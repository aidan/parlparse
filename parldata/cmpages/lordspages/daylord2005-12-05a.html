<a name="51205-01_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Tributes to the late Lord Belstead</h3>



<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="51205-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My Lords, I rise to pay tribute to Lord Belstead, who died on Saturday 3 December, aged 73. Lord Belstead was known to all as a mild-mannered and gentle man whose courteous ways were sometimes mistaken for shyness. He was hard working, sincere and of great integrity. It is right that we should pay tribute to him today.
</p>

<a name="51205-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>The noble Lord came from political stock. His father was a long-serving Conservative MP for Ipswich. However, the young Lord Belstead showed little interest in politics. After an education at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, he worked as a prep school master and later established himself as a Suffolk farmer. These experiences shaped the ideas which he was to bring to the House after the death of his father in 1958. In his maiden speech in 1964, on the Newsom report on education, he drew on his own teaching experience. He argued for extending the school leaving age to 16, for better pay for teachers in problem areas, and for cutting classroom sizes.
</p>

<a name="51205-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>Lord Belstead maintained a lifelong interest in education. He chaired the Association of Governing Bodies of Public Schools between 1974 and 1979, and the Independent Schools Joint Committee between 1977 and 1979. He gained the respect of his colleagues and, in 1970, he was appointed a junior Minister in the Department of Education and Science. There, he found himself working closely with the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, then Secretary of State for Education. A series of other jobs followed: in the Northern Ireland Office, the Home Office, the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Environment. The range of these posts demonstrates his intellect and versatility.
</p>

<a name="51205-01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>In 1987, Lord Whitelaw resigned the leadership of this House following a stroke, and Lord Belstead was announced as his successor. Pundits at the time wrongly suggested that he would be a short-term appointment until someone else, a political heavyweight, was found. Lord Belstead was described as solid and hard working, safe rather than exciting. But this description underplayed his many strengths. The noble Lord was popular and respected in the House. He had built up a reputation for common sense and, above all, he was respected for his reasoned and painstaking efforts to defuse argument and to reply in detail to points made during debates. He was trusted by his colleagues in government and steered difficult legislation through this House. The former Secretary <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_408"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 408</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of State for Energy, the noble Lord, Lord Walker of Worcester, insisted that Lord Belstead should take gas privatisation through this House.
</p>

<a name="51205-01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>So the pundits got it wrong, and Lord Belstead was Leader of the House of Lords and Lord Privy Seal from 1987 to 1990. Under John Major&#039;s Prime Ministership, Lord Belstead was moved to the Northern Ireland Office as deputy to the Secretary of State, a post which he held in tandem with the role of Paymaster General. This was his last ministerial post. He then served as chairman of the Parole Board from 1992 to 1997.
</p>

<a name="51205-01_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>Lord Belstead was very attached to his home county, Suffolk. He was appointed a justice of the peace in 1962, and in 1994 he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Suffolk, a role he performed until 2002. Towards the end of his tenure, he had the pleasure of greeting and accompanying Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh during their Golden Jubilee tour of Ipswich, Stowmarket and Bury St Edmunds.
</p>

<a name="51205-01_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>Throughout his life, Lord Belstead was a keen sports enthusiast with a particular passion for tennis. He served as chairman of Suffolk Playing Fields Association, president of Felixstowe Lawn Tennis Club and president of the Suffolk Lawn Tennis Association. He played tennis for the county, and was a member of the All-England Lawn Tennis Club and the MCC.
</p>

<a name="51205-01_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>I am sure the House will wish to join me in expressing our sympathy to Lord Belstead&#039;s sister, the Honourable Jill Ganzoni, and to all his friends.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="51205-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Strathclyde: </b>   My Lords, I begin by thanking the Leader of the House for her tribute to Lord Belstead, which will have been appreciated by Peers right across the House. She has rightly reminded us of his long public service as a Minister, spanning some 22 years, 17 of them as a Minister in six major departments. It is a remarkable record, even if one were not to take into account his distinguished service as Leader in this House, which is closest to all our hearts.
</p>

<a name="51205-01_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>It says a lot about John Belstead that, for all that great public career, he remained largely unknown to the public, and indeed to most media commentators. Even now, in this House, many Peers will not remember him. He was decidedly not a figure of the &quot;new politics&quot; or of the age of spin, but somehow I do not think that would have bothered him at all. He was a modest man&#151;none more so&#151;but he did what he thought was right in a quiet, unfailingly polite but resolute fashion. He was a character that this House instinctively liked: understated, courteous, loyal and a listener.
</p>

<a name="51205-01_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>With all the difficulties associated with succeeding Willie Whitelaw, he rang the changes by leading in a very different style. Not for him chairing great meetings on policy&#151;no, you always knew where to find John Belstead: sitting on the Front Bench for hours, listening to our debates. I have to admit that it was not always comfortable for the Front Bench Minister to find the Leader sitting next to him.
</p>

<a name="51205-01_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The House also liked his way on policy, which was to seek consensus, to build from the facts and understand the other point of view. He was a genuinely gentle man; a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_409"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 409</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

compassionate conservative, long before that phrase was first heard. He was an enlightened Home Office Minister with a deep concern for those in prisons, which saw him agree to serve as chairman of the Parole Board after stepping down from the Government. He had a lifelong and informed interest in education. The great trust placed on him by that shrewdest of judges of men, the late Viscount Whitelaw, says much about the respect he merited.
</p>

<a name="51205-01_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>As the noble Baroness reminded us, he was Leader of the House at a sometimes abrasive time; a time of sharp public conflict on some areas of policy that lapped over into this House. He would have preferred, I am sure, not to have wielded some of the strong whips he agreed to wield. But in this, too, he did his duty, but never in a way that weakened his deep sense of loyalty to the whole House and to our shared values. We will all miss him, and we are much the better for having seen his example.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="51205-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, in the other place the greatest accolade a Member can have is that he is a good House of Commons man. Lord Belstead, by the same token, was a good House of Lords man. He had what we like to think are the House of Lords attributes: what the <i>Times</i> obituary described as &quot;civilised, courteous and patient&quot;. He had, as we have heard, a long and distinguished ministerial career under three Prime Ministers and three Conservative Party leaders&#151;an achievement that was harder to achieve in his day than recently.
</p>

<a name="51205-01_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>We have heard that he came from exotic stock, his father being called Francis Ganzoni, but he exuded an Eton and Christ Church polish, and something that suggested an aristocracy of a longer lineage. I loved the story in the obituary in the <i>Times.</i> As a Foreign Office Minister visiting Istanbul, he said how happy he was to be in Constantinople.
</p>

<a name="51205-01_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>As we have heard, Lord Belstead became Leader of the House during turbulent times and had the almost impossible task of following Lord Willie Whitelaw. When he became Leader, I understand that Mrs Thatcher&#039;s instruction was &quot;Be robust&quot;. After one of her defeats in the Lords, she asked Lord Belstead, &quot;What are all the Tory Peers whom I have created doing?&quot; According to her biographer, the answer was that many of them were sacked Cabinet Ministers who owed her no favours while the rest were captains of industry who were happy to accept their titles but never went near the House. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, is relieved that things have changed.
</p>

<a name="51205-01_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>I said that Lord Belstead was a House of Lords man, but he also held one important non-parliamentary public office at an important time. He was chairman of the Parole Board from 1992&#150;97. I never had the pleasure of working directly with Lord Belstead, but my noble friend Lord Dholakia was a council member of the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders during this period. This morning I asked him for his assessment and he told me:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;It was Lord Belstead who implemented the reforms in our Parole System initiated by Lord Hurd and drawn up by Lord Carlisle of Bucklow. He did so with great distinction. At a time when the debate <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_410"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 410</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>too often centred around &#039;hang them and flog them&#039;, it was people like Lord Belstead who worked to make our criminal justice system more effective and civilised&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-01_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>&quot;Effective&quot; and &quot;civilised&quot;&#151;not bad epithets from a political opponent. I have no hesitation in using them today, not only about Lord Belstead&#039;s term at the Parole Board but about his contribution to public life. I pay tribute to those qualities from these Benches and send our sympathy to his sister and friends.
</p>

<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="51205-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Williamson of Horton: </b>   My Lords, on the behalf of the Cross Bench Peers, I should like to join in the tributes to the late Lord Belstead. The Cross Bench Peers have always appreciated the role of the Leader of the House, which transcends a political role and represents also a voice for the House as a whole. Lord Belstead fulfilled this role with distinction, both as Deputy Leader for four years and as Leader of the House and Lord Privy Seal for a further period between 1987 and 1990.
</p>

<a name="51205-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>I was a senior official in the Cabinet Office for part of this time and I know the esteem with which Lord Belstead was regarded by his political colleagues and, if it is a compliment, by senior officials. In addition to his role in the House of Lords which we remember today, I pay tribute to him for his capacity, during a long political career in high office, to master difficult issues and briefs at the Department of Education and Science, the Northern Ireland Office, the Home Office, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. That pretty well covers the whole of public life and he covered all those issues with distinction.
</p>

<a name="51205-02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food may be a somewhat unloved department, although not by me because I am an old boy of that ministry. I worked there when I was young and I stress how difficult some of the problems were. I remember personally and salute Lord Belstead&#039;s work there. But, first and foremost in the House today, I pay tribute from all the Cross-Benchers to a former Leader of the House who will be greatly missed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="51205-02_spnew1"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Chelmsford: </b>   My Lords, I am very happy on behalf of these Benches to be associated with the remarks already made about the late Lord Belstead. His quiet and courteous character clearly won him respect across the political divides and throughout this House. Indeed, our political life and the practice of government have been enriched by his quiet and self-effacing service. I hope that the House will forgive someone from Essex saying on behalf of the wider community of the east of England how much his leadership and service to the people of Suffolk, both in the farming community and as its Lord-Lieutenant, have been appreciated. He will be missed by many in that county, in this House and in the wider community. We send our sympathy to his sister and friends. May he rest in peace.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="51205-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Waddington: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that the House will forgive me for saying a few words, because I succeeded Lord Belstead as Leader of the House. The announcement that I was coming here from the House of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_411"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 411</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Commons to take his place must have come to him as an unpleasant surprise, for he had served loyally and well and had no reason to think that he would be replaced on the change of Prime Minister; but such is politics and John not only took the change in his fortunes with good grace, he agreed to continue to serve in the Government in what obviously had to be a more junior role, and he gave me all the support that he possibly could. He chose to leave the Government when I left in 1992.
</p>

<a name="51205-02_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>I shall always be grateful to John for his loyalty and his friendship, and I count myself lucky to have known such a fine man and such a dedicated public servant.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="51205-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   My Lords, it may be apposite to follow my noble friend Lord Waddington. As a result of the disability which eventually took John Belstead to his death, I scarcely saw him during my four years or so in this House, but the reminiscences concerning my late noble kinsman and my late noble relative were so affectionate and vivid that I vicariously felt that I was, in fact, more often in the House with him.
</p>

<a name="51205-02_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>However, I wish to make a brief reference to the one occasion when he and I overlapped in a government department. When my noble friend Lord Waddington became Leader of your Lordships&#039; House, John Belstead came to Northern Ireland, where he took over the vacancy left by my noble friend Lord Cope, who was removed in what I still call a shuffle, rather than a reshuffle. Lord Belstead became my understudy in the place of my noble friend Lord Cope. I do not think that he had ever been a soldier, but the office of being the understudy in Northern Ireland means that you become the security Minister in the Province, and I pay the loudest possible tribute to the fortitude and integrity with which he discharged that role without having had a military background. I also pay tribute to the manner in which he ran the Province during the general election in 1992, when, by definition, the other Ministers were fighting the election.
</p>

<a name="51205-02_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>I close on another personal note. He was a member of &quot;Nobody&#039;s Friends&quot;&#151;a body which dines in Lambeth Palace, half of whom are lay people and half of whom are ecclesiastical. I will not explain why what I am about to say happens, but the group is called &quot;Nobody&#039;s Friends&quot; because people who are elected to it have to make a seven minute speech to explain why they are nobody&#039;s friend. It will not surprise your Lordships&#039; House that John Belstead did that particularly well.

<a name="51205-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Avebury </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>

<a name="51205-02_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>What subjects the Prime Minister discussed with President Hu.
</p>


<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="51205-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  My Lords, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister and President Hu discussed a wide range of bilateral and international issues. They agreed to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_412"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 412</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

strengthen co-operation in key areas, including migration, education, culture, trade and investment, and to develop dialogue and co-operation on global issues such as climate change and sustainable development. The Prime Minister also encouraged China to institute political reforms to match its strong record of economic growth.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="51205-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, did the Prime Minister have time to urge the president to enter negotiations with the Dalai Lama on a lasting and legitimate solution to the problem of Tibet? Did he raise a long-running sore that has been taken up by the Foreign Office on many occasions regarding the jamming of BBC Mandarin language broadcasts to China and the blockage of access by Chinese users of the Internet to all the BBC sites, except those in which the English language is taught? Is it not time that the Chinese behaved in a manner consonant with everyone else&#039;s international responsibilities?
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="51205-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, as far as I am aware, the specific issue of relations with the Dalai Lama did not come up during the discussions, but we regularly encourage meetings between representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government, and I understand that talks in Berne earlier this year have been the most substantial to date. It is not yet possible to say that significant differences have been overcome, but there seem to have been some discussions.
</p>

<a name="51205-02_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>I do not think that the jamming of the BBC World Service was discussed specifically during the course of the meeting, but I, as the Minister responsible for the BBC World Service, had those discussions with the Chinese. I cannot say that that led to the unblocking of the service, although it was not blocked for about one month directly following the talks. I regret to say that it is blocked again.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="51205-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Clarke of Hampstead: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend will recall that only last Monday, in reply to a short debate in Grand Committee, he mentioned the obstacle of Russia and China in opening up the human rights agenda in the United Nations. Did our Prime Minister seek the co-operation of President Hu in the discussions on Zimbabwe and Burma and the violation of human rights in those countries?
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="51205-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I can report the generality of the discussion. The Prime Minister raised a number of issues with President Hu, including human rights and political reform issues. A list of political prisoners of particular concern was handed over during the margins of the meeting. I can also report that my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary, in his meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister, encouraged the Chinese to make substantive progress on human rights and to announce a timetable for the ratification of the international covenant on civil and political rights. There was a robust exchange with the Chinese Foreign Minister about the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_413"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 413</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

international parliamentary convention on Tibet as well. Overall, there was a broad discussion on human rights issues.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="51205-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, I shall broaden the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Clarke of Hampstead. Did the Prime Minister, when talking to President Hu Jintao, raise China&#039;s inclination to support all around the world very undesirable rogue states? Mr Mugabe and Zimbabwe have been mentioned, as has Burma. There is also Sudan, and China&#039;s very strong support for Iran and a huge energy contract with that country. Did the Prime Minister not explain to the Chinese that in the longer run it would be very much to the benefit of their people, as China assumes a responsible place in the comity of nations, if China would work with the rest of us, and with the West, in bringing these deviant nations to heel rather than financing and supporting them?
</p>

<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="51205-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord rightly introduces a list of countries in which the Chinese could make a much more positive contribution in a modern international setting. It is not possible during a visit of this kind to raise every one of those countries, just because of the length of the list, but a range of issues was raised in the general areas of human rights and political reform. Elsewhere in government&#151;it has fallen to me on occasions to do this&#151;we have discussed the more positive action that could be taken. I have had a recent discussion with the Chinese ambassador on the question of Sudan. I am hopeful that we may make some progress because China plainly has a considerable influence right across Africa and, indeed, elsewhere.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="51205-03_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Northover: </b>   My Lords, given China&#039;s massive industrial expansion and vast coal reserves, did the Prime Minister in his discussions on climate change raise with the Chinese what they were doing to take forward clean coal technology?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="51205-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I am not aware of a discussion on clean coal technology during that period. If there was one I will find out about it and respond. The general issues of climate change have been discussed in a number of meetings and, I believe, were discussed on the fringes. The countries whose economies are growing fastest and which are looking for sources of fuel often turn to carbon-based fuels because they are the most readily available. That is something we have to work with. They want the increase in their economic activity, but I am sure that we do not want to see it at the cost of wrecking the entire environment.

<a name="51205-03_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, it has been agreed in principle. I do not think a final date for it has been agreed for the whole of the process, although the initial visit took place from 21 November to 2 December.

</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="51205-03_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, our position has not changed at all. There has to be satisfaction on a number of fundamental issues as laid out in the conclusions of the European Council. The Government will consider those issues if those improvements are made.

<a name="51205-03_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, the government-funded Countryside Survey has estimated changes in the extent of bracken between 1984 and 1990, and 1990 and 1998. There was a marked decline during the first period, and no significant increase during the second. We intend to give further consideration to whether bracken control and undergrazing raise a cross-compliance issue. We do not believe that bringing together all the different parties in one large forum would help, because of local variations. However, all the bodies concerned are involved in various aspects and are kept informed, and we seek their views.

<a name="51205-03_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   My Lords, there has been an alarming spread of bracken in the hills in recent years, and not just in England. As bracken is carcinogenic, what research are the Government commissioning into the carcinogenic effects of bracken, particularly on water supplies in the areas most affected?
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="51205-03_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, it is alleged that bracken is carcinogenic, but I am not aware of any scientific evidence to support that claim. Research is continuing into various aspects of management control. I am not aware of any specific research into the potential ill-health effects of bracken, or bracken in watercourses.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="51205-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   My Lords, with the permission of the House, I shall say that I have clearly done more research than the Minister. There has been extensive research in many parts of the world, particularly in Brazil and Japan. I do not think there is any doubt at all that bracken is known to be carcinogenic.

<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="51205-03_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, if I am ill informed and the noble Lord is well informed, I would appreciate correspondence on the matter.

<a name="51205-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware of the development of an animal that likes eating bracken? Is not the best way to get rid of bracken to find something that enjoys eating it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="51205-03_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, bracken is eaten by animals, particularly cattle. I do not know to what degree they enjoy it or prefer it to any other diet. We have to consider whether we need a national strategy in this area because, as I said before, we need to look at whether cross-compliance will have any effect. We are pressing proposals to the European Commission to have cattle grazing as a conservation management option as part of the higher level environmental scheme project.

very young shoots of bracken are supposed to taste very much like asparagus when they are boiled? Perhaps we can eat it.

I understand that in Japan very young fronds of bracken are eaten, and that there is a higher than average incidence of cancer of the stomach. I also understand, however, that no scientific study has confirmed a &quot;cause and effect&quot; link. In the light of being asked before by the noble Countess whether I knew about eating grey squirrels, I asked whether anybody ate bracken.

<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="51205-03_spnew19"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, cattle certainly graze on it.

Bracken spread is actually a very serious problem and my noble friend rightly pointed out that it is rapidly getting worse. What assurance can the Minister give the House that those who advise the land managers will give the right advice, because in the past they have said there has been overgrazing and now we face the risk of undergrazing? If there is any more undergrazing we shall just get a more severe spread of bracken.

<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="51205-04_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, I have already referred to the fact that we are looking at undergrazing as a result of change in what is available. National parks authorities use agri-environment schemes or sites of special scientific interest management. They fund that and work with land owners to control it. Forest Enterprise also works in bracken management projects. Research is continuing into bracken management. There has been a 10-year project running with the University of Liverpool, and we have been using its results to directly help and advise those who need to control bracken. I do not think the noble Baroness need despair. As I have said, there is not clear evidence of a wide spread of bracken in all areas. It grows only below the frost line. The best answer to controlling the spread of bracken is to plant more trees, I am advised.

<a name="51205-04_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>Whether they support the appearance of public servants in uniform to defend or promote government policy.

<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="51205-04_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My Lords, chief constables, as public servants, have in the past argued both for and against government proposals on a wide range of policy matters, and I have no doubt that they will do so in the future where they feel it is appropriate. This is entirely consistent with their position as independent office-holders.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="51205-04_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hamilton of Epsom: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that Answer. Does she agree that it is wrong for the Chief of the General Staff to appear on television defending the ministerial decision to re-organise regiments in the British Army and that it is equally wrong for chief constables to lobby Members of Parliament in another place on periods of detention for terrorist subjects? Does that not indicate that the Government feel that public servants in uniform have credibility when their own Ministers have none?
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="51205-04_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I do not agree with that last statement. Noble Lords will know that the Ministry of Defence encourages the Armed Forces to explain their role through the media, but on the basis that they are an integral part of the MoD and therefore speak for it rather than as individuals expressing their personal view. The noble Lord will also know that the police have recently spoken in favour of 90-day detention and against certain other government proposals. Therefore, their independence is clear.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="51205-04_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Renton: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that senior police officers need to appear in uniform, that it is a great part of their authority and respectability and that if they decide to go without it, they will not receive the same amount of respect?
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="51205-04_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord that senior police officers have a great deal of authority, which is often depicted by their uniform. I for one would be sad if they did not feel they could wear it with a degree of pride.
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="51205-04_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, the essential element of British policing is its independence.

However, does the Minister agree that the independence is sacrificed if chief constables and other <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_418"></a>

senior police officers are seen going around in chauffeur-driven cars trying to extend the detention period to 90 days?
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="51205-04_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I do not agree with the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, if he seeks to suggest they do that not because they believe it but because they are pursuing some other end. In the past few days, we have seen how strongly chief constables can express their views. Sometimes they are in support of the Government and sometimes they are not. On pay and other issues, no one in this House would suggest that they are always pleased with what government do and they must be free to make their voices heard because they are independent office-holders. That is what they do&#151;they take the rough with the smooth.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="51205-04_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Davies of Coity: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that if members of the police or the military, dressed in uniform, are interviewed by the aggressive media that we have in this country and are trying to explain government policy that has been determined by Ministers, there is a danger, unfortunately, that they will be held up as Aunt Sallys?
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="51205-04_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, the roles are different because the Armed Forces are an integral part of the MoD. The police are independent office-holders and it would be quite improper to put an improper restraint on the communication they wish to give in relation to their views. They are independently held and they are entitled to express them, whether they are in favour of government policy or against it. They must be free to wear their uniforms when they so choose.
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="51205-04_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister reassure the House that no Minister, special adviser or official acting on instructions from Ministers encouraged any chief constable to lobby Members of Parliament about the 90 days detention period?
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="51205-04_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord will know that when my right honourable friend the Home Secretary made his statements, which he did openly, he made it clear that it was entirely appropriate for chief constables to talk to MPs if they so wished in relation to the issues pertaining to their locality. If that is seen as encouragement, there it was.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="51205-04_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Winston: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that fundamentally there is no difference between this and, say, a senior hospital consultant speaking on behalf of the health service either in favour of or opposing the Government&#039;s policy on the NHS?
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="51205-04_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I absolutely agree. Public servants have a duty to assist the public in terms of how they see provisions applying. I see no distinction.

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 419</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government were asking chief constables to state a view and asking them to support the Government? Using uniformed personnel as paid mouthpieces of Her Majesty&#039;s Government is a bad idea. For such individuals to present their own views as a matter of course is a different thing altogether.
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="51205-04_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I wholly disagree with the noble Earl. The position, which we have explained repeatedly, was that the Government listened to the police and took their advice. In acting on that advice, we proposed 90 days. It was not the Government who suggested that it was the ideal. We listened to the expert advice of the police and we agreed with them. The police are entitled to have their say.

The noble Lord will know that those preparations will include unit training, procuring equipment enhancements and early logistics work so that we can respond quickly should NATO decide to expand to the south.

</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="51205-05_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Cameron of Lochbroom </b>   moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>Page 1, line 5, leave out from &quot;statement&quot; to &quot;as&quot; in line 6 and insert &quot;which members of the public to whom it is published could reasonably be expected to understand&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: The amendment is grouped with Amendments Nos. 11, 13, 16, 29, 33, 35 and 38 standing in my name, which are consequential on it. The amendments were suggested by the Law Society of Scotland and are probing.
</p>

<a name="51205-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>I start from the proposition that clarity in the definition of the offence of encouragement of terrorism created by Clause 1 is essential. In subsection (1), the definition of statement applies to the offence both as to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;direct and indirect encouragement or other inducement . . . to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism or Convention offences&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>so far as that statement is likely to be understood by members of the public to whom it is published.
</p>

<a name="51205-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>It is to be noted that subsection (5) provides that for the purposes of the clause, two questions may arise that must be assessed in relation to a statement: first, how it is likely to be understood and, secondly,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;what members of the public could reasonably be expected to infer from it&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>That second reference appears to be a reference back to a question of what members of the public could reasonably have been expected to infer from a statement in relation to the definition of indirect statements set out in subsection (4)(b); that is, of statements which glorify,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;conduct that should be emulated by&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>those members of the public. From that, it would appear that for indirect statement, there is a subjective test which is related to that section of the public and which has to be applied. Albeit that in terms of subsection (6)(b), it is irrelevant,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;whether any person is in fact encouraged . . . by the statement&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>On the other hand, for direct encouragement, the single test is whether it is likely to be so understood by members of the public to whom it is published. That suggests an objective test related to the statement itself, rather than to those members who could reasonably be expected to understand it as meaning encouragement.

</p>

<a name="51205-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>This amendment probes the nature of the tests to be applied by the courts in determining whether a statement will be understood as a direct or as an indirect <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_422"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 422</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

encouragement of terrorism. It seeks to incorporate a test for both forms of statement which is based on a common and coherent standard; namely, one of reasonable expectation of how the statement would,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;be understood by members of the public to whom it is published&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>There are consequential amendments to Clause 1, and to Clause 2 where it refers back to such statements&#151;as, for instance, in subsections (3), (4), (5)(b) and (7). In this case, I suggest that there is a better way of going about providing a coherent and clear test for what a statement is&#151;falling within the terms of this clause&#151;than that which is presently in the Bill.

</p>

<a name="51205-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>Our approach has been simply to replace the expression &quot;is likely to&quot; with the expression &quot;would&quot;. It now reads:

</p>

<a name="51205-05_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>We accept that the test should continue to be objective on that aspect of the offence. But in our submission the concept is too vague and introduces a standard of proof that is more suited to the civil law than the criminal law; that is, the standard of the balance of probabilities. It will always be difficult for someone, before he or she makes a statement, to guess what effect it is going to have. A balance of probabilities test is wholly inappropriate where one is talking about offences in relation to things said. In our submission, &quot;would&quot; is the appropriate answer to the problem posed by the Government&#039;s wording. A jury would clearly understand how to interpret the expression,

<a name="51205-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My name is attached to the amendments just spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. There is a great deal too much looseness in the drafting of the Bill and that this point, which would make it clear that it must be an objective test&#151;one that members of the public would understand&#151;is the correct approach. We are therefore happy to support the proposal.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="51205-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I rise briefly to speak in support of the amendments just referred to by my noble friend Lord Goodhart. On the face of it, putting the word &quot;would&quot; in place of the words, &quot;is likely to be understood&quot; may create a more difficult test for the prosecution to comply with, but I suggest that that might be a wise outcome. I would argue that any conviction under this part of the Bill must be clear not merely to the population at large, but particularly within the host community. I am thinking, for example, of the recent London bombings committed by British citizens. There is a hearts and minds issue in all these matters which would be better served by this clearer and slightly more stringent test than the one currently in the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="51205-06_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I understand the concerns expressed by all noble Lords, but I do not think that their anxiety is merited. I shall explain why that is, and I hope to be able to signal some further changes which may give the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Goodhart, along with others, what I hope will be a considerable degree of comfort. I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, for his amendment. Perhaps I may explain why I do not think the amendment is necessary, but say first that I understand that his proposal is probing in nature to enable me better to explain how we seek to deal with these matters.
</p>

<a name="51205-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Amendments Nos. 1, 11, 13, 16, 29, 33, 35 and 38 would change the test for assessing whether a statement is captured by the offence in Clause 1. Currently, the test is whether a statement is likely to be understood by members of the public to whom it is published as encouraging terrorism, a point already made by all noble Lords. Under the amendments tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron, the test would be whether a statement could reasonably be expected to be understood by members of the public to whom it is published as encouraging terrorism. We do not believe, technically speaking, that this change would make a great deal of difference. But I do believe that, where possible, legislation should use simple rather than complicated language. I should like to give an example.


</p>

<a name="51205-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>On the basis of the arguments advanced on Second Reading, I would say that it is likely that we will not reach consensus on all of the measures of the Bill, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_424"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 424</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

although I still hope that we will. We could also reasonably be expected not to reach consensus on all of those measures. For the sake of simplicity, I would prefer the shorter expression, provided that it is as accurate as the longer expression; in this instance I believe that it is. I certainly appreciate the good intentions of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, but I suggest that the construct that he puts forward is perhaps more legalistic than is necessary and that the current simplicity suffices.
</p>

<a name="51205-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>By contrast, Amendments Nos. 2, 7, 12, 14, 18 and 34, tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland, Lord Henley and Lord Goodhart, would very substantially change the test used to assess whether statements are captured by the offence in Clause 1. As I explained, currently the test is whether a statement is likely to be understood by the members of the public to whom it is published as encouraging terrorism. Under these amendments, the test would be whether a statement would be understood by the members of the public to whom it is published as encouraging terrorism. This is a significantly higher test and we do not believe that it would be appropriate for it to be adopted. The higher test, included in these amendments, would require a court to come to a definitive view not only about the person making the statement, or about the statement itself, but also about the audience to which the statement is delivered.
</p>

<a name="51205-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>In the current drafting it is not necessary to reach a definitive view about the audience. I suggest that it is not appropriate to expect the prosecution to prove definitively&#151;which is what this amendment means they would have to do&#151;that a given audience would behave or react in a certain way. After all, the audience is not the subject of the offence. These changes could make the clause unworkable, enabling the defence to argue that even if it was accepted that a statement was likely to be understood as encouraging terrorism, it would not actually be so understood. The offence should, we respectfully suggest, target the individual making the statement and be concerned with the statement itself. The audience is relevant, obviously, but it should not be as directly involved in the offence as would be the case under these amendments. For those reasons I would urge noble Lords not to press the amendments, and I hope that this has been a helpful indication of why they are not necessary. I believe that the existing safeguards are quite sufficient.
</p>

<a name="51205-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Finally, I would like to refer briefly to comments I intend to make shortly when we turn to the amendments concerned with intent and recklessness. I would like to signal at this early stage the Government&#039;s intention to make significant changes in these respects. Although I do not want to go into the detail now, I can assure your Lordships that in my view the concerns that have led to the amendments before us now&#151;particularly those relating to the substitution of the &quot;would&quot; test for the &quot;likely&quot; test&#151;are unnecessary in the context of the offence. I hope that that eventually becomes apparent. I therefore urge the noble Lords who have tabled these amendments not to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_425"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 425</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

press them. We will have an opportunity later to discuss whether the subjective or objective test is to be preferred. I am happy to indicate that the Government are currently minded to adopt the subjective as opposed to the objective test.

<a name="51205-06_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   These are very much lawyers&#039; matters and I am no lawyer. I think I understood what the noble Baroness was saying about the amendments tabled by my noble friend on the Front Bench. Referring to Amendment No. 1, tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, in response to a request from the Law Society of Scotland, I understood the noble Baroness to say that she thought it would not make a great deal of difference to accept Amendment No. 1, but she thought it somewhat &quot;legalistic.&quot; I wonder whether, when the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, replies, he could tell us whether he feels, as a very distinguished retired judge of the High Court in Scotland, that his wording would make it very much easier to reach a judgment than that suggested by the Government? The point of his amendment is that it would make it easier for a court to decide the issue. I hope that I am not speaking out of order, but it seems an important point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="51205-06_spnew4"></a><b> The Earl of Onslow: </b>   If someone makes a statement that has no effect on the audience, it does not matter if they make the statement. The only thing the Government are worried about is the effect that the statement encouraging terrorism, or whatever it may be, will have on the audience. That is what matters. If a man is ranting but everyone thinks he is being completely idiotic, he is doing no harm. He is doing harm only if he has an effect on the audience. Surely that is the point that my noble friends and the noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Front Bench are trying to get over. It is the effect on the audience which is important, not what the man says.

<a name="51205-06_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Morris of Aberavon: </b>   I follow the Minister&#039;s argument and I am in some sympathy with it. But can she deal precisely with the issue of the burden of proof which has been raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland? &quot;More likely than not&quot; is a phrase that we do not particularly like in criminal law.

under which group of amendments we will discuss intent so that if she wants me to hold my horses, I can. As the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, said, every single one of us in the course of our lives, at some time or another, has glorified terrorism. I cannot believe that when the noble Baroness and her colleague on the Front Bench were young they did not support some of the then terrorist movements which were fashionable. For myself, I supported Robin Hood and Hereward the Wake. It is a part of wishing people to be free, as the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, said, that one is prepared to contemplate for them measures which go beyond the ordinary. We must be careful of exactly who we are criminalising. I do not feel entirely comfortable with having our discussion cut short now without really being told why.

<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="51205-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Eatwell: </b>   My Lords, in her remarks the Minister made a heavy hint that she was going to consider later the concept of intent. It might be helpful if she could let us know whether that applies only to Clause 1 or also to Clause 2.

<a name="51205-07_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I congratulate the Government on thinking again on the definition of &quot;recklessness&quot;. I look forward with great eagerness to the Minister&#039;s response on this at a later stage.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>I follow the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, in his question. The purpose of using the word &quot;would&quot; instead of &quot;it is likely to&quot; is to introduce more certainty into the offence. The answer given by the Minister is along the lines of, &quot;It is easier to convict someone if we say &#039;it is likely to&#039;&quot;. The criminal law is not about whether it is easier or harder to convict: it is about defining clearly an offence. The proof of that offence beyond reasonable doubt is then a matter for the prosecution to consider in due course. But we cannot make bad law by making criminal law simply on the basis that a conviction is more likely than not. I hope that we are not going to hear any further defences of the Government&#039;s drafting of these crimes as this Committee proceeds.

<a name="51205-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   I should put on record at this stage&#151;because do doubt it will come up repeatedly during our deliberations&#151;that I am a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and our report has come out only today. These issues are ones about which we thought a great deal in drafting the report. The first point I would like to make is that I am very glad indeed to hear my noble friend the Minister say that the issue of intent is going to be revisited in our deliberations. We see this as crucial. It is central to the way in which law has traditionally operated. Distinguishing the person&#039;s intention in what they were doing and saying from how others interpreted what they were doing and saying is a very important issue.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>I want unashamedly to make one point at this stage of our deliberations. I take second place to no one in my concern about the gravity of the issues with which we are confronted. It would be lamentable, to say the very least, if somebody who was guilty of the most <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_427"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 427</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

heinous crimes against innocent people were to go free because of inadequacies in the drafting of law. However, in the midst of the dangers that confront us and the gravity of the situation, we are about defending our society and what makes it worth living. The rights of the accused are crucially important. We must not, therefore, simply concentrate in our deliberations on what would make for a more effective prosecution. We also have honestly to state that the law must be quite clear in its approach so that the interests and rights of the accused are being properly considered throughout its Administration. What we are discussing here is central to that.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>The Committee has not yet dealt with this point about &quot;would&quot;, but it is an interesting one. It is central to the issue of having as much clarity and certainty as is possible to achieve not only to ensure effective prosecution, on the one hand, but to ensure that the rights and freedom of the accused are not being rode over roughly, on the other.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="51205-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Waddington: </b>   I am wondering whether the Government&#039;s concern about the amendment moved from these Benches may not arise from the fact that under the existing wording of the clause, a jury would be asked to exercise its common sense as to whether the words used would be likely to encourage terrorism. But if the words suggested in the amendment moved by my noble and learned friend were accepted, prosecution could very easily be frustrated by the defence, who could call a succession of witnesses from the audience who might say that whatever the common sense of the matter might be, they certainly were not encouraged to commit an offence of terrorism. I am therefore rather worried about the amendment moved from these Benches.
</p>




<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="51205-07_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lyell of Markyate: </b>   The complexity of this matter must already be very clear. It is certainly clear to me. I do not pretend to have the definitive answer except that, unlike my noble friend Lord Waddington, I am inclined to support the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Kingsland and supported by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon. Clarity in the criminal law is extraordinarily important.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>I have been affected by the letter which all of us will have received from&#151;and maybe we shall hear more of this during the debate; and I find it difficult to express the words correctly&#151;Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain. It points out the very complex world in which we are seeking to enter with the concept of glorification of terrorism. Clause 1(1) applies to a statement that is likely to or would be understood,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;by members of the public to whom it is published as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to them to the commission . . . of terrorism or . . . offences&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>Quite a lot of the members of the public to whom it is published will understand one thing and some, who are rather more inclined towards terrorism, will understand another, which constitutes the mischief that the clause is seeking to achieve. Hizb ut-Tahrir makes the quite compelling point that much of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_428"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 428</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

language that some people see as encouraging terrorism is the normal, everyday language used by those who deplore what is happening in Palestine or deplore the Iraq war. Whatever views one may take on those matters, in a free society it is very possible&#151;and ought to be possible&#151;to express those views. I see real danger here.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>We need as much clarity as possible about what precisely is the offence. For that reason, I support &quot;would&quot; rather than &quot;is likely to&quot;, but we shall have to continue to look at all the wording.
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="51205-07_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   The noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, introduced this group of amendments and it is for him to terminate this part of the proceedings. Perhaps, however, I could intervene once more on the subject of my amendments to say two things.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>First, the intention of the amendment, as was explained very clearly by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, is to achieve certainty. It may also make the tests differ, but that is not the fundamental reason for introducing the amendment. It certainly does not raise the test as high as the &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; test because it would be inappropriate to look at this part of the offence in those terms. The &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; test is relevant to intention, which is dealt with in Clause 1(2) and (3).
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>All we are seeking to achieve is certainty in the law. It would be most unfortunate if, because of a lack of certainty, the Government were faced with what might ultimately prove to be a successful litigation in the High Court on the grounds that the clause breached Article 7 of the convention on human rights. Certainty is extremely important.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>My second point was raised by the Minister in her response to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom. Despite the insertion of the word &quot;would&quot;, the test in Clause 1(1) remains an objective test, but with greater certainty. If we had sought to remove the expression &quot;likely to be&quot;, and simply left what remained to state, &quot;This section applies to a statement that is understood by members of the public to whom it is published as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement&quot;, then the many problems which were raised by my noble friend Lord Waddington would indeed face the court. But that is not so with our amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="51205-07_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   I hope that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron, will not think of terminating this stage of the proceedings, as his movement a moment ago suggested, before we have heard again from the Minister. She has a number of questions to answer; some of them are not as succinct as those of the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, but all of them deserve an answer before the debate comes to an end.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Secondly, along with my noble friend Lord Lucas, I am a bit anxious about the proposal to leave the field when so little is undecided. I hope that the noble Baroness and the rest of the House will be mindful of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_429"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 429</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the fact that a promise as imprecise as the one which has been given can, when honoured, reveal quite unexpected dilemmas. I hope that the noble Baroness and the House will remember that if that happens, a Report stage debate is not adequate for resolving such difficulties. It must be implicit, in an offer as vague as this, that there may be an opportunity to reconvene into Committee on this clause.


</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="51205-07_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   In response to the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Elton, I say that I do not think that there will be any need to reconvene into Committee on Report because I hope that we will be able to go through the Bill very fully now. I am more than happy to explain at this stage the Government&#039;s current thinking, to enable noble Lords to feel a greater degree of ease as we pass from this amendment to those that are to come. I will seek to answer directly some of the questions that were raised.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>I can tell the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, that the burden of proving the effect of the statement would remain with the prosecution. It would be the normal burden of proof in criminal cases of beyond reasonable doubt. I said that inserting &quot;would&quot; would become less problematic because, if we were to adopt the suggestion of noble Lords opposite in relation to the subjective test, that issue would become more clear.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, asked a question about the Qur&#039;an. We are not seeking to criminalise legitimate use of religious text. As noble Lords know, the offence of encouragement or glorification can be committed only if the statement is made with the intent of inciting others to commit terrorist acts or, once the Bill has been amended, if the person knows that that is the likely result. Mere glorification is not an offence.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, for his encouragement. This is not going to be bad law. I think that even he will be pleased by the indications that I am about to give.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>As my noble friend Lord Eatwell and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, raised this matter, and if it is convenient to the House, I shall deal with the way in which we propose to look at Clauses 1, 2 and 6. Much of the debate at Second Reading and today has focused on the possibility that Clauses 1, 2 and 6 might criminalise activity which we all regard as acceptable. My noble friend Lord Eatwell, for example, argued at Second Reading that Clause 2 might capture some activities which certain libraries are bound to perform. Other noble Lords argued that these clauses would capture academic work, including those who teach history and touch on Islamic extremism. For those reasons, we have thought very carefully about where we go from here.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>We disagreed that the Bill as currently structured criminalises these activities. We are satisfied that it does not. Where those activities are innocent and unlikely to promote terrorism, it will not cause difficulty. However, in view of the concern which has been expressed here and in another place, the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_430"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 430</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government have given these matters further consideration. We have tried to find ways of giving comfort in relation to them.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>The question of intent and recklessness in Clause 1 has caused the most anxiety. There is clearly no doubt that intent should be part of the offence. Those who intend to encourage terrorism should find that their activities fall within the parameters of this offence. There is, however, some disagreement over the recklessness element. The question is whether the recklessness test should be objective or subjective. An objective test involves establishing whether the defendant could not reasonably have failed to know what the effect of his statement would be. A subjective test would involve establishing that that defendant in fact knew what the effect of his statement would be.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>We are satisfied that if a person could not reasonably have failed to know what the effect of his statement would be, he should not be able to escape punishment simply by asserting that he did not actually know what the effect would be. We in the Government, however, have listened to the concerns expressed here and in another place, and I can confirm that the Government will accept a subjective recklessness test in Clause 1, which both Her Majesty&#039;s loyal Opposition and the Liberal Democrats voted for in another place. When we reach Amendment No. 9, tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland, Lord Henley and Lord Goodhart, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, we in the Government will support it. Similar issues arise elsewhere.

</p>

<a name="51205-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>This change will mean that the prosecution will have to show not that the defendant could not reasonably have failed to know what the effect of his statement would be, but that he in fact knew what the effect would be. I am satisfied that this change should provide the comfort sought by noble Lords who have had concerns about this offence. The offence will not be committed unless the defendant either intended to encourage terrorism or knew his statement would encourage terrorism. I do not believe that people should be allowed to encourage terrorism intentionally, or to make statements that encourage terrorism when they know what the effect will be.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>I also signal that the Government will seek to make a further change to Clause 1. At present, there is a defence in Clause 1(7). The defence has three limbs: first, that the statement was published in the course of providing a service electronically; secondly, that the statement did not express the views of the person publishing it; and, thirdly, that it was clear in all the circumstances that the statement did not express the views of the person publishing it.
</p>

<a name="51205-07_para19"></a>

<a name="51205-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   This is a significant concession, but are the Government prepared to take it one step further and make the burden of proof on the defendant in these cases an evidential burden of proof?
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="51205-08_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   We believe that the burden lies with the prosecution&#151;appropriately, under the new subjective test&#151;and that no further changes are necessary at the moment. The standard is beyond reasonable doubt. It is relevant to all elements of the offence in Clause 1. The prosecution must prove all those elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt and that it is likely to be the effect of the statement.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="51205-08_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I am sorry to come back on that, but I understand that as a general rule when a specific defence is provided, as it is in subsection (7), the burden is on the defendant to prove his defence on the balance of probabilities. However, there are occasions&#151;under the Terrorism Act 2000, for example&#151;where that burden is reduced to an evidential burden; that is, as long as evidence is produced sufficient to raise it as an issue, it then becomes a burden on the prosecution to disprove that defence beyond a reasonable doubt.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="51205-08_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   No, I do not think that there is any intention for us to change this in the way that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, indicated. These are real changes in relation to the offence. The Government have listened very carefully. I hope that Committee Members will feel that we have gone a long way to meet the concerns that were raised in the other place, which we have decided to accept. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, will be delighted that we have done so.

<a name="51205-08_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Ackner: </b>   I support what has just been said. Unless there is a suggestion that the burden could be treated as evidential, a sizeable burden has been placed on the defence. It would be quite contrary in cases of this kind for the defence to shoulder entirely new burdens. The evidential approach gets over that altogether. There must be some material, but once there is some material, the defence awaits the proof by the prosecution of the issue itself.

<a name="51205-08_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   To add to what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, said, in the light of the significant concession that the Minister has just announced to the House, is there any substance left in the recklessness part of this at all if there can be subjective restlessness?
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="51205-08_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   I am concerned that the Minister should explain this a little further. As I understand it, the concession does not go so far as removing recklessness altogether, which is the amendment to which the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and I put our names. If that is the concession, I am going home, but I imagine that it is not.
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="51205-08_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   Would the extension of the defence to which the Minister referred in Clause 1&#151;extending the provision made for Internet service providers&#151;also apply in the case of dissemination?
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="51205-08_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I will certainly think about the noble Baroness&#039;s question, although I do not think that it could. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, is absolutely right. We are not removing recklessness. We are saying that the test is subjective and not objective. The House should accept that we have moved a long way, not least because it makes this offence considerably more difficult to prosecute, and we have accepted that. The question is whether it makes it impossible to prosecute. Noble Lords should be aware of the argument that the concession would make it almost impossible for there to be a prosecution, and we had to think very carefully as to whether that was the case. We believe that it would be possible&#151;I emphasise &quot;possible&quot;&#151;to prosecute using the subjective test, but no one should be left in any doubt as to the difficulties of satisfying that test. It would be difficult even as it is currently structured.
</p>

<a name="51205-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Whether the burden of proof should be placed on the defendant is a difficult issue. Placing the burden on the defendant must be assessed to ensure that it does not breach, for example, Article 6 of the ECHR, which guarantees the right to a fair trial. The Government&#039;s view is that it is proper and fair for the defendant to bear the burden of proof in those circumstances. Placing a burden on the defence is fair and reasonable for a number of reasons. First, endorsement is not an element of either offence; therefore, the defences are aimed at the exception to the offence. Secondly, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_433"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 433</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

whether or not a person endorsed a statement or was expressing his view is within his particular knowledge. Whether that person examined a publication or intended it to be useful to terrorists is also within his particular knowledge. Finally, the defendant is in the best position to bring forward evidence of how he runs his electronic service and to show that the electronic material on it did not have his endorsement.
</p>

<a name="51205-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>The reason why I said that I would consider the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, was to see whether there was anything further that we could do. Of course we will look at this matter, but I should make it clear that I do not believe, having moved such a considerable way forward, that any further movement is likely and it would be wrong of me to leave that impression in your Lordships&#039; minds. This move is very considerable indeed.

<a name="51205-08_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   We accept that the Minister has moved a long way and we are grateful to her for the way in which she described it at the beginning of our deliberations. The problem is that we are not sure how far she has moved and I would like to focus again on the issue that has been raised.
</p>

<a name="51205-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>If I lecture a group of students and make a speech setting out the views of a terrorist, I accept, in terms of subsection (1), that I have made a statement,

</p>

<a name="51205-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>However, my defence under subsection (7) is that that is not my view and I am not endorsing the statement. The issue on which we require clarification is whether I have to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that I do not hold or endorse those views, or whether it is for the prosecution to establish beyond reasonable doubt that those are my views and that I endorse the statement that I read out. That is the precise issue and, although it is not for me to make suggestions to the Minister, it requires her considerable thought. As my noble friend said, the matter arose in the Terrorism Act 2000, and was the subject of considerable discussion. It was raised by my noble friend Lord Goodhart, and, as a result of his intervention at that time, the burden of proof became an evidential burden on the defence and no more than that. That is the issue on which we need clarification.

I realise now that it was a lance that was being employed, and that I have been offered, in what the Minister very generously said in response, material which goes far beyond what I intended. I was concerned not with intent, in the sense of the person accused, but with the description of a statement which is to be the subject of an offence. It has to be described adequately, in terms from which a jury would understand the kind of statement covered by this offence. Issues of intent of the person uttering the statement or being responsible for publishing it come at a later point. I am grateful for what has been said by <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, asked me whether, as a judge, I would be happy trying to describe to the jury where they are going. In subsection (1), the offence has to be a statement that is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;likely to be understood by members of the public to whom it is published&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>It can be looked at first of all as a direct encouragement or other inducement. On the other hand, it can also be an indirect encouragement or inducement. We then have to go to subsection (4) to determine how that is to be looked at, particularly where it includes,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;every statement which glorifies the commission&quot;,</p>

<p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>So it goes on. I raise the issue in subsection (5) about the questions that could arise.
</p>

<a name="51205-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>I will look again very carefully at the Minister&#039;s response, but I do not think that she quite covered the point I was trying to raise. My point is that, if you have a test of a statement which members of the public could reasonably be expected to infer was to glorify conduct which should be emulated by them, why cannot that test also properly be brought back into the description of a statement which directly invites them to take part in,

</p>

<a name="51205-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>It may well be that some small terrorist groups may make no efforts to recruit members of the public. I would think, for example, that that was probably true, although I cannot be certain, of the Baader-Meinhof gang, which was a very small terrorist group operating in Germany. That would no doubt be because some groups of this kind find that indoctrinating people who are already known to members of the group is a more effective method of recruitment than trying to indoctrinate unidentified <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="51205-09_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   The whole purpose of this part of the Bill is to enable us to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism. In order to allow us to ratify the convention in this respect, we can create an offence that is broader than, or has the same scope as, the offence envisaged in Article 5 of the convention&#151;as the noble Lord knows&#151;but not one that is narrower. In considering whether our offence should have the same scope as that offence, we have taken into account the particular mischief which we feel we need to tackle, as well as existing UK law.
</p>

<a name="51205-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>In fact, if we were to adopt the construction suggested by the noble Lord&#151;&quot;persons&quot;&#151;it would be, if I may say so, more illiberal than our current structure. Amendments Nos. 3 and 15 would replace references to &quot;members of the public&quot; with references to &quot;persons&quot;. The Committee will know that the offence envisaged under Article 5 of the convention is concerned with making messages available to the public. The Government feel it is appropriate to have the same scope as that offence. It is not appropriate for this offence to target private communications.
</p>

<a name="51205-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>Although our decision to target only public statements may be inherent in the notion of &quot;publishing&quot; which is included in the current draft of Clause 1, we see no reason why the clause should not make it explicit that we are describing public communications by referring to members of the public as well. Given that the offence is not directed at private conversations, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, will accept the slightly tighter wording. I know that he would hate this provision to be seen as more illiberal than it needed to be. I must confess, I could not believe this draft when I first saw it, given where it comes from. I hope, with my explanation, the noble Lord will be content that the Government are trying to be liberal&#151;with a little &#039;l&#039;&#151;on this, and will join with us in our liberality.

Suppose a tutor is talking to his pupils&#151;are they members of the public? If he is giving a lecture which is open only to members of a particular university, are they members of the public? It is just one of those vague expressions that runs through Clause 1 and makes it extremely difficult to understand the scope of the offence.

&quot;members of the public&quot;&#151;is to enable us to ratify the convention when we come to implement the provisions, and make it clear that we are not seeking to catch private communications; that is reinforced by referring to &quot;members of the public&quot; as opposed to &quot;persons&quot;. If we leave it as &quot;persons&quot;, it could conceivably be suggested that we are seeking to catch private conversations and communications, which are not included. &quot;Public&quot; is, of course, defined at Clause 20(3).

<a name="51205-09_spnew6"></a><b> The Earl of Onslow: </b>   On this occasion, I suppose that I can be accused of arguing from a point of view that differs from that which I normally adopt. Is there a danger that a susceptible individual can be got hold of and, by glorification, be bullied into doing whatever misbehaviour we are trying to discourage? That one person could on many occasions be much more susceptible than a group. It could be argued that you are missing the real danger by focusing on people who are just writing cartoons or general articles in a newspaper.

<a name="51205-09_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   A person could, of course, be a member of the public who could be affected thereby. The whole purpose of having the definition in Clause 20(3), which deals with references to the public, is to give a certain degree of clarity to this. Clause 20(3)(a) provides that references to the public,

As I understand it, the position is that a meeting or a seminar, to use the expression mentioned by my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford would not be regarded as open to the public. Clause 6 deals with references to persons rather than to the public. There are obviously questions that may still arise, such as whether something that was open to any member of a particular religion could be regarded as open to the public. I do not think it is necessary to take this matter further. No doubt this may from time to time concern the courts in the future, if and when this Bill is enacted.

<a name="51205-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>If Amendment No. 4 were agreed to, the Bill would refer only to encouragement, without splitting encouragement into direct and indirect forms. Why is a reference to indirect encouragement necessary? The Bill defines one type of indirect encouragement of terrorism in Clause 1(4). Whether Clause 1(4) should be retained at all is a subject for debate in a different group of amendments and I will not discuss that now. Clause 1(4) is not an exclusive definition of indirect encouragement, it is what I might call an &quot;includes definition&quot; and not a &quot;means definition&quot;. The question for this group of amendments is: What else&#151;if anything&#151;do the Government have in mind as being indirect encouragement of terrorism? The concept of &quot;indirect&quot; encouragement of terrorism is frankly extremely vague. It is most unsatisfactory if people can drift into a criminal offence with statements which do not openly, or by necessary implication, encourage terrorism. That is particularly important when freedom of speech is an issue because people should have clear guidance on what they can and cannot say. Subsection (4) gives some guidance for one category of indirect encouragement&#151;the so-called glorification&#151;but not for indirect encouragement as a whole. Will the Minister therefore explain what indirect encouragement may involve? Why is it necessary to have separate categories of direct and indirect encouragement instead of simply a single category of encouragement?
</p>

<a name="51205-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>I note and accept the views of the Joint Committee on Human Rights that indirect encouragement of terrorism can be a legitimate offence. However, the Joint Committee also made it clear that any such offence must be narrowly defined and at present it plainly is not. Indeed, it is not defined at all. If the Government want to make indirect encouragement an offence, they should come back with a clear, complete and narrow definition of it. I beg to move.

The Association of University Teachers, in making representations on the Bill, wisely referred to the &quot;chilling effect&quot;. The chilling effect of legislation that can bite on freedom of speech and inquiry can be wide and go beyond what may be intended by the Government. Having lived for some two years in the United States during the period of McCarthyism, I am well aware of what is meant by a chilling effect. It is that people are frightened of what may be the consequences and the wide interpretation of what they do and they then avoid doing it even though their obligation as a journalist, university teacher or librarian might otherwise oblige them to do it. The danger of a vague definition of what is meant by &quot;encouragement&quot;&#151;the word &quot;indirect&quot; turns it from being specific to vague&#151;is that the chilling effect becomes very widespread.

The phrase &quot;indirect encouragement&quot; in the hands of someone in a responsible position&#151;an academic or a librarian&#151;could mean the careful avoiding of anything which could be considered to encourage terrorism. Let me give an extreme example. Supposing that I applaud a speech favouring terrorism given by some proselytiser in a public setting, could my applause be regarded as indirect encouragement to terrorism? Could it be that if I give my class in literature William Butler Yeats&#039;s &quot;Easter Rising&quot; to read, that might be interpreted as an encouragement of terrorism?

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>I believe that it is extremely important in our much looser and unconstitutional&#151;that is, without having a written constitution&#151;setting that we should consider how we define what is meant by &quot;encouragement of terrorism&quot; in such a way that will limit to the greatest conceivable extent the impact that it could have on freedom of discussion, debate and scholarship within our country.

<a name="51205-10_spnew1"></a><b> The Earl of Onslow: </b>   I see another difficulty. Let us assume that a student wishes to discuss or to write an historical essay on the Afghan-Russian war of whenever it was&#151;1970-odd to 1985. Sandy Gall wrote strongly in favour of the Mujaheddin who were resisting the Russians. Almost certainly the Russians referred to those gentlemen as terrorists. Had we been Russians, we would have done so, too. We regard that sort of behaviour as terrorism. The Americans provided them with large, substantive gifts of arms solely to make their terrorism much more effective, which was part of the policy.

<a name="51205-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>We have to be careful. Would it be an offence of &quot;indirect encouragement&quot; were a librarian to recommend Sandy Gall&#039;s articles on the Afghan war? What about library-held copies of some of the United States&#039; newspapers with their encouragement of the Irish uprisings at various times&#151;not least the 1916 rebellion&#151;and up to and including the present troubles, from which, thank goodness, it looks as if we are about to be spared? It is a difficult question. I seem to remember that there were good terrorists called the Macquis<i>,</i> who should be encouraged and bad <br>&nbsp;<br>

terrorists, called the IRA, who should definitely not be encouraged. The Bill seems to catch them all with all its dangers and illogicalities. That is a perfect example, and this is the first time we have had in Committee to consider the point.

<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="51205-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Ahmed: </b>   I support the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I am deeply worried about the definition of a terrorist, or of encouraging terrorism, which has expanded to other parts of the world where there are legitimate struggles of the right of self-determination and legitimate struggles against oppression; where there are abuses of human rights and where there is rape and torture. People like me who come from Kashmir know that there are 700,000 Indian soldiers there. International organisations, such as Amnesty International, Physicians for Human Rights, Asia Watch, and the state department, and even the Foreign Office know well that there have been many reports of fake encounters and abuses of human rights, such as rape and torture.


</p>

<a name="51205-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>We need clarification about how far we can go in terms of freedom of speech and legitimate struggles that we have been supporting. After all, our tradition is that we have supported those people who are oppressed. There is absolutely no suggestion that we want to support any terrorist who wants to kill innocent people, but there are people facing armies of oppression, and we need a very clear definition.
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="51205-10_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I do not want to add to the excellent speeches that we have just heard, with all of which I agree in their entirety. I want to make one or two further points wearing my hat as a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, whose report has already been mentioned today, and describe how I see the issue as someone who trades in human rights law in the context of free speech in my professional capacity.
</p>

<a name="51205-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>We are here dealing with speech crimes, are we not? They are speech crimes that criminalise the expression of political ideas that cause grave offence and worse, just as we were dealing with speech crimes when we debated provisions in the religious hate Bill on stirring up religious hatred. It is very important&#151;I have said this to friends within the Muslim Council of Britain, for example&#151;to have a completely consistent approach to free expression, whether it is in the context of speech crime in the Bill or under the incitement to religious hatred Bill or any other Bill. What do they have in common? First, there is a serious impact on the right of free expression. Secondly, as I said, they are in the context of political speech. Thirdly, under the principles of the United States Constitution first amendment or the European Convention on Human Rights, it is clear that two main vices must be avoided in legislation of this kind.
</p>

<a name="51205-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>The first vice is vagueness. Crimes of that kind must be tailored so that the citizen is given fair warning in advance of whether their contact will give rise to a serious criminal offence. The vice of vagueness is accompanied by the vice of over-breadth. A crime <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_440"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 440</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

must not be defined more broadly than is necessary to meet the legitimate aims of the state. In my view, and that of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the crime of glorifying terrorism fails to satisfy either of those tests. It is too vague and lacks proportionality.
</p>

<a name="51205-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>The Minister may say in her reply, as was said in the context of religious hate speech, that the Human Rights Act comes to the rescue because it states that all legislation, old and new, must be read and give effect compatibly with the convention rights, including the right to free speech. That is true, but the reason why that is no solution to the concern being expressed across the House is that Article 10 of the European convention is a qualifying right, not an absolute right. It has very broad exceptions and the citizen cannot tell by reading Article 10.1 or Article 10.2 whether given conduct will or will not be protected by the convention. So the vices of vagueness and over-breadth are not solved merely by the incantation of the Human Rights Act. It is therefore vital for the House to make quite sure that when those offences are defined, whether in this Bill or the other one, they are not too vague and not over-broad. We have work to do to accomplish those objectives.

<a name="51205-10_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   Reference has been made to the work of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. The evidence that we received is published, and it is beyond doubt that one of the most controversial issues in that evidence was the business of the definition of terrorism. It is worth taking seriously the amount of feeling that existed among some of the very articulate witnesses who came before us and put their cases extremely well.
</p>

<a name="51205-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>Surely it is because of the difficulties and uncertainties which we are discussing now in Clause 1 that the Home Secretary has invited the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, to review the definition of terrorism. Therefore, somebody looking at our situation from the moon might say that we were rather ahead of events. On the one hand, we have recognised that there is a need to review the definition of terrorism&#151;and the Government have asked someone to produce a report doing that&#151;and on the other, we are introducing legislation to deal with people who, directly or indirectly, advocate terrorism. Forgive me, but in all seriousness that is really rather bizarre. However, as the situation operates it makes it all the more important to have the certainties for which the Joint Committee has argued.
</p>

<a name="51205-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>If I may, I will switch from talking about the Joint Committee to talking from personal experience for a moment. I apologise for repeating something to which I have referred before, but it made a profound impression upon me. For three and a half years, I was the rapporteur to the Council of Europe on the conflict in Chechnya. I visited that country nine times during those years. I saw the consequences of the indiscriminate and ruthless bombardment of Grozny and elsewhere. I constantly heard from and met people who had suffered the disappearance of relatives, the <br>&nbsp;<br>

torture of family, the road blocks and all the brutality and insensitivity that marked the way in which the Russians have conducted that operation.
</p>

<a name="51205-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>Now, as I have argued before in the House, not for one moment does that begin to justify the vile and wicked things done at the school in Beslan, at the theatre in Moscow or, indeed, at the stadium in Grozny. Yet with that consistent, ongoing experience of the people of Chechnya, the certainties about what is and is not terrorism&#151;about who is and is not conducting it, and about where state terrorism or the terrorism of others starts and finishes&#151;all become much more confused and grey than it perhaps seems in abstract, intellectual deliberations in this Chamber. Therefore, this is no mere theoretical discussion. It has real and immediate implications for people in the midst of the most terrible situations&#151;and their friends and supporters in this country. For that reason, we need to exercise great caution in our drafting. We also need to be quite sure that anything we say is presented in as certain a way as it is possible to be.

<a name="51205-11_spnew0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </b>   Perhaps I may follow the noble Lord. It seems to me that however tight the present legal definition of terrorism might be, there is huge confusion in people&#039;s minds.
</p>

<a name="51205-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, and before that the noble Lords, Lord Lucas and Lord Ahmed, referred to certain causes that one might or might not support. The long tradition of Christian thinking on the subject makes a very clear distinction between the morality of a person&#039;s cause, which may or may not be justified, and the morality with which they pursue that cause. That is a separate issue which, again, may or may not be justified. So a person&#039;s cause may be morally legitimate, but they pursue it with terrorist tactics; that is, tactics designed to engender terror through attacks on civilians or attacks which are essentially indiscriminate. A precise definition of terror would be a tactic which is indiscriminate and disproportionate.
</p>

<a name="51205-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>What worries me about this debate, and why we are in such confusion all the time, is that people are slipping between discussing a cause which may be regarded as morally legitimate or illegitimate and having at the back of their mind certain terrorist tactics. I agree completely with the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that until we have a much tighter definition of terrorism, we will continue to sway in our minds between considering causes and considering the conduct with which those causes are pursued.
</p>




<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="51205-11_spnew1"></a><b> The Earl of Onslow: </b>   Is it not true that you could have an insurrection caused by a non-uniformed civilian rebellion using very extreme violence which is not terrorist in nature and a uniformed police, gendarmerie, militia or army which, in turn, uses terrorist methods to suppress that legitimate uprising? Does that not show even more muddle and underline exactly the point expressed so eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, and the right reverend Prelate?
</p>

entirely with what has been said. It is quite wrong to confuse admiration for courage and belief in a cause with conceding the people involved the right to threaten and terrorise. The kind of terrorists I hope we are aiming at are, for instance, those people in the animal rights movement who believe it is right to threaten and attack others&#151;as I believe recently happened to the entire board of the Bank of England. Those people are terrorists, but we are also talking about people who I agree are quite different. We are talking about those who have passion and courage in defence of a cause, but who are fighting, not terrorising. Is there no way that we can devise a definition to divide those two quite separate issues?
</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="51205-11_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I hesitate to enter into this aspect of the debate while on this group of amendments because I know that a later group will introduce the whole topic of the definition of terrorism and whether it is too wide or too narrow. I apologise to the Committee for the fact that Amendment No. 27 has strayed into this group of amendments because it plainly applies to Clause 2 rather than Clause 1. It ought to be included in the group beginning with Amendment No. 10.
</p>

<a name="51205-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, in his identification of vagueness as the main disease of this Bill. It is indeed vague and it is therefore additionally worrying that such wide discretion is later given to the Director of Public Prosecutions in Clause 20. The combination of the vagueness of the Bill, together with the width of discretion given to the Director of Public Prosecutions, moves us nearer to a situation where the rule of law is displaced entirely by government discretion. Every clause should be tested with that yardstick in mind.
</p>

<a name="51205-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>We did not add our names to these amendments, but that does not mean to say that we do not have considerable sympathy with the arguments brought to bear by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in support of them. We agree with the Joint Committee on Human Rights that there is a role for indirect encouragement, although that role should be much more tightly and narrowly defined than the definition to be found in the Bill itself. Clause 1(4) provides a definition of the notion of indirect encouragement, but nowhere in the Bill is there a definition of the concept of direct encouragement or, indeed, of encouragement itself.


</p>

<a name="51205-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>There is already an offence of incitement which would catch much of what would be published in the context that the Government seek to control. I wonder, therefore, if the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, would be kind enough to explain to the House&#151;to the extent that she feels able&#151;the degree to which &quot;encouragement&quot; goes beyond &quot;incitement?&quot; Is encouragement the same as incitement? If not, to what extent does it go further? If it goes beyond, could she give us some examples of how incitement differs from encouragement? Until we understand exactly what is meant by &quot;encouragement&quot; in this Bill, I do not see how we can go on to analyse the distinction between &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot; encouragement.

agree, is to make the definitions here as precise and as clear as possible&#151;which I fully endorse&#151;then I am not yet satisfied that this amendment will achieve that. If you take out &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect,&quot; you leave simply &quot;an encouragement&quot;. A court is bound to be asked to decide whether indirect encouragement is sufficient for this purpose. If the object of this exercise is to cut out indirect encouragement altogether, one has merely to delete &quot;indirect&quot; and leave in &quot;direct&quot;. So far in this debate no one has suggested that this is the intention. It does not seem that the object of clarity is achieved by taking out words that the courts might have to decide many times are included, while having to look at &quot;encouragement&quot;. I wholly agree with what has just been said by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, but what is really important is to get a clear definition of &quot;encouragement&quot;. I do not think that this amendment will achieve that objective.
</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="51205-11_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   Can I respond to a number of those points? I thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, for the point he made about &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot;. In Committee we are invited to direct our minds to specific amendments to specific laws on specific issues, as opposed to having the illuminating but very general debate we normally enjoy at Second Reading. I shall look at the actual purpose of these amendments, which have greatly surprised me. Let me explain why. All these amendments seek to do is remove the reference to &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot; encouragement, leaving &quot;encouragement&quot; undefined; as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, says, we think that would be serially unhelpful. I think I also agree with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford: it is important not to conflate terrorism with causes, just or not, which people pursue with energy. I will seek not to stray into those fields.
</p>

<a name="51205-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>The reason I confess to being surprised&#151;even doubly so&#151;by these amendments is that the Government announced our intention to create an offence of indirect incitement as long ago as July. At that time it was welcomed by the Liberal Democrats, who strongly supported the notion of such an offence. I am not clear why, precisely, there has been an apparent change of heart. The second reason for my surprise is that one of the key factors behind our decision&#151;and, I am sure, the wholehearted support then expressed by the Liberal Democrats&#151;was the intention to create an offence of indirect incitement in order to satisfy the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism. Article 5 of that convention, as I am sure this House does not need reminding, requires that parties to it create an offence of public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, whether or not directly advocating terrorist offences. To put it bluntly, if these amendments were to be made the United Kingdom would not be able to ratify that important European convention. It would be, to say the least, an unusual position&#151;I put it no stronger&#151;for an internationalist party such as the Liberal Democrats to take. I wonder if, on further reflection, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_444"></a>

noble Lords will consider whether that is really what they intend to do or what the amendments are intended to achieve.

<a name="51205-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>We have discussed, and will discuss further in due course, the specific definition of terrorism. I understand the concerns that have been raised about that. My noble friend Lord Judd is right to remind us that one of the onerous tasks that have been given to the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, when he comes to make his review, is to look at the definition of terrorism to see whether it needs further clarification and definition. We contend that Clause 1 is not too vague; that it is, in fact, clear.
</p>

<a name="51205-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>Terrorism and the convention offences&#151;the things that must be encouraged&#151;are clearly defined in Section 1 of the Terrorism Act and Schedule 1 to the Bill respectively. &quot;An offence&quot; makes it clear that the statements must be made publicly. It has clearly defined consequences: that a criminal offence with clearly defined penalties will be committed. The offence is also proportionate for the purposes of Article 10 of the ECHR&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Lester, was right to anticipate that that would be, in part, our response&#151;and only public statements are caught.
</p>

<a name="51205-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>The United Kingdom is facing a particular and specific threat of terrorism. This means that an individual&#039;s responsibility to refrain from making encouraging statements is heightened. The offence, once amended, will include a defence for those who do not endorse the statements. A statement which is caught could result in serious criminal proceedings and the consent of the DPP will be needed before prosecution can be brought. We need to keep these matters closely in mind.
</p>

<a name="51205-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>As to the concern raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, in relation to dissemination, I wish to make it clear that I understand the context, whether she was talking about dissemination generally or dissemination of articles and materials used by academics and/or issued in libraries in a proper context. If she was talking about dissemination generally, I responded to that with a question mark. If she was talking about the dissemination of material, I hope she was in her place when I spoke about the amendments that we propose to make to Clause 1(7) and Clause 2(9). Those changes will mean that no one will commit an offence where they can show that the statement or publication did not have their endorsement. Academics and librarians will then be quite safe because it will be clear that the context in which they were dealing with these issues clearly meant that they were not endorsing them, so they will be able to discuss and debate these issues.
</p>

<a name="51205-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, asked whether librarians would be safe to recommend the articles of Sandy Gall.

<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="51205-12_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   &quot;Encouragement&quot; can be broader than incitement.

</p>




<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="51205-12_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   It is clear that we already have legal authority to prosecute for incitement in the general context of terrorism and of what the Bill seeks to achieve. In our attempt to get to grips with the concepts of &quot;indirect&quot; and &quot;direct&quot; in relation to encouragement, I was simply asking the Minister what distinction she saw between the definition of incitement and the definition of encouragement. Clearly if encouragement means only incitement, there is no point in inventing &quot;encouragement&quot;. If it means something more than incitement, what does it mean?
</p>




<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="51205-12_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   As the noble Lord knows, encouragement can be direct and indirect; incitement is only direct&#151;you directly incite someone to do things. The difficulty is that, with regard to terrorist activity, it is often said, &quot;I did not seek to incite someone to do X, Y or Z, but the words I used positively encouraged them so to do&quot;. There is a distinction between those two things.
</p>

<a name="51205-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>We can already prosecute for the specific offence of terrorism. The provision will enable us to present those cases where &quot;encouragement&quot; falls short of sufficient information in relation to &quot;incitement&quot;. When someone makes a statement which does not directly incite but nevertheless encourages someone to do something and create an act of terror, it will enable us to intervene at that point.

<a name="51205-12_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </b>   Now that the noble Baroness has conceded that there is to be a subjective test and it will be a question of whether someone has been knowingly encouraging, are we not discussing an extraordinarily narrow line between someone knowingly encouraging somebody to do something and inciting them to do it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="51205-12_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   It is a narrow line and might cause a number of people to say that we should not have a subjective but an objective test. A subjective test is much more difficult to satisfy than an objective test, which would enable one to consider what a reasonable person in that situation would have foreseen. It is always possible, once one has a subjective test, to say that a reasonable person may have seen this as a foreseeable consequence, but individual X did not. Therefore, it is much more difficult to prove that they did. That issue has troubled us greatly&#151;it troubled us in the other place and it troubles us now&#151;in terms of whether it would be possible to prove this offence in a way that would give the offence teeth. The noble and learned Lord is right to point out that a subjective test will make the offence more difficult to prove that that is the express intent of many, and we have accepted that that should be the position.

incitement is saying, &quot;Go and do X&quot;, and that that is the difference between them? We have to ask ourselves whether we should carry the prosecution and make it an offence to say that something is a good thing rather than saying, &quot;Go and do it&quot;. Is that a fair definition?
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="51205-12_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I see what the noble Earl is directing his mind to. It is not entirely apposite because directly inciting someone and giving them the wherewithal to complete the offence is one thing; &quot;encouraging&quot; falls short of the direct offence of incitement. We have to consider whether we believe that people should be able to encourage others to commit acts of terror. We on this side of the House are very clear that they should not be encouraged or lawfully allowed so to do and that we should do all we can to prevent them so doing.

<a name="51205-12_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   I, too, am not a lawyer and have listened closely to what has been said. Is not an indirect encouragement a statement which says that, to take a current example, people who undertake certain sorts of suicide bombings will be rewarded in the afterlife with pleasures beyond the sorts of things they currently enjoy? Is it not an indirect encouragement to say that people who undertake suicide bombings receive money from certain sources? While not asking an individual directly to undertake these suicide bombings, the statements of what may be the reward to those who do could be an indirect encouragement. Is that not what we are trying to stop&#151;the sort of indirect encouragement which susceptible people might take as the go-ahead to carry out such crimes?

<a name="51205-12_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My noble friend is right, to the extent, of course, that one has to incite a person to commit a specific act. It cannot be an incitement to commit acts of terrorism generally. I take as an example the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, because I know that he is a gentleman of resolute character. Let us suppose that I were to make statements to try to incite him to commit an offence in relation to his noble friend on the Front Bench. If I named the person to whom he should direct his attention and specified the acts, I could be accused of, and properly arrested for, seeking to incite the noble and learned Lord to do something of a criminal nature in relation to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. If, however, I were to encourage Members on the opposite Benches to commit imprecise, general acts of terror, that would be encouragement, but I could not be accused of having incited someone to commit a specific act. So encouragement is much more general. I suppose that that is the real distinction between the two: incitement relates to specific acts, and encouragement to general acts of terrorism.

<a name="51205-12_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Cameron of Lochbroom: </b>   We have been talking about encouragement, but I remind noble Lords that the phrase used in Clause 1(1) is not merely &quot;encouragement&quot;, but also &quot;or other inducement&quot;. <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="51205-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I am grateful for the support which my amendments have received, not only from my noble friends, but from other quarters of the Committee. The purpose of the amendment is not, as the Minister seemed to think, to state that the Government must never introduce an offence of indirect terrorism. Its purpose was to raise a debate, which indeed it has, about what &quot;encouragement&quot; means; about what &quot;direct encouragement&quot; means; and about what &quot;indirect encouragement&quot; means. It is plain, and it has been borne out by the report of the Joint Committee, that when one is creating a new offence, one should make sure that it is adequately defined. In the case of the Bill, &quot;encouragement&quot; is not defined; &quot;direct encouragement&quot; is not defined; and &quot;indirect encouragement&quot; is not defined.
</p>

<a name="51205-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>It is necessary to start by defining &quot;encouragement&quot;. Once one has done so, one may well find that it is unnecessary to distinguish between direct and indirect encouragement. Let us say that one&#039;s definition states that &quot;encouragement&quot; is, &quot;saying or doing anything which makes it more likely that some recipients of your message will become involved in terrorist activity&quot;. That would seem to be a perfectly adequate definition of what is meant by &quot;encouragement&quot;. I am not necessarily putting it forward to the Government, but one has to start by defining &quot;encouragement&quot;. Only then can you move on to see whether you can in fact produce a sensible division between direct and indirect encouragement, and, if so, where that division lies. To begin with, I asked the Minister whether she could give me any indication of what, apart from the specific matter of glorification under subsection (4), might be covered by &quot;indirect encouragement&quot;, and she failed to do so.
</p>

<a name="51205-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>We need further clarification of what the Government have in mind. I should add that issues were raised during the debate relating to the problems of Kashmir and Chechnya. There will be opportunities to come back in more detail on those issues when we get to later amendments. At this point I say simply that if &quot;indirect encouragement&quot; goes as wide as the Government seem to intend at present, we could well find ourselves in a position where if the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, were to say outside your Lordships&#039; House&#151;where he would be protected by parliamentary privilege&#151;the words he said tonight, which he was perfectly entitled to say, he might face a charge of indirect encouragement.
</p>

<a name="51205-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>The long term may be that my noble friend Lord Carlile of Berriew will recommend a revised definition of terrorism, and the Government may accept it and legislate for it. The problem here, though, is that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_449"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 449</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government clearly do not intend to defer the commencement of the provisions relating to indirect encouragement until such time as we have a revised definition of terrorism.
</p>

<a name="51205-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>While I do not necessarily expect to bring these amendments back at a later stage, because they are intended to provoke a debate rather than to change the Bill, it is important that the Government give further thought to what they mean by &quot;encouragement&quot;. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

Might it not, for example, prevent the prosecution&#151;which I would have thought would be fully justified&#151;of an intermediate who gets someone else to publish the statement, not on his own behalf, but on behalf of a third party who has created the original statement? That is all I have to say on this rather limited issue. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="51205-13_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I find myself once again in the unusual position where the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is suggesting that a provision should be widened rather than narrowed. It is indeed an unusual sensation to be saying to the noble Lord that we feel that the current tightness of our provision is more accurate because it targets those whom we think should be captured, and we do not believe that it should be extended in the way the noble Lord seeks.
</p>

<a name="51205-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>The offence in Clause 1 will allow us to comply with Article 5. I have made it clear that that is what we intend and want to do. We do not want to go wider than that. The provision is drafted for that purpose. The language is accurate, and the suggested amendment would be less clear than the current drafting. Amendment No. 5 would widen the offence in ways that we in the Government do not regard as necessary. Instead of restricting the offence to persons who publish statements which encourage terrorism or to persons who cause others to publish such statements on their behalf, the offence would also apply to persons who cause others to publish such statements but on behalf of third parties.
</p>

<a name="51205-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>I am terribly interested in what the noble Lord is suggesting, because it is contrary to everything else that he has suggested. The amendment means that he would like to widen this provision and I do not believe that that is necessary. The Government would like to keep it as narrow as possible and necessary. We think <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_450"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 450</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that it is narrow enough as it is and we do not particularly want to widen it to catch any more people, although I thank the noble Lord for his invitation.

Therefore, there is nothing inconsistent with our attitude in proposing amendments that would, in a small way, strengthen the provisions of the Bill. However, this is a small issue which is not worth pursuing at any great length. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>The noble Lord said: I am sorry for rising yet again, but this time the issue is one of great importance and the Government will not regard it as strengthening the Bill. The purpose of Clause 6 is to remove the recklessness test and require actual intent. We believe that that would be in line with Article 5 of the Council of Europe&#039;s Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism.
</p>

<a name="51205-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>We welcomed with faint praise the government amendment in the House of Commons and we welcomed with perhaps slightly stronger praise the Government&#039;s announcement through the Minister this evening that they will accept that the test of recklessness should be subjective rather than objective. That is a considerable improvement. As the Minister said, she will accept the amendment to remove subsection (3) which converts the provision from objective to subjective recklessness, which we support. However, we would prefer to remove recklessness altogether.
</p>

<a name="51205-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Recklessness clearly has a part to play in the criminal law. It involves a conscious running of a risk. For example, someone who drives dangerously, not wanting to kill some other user of the road but being aware that his dangerous driving increases the risk that someone else will be killed, is plainly guilty of recklessness. However, it is not easy to transpose the concept of recklessness to the encouragement of terrorism or to anything that my noble friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill described as a speech crime.
<a name="time_13"></a>
<a name="51205-13_time0"></a><h5>5.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="51205-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>The problem here is that what creates the crime is not the objective physical result&#151;the causing of death or injury to another&#151;but the effect of the encouragement on the subjective mental state of people who read or hear the statement. That is not always predictable and may, and almost always will, vary among those who hear the statement. If intent on the part of the maker of the statement is necessary then <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_451"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 451</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

there is no problem. It is always possible for a jury to draw the inference that when the meaning of words is obvious, that is the meaning that the user of those words intended. If the statement is, &quot;Go out and become suicide bombers&quot;, the intent to encourage terrorism is obvious and the inference is inescapable. If every hearer or reader of the statement is likely to read it as encouraging terrorism, then that inference can hardly be avoided.
</p>

<a name="51205-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>However, what if the meaning of the statement is not so obvious? Recklessness may involve a very complicated scenario. It involves someone making a statement which is not unequivocally supportive of terrorism but which he realises may be seen or heard by possible recipients of the messages as encouraging them to acts of terrorism. For example, a strong attack on Israeli conduct on the West Bank which does not mention the use of violence against them may nevertheless encourage people who hear that statement to acts of violence. That could help to stir up some who hear or read the statement to become terrorists. The person who made the original statement may well foresee that as a risk, but, if so, there is a real problem, because any strongly worded criticism of an oppressive government may stir up hostility towards that government and may encourage&#151;I will not say directly or indirectly&#151;terrorism. At that point, it becomes an unacceptable interference with the freedom of speech if that was not the intention of the person who made the statement.
</p>

<a name="51205-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>I accept that intentional encouragement of terrorism should be an offence, but a verbal attack, even if it were a fiery and emotional one, on perceived oppression should not be an offence simply because the maker realises that it might stir up the flames of violence. We cannot silence critics of regimes on the West Bank, in Burma or in Zimbabwe. If recklessness stays in the Bill, there is a real danger that that is what it will do. I note that the Joint Committee was prepared to accept subjective recklessness as a test. I would go somewhat further, but I certainly agree that if recklessness is to be included, there must be a public interest defence so that strong criticism of foreign governments cannot be an offence. If that risk was taken out, then maybe we could go back to recklessness. But, at the moment, I do not think that there is adequate protection for those who express strong feelings, which they are now legitimately entitled to express, about what they see as oppression, breaches of human rights and even genocide in foreign states.
</p>

<a name="51205-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>Amendment No. 19 is consequential and removes Clause 1(7), which gives a specific defence that a statement was published in ignorance of its contents. That subsection would not be needed if intent was an essential requirement for an offence under Clause 1. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="51205-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   I support this amendment. I am afraid that the concession that the Minister has offered on subsection (3) does not satisfy me. I have found it useful to trace the history of Clause 1 as it has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_452"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 452</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

developed over the past few months to see what it is the Government are trying to achieve. That is what has caused us so much difficulty today.
</p>

<a name="51205-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>On 20 July, we were told that there would be three new offences: the preparatory offence, the training offence and the indirect incitement offence. In a letter to Mr David Davies and Mr Oaten, the Home Secretary accepted at that time that direct incitement was already covered by the common law and therefore there was no need for a new offence of direct incitement. The only odd feature is that there has been no attempt, so far as we know, to prosecute any of these so-called loudmouths for direct incitement.
</p>

<a name="51205-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>The Home Secretary&#039;s letter went on to explain what he meant by indirect incitement. This is perhaps my footnote to the discussion that has been taking place this afternoon. He stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;We now want also to cover indirect incitement to terrorism. We intend that the new offence should capture the expression of sentiments which do not amount to direct incitement to perpetrate acts of violence, but which are uttered&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>&#151;the following are the important words&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;with the intent that they should encourage others to commit, or attempt to commit, terrorist acts&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>So the difference between direct and indirect incitement depends not on a difference of intent&#151;both require the same intent. The difference seems to lie in the strength of language used by the potential defendant. As the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, said at Second Reading, direct incitement will lie with the &quot;loudmouth&quot; who shouts from the hilltops. If convicted, he will get a life sentence. Indirect incitement seems to apply to the man whose sentiments are expressed more obliquely or in a more guarded manner. He will get not a life sentence but seven years. But I emphasise that the intention is exactly the same. The defendant would be indicted with two charges, direct incitement and what I shall call indirect incitement. The jury would have no difficulty at all in deciding which of these charges to convict on, if either.
</p>

<a name="51205-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>So far, so good. I have no difficulty with indirect incitement in that sense. However, we come back to the question of the mental element of that offence. In his Statement on 20 July and in the Home Office press release on 6 October, Mr Clarke, the Home Secretary, made it clear that the offence of indirect incitement would depend on intention. There is no doubt about what he was trying to achieve. That would fit entirely with the Council of Europe convention and the offence of provocation, because&#151;as the noble Baroness will know, given that she quoted part of the definition of public provocation&#151;it goes on to use the same words, that the offence would have to be &quot;with the intent&quot; to incite the commission of a terrorist offence.
</p>

<a name="51205-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>So far there has been no reference to anything of the kind that we now find in Clause 1. What happened was that on the very day the Home Office was saying that it would depend on intent, the Government published the second draft of the Bill and there was no mention of intent anywhere. It said that the offence is committed if the defendant has &quot;reasonable grounds for believing&quot; that it would encourage. I remember my <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_453"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 453</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

astonishment in reading those draft clauses. I was going to be interviewed that night so I had to see if I could find out what they meant. Although the Home Secretary had said that intention was the essence of this, nevertheless, when the Bill was published, there was no reference to intention but to something quite different&#151;reasonable grounds for believing.


</p>

<a name="51205-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>When the Bill had its Second Reading in the House of Commons, of course Mr David Davis keyed in on that very point&#151;we cannot have reasonable grounds for believing, we must have intention. That is what has been suggested all along. But then something happened which I do not understand. What should have happened is that intention should then have replaced the words &quot;reasonable grounds for believing&quot; but for some reasoning intention was coupled with recklessness; and that is the whole problem. &quot;Recklessness&quot; simply does not fit into this context at all. You can make a reckless statement in the sense that you are reckless as to whether or not it is true, but to make a reckless statement in the sense that you do not care how it is understood I find extremely difficult to understand. I am sure that a jury would find it equally difficult.
</p>

<a name="51205-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>Recklessness is notoriously extremely difficult to define to a jury. It is even difficult to define it to judges, because Law Lords have differed about this, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, will remember when he failed to win the <i>Caldwell</i> case. Yet recklessness has been induced here at this stage, apparently for no other reason than to secure more convictions, and, as the noble Lord, Lord Plant, observed during the Second Reading debate, that is a very weak ground for a new offence. It would be a bad ground because it will not secure any more convictions at all.
</p>

<a name="51205-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The Government seem to have the view that they needed to introduce recklessness because of the difficulty in proving intention. But we prove intention day in and day out in the courts. If there were any difficulty in proving intention, the prisons would be only half full instead of overflowing. We can prove intention; the difficulty is in proving recklessness. That is going to cause much more trouble for apparently no real object and will certainly lead to many more appeals.
</p>

<a name="51205-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>At Second Reading there was very little support, if any, for recklessness as a test. Two very powerful speeches were made against recklessness: by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, who implored the Government to take back recklessness&#151;recklessness, not subsection (3)&#151;and by the noble Lord, Lord Plant, who made, it seemed to me, an unanswerable case against the clause based on recklessness.
</p>

<a name="51205-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>So I hope that the Government will have second thoughts about this fallback position of recklessness, which will not work, and that the Conservative <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_454"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 454</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Opposition will also have second thoughts and support this amendment rather than the one in their own name.

<a name="51205-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I support my noble friend Goodhart in this amendment. Reference has been made to the case of <i>Caldwell</i> by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. That was reversed in the case of <i>R</i> v <i>G</i> in 2003. It is quite instructive to look at the speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Steyn, in that case. This is what he said about it:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;The surest test of a new legal rule is not whether it satisfies a team of logicians but how it performs in the real world. With the benefit of hindsight the verdict must be that the rule laid down by the majority in <i>R</i> v <i>Caldwell</i> failed this test. It was severely criticised by academic lawyers of distinction. It did not command respect among practitioners and judges. Jurors found it difficult to understand: it also sometimes offended their sense of justice. Experience suggests that in <i>Caldwell</i> the law took a wrong turn&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>I have to accept, as the noble and learned Lord has pointed out, some responsibility for that, since my argument failed in <i>Caldwell</i>. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Steyn, went on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;That brings me to the question whether the subjective interpretation of recklessness might allow wrongdoers who ought to be convicted of serious crime to escape conviction&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Waddington, earlier this afternoon asked whether bringing in a subjective test of recklessness would have this effect.

<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>and I have to say that he agreed with my argument&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;if a defendant closes his mind to a risk he must realise that there is a risk and, on the evidence, that will usually be decisive . . . One can trust the realism of trial judges, who direct juries, to guide juries to sensible verdicts and juries can in turn be relied on to apply robust common sense to the evaluation of ridiculous defences&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="51205-14_para15"></a>

We are concerned not with how a person acts but with what he says and what its effect will be on the audience. Either he is trying to encourage them, in which case it is arguable that he should be punished for doing that, or he is not. It has to be a statement. It is not enough for him merely to applaud a speaker or to shout in a crowd to encourage people. He has to be saying something to people. He knows what he is saying. If he is trying to encourage, he should be punished. If he is not trying to encourage and somebody takes it the wrong way in a way that he cannot possibly foresee, he should not be punished. That is the issue with which we are concerned, and <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="51205-15_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   Of course I understand the purport of the opposition of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and the way in which it is put by the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Thomas.
</p>

<a name="51205-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>To make it clear, we believe that one has to look at the way in which this Bill has been framed. In framing the Bill we have had to try to fulfil two obligations. The first is our obligation to our partner countries in the Council of Europe, to which we have already alluded, and, in order to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, we needed to create an offence of incitement to terrorism, whether that incitement is direct or indirect. Noble Lords know that Clause 1 purports to satisfy that end and create this offence.
</p>

<a name="51205-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>Noble Lords are right to have said that there is already an offence in our law directly to incite a person to commit a specific act of terrorism. We do not seek to interfere with the common law in the way in which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, set out in advancing his remarks on this amendment. It is not an offence, as we have already discussed in our debate on the previous amendment, to incite people to engage in terrorist activities generally, or to incite them obliquely by creating the climate in which they may come to believe that terrorist acts are acceptable. That is the gap that we want to close, both to enable us to fulfil our international obligations and because we believe that it is desirable in its own right. I remind the Committee of the powerful speeches made, particularly on Second Reading, not least by noble Lords on Benches opposite, the noble Baronesses, Lady Park of Monmouth and Lady Ramsay of Cartvale, and other noble Lords who have great experience of that. We are living in a different context.
</p>

<a name="51205-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>The second obligation is, of course, to the electorate. The manifesto on which the Labour Party fought, and won, the 2005 general election contained a clear commitment to create a new offence of glorification. The offence in Clause 1 allows the Government to meet their obligations to the electorate.
</p>

<a name="51205-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>Having outlined the intentions behind Clause 1 in broad terms, I should also like to stress what it is not intended to do. The Government have no intention of outlawing legitimate activities that do not encourage or help terrorists. The emphasis on context and the defences provided in Clause 1 are designed to ensure that teachers, lecturers and writers can all go about their business freely. I am satisfied that the Bill does not pose a danger to such people.
</p>

<a name="51205-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>I am, however, conscious&#151;and we have debated this both on Second Reading and today&#151;that many noble Lords have expressed concerns that the activities of such people will be criminalised by this clause. That was raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and is exciting the attention of the noble Lords, Lord Thomas of Gresford and Lord Goodhart. That is why I made my earlier comments on our <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_456"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 456</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

proposed amendments. The most important amendment which we are now considering, Amendment No. 6, means that the offence in Clause 1 would be committed only&#151;I emphasise this&#151;if the person making the statement intends to encourage terrorism. There would be no provision relating to recklessness at all if the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, had their part.
</p>

<a name="51205-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>There has been much debate about the objective and subjective elements. They were considered extensively both in the other place and on Second Reading. The provision that the offence should be committed if the person making a statement intends to encourage terrorism clearly needs no further justification. I think we are all agreed&#151;as was clear from the statements of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick&#151;that people who make statements which they intend to encourage terrorism should be committing an offence. We are in total agreement, <i>ad idem</i>.
</p>

<a name="51205-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>I am also absolutely satisfied that a recklessness limb is justified. People who knowingly make statements that will encourage their audience to commit acts of terrorism should be covered by this offence. Indeed, the very idea of a defendant arguing that he knew his statement would encourage terrorism, but that he did not intend that it should do so, shows how difficult the amendment is. It is verging, if I may respectfully say so, on the absurd. Would we really want defendants going scot-free who quite brazenly say that they knew what the effect of their statements would be, but made them anyway?
</p>

<a name="51205-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>Before even considering the changes the Government now propose to make, I would therefore urge noble Lords to withdraw their amendments, bearing in mind the clear change that I have signalled that the Government are minded to make. In order to explain our change, I perhaps need to say a little more.
</p>

<a name="51205-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a> The detail of what the recklessness limb should be is, of course, complicated. In order that the Committee should fully understand the implications of Amendment No. 6, I need to explain what the Government propose to do to the recklessness limb which this amendment would remove. Although this anticipates matters that will be debated further at a later stage, it is necessary in order that your Lordships should know what they would be rejecting, if they were to support this amendment, which comes first.
</p>

<a name="51205-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>As the Committee will be aware, much of the debate on recklessness focused on subjectivity and objectivity. If a person could not reasonably have failed to know what the effect of his statement would be, he should not be able to escape punishment by simply asserting that he did not know what the effect would be. However, we understand the difficulties that poses, the arguments extended about Caldwell, and the arguments about where the law now is in relation to <i>R </i>v<i> G</i>. That is why I signalled today, on behalf of the Government, that we are prepared to move to the subjective test of recklessness in Clause 1 of this Bill, which both the Her Majesty&#039;s loyal Opposition and the Liberal Democrats voted for in another place. On that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_457"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 457</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

basis, we will support Amendment No. 9, tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland, Lord Henley and Lord Goodhart, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom.
</p>

<a name="51205-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>As I understand it, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is indicating that he would prefer the removal of &quot;recklessness&quot; in its entirety. If &quot;recklessness&quot; should remain&#151;he does not admit that&#151;he would prefer the subjective, as opposed to the objective, test. The effect of this change, if we adopt the position of Amendment No. 9, will be that the prosecution will have to show not that the defendant could not reasonably have failed to know what the effect of his statement would be, but that he did in fact know what the effect would be.
</p>

<a name="51205-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>I think this amendment would provide the comfort that many on this Committee said that they needed in order to assuage their concern over this offence. If that construct is accepted and adopted by us all, there will then be no circumstances under which this offence could be committed if the defendant did not either intend to encourage terrorism or know that his statement would encourage terrorism. Speaking entirely for myself, I can see no reason why people should be allowed to encourage terrorism intentionally, or to make statements that encourage terrorism recklessly, when they know what the effect will be. It would be unfortunate indeed if we were to allow people the opportunity to abuse our citizens in a way which would have such potentially horrific consequences, and if we did nothing to prevent it.
</p>

<a name="51205-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>In view of the change to a subjective recklessness test, which the Government will seek to introduce on Report, I invite the noble Lord to indicate that he is content to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51205-15_para13"></a>

<a name="51205-15_spnew1"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Oxford </b>  : Can the Minister help me on the last point before she moves on? Suppose that a person supports a particular armed struggle but disapproves of some of the terrorist tactics they use. Supposing they make a speech supporting the cause, and they know&#151;they do not approve but they know&#151;that one of the effects of their speech will be to strengthen those who want to use terrorist tactics in their favour. Will they be caught by the new government amendment with its subjective recklessness test?
</p>




<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="51205-15_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   First, their intent has either to be to encourage the commission of those acts of terror, or to make statements, knowing it will encourage acts of terror to be committed, but are reckless as to those consequences; they may say, &quot;I will do it anyway&quot;. Similarly, someone may say, &quot;I wish to blow up an aeroplane. I do not wish to kill any of the people on the aeroplane, but I intend to put the bomb on the aeroplane and I am reckless as to the consequences&quot;. If you intend to do something, the consequences of which are known to you, and those <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 458</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consequences occur, you must be held responsible for what you have done. In the description that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford gives, it would be perfectly possible for the person making that speech to make a distinction between the cause and the way in which others pursue it. It would be possible to say that I absolutely abhor all forms and acts of terror and I do not believe it is possible to legitimately pursue these aims using those acts of terror, albeit that I understand the mischief from which you suffer and which you seek to address. It is perfectly possible to make a speech in which one clearly disassociates oneself from the type of acts of terror which are used by individuals to pursue their aims.
</p>

<a name="51205-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>This Bill says, &quot;If people do not wish to endorse those acts of terror, they should make it plain that they do not seek so to do&quot;. I do not believe that that is beyond the wit of man to make that distinction. Innumerable people have done that. The behaviour and statements of Gandhi&#151;at a time when terror was being used&#151;made it absolutely clear that he agreed with the independent struggle and with change but he fundamentally disagreed with those who used acts of terror to pursue that cause.

<a name="51205-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   Does the noble Baroness accept that we would comply with our international obligations under Article 5, if Clause 1(2)(b) stopped with the word &quot;intention&quot;? If she does accept that, what is the justification for adding anything to this involving recklessness?
</p>




<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="51205-16_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   As I have tried to make plain, we believe the two parts are justified. We think it is right that the issues I have just outlined should both be caught. We do not think it is appropriate where someone knows the consequences of what they have said for them simply to say, &quot;I am not caught and I can continue to encourage&quot;. It is important for both limbs to be caught. If one accepts the subjective test&#151;which I have indicated as clearly as I can that we do&#151;that gives a very high hurdle over which people would have to jump, in order to make sure that the person charged with this offence intended to commit this offence, or intended the consequences in the way I have just described.

<a name="51205-16_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   Could I raise with my noble friend the difficulty some of us have with her argument? Much of her argument is very persuasive. The difficulty, as some of us understand it, is that the Home Secretary has said that he believes there is nowhere in the world where violence, including violence against property, can be justified as a means of bringing about political change. Is my noble friend saying that no distinction can be drawn between highly targeted violence which seeks not to hurt innocent people&#151;in the kind of situation, for example, which I described in Chechnya&#151;and terrorism?

<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="51205-16_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Ahmed: </b>   May I also add that during the elections, and even after the elections, many Members from the other place went to the Kashmiri community <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 459</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in the United Kingdom, where they were saying openly that Kashmiris are freedom fighters and not terrorists. The Prime Minister, during his visit to India, said that they are terrorists. Would those Members of Parliament, when they go back to their constituencies with their Kashmiri constituents, be allowed to say that they are freedom fighters, or would they now have to say that they are terrorists?
</p>




<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="51205-16_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   I want to add one more example to the Minister&#039;s interesting explanation. When there is a constitutional or democratic route to change a government, all of us understand that the case for terrorism becomes extremely weak. If there is no such route&#151;if no method of peaceful and effective protest exists&#151;does the situation not change somewhat, particularly in the strongest case given by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, about terrorism against property? For a long time, Umkhonto we Sizwe of South Africa was the outstanding example, in so far as it did not have a strategy of attacking people but did have a clear strategy of targeting property. Most or many people of this country fully approved, because there was no other route that existed by which they could constitutionally pursue their attempt to change the regime. Does that not make a difference, and is it not characteristic of some of the positions that our Government&#151;and that of the United States, to give another example&#151;have taken? The non-existence of a democratic challenge alters the basis upon which one may or may not accept methods that are necessarily extra-parliamentary and possibly violent.
</p>




<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="51205-16_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   Of course there are some very complex and difficult questions in relation to determining when terrorism is terrorism. We have discussed this not least because of the innate difficulties in the changes that we propose. We have spoken today and on other days about whether the change of the definition is merited, and what the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, will suggest to us when he reports. We do, however, now have a pressing difficulty. We have been very clear. We need to remind ourselves of the context in which we currently live, where suicide bombers and acts of terror are outwith the sort of buildings or matters the noble Baroness speaks of. The terrorism that we are dealing with on a day-to-day basis is a terror which takes lives and which visits huge mayhem on those who are innocent of any degree of culpability at all. Where one stimulates and encourages such acts of terror, it is critical to look at those issues.

<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="51205-16_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I hear what the noble Earl says about muddle and some powerful speeches outlined why, regrettably, the position on terrorism that we face today is significantly different from that which we have ever faced. I know that the noble Earl may not accept that but we believe that the terrorism with which we are currently faced is significantly different. It is of a more virile, disparate effect.
</p>

<a name="51205-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a> In answer to my noble friend Lord Ahmed, no one is saying that people must define how they describe people&#151;as Kashmiri, independence campaigners, freedom fighters or terrorists. The Bill does not criminalise any description. We must be clear about what the Bill does. What is criminalised is the encouragement to commit terrorist acts, whether by express intent or recklessness where there is the application of the subjective test. That is a narrow compass indeed. A person could not reasonably have failed to know what the effect of his statement would be should he make it. There will be no circumstances under this offence, if we amend it as I describe, where the offence could be committed if the defendant did not either intend to encourage terrorism or know that his statement would do so. That is what <i>Re G</i> does. It says, &quot;You either expressly intended or you knew that your statement would encourage terrorism&quot;. In those two narrow circumstances, culpability would have to be demonstrated that this offence would bite. We can put to one side the arguments about what a reasonable person might have thought objectively about what was said and we have to look at the specific, the subjective, of what this individual&#151;not someone else&#151;intended or knew. They will either stand or fall, be convicted or acquitted, on the basis of what they did, what they intended and what they knew. That is what the majority of people in this House wanted to see. With the combination of specific intent and a <i>Re G</i> form of recklessness, that is what we have.
</p>

<a name="51205-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>There are those who would say that <i>Re G</i> is wrong. I have got to the stage where I do not know what cannot be said. However, I say strongly that where the Government, having listened so carefully to what was said in the other place by Her Majesty&#039;s loyal Opposition and the Liberal Democrats, and having listened to what was said by the majority in this House and just as powerfully by those who sit behind me on our Benches, we have come to the view that the right course would be intention and <i>Re G</i> recklessness. I have not stood at this Dispatch Box so long that not even I sometimes hope that I will be met with a certain degree of welcome when the Government move as far as we have moved today.

<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="51205-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I am grateful to those who have raised a number of interesting issues in this long and serious debate. However, I am concerned that the Minister does not seem fully to have appreciated the depth of the problem. Let me take a hypothetical situation, but one that is wholly realistic, of someone who writes an article or makes a speech saying that the people of Chechnya are entitled to independence from Russia if they want to have it. Let us suppose that that person at the same time condemns the attacks on the school children at Beslan and on the theatres in Moscow as being both evil and counterproductive. Nevertheless, anyone making such a speech will be well aware that a body of public opinion in other countries, building up in support of independence for Chechnya, will in some measure give support to those who are taking armed steps against Russian soldiers in Chechnya.


</p>

<a name="51205-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>The definition of terrorism in the 2000 Act is very wide. It does not apply to heinous acts such as the attack on the school at Beslan. It extends also to attacks on Russian soldiers who are trying to impose an unpopular government on the inhabitants of Chechnya. It seems beyond doubt that anybody making that speech will know that it will be part of the cumulative effect of foreign support. In those circumstances they will be in breach of the test of recklessness. Although they do not intend armed struggle in Chechnya they are doing something that makes it somewhat more likely to happen. That would necessarily be an offence under Clause 1. It is essential to get that sort of statement out of criminal liability.
</p>

<a name="51205-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>I have an example from my own record. In 1993 I led a team of people on behalf of the International Commission of Jurists to Kashmir. We delivered a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_462"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 462</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

report on human rights in Kashmir. One of the things we said in the report was that the inhabitants of Kashmir had been denied the human right of self-determination under Article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. At no point in our report did we support militancy in Kashmir. Nevertheless, I have to say that if I were writing that report now, I would be seriously concerned about my potential liability. We must either eliminate even subjective recklessness as the basis for an offence under Clause 1, or we must as an alternative come back with a new provision. I have made an attempt at one, which will come up much later, to ensure that the kind of speeches or reports that I have been discussing do not present those who make them with the risk of being prosecuted for an offence under Clause 1. The noble Baroness shakes her head, but I think that it is a real risk.

Am I right in interpreting the noble Baroness in that way? I see that she is nodding, so I am right. I am much obliged.
</p>

<a name="51205-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>It follows that the noble Baroness must have some doubts about the way in which we have formulated Amendment No. 8. To help the noble Baroness in her cerebrations between Committee and Report stages, I draw her attention to paragraph 41 of the judgment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, in which he sets out his definition of recklessness. The noble and learned Lord states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;A person acts recklessly within the meaning of Section 1 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 with respect to</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>             (i)   a circumstance when he is aware of a risk that it exists or will exist;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>            (ii)   a result when he is aware of a risk that it will occur; and it is, in the circumstances known to him, unreasonable to take the risk&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>Amendment No. 8 is intended&#151;to use that frequently employed word in our deliberations today&#151;to do no more or less than reflect exactly the definition that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, used in <i>R </i>v <i>G</i>. I shall be intrigued to see what the noble Baroness makes of the definition of subjective recklessness on Report.
</p>




<p><a name="st_159"></a>
<a name="51205-17_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I support the amendment, and want to make a simple point. I have already quoted from another judgment in the case of <i>G</i>. Your Lordships should bear in mind the fact that 20 years passed between the case of <i>Caldwell</i> and <i>G</i>, during which the law took a wrong turn. In that 20 years recorders and judges throughout the country summed up to a jury on the basis of the law as wrongly laid down in <i>Caldwell</i>. It is inevitable that people went to prison who would not have gone to prison if the proper principles had been stated in the Caldwell case. For 20 years, the law took a wrong turn.
</p>

<a name="51205-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>I hear the Minister say that it is with the deepest regret that we move from the objective to the subjective test and that they are making a great concession. If they did not make that concession, it would have been a disgrace.
<a name="time_17"></a>

</p>




<p><a name="st_160"></a>
<a name="51205-17_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   For the sake of clarity, we do not intend to move government amendments to Clause 1(2)(b); there is no need for them. However, we plan to table amendments to Clause 1(7) and Clause 2(9). I shall explain why.
</p>

<a name="51205-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>First, I tell the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that the whole issue of subjective/objective has exercised us all greatly. I know that it has exercised noble Lords sitting opposite for the same reason that it has exercised us. First, as I think I made plain in our earlier discussions, all Members of this House and indeed those of another place want to address the issue of terrorism with an appropriate degree of vigour. The question between us has been how we should do that and what is the best <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_464"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 464</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

course to take. There are difficulties in taking a course that is too restrictive; there is also difficulty in taking a course that does not properly address the mischief with which we are now faced. That is and has been the dilemma. When I say that the Government have taken this course and that it is a large concession, that is because we understand how difficult it is to get the balance right. We understand that there is a consequence if the judgment that we collectively make about the subjective test proves to be incorrect or over-optimistic.  That is why we have thought about this so keenly.
</p>

<a name="51205-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>I signalled earlier and am delighted to confirm that we will accept Amendment No. 9. I am grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland, Lord Henley and Lord Goodhart, and to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom. I hope that the noble Lord will be content to withdraw Amendment No. 8, which relates to the issue of objective versus subjective recklessness, in view of our movement on Amendment No. 9. We have particular objections to that amendment. The suggestion that it should be an offence for a person intentionally or knowingly to encourage terrorism only in circumstances known to or foreseen by him is on the face of it reasonable. However, it has an unforeseen side-effect. It means that it would not be an offence for a person intentionally&#151;intentionally&#151;or knowingly to encourage terrorism in circumstances unknown to or not foreseen by him, although that was his purpose and intent.
</p>

<a name="51205-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>We just ask rhetorically: why should that be the case? Why should someone be allowed intentionally or knowingly to encourage terrorism generally? If he intends to encourage terrorism or knows that his statement may encourage terrorism, the specific circumstances in which his statement may have an effect should not be relevant. The important thing should be to satisfy the test either of intention or of knowingly to have encouraged.
</p>

<a name="51205-17_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>Amendments Nos. 24, 25 and 37 would play a similar role to that of Amendment No. 6, which we have already considered, but in Clause 2. That clause makes it an offence to disseminate terrorist publications. The offence does not involve intent. That was quite deliberate. We want to give enforcement agencies the tools that they need to tackle a particular mischief: the dissemination of publications in contexts that mean they will either encourage terrorism or be of use to terrorists in practical ways. If the offence required intent, it would be virtually impossible to use, because booksellers, for example, would easily be able to say that they provided terrorist publications for financial gain. The Government therefore cannot support any move to make intent part of the offence.
</p>

<a name="51205-17_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>However, we listened carefully to the concerns expressed by your Lordships in the House and elsewhere. In particular, we listened carefully to my noble friend Lord Eatwell, who has been engaged in this matter very constructively and had some helpful conversations with my right honourable friend the Home Secretary. My noble friend&#039;s concerns were echoed by several other noble Lords who have been <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_465"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 465</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

intimately involved in academic work and libraries&#151;not least the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, whom I see in her place, and my noble friend Lord Parekh. Issues concerning librarians concerned my noble friend Lord Eatwell and others. He argued strongly for safeguards in regard to that offence and, like other noble Lords, wanted to ensure that appropriate protection was in place. In order to give my noble friends and other Members of the Committee the reassurance that they seek, the Government propose to change that offence in a very important way. The core element of the offence will remain the same, but we will seek to change the defences available to those who may be charged with this offence.
</p>

<a name="51205-17_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>At present, Clause 2(8) provides an obvious defence for libraries. It states that it is a defence for a person charged with the offence to show:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;that he had not examined the publication . . . had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that it was a terrorist publication&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-17_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>and did not endorse the matter in the publication that made it a terrorist publication. I should clarify for the Committee&#039;s benefit that merely collecting publications&#151;as a copyright library must&#151;does not mean that they will be regarded as endorsing the publications. &quot;Endorse&quot; in the Bill is to be understood in the commonly accepted sense. I should also stress that the word &quot;examine&quot; is to be understood as referring to the sort of exercise that would reveal any reasonable grounds for the purposes of Clause 2(8)(b).
</p>

<a name="51205-17_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>However, since many of your Lordships have argued that Clause 2(8) does not provide a sufficient defence for librarians and others, we propose to extend the defence in Clause 2(9). At present, Clause 2(9) is restricted to those who disseminate terrorist publications through an electronic service. We intend to extend that defence so that it can apply to everyone who might otherwise have been liable under that offence. That will mirror the change we intend to make to Clause 1(7), which I have already explained in my earlier general comments.
</p>

<a name="51205-17_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>That change will mean that, in the case of publications that encourage terrorism, it will be a defence for a person charged with the offence to show that the publication did not express his views and that it was clear it did not; or, in the case of publications that provide material of use to terrorists, that the person did not provide the material with the intention of it being of use to terrorists.
</p>

<a name="51205-17_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>There can be no question but that that defence should be available to all legitimate librarians, academics and booksellers. The defence would be restricted to them. It would not be extended to others seeking to flout the law and encourage or facilitate terrorism. We think that this change will address all the remaining concerns over Clause 2.

<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="51205-18_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   Yes, because at the moment Clause 2 is restricted to a narrow group. We intend, through the amendments we are making, to remove that restriction so that it could be of general application. Clause 2(9) provides that:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;In proceedings against a person for an offence under this section in respect of any conduct falling within subsection (1)(a) to (f) it is a defence for him to show&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>and then it sets out, in paragraphs (a) to (d), the extent to which they are able to take advantage of those defences. Clause 2(9) will then be of general application, so that academics, librarians and others will be able to fall within these provisions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="51205-18_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   Perhaps I may press the Minister a little further, because what she said is obviously of great interest to academics and libraries. The Minister will appreciate that the Bill, as it stands, is almost certainly unworkable for those libraries that have collections of literally tens of millions of items. To take one example, the British Library acquires 1.5 million new items every year. It cannot be expected to go through them all. I took her point about deposit libraries, but this is a slight distinction because it will apply to the whole public library system.
</p>

<a name="51205-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>Also, in a situation where it is literally impossible for those responsible for collections to know exactly what they contain&#151;and, furthermore, where they have an obligation to increase those collections to cover all the areas where their customers and students may have legitimate interests&#151;does this extension of subsection (9) in effect mean that a librarian or academic in pursuit of their normal tasks and responsibilities would not normally come within the purview of this law, unless there was some special example? I apologise for asking these rather banal questions, but it is important for the Committee to understand exactly where we are. I stumbled because I am inclined to say &quot;a deliberate intention of&quot;, but the word &quot;intent&quot; is still one that the Government will not accept for Clause 2. Unless intent is brought into the picture somewhere along the line, can the Minister define a little more clearly the distinction between the librarian or academic who is simply doing their proper job, and a particular instance&#151;which they do not know about&#151;where someone who has either borrowed from them or listened to their lecture uses that information for terrorist purposes?

First, all those who collate information and publications for libraries such as the British Library in the way that the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, described will be able to continue what they have always done without fear of transgressing these provisions. The extension of Clause 2(9) to all those involved in that work will give them that assurance.

<a name="51205-18_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   Does that mean that a bookseller who has been selling books on terrorism would be let off if he says, &quot;I do not endorse these for a moment, but I thought it was a good way of making money&quot;?

<a name="51205-18_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I do not think it would unless he was unaware of the content of the publications. If a librarian or other individual is unaware of the content of a publication and he has no reasonable grounds for suspecting that it encouraged terrorism or was wholly or mainly to be used by terrorists, he would have a defence under Clause 2(8). If, however, a bookseller was a deliberate purveyor of terrorist materials to people whom he reasonably expected were going to use them and he endorsed that in circumstances that made it clear that he was doing so, of course he could not take advantage of the provision. It would be very much a question of fact and the context of the circumstances. There would be an evidential burden&#151;

</p>




<p><a name="st_170"></a>
<a name="51205-18_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   No. It would be clear from the circumstances that the ordinary, average bookseller one has in mind would not endorse any act of terrorism. It would also be clear that the articles were not being purveyed to promote terrorism. However, there are other circumstances that we have had indications of where material is gathered together. All of it is of a terrorist nature, explaining how to construct bombs, how to target people and details on a whole set of nefarious practices. The circumstances under which such material is sold make it clear that it is for a restricted audience. Perhaps the material is stored at the back of the shop. All these things are evidential&#151;

I listened carefully to what she said on Amendment No. 8. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, has defined recklessness in the context of the Criminal Damage Act 1971. If I have understood the noble Baroness correctly, she has said that, for the kind of offence in the Bill, particularly when talking about terrorism in its generality rather than in relation to a certain act, the way in which the noble and learned Lord formulated the definition of recklessness for the Criminal Damage Act 1971 might not be appropriate for the offences as defined in this Bill.

<a name="51205-19_state0"></a> My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall repeat a Statement about local authority revenue finance for England in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 made earlier today in another place by my honourable friend the Minister of State for Local Government. The Statement is as follows:


</p>

<a name="51205-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>&quot;Sensible planning for service delivery needs a stable and predictable funding environment. Freezes on grant distribution changes have helped. But the time has come to go further and give councils firm forward financial allocations. There is no reason why councils cannot now provide similar certainty for their local taxpayers when setting their council tax for 2006&#150;07 by providing an indicative council tax for 2007&#150;08.


</p>

<a name="51205-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>&quot;To give councils as complete a picture as possible of forward financial allocations, I am announcing today for the two years 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 allocations of formula grant and grant for the Supporting People programme. The Government will also publish by local authority a table of allocations of all the major revenue grants that can be allocated in advance, including the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund, which gives indicative allocations of &#163;525 million for 2006&#150;07 and &#163;525 million for 2007&#150;08 for the 86 most deprived local authority areas in England. By the end of this week we expect that the vast majority of individual specific grant allocations will be announced to local authorities. The only grants that cannot be announced at this stage will either be performance-led or data-driven in their nature.


</p>

<a name="51205-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>&quot;My right honourable friend the Minister for Schools will shortly announce the provisional allocations to authorities of Dedicated Schools Grant; noble Lords should bear in mind that these allocations need to be added to those I am announcing today to give a fuller picture of the above-inflation funding going to authorities with education and social services responsibilities.

<a name="51205-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>But we no longer take that view. The formula is simply a means of distributing government grant. Notional spending and taxation figures are nonetheless still being misunderstood and misused for a variety of purposes, such as spending or tax <br>&nbsp;<br>

targets, for which they were neither intended nor suitable. Such notional figures get in the way of sensible budget setting, because councils treat them as targets or going rates, and get in the way of a more mature relationship with local government on doing business together. I propose a system that deals in an honest currency&#151;cash grant&#151;not fanciful assumptions about spending.


</p>

<a name="51205-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>&quot;I accept that most responses to consultation were against our consultation proposals along these lines. However, the arguments supporting this position were not strong. Many stated that the new system would be more complex or use more judgment than the existing system; neither is the case. The new system will retain the strengths of the old. It will continue to take account of the relative needs of an area, and the relative ability of councils&#039; areas to raise council tax. There will be an element of grant that is distributed on a &#039;per head&#039; basis, and there will be a grant floor.


</p>

<a name="51205-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>&quot;Total revenue grants to English local authorities will be &#163;62.1 billion in 2006&#150;07 and &#163;65.1 billion in 2007&#150;08, increases over the previous year of 4.5 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. Part of that increase is dedicated funding for schools, leaving formula grant for other services that will total &#163;24.8 billion in 2006&#150;07 and &#163;25.6 billion in 2007&#150;08, increases of 3 per cent and 8.8 per cent respectively. This means that by 2007&#150;08 the increase in government grants for local services, since taking office, will be 39 per cent in real terms.


</p>

<a name="51205-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>&quot;We have been working with local government over the past three years on possible changes to grant distribution formulae. We consulted publicly over the summer and I am publishing the summary of consultation responses today. Following that consultation, we propose a number of changes. The main drivers behind these are: updating, in particular by using 2001 census data in place of that from 1991; making the system more forward-looking by using projections of population and council tax base; and adapting to policy change.


</p>

<a name="51205-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>&quot;The new formulae for personal social services for children and younger adults are based on extensive research and have a solid evidence base. This makes it clear that there will need to be substantial change to reflect the evidence on service provision and the very different social and demographic environment of the 2001 census. The grant system also takes account of councils&#039; widely varying ability to raise council tax, depending on the council tax valuations of housing in their area. We propose to increase this resource equalisation because doing so will make the system fairer for those authorities with relatively low ability to raise council tax locally. I propose to adjust the grant distribution system to reflect the introduction of free off-peak bus travel for the over-60s and the disabled from next April. I shall do so by increasing in the district level environmental, protective and cultural services formula the weightings given to factors that reflect support for the disabled and the needs of areas where take-up is likely to be highest.

</p>

<a name="51205-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>&quot;Grant floors&#151;minimum guaranteed increases from one year to the next&#151;are a permanent part of the system. Given the importance we attach to stability and predictability of grant, we shall be phasing in the larger changes this year with more than usual care. The changes to children&#039;s and younger adults&#039; social services will be phased in with specific formula floors. Additionally, we propose grant floors for groups of authorities as follows. For 2006&#150;07 the floors will be: 2 per cent for authorities with education and social services responsibilities, but this figure excludes the increase in schools funding, which will give all such authorities above-inflation increases in grant; 3.2 per cent for police authorities; 1.5 per cent for fire and rescue authorities, with this figure masking the help we give by phasing in recovery of the modernisation grant paid in 2004&#150;05; and 3 per cent for shire district authorities.


</p>

<a name="51205-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>&quot;For 2007&#150;08, the grant floors will be: 2.7 per cent for authorities with education and social services responsibilities; 3.7 per cent for police authorities; 2.7 per cent for fire and rescue authorities; and 2.7 per cent for shire district authorities. Within each group of authorities, those above the floor will have their grant increase scaled back to pay for the floor. The proposed floor levels will mean a fairly narrow range of grant increases in 2006&#150;07, with police authorities, in particular, all receiving approximately the average increase. For 2007&#150;08 all authorities receive a grant increase at least in line with inflation, and more formula change will come through for most authorities.


</p>

<a name="51205-19_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>&quot;I would now like to turn to the Supporting People programme, introduced in 2003 and now successfully providing support to over 1.2 million vulnerable people. I am pleased to announce a two-year settlement for this programme. The Supporting People grant allocation for 2006&#150;07 will be &#163;1.685 billion, which is a significant investment. I have also announced guaranteed minimum allocations for 2007&#150;08 to enable authorities to plan their expenditure. Further, I am pleased to announce that authorities will be able to roll forward any savings from 2005&#150;06 to 2006&#150;07 in order to reinvest in the programme. This announcement brings stability to the sector and will enable authorities to work with support providers and voluntary sector and community groups to plan for the future. Building on the success of Supporting People, I recently launched a consultation on how the programme can be further improved and, following this consultation, I will announce next summer full allocations for 2007&#150;08.


</p>

<a name="51205-19_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>&quot;This settlement is good news for councils and council tax payers. We have been working closely with local authorities this year to identify the extent of the pressures they face up to 2007&#150;08, and consider these actions necessary to mitigate those pressures. I am pleased to announce extra formula grant for the two years over and above previous plans of &#163;305 million and &#163;508 million for local government. We have also agreed with local <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_473"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 473</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

government that we will jointly move forward on a number of fronts aimed at addressing the real pressures that councils face. This includes a continued commitment to the new burdens procedure, working with local government to assess the costs and savings of implementing new policies and funding the net costs. We will be strengthening the mechanisms to enforce the new burdens procedure. Further, I announced to this House on Friday our agreement that cost pressures arising from reinstatement of the 85-year rule in the local government pension scheme will not fall on taxpayers.


</p>

<a name="51205-19_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>&quot;We are also aware of authorities&#039; concerns over the costs of the new licensing scheme. I am pleased that we have been able to reassure the Local Government Association on this issue. My honourable friend the Minister for Creative Industries and Tourism has today reaffirmed the Government&#039;s undertaking that costs to local authorities from meeting their requirements under the new Licensing Act will be fully met by fees within the national fee regime, provided that they are incurred legitimately and efficiently. Local authorities will also benefit from the extra money coming in to local authority budgets through the Local Authority Business Growth Incentive scheme, and from the new top-up grants for police and fire and rescue pensions. These will help budget planning and, ultimately, the council tax payer.


</p>

<a name="51205-19_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>&quot;We have provided a stable and predictable funding basis for local services. We expect local government to respond positively so far as council tax is concerned. Therefore, we expect to see average council tax increases of less than 5 per cent in each of the next two years. There is, following today&#039;s announcement, no excuse for excessive increases. Local government should be under no illusions: if there are excessive increases, we will take capping action, as we have over the past two years.


</p>

<a name="51205-19_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>&quot;I am also announcing consultation on alternative notional amounts. The draft alternative notional amounts report sets out the proposed notional adjustments to local authorities&#039; 2005&#150;06 budget requirements, to help enable like-for-like comparisons with 2006&#150;07 budget requirements for capping purposes. This is being issued today for consultation, to ensure that authorities know in advance of setting their budgets the budget requirement figure for 2005&#150;06 that the Government will use when considering using capping powers.


</p>

<a name="51205-19_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>&quot;The Government have provided another significant boost to local authorities with a financial package that is stable, predictable and adequate to meet the pressures local authorities face over the next two years while keeping council tax increases down to acceptable levels. I have placed copies of tables showing grant allocations and supporting documentation in the Vote Office and the Library of the House; full details are being made available for <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_177"></a>
<a name="51205-20_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating this Statement, and I thank the Government for making sure that the Statement was available in rather more time than we would normally have to read it. This Statement, in many ways, affects more people than all the rhetoric of the Chancellor of the Exchequer earlier this afternoon. I think all of us in this House value local government, and even the Government pay lip-service to that. The trouble is that the Government, despite what they say, will not allow local government to be local, and there is no sign of any change in the Statement.
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>The Government have imposed new duties and have certainly not fully funded them. The latest relate to the absurd and unwanted 24-hour drinking. I welcome the indications in the Statement that more of the costs associated with that will be met in the fees-regime, although local authorities have already had to face substantial up-front costs. It is a bit like shutting the stable door. Will all the costs of appeals&#151;and many, many appeals are now being made&#151;be met by the Government or an allowance made for them? How will the Government precisely assess&#151;as the Statement says they will&#151;whether licensing costs are incurred legitimately and efficiently? The presumption with local government is that it is legitimate and that it tries to be efficient.
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>I welcome the idea of a new burdens procedure&#151;which involves working with local government to assess the costs of new burdens&#151;but would it not be better if, instead of a new burdens procedure, we had fewer new burdens and therefore did not require the procedure? Council tax payers might then be a bit happier. As the Statement acknowledges that the Government have ignored most of the comments made to them in the consultation on the new finance regime, what faith can we have in these new procedures? What burdens does the Minister anticipate will fall on councils in the future on which these procedures presumably will be imposed?
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>Can the Minister assure the House that the new grant system will not give central government even more opportunity to switch resources from year to year to suit central government&#039;s political priorities, which has certainly happened in the past? Will she say specifically how resource equalisation will operate under the new regime? Will the Minister explain the equity of the damping mechanism whereby those who receive grant above the floor will have it taken away to pay for the floor?
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>Does the Minister understand my disappointment that there is no cull of CPA, inspection, best value and the other regimes in the Statement? The Government talk of &quot;new localism&quot; but run a &quot;new inspectorism&quot;. Would not one way to have cut council tax have been to come here and announce a cull of such unnecessary <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_475"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 475</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

bureaucracy? Where is the contribution from the Government and their agencies to all the justifiable talk of efficiencies being needed by local authorities? There is nothing in the Statement which gives us any comfort that any of that is likely to happen.
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>Council tax has been forced up as a deliberate stealth tax by the Chancellor while local authorities are blamed for the result. No wonder the average council tax in England has ballooned from &#163;689 in this Government&#039;s first year of office to &#163;1,214 this year That is a rise of over 80 per cent when this year&#039;s planned increase is added. The Statement means that there will be yet more council tax rises&#151;or service cuts&#151;in the year ahead. Before today the Local Government Association said that there was a funding gap of &#163;2.2 billion. The Statement refers to one-off grants of &#163;300 million and &#163;500 million over two years. That sounds to me like &#163;800 million, which is a long way short of &#163;2.2 billion. How much of that gap&#151;the difference between &#163;800 million and &#163;2.2 billion&#151;has been filled, and precisely how will it be filled?
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>Can the Minister explain how much of the new development land tax&#151;which is a classic old style Labour tax, even if recommended by Kate Barker&#151;will go back to local authorities rather than to regions? I stress &quot;rather than to regions&quot; and include in that the Greater London Authority. Can the Minister give an undertaking that the Mayor of London will be capped if he proposes an increase in precept of above 5 per cent? Can she say whether the London boroughs will be either compensated for their current concessionary fare scheme or receive a grant towards it in the light of the Chancellor&#039;s announcement that there will be a universal scheme?
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>Continuing council tax rises are inevitable. Indeed, the Chancellor is expecting council tax revenue to rise by 7.1 per cent in the coming year. The Statement refers to council tax rises of 5 per cent at the upper end of the average for the next two years. That means that the Government are planning on the assumption that council taxes will rise at nearly double the rate of inflation for the next two years, which is fairly tough news for those on pensions and fixed incomes.
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>It is no wonder that we had earlier today the humiliation of the First Reading of a Bill to stop a revaluation of council tax&#151;a Bill for which the Government legislated only last year. The impact of that, as the Government widely understand, will be disastrous for anyone involved with a house that has any value in it at all and, of course, it opens the doors to the official snoopers with their cameras. Council tax payers have had enough of what the Government are putting forward. The Statement, unfortunately, gives them more of the same.
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>Can the Minister say when the Lyons report will now be received? How many more reviews of local government structures and finance are currently in train? Indeed, we have referred before to the Miliband review and I am sure that that will not be the only one. Can the Minister tell the House how the move away from notional amounts announced in the early part of the Statement relates to a consultation on continuing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_476"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 476</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

alternative notional amounts in relation to capping? Can she say whether there is any intention by the Government to pay more attention to that consultation than they did to the previous one?
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>We welcome a move towards two-year and three-year planning. However, will the Minister acknowledge that it will be worth nothing if it takes place against a background of capricious policy change&#151;such as the triple U-turn on local authority pensions&#151;and in the context of a new grant regime that gives central politicians more power to dictate to local councils than ever before?

<p><a name="st_178"></a>
<a name="51205-20_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for repeating the Statement. In view of my comments and questions, I say at the outset that I appreciate that the Statement was not of her making. I declare an interest as a member of the London Assembly, which has theoretical, if not very practical, powers to deal with the Mayor of London&#039;s budget.
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>The Statement reads to me as highly centralising and, yet again, as reducing local discretion. It continues&#151;perhaps even more harshly than in previous years&#151;the capping regime. It also reads to me as very confusing. What now for the Lyons review? Will the Government&#151;as I think they should&#151;apologise to Sir Michael Lyons for the continual postponement of dealing with his review, and to local government for what I regard, quite frankly, as the Government&#039;s messing about.
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>I was at a public meeting about 10 days ago&#151;there were some 300 people there&#151;and one of the subjects which was being discussed was the precept to be levied for the 2012 Olympics. The complaints were not about the cost of the Olympics but substantially about the costs to be incurred by pensioners. Their point was that council tax is an unfair way of raising money and there were many references to those on low incomes. The conclusion, I suspect, for many of those reading the Statement will be that the council tax is unfair and must be got rid of.
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>To seek some answers to particular points which were raised, nobody could object to having a stable and predictable funding environment or to enabling local authorities to provide an indicative council tax on a rolling basis for future years. That needs adequate information. It is a very laudable aim and I wonder whether it will work. Do the Government intend to legislate to require this and would I be over-cynical in saying that I see it as something of a mechanism for transferring blame?
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>The paragraphs regarding the various grants, by listing all the components, illustrate the complexity and the centralised nature of local government finance. For instance, to talk of allocations under the neighbourhood renewal fund immediately says it: not a local authority decision but an allocation. It seems that unless gearing is drastically reduced there cannot be certainty for the future in the way that this Statement suggests.

</p>

<a name="51205-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>The reference to doing business with local government in a &quot;mature relationship&quot; is again laudable, but to be followed immediately by the confession that the Government are going ahead with plans when the responses to their consultation were not in support of the Government does not seem to me to be a basis for a mature relationship. Could the Minister explain the psychology behind that? It seems to be a question of, &quot;The kiddies in local government got it wrong, we know what&#039;s best&quot;. Can the Government give us an assurance that a mature relationship as they understand it includes dialogue?
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>The figures for total revenue grants exclude the dedicated&#151;the jargon has changed, it is not ring-fenced but dedicated&#151;funding for schools, but do not deal with the inevitable impact on social care budgets. If you dedicate, or ring-fence, one of the two large budget heads, the other one is bound to be vulnerable.
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked about resource equalisation, which again seems to be layering complexity on complexity and compounds the problem by performing a rather intricate dance around the area rather than actually addressing it. In dealing with free off-peak travel, where the grant distribution is to be adjusted, can the Minister give an assurance that an adjustment will not be a reduction in practice?
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>With regard to grant floors I hope that the Government can also assure us&#151;perhaps they can tell us what consultations they have had&#151;that the figures given for floors will not be met by either despair or hollow laughter, given that they seem to be very low. In relation to the future indicators of all authorities for 2007&#150;08 receiving a grant increase at least in line with inflation, which inflation indicator will be used? We have many and we are accustomed to inflation in local government being higher than what the general public might regard as the inflation level&#151;often for very understandable reasons.
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>As this whole area deals, among others, with police and fire authorities, I add to the pleas that I know are being made&#151;I have made them with another hat on&#151;with the London Metropolitan Police Authority and the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, whose needs are in part governed by their national responsibilities, which are not, in our view, wholly recognised by the grant made available from central Government.
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>I should not take too much longer but I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us whether, in working &quot;closely with local authorities&quot;, to quote the Statement, the Government have come to an agreement with the Local Government Association and that the black hole of &#163;2.2 billion, which the Minister has already mentioned, is an agreed figure? Can she also tell us whether the Government agree with the Local Government Association that local authorities have done pretty well when it comes to applying Gershon efficiencies?

I thought that that was supposed to be revenue neutral&#151;I seem to remember some assurances being given in this House during the passage of the Bill. But my heart sinks a little at the explanation that the fees will be met provided they are incurred legitimately and efficiently. Are central Government going to check on all that?
</p>

<a name="51205-20_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>An inevitably superficial reading of the Statement as I have had to give it, and an inevitably abbreviated report, cannot amount to real scrutiny of a difficult and complex area. We have an annual formula, not one applied just by the ODPM. It is a ritual with increasingly complex rules. I have said of other issues that it is not the issue itself which is the only thing that concerns me. Here, too, I fear that the public will see this as the bureaucrats playing with jargon, with figures, and not addressing what it really is like to receive a council tax bill, or indeed any tax bill because I appreciate that most local funding comes out of taxation raised through other mechanisms. People may well think that this is what bureaucrats thrive on, but I do not think that anybody in the Chamber this evening would say that the politicians thrive on it. Perhaps only those who purvey headache pills in the vicinity of town halls will thrive on this Statement.

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>I shall start with what I can welcome, which is the welcome that noble Lords have given to the three-year funding and the stability that that implies. I take issue with the notion of centralisation, which both noble Baronesses raised. With the cash arrangement that we now have we will be working with local government just as we always have, to share judgment and to meet real needs. There is no change in that. As the noble Baronesses know, in our local vision we very much respect the importance of the discretion of local government, as indeed did the dialogue that we had with local government in the framing of this settlement in front of us.
</p>

<a name="51205-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>I will take the questions raised in turn. With regard to licensing, for example, I can tell the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, that the DCMS has confirmed that the costs incurred by local authorities in meeting their requirements under the new Licensing Act, provided that they have been incurred legitimately, will be fully met. There should be no liability there.

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>Resource equalisation&#151;which is a means of introducing fairness into the system&#151;will operate in the same way as before. More account will be taken of relative ability to raise council tax by ensuring the total within the grant system that relates to resource.

a floor within the system for the protection of social services. The education grant is, of course, on top of that.

We have increased funding for local authorities by 39 per cent since 1997&#151;that would be the figure by 2007&#150;08. Both noble Baronesses referred to the &#163;2.2 billion which was posited by the Local Government Association. We said at the time that we did not accept that for a number of reasons, not least because some of the elements were not costed, such as the minimum fostering allowance. We have &#163;305 million this year and an additional package to work with councils through the new burdens and to look at the set-up problems they have discussed with us. We accept the additional pressures that the noble Baroness mentioned. Things such as waste and an ageing population require us to think constructively with our partners&#151;and it is a partnership. We have to get it right.
</p>

<a name="51205-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>I can assure the noble Baroness, just as my colleague did in the other place, that we expect the majority of the planning gain settlement to go to local government for funding infrastructure&#151;the crucial infrastructure we need if we are to be able to meet our ambitions to house more people in the future than we have been able to in the past. That is being driven by demographic pressure, not just in the south-east but in other parts of the country as well.
</p>

<a name="51205-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>The noble Baronesses referred to the council tax. The figure of 5 per cent is by no means a going rate. It is a statement of the implications. Last year we set 5 per cent and most councils came in at under 4.1 per cent.

If I understand the figures correctly, it will be &#163;2.25 million after the new settlement. Will the Minister give an undertaking that over the next two or three years, on the basis of the new settlement, the figures will unwind properly and authorities throughout the country will get the money the Government say they deserve rather than an amount which is constrained by keeping the floors and having to have the cross-subsidies within them?

<a name="time_25"></a>
<a name="51205-22_time0"></a><h5>7.41 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_191"></a>
<a name="51205-22_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Lord Rooker) </b>  rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 15 November be approved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_192"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the draft Legal Aid (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 amends the existing legal aid legislation in Northern Ireland by taking a power to enable the Lord Chancellor to direct or authorise funding in exceptional cases. This power is required because the legislation governing legal aid in Northern Ireland, pending full implementation of legal aid reform, is a restrictive and inflexible 1981 order which does not have an exceptional grant power. As such, the draft order seeks to ensure that exceptional funding is available in Northern Ireland, as it is in England and Wales, and that the Lord Chancellor can, in appropriate circumstances, exercise powers to compensate for the inflexibility of the 1981 order.
</p>

<a name="51205-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>Your Lordships may be aware that the Lord Chancellor had previously sought to address this issue by bringing forward a transitional exceptional grant power under the Access to Justice (Northern Ireland) <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_483"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 483</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Order 2003. That transitional exceptional grant power worked well, providing important assistance in numerous cases, particularly in relation to inquests. However, as your Lordships may be aware, that transitional power was successfully challenged by way of judicial review by one of the defendants to the Omagh civil action. The defendant successfully challenged the funding provided to the Omagh families.
</p>

<a name="51205-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>The draft order essentially replicates the exceptional grant provision set out in the now-repealed Section 76 of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002. Under the order, the Lord Chancellor can direct the Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission to fund categories of cases or, in response to a request from the commission, authorise funding for an individual case which falls outside the scope of the ordinary legal aid scheme. I repeat, this reflects the current position in England and Wales.
</p>

<a name="51205-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>However, the draft order also enables the Lord Chancellor, in response to a request by the commission, to authorise funding generically or in respect of individual cases which are within the scope of the ordinary legal aid scheme. Your Lordships will note that this particular power is intended to compensate for the inflexibility of the powers currently available under the governing 1981 order. It is a transitional provision, until such time as the full range of powers under the Access to Justice Order becomes available to the commission and the Lord Chancellor.
</p>

<a name="51205-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>The draft guidance, which I have made available to your Lordships&#039; House, indicates that this power could be used to compensate for the systemic impediments within the 1981 order or to fund an individual, wholly exceptional case which is technically within the scope of the ordinary legal aid scheme and yet cannot secure funding. The Lord Chancellor would consider exercising this power only if the commission requested funding in a case where there were compelling reasons why it would be inappropriate simply to apply the rigid test set in the 1981 order.
</p>

<a name="51205-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>Your Lordships may consider that a practical example of the use of this power would be to provide funding to those bringing the Omagh civil action. I cannot enter the realms of speculation, but your Lordships will note that under the terms of the order the issue of funding for the Omagh civil action or any other action is a matter in the first instance for the commission to determine should an application for legal aid be lodged. All I can say on behalf of the Lord Chancellor is that he would consider any request submitted by the commission on the merits of the case and against the general principles set out in the draft guidance. I commend the order to the House.

that it is not feasible to refer to it at the moment, but I hope that he will listen very carefully to what the people of Omagh have to say about it.

<a name="51205-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for bringing this order to the House. I assure him that we on these Benches fully support it. Since the Access to Justice Act 1999, we have had a much better system of providing legal aid in England and Wales than has been the case in Northern Ireland. This order is timely in addressing that anomaly.
</p>

<a name="51205-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>Granting legal aid in exceptional circumstances will bring Northern Ireland within Articles 2 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. I have just two questions for the Minister. Are there restrictions on legal aid for civil cases? It seems that use of legal aid in criminal cases will inevitably use up a lot of specified money. Will there be any moves to redress the balance between legal aid for civil and legal aid for criminal cases if that proves to be necessary?

Naturally, I hope that he will consider it favourably, although I understand from the Minister that no undertakings can be given in this respect until the moment comes when the Lord Chancellor has to exercise his discretion.
</p>

<a name="51205-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>As the Minister explained, the order grants a power to enable the Lord Chancellor to grant legal aid in exceptional circumstances. As he also explained, the existing statutory basis for the provision of legal aid in Northern Ireland is the Legal Aid, Advice and Assistance (Northern Ireland) Order 1981. That order contained no power to grant exceptional legal aid. It seemed that the Lord Chancellor had attempted to commence, in transitional form, the power in question in an earlier 2003 order. This order replaces the transitional mechanism. In as much as it simply provides a new statutory basis for the existing exceptional grant scheme, I support it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_195"></a>
<a name="51205-22_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the supportive comments. The order&#151;which is in effect transitional&#151;is coming forward only because of the remarks of the judge in the case which I referred to earlier, who said that things were unsatisfactory and something needed to be done. Work is going on to bring in the full Monty, if I can put it that way, of the procedures that have already gone through the House, but it is necessary to do this now for lots of purposes.
</p>

<a name="51205-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>As I said, it would be wrong of me to speculate about particular cases, although I have only referred to one by name and title. As I also said, the Lord Chancellor would have to look first of all at any determination from the commission, because that is where the applications would need to be made.
</p>

<a name="51205-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>I assure the noble Baroness that in Northern Ireland at the present time there is no cap on the civil legal aid budget, so there is no cross-over between criminal and civil. There is ongoing reform of legal aid in Northern <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>Page 2, line 1, leave out subsection (4).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: This brings us to what may be the one of the most contentious provisions in the Bill. It may help to start by looking at the history of the clause. The glorification offence hit the headlines when the Prime Minister held his press conference on 5 August shortly before going on holiday, but it had already figured in the Labour Party manifesto. The relevant paragraph contains a brief mention of glorification but it is not informative and does not say what is meant by glorification, nor how it could be enforced as a criminal offence. That may explain why, when drafting the Bill, the draftsmen found it so difficult to express it in terms that any of us can understand. This provision was originally a separate clause&#151;Clause 2&#151;but the Home Secretary abandoned that at an early stage and transferred the glorification provision to what I call a deeming provision in Clause 1(4) because he said that that would be an improvement.
</p>

<a name="51205-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>Almost everyone who spoke at Second Reading about glorification, condemned the clause because it was either incomprehensible to the man in the street or unenforceable or both. Those who spoke to that effect included the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, and the noble Lords, Lord Thomas of Gresford, Lord Kingsland, Lord Hurd, , Lord Soley, Lord Stratford, Lord Judd, Lord Griffiths of Burry Port, Lord Ahmed and the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. Nobody who I am aware of spoke in favour of glorification as an offence or the basis of an offence, certainly as drafted. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, did not support it and the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, did not deal with it in her reply. We do not have the advantage of her view but we do have the advantage of her presence.
</p>

<a name="51205-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>Let me describe what I think the clause means. Subsections (1) and (2) make it an offence to publish a statement with the requisite mental element, whatever that may turn out to be, which is likely to be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_486"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 486</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

understood by members of the public as an encouragement to commit acts of terrorism. Under Clause 20(3) &quot;public&quot; includes members of the public at home or abroad. So guilt will or may depend upon how a statement is likely to be understood in, for example, Palestine or Pakistan, because they are included under the term &quot;members of the public&quot;. I do not know how a jury is supposed to form a view about that.
</p>

<a name="51205-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>Under Clause 1(4), which is the deeming provision, a statement celebrating the achievements of, for example, the African National Congress in South Africa or the rebels in Chechnya, is deemed to be likely to be understood as an encouragement to commit terrorist acts in, say, Palestine, if potential terrorists there could reasonably be expected to infer that they should do likewise. I have put that in as simple language as I can, but the very involved language of Clause 1(4) seems to amount to that. That immediately prompts the question: how on earth can anyone know what a potential terrorist in Palestine, or in England, is likely to infer from what is stated? How can anyone know what a potential terrorist would reasonably infer, when, almost by definition, terrorists are not reasonable people?
</p>

<a name="51205-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>Making an offence depend on something which is almost a contradiction in terms&#151;what would be understood by a terrorist in Palestine&#151;is not a proper basis for an offence committed in England. I cannot imagine that any jury would convict in the circumstances that are put before us. Juries do not like these catch-all offences, as we saw the other day in the case of the couple who failed to inform the police about a member of their family who turned out to have been a suicide bomber. Quite rightly, the jury acquitted them. That should never have been an offence, any more than this should be an offence, as it is currently drafted or, indeed, as it could be drafted. It could be drafted more clearly, but it could not be drafted in a way that would make it a suitable subject for a criminal offence under our law.
</p>

<a name="51205-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>In the unlikely event that a jury convicted someone under Clause 1(4), what would be the chances of that conviction being upheld? They would be minimal. The subsection would fail on two separate grounds, both of which were explained earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill. It would fail the test of legal certainty, because people must know where they stand, which is the principle that was explained clearly by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, at Second Reading. The subsection would also fail on the ground that it was an unjustifiable restriction on freedom of speech&#151;a principle that still stands for something in this country. It is clearly a restriction on freedom of speech and it is difficult to believe that any court would hold that Clause 1(4) was a proportionate response to the threat of terrorism that we face, although that threat is serious. So it would be held inevitably that Clause 1(4) is not a necessary provision in a democratic society.
</p>

<a name="51205-23_para8"></a>

<a name="51205-23_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My name is also on this amendment and I would like to give strong support to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. When the Government decided to merge an originally separate offence of glorification into the wider offence of encouragement, the word &quot;glorification&quot; became pointless. The definition of terrorism is so wide that it includes many events that have been glorified for years, and even centuries&#151;for example, the American War of Independence, which involved a violent struggle by a number of people against a lawful government. So glorification of past acts, which may have fallen within the definition of terrorism, are not automatically an offence.
</p>

<a name="51205-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>It was originally proposed that there should be an exemption for acts more than 20 years old, which would be subject to a black list of acts which were more than 20 years old but which the Home Secretary thought still ought to be treated as being beyond the pale. That particular proposal I think sank under its own absurdity. So, glorification as a definition of terrorism is not automatically an offence.
</p>

<a name="51205-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>Glorification remains permissible, unless it carries the inference that the conduct being glorified should be emulated. But once you find someone saying that you should emulate what happened on 9/11 or 7/7, they are plainly encouraging terrorism in any meaningful sense of the word. Therefore, reference to glorification, if coupled with a requirement that the conduct being glorified is to be emulated, adds nothing because it is already within the ordinary definition of encouragement. I believe, frankly, that it is only being included in the Bill in order to save the Government&#039;s face, as the Labour Party manifesto promised to make glorification of terrorism an offence. I recall that the Labour Party also promised to make condoning terrorism an offence, but that promise has widely been forgotten.

It would be a brave person who did not want to glorify Nelson Mandela, particularly after those years spent in Robben Island. One could think of others in that struggle, like Eduardo Mondlane, who sought to throw off the yoke of a fairly cruel Portuguese imperialism. The point I wanted to stress was the conclusion of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, because we put a lot of time into it and we met till late hours. I promise that I will not delay the Committee by quoting at great length from it, but I do think it is appropriate on this point. It stated:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;The legal certainty concern is that terms such as glorification, praise and celebration are too vague to form part of the criminal offence which can be committed by speaking. The Home Secretary draws a distinction between encouraging and glorifying on the one hand and explaining or understanding on the other. The last two, he says, would not be caught by the new offence, because they do not amount to encouraging, glorifying, praising or celebrating. In our view, the difficulty with the Home Secretary&#039;s response is that his distinction is not self-executing: the content of comments and remarks will have to be carefully analysed in each case, including the context in which they were spoken, and there will be enormous scope for disagreement between reasonable people as to whether a particular comment is merely an explanation or an expression of understanding or goes further and amounts to encouragement, praise or glorification&quot;.</p>

I would like to suggest that somebody who undoubtedly would be a member of the public would be a member of a jury invited to try a prosecution under this particular provision. They are not likely to take kindly to being told what it is likely that they should understand as indirectly encouraging the commission of a terrorist offence. Page 2 of the Bill states:

</p>

<a name="51205-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>That can be perfectly well avoided by heeding what has been said already this evening&#151;that this clause is quite unnecessary. Once you have encouragement of an offence, you do not need to go on to specify what should be done in the case of conduct that should be emulated by them in existing circumstances. Emulation is a result of encouragement. The purpose of encouraging is to bring about emulation, so it is quite unnecessary.

That has been the case for many years. It is well known that there are songs celebrating 1916 or, on the other hand, Orange domination. These things have never been prosecuted. We may all disapprove of them and think that they ought not to exist in an ideal world, but they are there. Surely, the Government are not going to upset what has been considered and accepted policy over a very long period of years.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>The dictionary gives a 1631 quotation from John Donne&#039;s poem:

<a name="51205-24_para11"></a>

<a name="51205-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>The primary offence of Clause 1(4) lies in its uncertainty. I doubt whether it passes the Article 7 test in the European Convention on Human Rights. An individual has a right, before he does something, to know whether what he is about to do is within or without the law. If you apply that principle to the text of subsection (4), it is impossible for somebody to predict, at the outset of the statement, whether at the end of making it he will or will not have committed an offence. The subsection is riddled with expressions that are vague and incapable of definition. Even when the Bill tries to define expressions, such as &quot;glorification&quot;, it obfuscates rather than clarifies.
</p>

<a name="51205-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>Clause 20(2) states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;&#039;glorification&#039; includes any form of praise or celebration, and cognate expressions are to be construed accordingly&quot;.</p>

<a name="51205-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>I should be most interested to hear an explanation of what that means if the noble Baroness feels so inclined.
</p>

<a name="51205-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>Having said that, I readily admit what I said earlier that, provided it is expressed much more narrowly and precisely, there may be a role for an offence of indirect encouragement. To that end we have tabled Amendment No. 111, which is by no means our final thinking on what a definition of &quot;indirect encouragement&quot; might be. It is a first attempt in Committee to try to find our way through the labyrinth. The amendment would be inserted at page 18, line 14, which would define &quot;indirect encouragement&quot; as a,

If we look at the terms with which we must now deal, we must look at the specific provisions. I made clear that the glorification of terrorist acts in such a way that others could reasonably take it as a direction to them to emulate those acts should be criminalised. We made that absolutely clear. The Government do not believe that it is acceptable that people&#151;we can all think of examples in the recent past&#151;should be allowed to make statements that glorify terrorism and, in so doing, make it more likely that their audience will commit acts of terrorism.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;The original version was in my view capable of drawing some odd results; the present version now concentrates in <i>sub clause (2)(a) </i>on statements designed to encourage emulation. What this means is that effectively the controversial idea of a separate offence simply of <i>glorifying </i>terrorism rightly has been dropped. A more specific state of mind is required of the putative offender. This is a sensible decision, consistent with the concerns I would have expressed about the original draft Bill shown to me. It was not workable in its original form.</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a>&quot;In my view this proposal in its revised form is a proportionate response to the real and present danger of young radically minded people being persuaded towards terrorism by apparently authoritative tracts wrapped in a religious or quasi-religious context.

The method adopted is one of inclusion, resolution, and a focus on trying to bring about long-lasting peace in that state. I do not believe that those acts in which this Government have participated in trying to achieve that would &quot;glorify&quot; in any sense. I do not intend to give way until I have finished the responses that I want to make. I will then do so since the joy of Committee is that we can endlessly discuss these issues.
</p>

<a name="51205-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>Perhaps I may remind noble Lords that simply condoning terrorism will not be sufficient to constitute a criminal offence. Neither will simply glorifying terrorism. Rather, to be criminal, the glorification must take place in such a way that the person can reasonably infer that the conduct being glorified is done so that such conduct should be emulated in existing circumstances. That &quot;should&quot; and &quot;existing circumstances&quot; are important; mere glorification of terrorism, reprehensible though we would all regard it, is not enough. The likely effect on the audience also has to come into play. We do not see how there can be real objections to that.
</p>

<a name="51205-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>A number of your Lordships, not least the noble and learned Lords Lord Mayhew and Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, rightly raised the issue of a jury, with juries being the final arbiters of fact&#151;and quite right too. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_495"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 495</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

When this matter comes to be determined, the good sense of a jury would have to be used to decide whether these offences were or were not made out.
</p>

<a name="51205-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>I also draw the attention of the Committee to Clauses 1(5) and 2(6) which make clear that in answering questions about how a statement is likely to be understood and what the public could reasonably infer, the court must have regard to the contents of the statement or publication as a whole and the circumstances of its publication. The test is not a quantitative one, but a qualitative one. The test is whether the surrounding material and context of the statement indicate that the whole statement does not have the effect that a mere extract, which may be objectionable, would have. So it is the context and the content which are important. I hope, therefore, that I can assuage the concerns of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow. Some of the examples given are simply not merited in terms of suggesting that these issues would be caught.
</p>

<a name="51205-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>We also reject any suggestion that the provisions on glorification are unnecessary. They serve as a useful guide to the courts on the conduct which Parliament is seeking to cover in this new legislation. Indeed, not only are they a useful guide to the courts, but if they were to be removed at this stage, the courts would be likely to interpret that removal as meaning that such conduct was not intended to be covered, thus significantly narrowing the offence. Very importantly, they also make it clear, including to the courts, that for the purposes of this offence, acts of terrorism that are glorified must be ones that can be emulated in existing circumstances.
</p>

<a name="51205-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>This form of guidance in legislation is not new. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 provides an analogy as it contains a description of the conduct involved in harassment. This was included to help clarify what was a new concept to the courts. The subsections relating to glorification in Clauses 1 and 2 are included for the same reason.

person to be quoted when giving his statement in Rome said that it had nothing to do with religious glorification, but more to do with the war in Iraq and other international matters. Do the Government have any evidence on encouragement in relation to glorification?
</p>




<p><a name="st_224"></a>
<a name="51205-26_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My noble friend will know that I am not entitled to rely on information in relation to any current cases because those issues may be <i>sub judice</i>, so I shall try to answer his question more generally than as it relates to the events of 7 July. It is clear from articles recovered from various incidents, such as videos and tapes, that they appear to have played a part in encouragement and indeed in the facilitation of those who would seek to perpetrate acts of terror. We cannot avoid that conclusion. Indeed, if one looks back over the evidence produced and the report prepared by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, and the other evidence brought before committees considering terrorism, we can see that the promulgation of these matters appears to have played a part&#151;and by no means an insignificant one&#151;in the way events then unfolded. We are faced with that not as a technicality or a possibility but as a real issue to be grappled with appropriately.
</p>

<a name="51205-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>I also refer to Clause 21 because the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, signalled his intention to oppose that clause, too. Organisations that glorify terrorism create a climate in which terrorism is seen not just as acceptable but as something to be emulated. This is clearly something we would seek to prevent and that is the purpose of Clause 21. It is important to note that the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, in his independent report on the proposed legislation said of this clause that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a>&quot;extending the list to include the organisations envisaged in the clause is a proportionate limitation on the freedom of association in relation to the greater public good&quot; .</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>The Government&#039;s position is clear: if an individual can be prosecuted for making statements that glorify terrorist acts, which others could reasonably infer as encouraging emulation of those acts, then organisations ought to &quot;walk the line,&quot; too. What is sauce for the goose, we say in this instance, should also be sauce for the gander.
</p>

<a name="51205-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>We believe that a strong case exists for the creation of these offences and that there is a clear case to include them. We do not believe, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, contends, that it introduces uncertainty; nor do we believe that the Article 7 test is not met. We believe, that by virtue of strengthening the Bill in this way&#151;and I thank my noble friend Lord Judd for his comment about being &quot;greatly comforted&quot; by that&#151;we have dealt with the whole issue of intent by introducing the question of specific intent and subjective recklessness. Those two factors mean that the glorification offence has to be dealt with within that context. In terms of proof, it is clear that that offence is much stronger than it would otherwise be.
</p>

<a name="51205-26_para3"></a>

species of encouragement is unnecessary; it could simply be expunged. I have already identified the reason why we say &quot;no&quot; to this: it a manifesto commitment and, just as importantly, it is an exemplar of how the power should be used. It makes it clear that it should be used to deal with specific current matters that are not retrospective, so the worries about Robin Hood and all those other merry men that have been trailed out need not concern us at all. I understand that this issue has caused concern, but we believe that there is sufficient merit to allow it to continue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_225"></a>
<a name="51205-26_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I want to follow up the suggestion that it is not retrospective. Clearly it is not retrospective in that you cannot prosecute somebody for past glorification. However, surely if somebody chooses, after the Bill has come into effect, to glorify something that happened before the Bill came into effect, that could still be glorification, leading to prosecution under the Act.

I am more than happy to sit down, but if I can just finish one sentence after the other it does help me enormously. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said that the inclusion of &quot;glorification&quot; is unnecessary because it does not add anything to &quot;encouragement&quot;. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, said that we should not have it because it is an unwarranted restriction on freedom of speech. We cannot have both. We say that it is necessary; that it adds something and that it deals with a mischief. It is now proportionate, not least because we have made &quot;intention&quot; such a tough provision with which to deal as a result of our agreement with Clause 9.

<a name="51205-26_spnew10"></a><b> The Earl of Onslow: </b>   If someone is in rebellion and you say, &quot;Remember what the Spaniards did in 1814 and remember what the Afghans did&quot;, you are then glorifying terrorism to encourage someone else to behave in a similar fashion against oppressors.

</p>




<p><a name="st_230"></a>
<a name="51205-26_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   It certainly is a fact that the IRA was influenced by the events of 1797 and Wolfe Tone and people of that nature.

<a name="51205-26_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </b>   I invite the Minister&#151;who has been courtesy itself&#151;to reflect on a point she made a few moments ago.

<a name="column_498"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 498</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that glorification was not something caught by &quot;encouragement&quot;. That cannot be right. The courts would look at this debate, for example, and would see how the argument had gone&#151;and it certainly would not sustain that interpretation. I thought the Minister recognised that a moment or two ago when she said that it was in there to be an exemplar of what was encouraging behaviour; that it cannot be both ways. On the contrary, I think the courts would glorify&#151;to coin a phrase&#151;the noble Baroness for relieving them of a totally unnecessary complexity.
</p>




<p><a name="st_232"></a>
<a name="51205-26_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I hear what the noble and learned Lord says in relation to that. I am confident that there are no circumstances when it is likely that I will be glorified. I have a very clear appreciation of my own ability. If I did not have it before today, I shall certainly have it afterwards.
</p>

<a name="51205-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>The issue for the courts will always be one of how they interpret these provisions. I wish I could be as sanguine as the noble and learned Lord that the courts spend as much time, on a <i>Pepper </i>v <i>Hart</i> basis, looking at our debates as some of us would perhaps wish. The courts have also had a tendency to say, &quot;We will look at the Bill and the terms contained within it. Although <i>Hansard</i> may assist us, the debates in the House are of such interesting quality that one can almost subtract from it anything one wishes about where the balance was at the end of the day&quot;.
</p>

<a name="51205-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>This is a very clear opportunity to give the courts examples of things which specifically should be caught. I have already explained why that is important. A specific, identified mischief needed to be addressed and the subsection addresses it. It is not otiose; it does not detract from the provisions in Clause 1(1) or Clause 2 in relation to intent and it is not in conflict with anything therein and would be helpful. This commitment was made as part of our manifesto and we intend to honour it. I have no need to remind your Lordships that this provision met with assent in the other place, in such a way as to suggest that it would doubtless meet with assent again.

I certainly agree with those who say it is much too vague to form the basis of a criminal offence in our law. Above all, it is a restriction on freedom of speech, which is not justified in the circumstances. It is not a proportional response and it is therefore not necessary in a democratic society. It will, in due course&#151;inevitably, in my view&#151;be held to be contrary to Article 10 of the convention. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_238"></a>The noble Lord said: In speaking to Amendment No. 20, I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 41 and 42 as well.
</p>

<a name="51205-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>All three amendments refer to special defences where certain conditions are imposed. They are cumulative, in the sense that each of several conditions has to be satisfied to obtain the benefit of the defence. The provisions are Clauses 1(7) and 2(8) and (9). The position on these has been altered by the Government&#039;s statement that they intend to remove paragraphs (a) from Clauses 1(7) and 2(9). This paragraph limits the availability of the defences to cases against Internet providers.
</p>

<a name="51205-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>Clause 1(7) will therefore now require the satisfaction of both the remaining paragraphs. Paragraph (b) requires that the statement neither expresses the views of the defendant nor has his endorsement, while paragraph (c) requires that it is clear that it does not express his views and have his endorsement. It is not clear to me why both paragraphs are needed, since they seem to say much the same thing. Perhaps the Minister can explain.
</p>

<a name="51205-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>Under the Government&#039;s concession on objective recklessness, the prosecution must prove that the defendant had the necessary intention or subjective recklessness. It would be inconsistent with that concession to require the defendant to prove that the statement did not express his views, since it is up to the prosecution to prove that it did. Paragraph (b) should therefore go. By the same reasoning, paragraph (c) should also go. If the prosecution fails to prove intent or recklessness, it is surely not open to it to say, &quot;We can still convict you because you did not make it clear that the statement did not reflect your views&quot;.
</p>

<a name="51205-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>The logical conclusion of both concessions, taken together, is that Clause 1(7) is inconsistent with them and must go in its entirety. That reasoning does not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_500"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 500</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

apply to the subsections of Clause 2, since the Government have not so far accepted the need to introduce an intention test into Clause 2.
</p>

<a name="51205-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>Clause 2(8) requires three conditions to be fulfilled for the defence to be available: that the defendant has not examined the publication; that he had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that it was a terrorist publication; and that objectionable parts of the statement did not have his &quot;endorsement&quot;. The only one of these that matters is the second condition. Given that whether the publication is a terrorist publication depends, at least in part, on the context, it is clearly possible that the defendant could have examined the document and still have no reasonable grounds for suspecting that it was a terrorist publication. If the defendant had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that it was a terrorist publication then it seems to me to be wholly irrelevant whether or not he endorsed any part of it. Here, the second is the only test that needs to be satisfied and the other two, in paragraphs (a) and (c), should be removed.
</p>

<a name="51205-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>Later amendments will press for the inclusion of an intention test for offences under Clause 2, and if those are incorporated into the Bill, then subsections (8) and (9) of Clause 2 will become otiose. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_239"></a>
<a name="51205-27_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I am going to disappoint the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, because we do not believe that Clause 1(7) or Clause 2(9) are incompatible with the amendments that we have agreed to&#151;Amendment No. 9 in relation to Clause&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_240"></a>
<a name="51205-27_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I did not say that of Clause 2(9); I was referring only to Clause 1(7).
</p>




<p><a name="st_241"></a>
<a name="51205-27_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I will then restrict my comments to Clause 1(7). We do not think that those two are incompatible and I shall make it plain that we make the concession in relation to the subjective test predicated on the removal of Clause 1(7)(a) but the retention of subsections (b) and (c) as a defence. And for the purposes of clarity, before I move to the substance of the comments I will make on Clause 2(9), it might assist the House if I indicate, as has already been accepted by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that we would remove subsection (9)(a). But then if we look logically&#151;we do not have the draft, so I am trying to assist on the basis for debate&#151;we would have to add an &quot;and&quot; after paragraph (b) and then the &quot;and&quot; that appears at the end of paragraph (c) would become &quot;or&quot;. So, it would read (b) &quot;and&quot; (c) &quot;or&quot; (d). I say that at this stage so that as I am dealing with the other comments, noble Lords may wish to bear that in mind.
</p>

<a name="51205-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Let us come back to the defence that we now propose in Clause 1(7). We do not believe that Amendment No. 20 would be useful, for the following reasons. If the limbs were alternatives, it would be possible for defendants to take advantage of the alternatives to disguise their real aims or beliefs. Given the relatively low standards of proof involved in demonstrating a defence it might be possible for defendants to show that they did not endorse the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_501"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column 501</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

statement in question, for example by calling friends up to confirm the point even though it was clear in the circumstances that prevailed that they did. This would render the offence ineffective.
</p>

<a name="51205-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>Exactly the same point arises in the context of Amendment No. 42, which seeks to make a corresponding change to Clause 2(9). As I have indicated, we are happy to remove the first limb of the offence but it will be important that the remaining limbs continue to be governed by &quot;and&quot;. Otherwise, we could again have the situation where a person seeks to show that the publication which he distributed does not reflect his views when it is quite apparent because of the circumstances of the case that that is not true.
</p>

<a name="51205-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>Unfortunately, we cannot accept Amendment No. 41 either, because it concerns the defence in Clause 2(8), which has no parallel in Clause 1. Perhaps I may explain why it is important that all three limbs of Clause 2(8) are retained. It should be demonstrated for us to understand the validity of the defence. If the word on line 9 on page 4 is &quot;or&quot; rather than &quot;and&quot;, it would be possible for a defendant to say that he had reasonable grounds for suspecting that it was a terrorist publication and that he endorsed it, but that he had deliberately not bothered to examine it. For this reason, &quot;and&quot; must be retained in line 9 on page 4.
</p>

<a name="51205-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>However, I can assure your Lordships further on this point. I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and others were concerned because they envisaged librarians being unable to avail themselves of this defence if they had examined the publication, suspected that it might be a terrorist publication, did not endorse it, but nevertheless felt obliged because of their professional duties to disseminate it. They are quite right that such persons would not be able to use this defence. But such persons would be able to use the defence in Clause 2(9) when it is expanded on Report in the way that I have set out. For this reason, Amendment No. 41 is not necessary. I can see why it is proposed now, but once we amend the Bill as I have outlined, it will be so.
</p>

<a name="51205-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>Those who would not be able to avail themselves of the revised defence in Clause 2(9) should not be able to use the defence in Clause 2(8) if it is not available to them in its current form. Therefore, I hope that the noble Lord will be satisfied that I have explained why we need to retain Clause 1(7) and why the proposed amendments to Clause 2(9) will meet the concerns that have been raised in relation to it in a way that noble Lords will feel is appropriate.

first, whether the document has been examined and, secondly, whether it has been suspected&#151;in other words, whether it has been examined, had views expressed about it and been endorsed&#151;it is exceedingly difficult to meet all three requirements together for the reasons that we advanced earlier. A great deal therefore depends on the burden that the Government&#039;s concession can carry, particularly in relation to librarians and academics. It may be, as the Minister explained to us earlier, that it will go sufficiently far, but will she indicate whether there are, in a sense, professional obligations on particular individuals that effectively would allow them to advance the defence under the extended subsection (9) in a way that would make that defence more likely to be viable than it is without that government amendment?
</p>

<a name="51205-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>The Minister will appreciate that one of the difficulties of the Committee is to weigh the precise substance of those proposals without the wording before us. Since she is obviously going to go away to consider that wording, will she bear in mind the possibility of some phrase about the obligations that rest on certain professions? The noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, and others talked about the special problems facing deposit libraries. Those problems really are acute and librarians face them with a straight conflict of legal obligations which, as the Bill stood, were almost impossible to resolve. The Government&#039;s concessions may enable them to be resolved, but as things stand and without seeing that new wording, it is quite difficult for me to see how they can be.

<p><a name="st_243"></a>
<a name="51205-28_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Eatwell: </b>   I endorse what the noble Baroness has just said. May I ask a question of my noble friend, which she might wish to reflect on when redrafting Clause 2(9) to bring it before us? It is difficult to discuss the redraft, because we do not really know what it will look like. Clause 2(9)(d) is drafted in such a way that, with respect to the offence of providing information of assistance in the commission of acts, the conduct in relation to the publication was not intended by the person to provide or make available assistance. However, that is not so with respect to the issue of direct or indirect encouragement, and I would like the Minister to reflect on whether Clause 2(9)(b) should be drafted in the same form as 2(9)(d), so that it reads something like:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a>&quot;that the conduct in relation to that publication, so far as it contained matter by reference to which it was a terrorist publication by virtue of subsection (2)(b), was not intended by him to provide direct or indirect encouragement&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>and so on.
</p>

<a name="51205-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>There is a puzzle here. Why does providing assistance require a demonstration of intent, but encouragement does not? I know that we will discuss this at a later time, but since the clause is being prayed in aid of the Minister&#039;s rejection of the amendment in respect of subsection 2(8), perhaps she would consider that question when drafting the new clause.
</p>




<p><a name="st_244"></a>
<a name="51205-28_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I should start by apologising to the Minister for the fact that, as a result of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

announcement at an early stage of today&#039;s debate of the concessions by the Government, my speech on the amendments went beyond the scope of the amendments. We are now in somewhat different territory here. Having said that, I remain of the opinion that Clause 1(7) is now entirely otiose and should simply go.

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>Clause 1 [<i>Aerodrome charges: noise and emissions</i>]:
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="51205-28_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield </b>   moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 1, line 7, after &quot;below,&quot; insert &quot;and having ensured that sufficient notice has been given prior to the introduction of the proposed charges,&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>The noble Lord said: I have a rather bad throat, so I hope that it will last out. It is a pleasure to be before the Committee and the Minister once again to discuss this important legislation. Although an earlier form of the Bill was discussed in another place, we now have a valuable opportunity to scrutinise this Bill at some length and to improve it wherever possible.
</p>

<a name="51205-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>These amendments attempt to probe the Government on the provisions outlined in Clause 1, which empower aerodrome authorities, should they so choose, to fix their charges by reference to noise and the atmospheric pollution produced by aircraft emissions. As I understand the clause, the powers are designed to encourage airlines to produce lower emissions and adopt quieter aircraft technologies. At face value, my amendment would seem self-explanatory: it is designed to ensure that sufficient notice is given prior to the introduction of the proposed charges. I am sure that noble Lords will agree that it is only reasonable that airline companies are properly consulted and informed prior to the introduction of any such charging regime. However, it masks a broader purpose&#151;the amendment is also intended to probe the Minister on the failure of the Bill to provide a coherent environmental policy for civil aviation.
</p>

<a name="51205-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>We welcome the concept of charging with reference to noise and emissions, but the Bill fails to fully realise the potential. It provides no compulsion for all airports to fix their charges with reference to noise and emissions. Instead, the provision is reliant on aerodrome authorities voluntarily incorporating the provisions into the determination of their charging scheme. Unless all airports are compelled to levy <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC54"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC54</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

charges with reference to noise and emissions, not only do we run the risk of losing out on the environmental improvements that they offer but we risk creating an unfair playing field for the aviation industry, whereby those that choose not to incorporate those imperatives into their charges could potentially compete for airlines at an advantage over those that had done so.
</p>

<a name="51205-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>Another important consideration is the methodology to be used for measuring and monitoring noise and emissions. Simply put, you cannot charge with reference to noise and emissions without a clear methodology for their measurement. If the Government intend for there to be charges made with reference to levels of noise and emissions, they must make it clear what those levels are and how they are to be measured. Furthermore, I am concerned by the absence of a requirement in the Bill for aerodrome authorities to monitor and report on emissions and noise. It would seem grossly unfair for airline operators to be charged with reference to the noise and emissions that their aircraft produce without knowing either the measurement or the criteria for the charges. Without that requirement, the provisions lack any method for determining the environmental impact&#151;good or otherwise&#151;of introducing those measures into aerodrome charges. Unless measurements are made and evidence of noise and emissions published, we will not have the necessary facts at our disposal to evaluate the effectiveness of charging with reference to noise and emissions.
</p>

<a name="51205-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>Amendment No. 2 addresses those problems. It requires that any aerodrome authorities that make charges under Clause 1(1), for the purposes of subsection (2) will be required to monitor noise and emissions and publish those findings annually. The amendment introduces a much-needed element of transparency that is neither unreasonable nor unnecessarily burdensome, especially since, as the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh, indicated at Second Reading, some airports already monitor noise and air quality. Therefore it would seem no great inconvenience to compel those airports that base their charges on noise and emissions to publish those measurements annually. Moreover, with such information in hand, the next logical step would be to use it to determine what levels of emissions and noise can be expected in the following 12-month period. That is the essence of paragraph (b) of the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51205-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>In addition, several major airlines have expressed reasonable concerns that the Bill provides no opportunity for airline operators to challenge what an airport might do other than through the normal commercial process of taking their business away, which may not be an option to them. Subsection (3) remedies that problem by providing airlines with recourse for appeal to the Secretary of State against the imposition of charges by the aerodrome authority. Like Amendment No. 1, it recognises the need to make airlines partners in our environmental desires.
</p>

<a name="51205-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>I recognise and applaud the environmental concerns that underpin Clause 1. The idea that landing charges be determined with reference to noise and emissions for the purpose of mitigation is very good. However, in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC55"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC55</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

its present form, the Bill is incapable of fulfilling those good intentions. These amendments highlight those problems and provide a number of reasonable ways to improve and enhance the Bill. I beg to move.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51205-29.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="51205-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   My name is not attached to this group of amendments but they go to the heart of what the Bill is about: aircraft noise shall be limited and, we hope, on a basis where each year it decreases. That is very hard for airlines to achieve because, until regulations prescribe noise and emissions limits, aircraft manufacturers will not take the necessary steps to reduce noise and emissions. We have to take the car industry as our mirror: it was not until tighter regulations for car manufacturers in the EU were agreed that higher standards for emissions, noise and other accident prevention measures were agreed.
</p>

<a name="51205-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>It is also important to think about the Government&#039;s intention on whether noise limits shall be at the airport operator&#039;s discretion. In our view, every airport should come under noise regulations. It should not be for an individual airport to determine whether it will measure noise. Noise has to be measured, because some airports are virtually owned by operators and other airports have great interests in attracting operators and might try to do so by having a more permissive regime for aircraft.
</p>

<a name="51205-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The third issue is who should do the monitoring. The Bill says that the airport authority should do it. One must ask how independent a standard of monitoring the airport operator could be expected to maintain. If the airport is seeking to expand its facilities or the number of flights, it will have an interest in not producing figures that show it in a poor light.
</p>

<a name="51205-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>We will come later to the question of how noise is to be measured. That is a difficult subject that I will try to present to the Committee in a sympathetic way that can easily be understood&#151;the briefs almost go beyond my comprehension&#151;by people who are very well qualified in this field. Clause 1 raises significant issues, and as the opposition we will study the Minister&#039;s answers with interest. The fundamental question is whether the Bill is about reducing noise and nuisance from aircraft, which afflict the lives of many, or whether it just legitimises the present procedure, which many regard as unsatisfactory?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="51205-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   The noble Lords, Lord Hanningfield and Lord Bradshaw, have raised useful points which I hope my noble friend will answer. His reply will be awaited with great anxiety.
</p>

<a name="51205-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>Amendment No. 7 underlines certain points to which there is no reference&#151;my noble friend may say that they are implied. First, specifically, paragraph (a) refers to the,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;economic, social and wider environmental interests [and] . . . international standards and agreements&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>which are two separate things. It is incumbent on my noble friend to postulate clearly whether those factors are taken into account in coming to any decision. It is vital that economic, social and environmental interests <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC56"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC56</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

should be taken into account, but how is that possible? How will it be done? What is the shape of the relevant considerations which the airport authorities will take? How will they measure up to the &quot;international standards and agreements&quot; which cover those issues?
</p>

<a name="51205-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>The second point is relevant not only for this, but also for other considerations in the Bill. We talk about a committee, but it does not involve only airlines. The local community is highly relevant as well. If my noble friend goes along with this thinking, it is his duty to underline how the committee should be comprised. It is enormously important that the local community should agree with what is put forward by the airports, but they are not the only consideration. It should not be taken for granted.
</p>

<a name="51205-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>Thirdly, sufficient notice should be given before the proposed judges are introduced. That may be the subject of regulations or of a communication. I do not know. Unless we have some direction from my noble friend on the Front Bench, it is impossible that the proposed charges have to be considered and then introduced by the operators. Again, I do not think that it is possible to take that for granted. Therefore, for all those reasons, I have tabled Amendment No. 7.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="51205-29_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Soley: </b>   I declare an interest as campaign director of Future Heathrow. I want to draw attention to Amendment No. 2, which relates to Clause 1. There is a missed opportunity here, which fits with the general thrust of the Bill and some of the amendments. I accept, as I think that most people do, that aircraft noise is a problem. We all know that emissions are a problem and that aircraft and engine manufacturers and airport operators are very conscious of that and try to bear down on aircraft noise and aircraft emissions. That is wholly good and I support it entirely.
</p>

<a name="51205-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a> It troubles me that here we have left out an opportunity to do something about ground operations. I would like the Minister to consider introducing a new part to Clause 1 to require airport operators to report, perhaps annually, on their progress either towards reaching carbon neutrality on ground emissions or at least giving a more detailed report on what they are doing to improve ground emissions generally. I refer primarily to air quality emissions rather than noise.
<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="51205-29_time0"></a><h5>3.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="51205-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>The key issue is that, as we know very well, there has been a massive increase in air transport. Many more people than ever before now want to fly. The number will continue to rise, and it will rise even faster in developing nations, so we have to bear down on emissions and on noise.
</p>

<a name="51205-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>However, if we are to win the argument generally with the public, it is right that they should ask us what else we are doing to deal with the general problem of pollution and global warming. One thing that attracted me to this option is that ground operations contribute an awful lot to the emissions problem, and we could do many things to deal with that over a fairly <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC57"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC57</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

short period. For example, we could introduce bio-diesel in many of the ground-operating vehicles; we should certainly discourage the taxiing of aircraft by the use of their engines rather than being towed; and all our new buildings should be designed on a carbon-neutral basis. It rather saddened me that at Terminal 5 the opportunity to do just that was lost.
</p>

<a name="51205-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>This country has an impressive lead in some of the technology associated with this matter, as I have mentioned on previous occasions. Arup, the big construction company, has just won the contract in China to build a city for 1 million people&#151;the first city designed to be carbon-neutral. If we can do that for a city of 1 million people, at the very least we should be looking at getting our airport ground operations down to carbon neutrality over a reasonable period.
</p>

<a name="51205-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>When I raised that in a speech to the Airport Operators Association conference a few weeks ago in Bournemouth, I was pleased with the response. Some people thought that it would just not be possible in the foreseeable future but a larger number thought that it would, and there was significant debate among those I spoke to about how long it would take. Some thought that it could be done in 10 years. I am not sure that all airports could meet that standard&#151;it would be a lot to ask of some of them&#151;and I recognise that it would be difficult to raise the investment required in some of the older buildings.
</p>

<a name="51205-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>However, I say to the Minister that, in conveying to the public and to the industry that we are trying to bear down on emissions and pollution generally and that we are not just allowing aircraft travel to expand without any consequences, the least we should do is to indicate that we are looking not only at aircraft noise and emissions but also at ground emissions. There is a hole in the Bill in that respect. The Bill does deal with the airport operators, and Clause 1 and Amendment No. 2 are relevant to that because they both cover the emissions problem.
</p>

<a name="51205-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>I know that the Minister takes climate change and emissions seriously. Will he consider whether at the very least we could request all airport operators to report on the effect of reducing carbon emissions in ground operations&#151;that is, non-aircraft operations on the ground&#151;and to look at other effects of air pollution on airports themselves? It is an important issue. I do not think that members of the Airport Operators Association will be lined up against it. There will be a division of opinion and there might be an argument about whether it should be legislated for or whether it should be done voluntarily. But it must be done and it must become a much more important part of the dialogue than it has been so far. It will be easier to deal with this issue quickly compared with some of the other changes that we are looking for in aircraft and engine design.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="51205-29_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   Should there not be some sort of consultation on the important issue that my noble friend raises?

<a name="column_GC58"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC58</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Association was quite interesting in its own right. I invited the association to consider approaching the Minister, or myself, with a suggested amendment. It is true that I have not had one yet, but that may not be surprising given that the association met only four or five weeks ago. However, we cannot ignore the central issue, which is that air transport will dramatically increase. That has environmental consequences, and to ignore that is perverse in the extreme. I know that the Minister and the Government do not want to ignore it; what I am proposing is a small but very important way in which to bear down on those pollution effects.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51205-30.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="51205-30_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall: </b>   Will my noble friend take note in his reply of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, on measuring emissions and noise? I would make the point&#151;which is to some extent an anecdotal point&#151;that the aircraft most annoying to those on the ground tend to be the older ones. One effect of introducing a more effective measure of noise and pollution would be that, with a bit of luck, it would accelerate the process of retiring older aircraft, just as over time there was a significant reduction in the number of vehicles on the road that were older and more likely to add disproportionately to pollution.
</p>

<a name="51205-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>The economic impact of that on airlines is likely to be quite considerable, and for many of them&#151;particularly those that are not at the glamorous end of the market and are transporting not people but things&#151;the continuing use of older aircraft is of considerable benefit to them economically. But if the Government are going to make a major plank of their argument about noise and pollution the point that aircraft technology is changing and that improvements in how aircraft are built are constantly being brought on line in the way in which aircraft are built, so that they can be less polluting, we must pay attention to the fact that there are still in service many aircraft that do not meet those standards.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="51205-30_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   I declare an interest as president of the Aviation Environment Federation. I like my noble friend&#039;s idea of including ground emissions in the first clause, but I wonder whether that could be related in some way to the emissions caused by the large proportion of cars bringing people and workers to the airport. That is part of the debate that we have regularly in transport Bills about what proportion of the workforce and passengers come by private car, and how they can be discouraged from doing so and encouraged to use public transport instead. The case of Heathrow Terminal 5 is a classic example of failure to provide better transport in that regard&#151;which could have been done with a public inquiry. But that is another story.
</p>

<a name="51205-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Perhaps we had better keep away from the debate about airlines not paying any duty or tax on their fuel, as that will come under a different amendment. But I worry about the issues around Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 and agree with what other Members of the Committee have said about them. The Government produced a White Paper saying that they <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC59"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC59</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

would predict and provide for whatever demand for air travel or transport there might be in future; then they said that they could not possibly make any change to the arrangements for duty or tax on fuel because it would be political suicide. So I worry about a situation in which airports and airlines are all as one in trying to get as many punters as possible to use their facilities.
</p>

<a name="51205-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>The need for an independent arrangement for monitoring emissions and noise is absolutely fundamental. I do not know who it would be yet, but there is a fundamental need for someone independent to ensure that we do not end up with some sort of happy family, with everyone saying, &quot;Yes, let&#039;s have as many passengers as possible and adjust the figures so that they&#039;re as good as possible, and keep the costs down and so on&quot;. It is interesting that there is provision in Amendment No. 1 for an airline to appeal to a Secretary of State, but I do not see anywhere in the proposals the ability of local authorities or local people to appeal to him. I know that that is not quite relevant&#151;but that seems to encourage the bulldozing of a policy, which will end in tears before long. I support the measures in Amendment No. 6 on monitoring emissions and publishing figures and, in Amendment No. 7, in the name of my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis, the measure to take account of,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;economic, social and wider environmental interests&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="51205-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Finally, it is fine monitoring these things but who will enforce them if things go wrong? I do not see that, but maybe I have missed something. Enforcement by someone who is not in this happy family of wanting to &quot;grow&quot; everything is essential if these clauses are to have any credibility at all.

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>I regard the main thrust behind Amendment No. 1 as a concern on the part of the airline industry that it may be faced with unfair charges. New section 38 reflects the existing Section 38 of the 1982 Act, which gives airport operators the power to fix their charges by reference to aircraft noise; there is no provision requiring a notice period before such <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC60"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC60</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

charges are introduced. Though the power has been available since 1982&#151;so we have had two decades&#039; experience of it&#151;and is used by many airports, there does not appear to have been a case in which airlines have raised a grievance about the introduction of noise-related charges.
</p>

<a name="51205-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>It is surely unlikely in practice that an airport would seek to alienate its customers&#151;that is who the airlines are&#151;by introducing new charges using its powers under the revised Section 38, whether related to aircraft noise or to their emissions, without giving reasonable notice. Airport managers will need to balance that need to give reasonable notice to aircraft operators with the entirely legitimate expectations&#151;already voiced in the Committee&#151;of those living around the airport that measures aimed at reducing noise and local emissions from aircraft will be introduced without undue delay. Any period of notice would inevitably need to reflect the complexity of the arrangements being introduced.
</p>

<a name="51205-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>We do not believe it is necessary to introduce a statutory requirement for airports to give notice of charging regimes made under Section 38, not least because the remedy of legal challenge would, of course, be open to any airline. In any case, the airport concerned would be in most grievous danger of alienating key customers. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, made an extremely important point, which I think was followed up by my noble friend Lady McIntosh, on clear charging and the measurement of noise. I do not underestimate the general interest of either the noble Lord or the noble Baroness but I would be extremely limited if I did not recognise that certainly the noble Baroness has a particular interest with regard to Stansted.

<a name="51205-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted already charge with reference to the certificated noise of aircraft, which is measured using internationally recognised ICAO procedures. The answer to both noble Lords, particularly my noble friend, is that those who use antiquated&#151;the noble Baroness may have used that word but perhaps I am exaggerating to make my point&#151;aircraft may be guilty of greater emissions and noise than users of more modern aircraft. An important aspect of the Government&#039;s case is that aircraft noise and emissions are improving and we need to retain flexibility in primary legislation because the situation is changing rapidly. It would be an awful problem if we were trapped with primary legislation that inhibited us from taking full recognition of rapid technological changes in aircraft.
</p>

<a name="51205-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>As those are measured, once we have clear indications of what aircraft are permitted to do, under that rubric the number of noisy or more polluting aircraft that can come in will be reduced or the act will have to be cleaned up by withdrawing those aircraft. That structure is already in place. We do not want to include the measurement of noise in the Bill. I recognise the strength of feeling that the amendment would satisfy those most concerned about noise and <br>&nbsp;<br>

emissions, but we are all concerned about it&#151;we would not be serving our cause well if we did not recognise aircraft&#039;s contribution to noise and emissions. It is why we are looking at their contribution to emissions on an international basis.
</p>

<a name="51205-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The danger of inserting such measurements into primary legislation is that we would be trapped in time against a background of rapidly changing technology. We do not want that. We want the Bill to be future-proof in those terms, so that it makes due provision for regulation and we know how the measurements will be taken. If there was a decision to tighten up the position as time went on or if the number of aircraft movements or the emissions from any one aircraft changed because of new technology, no Government could afford to be trapped with primary legislation that gave them less flexibility to improve the situation.

<a name="51205-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   The Minister said that Gatwick, Stansted and Heathrow were designated airports and that that is as far as it goes. Is it possible that the aircraft expelled from those airports would be sent to Luton or Coventry, annoying the people there? Those living around those two airports, or anywhere else for that matter, should not be treated to the cast-offs from the airports that the Minister mentioned.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="51205-31_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   Further to the Minister&#039;s remarks, none of our amendments would result in very prescriptive primary legislation. The objective is to make more information available and to have a better regime of monitoring emissions and noise. I accept that technology moves on but our amendments are designed to ensure that there is more information and monitoring.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="51205-31_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The danger is in the definition. We have a regime in place, which, as we indicated, we think will work well. We do not see that attempts to tighten up the legislation in these terms do anything towards the general objective. Potentially they will restrict us. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, says about other airports. The line has to be drawn somewhere and I would have thought that the line should be drawn exactly where the Government draw it; namely, we have three designated airports where we operate one regime, but with regard to other airports, which have had a good record in the past, it is all about local decision-making. Local authorities have the framework under which they can evaluate the situation and, if there were grotesque abuse of the situation, if we had a situation where a vast transfer was occurring and causing enormous troubles locally, there is no doubt that the first people to tell us would be the local authorities in the vicinity. The noble Lord is asking me to expand beyond the three, without any definition of where that might go. We would get ourselves into an absurd position&#151;

legislation. Does he have in mind any secondary legislation that will affect the issue that we are discussing at the moment?

<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="51205-31_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   If my noble friend exercises a little patience, he will see that I have, as yet, given only a very small fraction of the response I need to give to cover some of the fundamental propositions made. I want to turn to the point that he raised about where local authorities fit into the position. These amendments point up that dimension as well. If he will exercise a little patience I shall do my best to respond to him, and if I do not, I am sure that he will make that point again.
</p>

<a name="51205-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Amendment No. 6 requires airports making charges under Section 38 to publish details of those charges. However, details of an aerodrome&#039;s charging schemes will already be available as part of its conditions of use. The British Airports Authority runs the designated airports, and conditions of use are publicly available on the Internet. Similarly, Manchester is an example of an airport that is not so designated but which also does exactly the same. We do not believe it is necessary to make that requirement statutory. If we have in place procedures that work, there cannot be a strong argument for translating into statute that which already serves the nation well.
</p>

<a name="51205-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>Amendments Nos. 2 and 6 would give airlines the right of appeal to the Secretary of State against charges made by airports in the exercise of their powers under Section 38. I am not persuaded that there is any need to place in the Bill a right of appeal to the Secretary of State. The industry has not called for that before. Should it appear to the Secretary of State that an airport is not making appropriate use of its powers under Section 38, new subsection (4) of Section 38 allows the Secretary of State to direct an aerodrome authority to fix its charges in exercising the powers in Section 38(1). That direction may cover the manner in which the charges are to be fixed. That power has already been placed in the 1982 Act, and no Secretary of State has ever felt the necessity to use it. It does not appear that we need it in this Bill governing the industry.
</p>

<a name="51205-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The Government do not believe that they should have a new appellate role in disputes between an airport operator and an airline over airport charges fixed using the powers in Section 38. Again, the remedy of legal challenge would be open to the airline; this is the approach that we are taking in Clause 6, which removes the Secretary of State&#039;s current appellate role in route-licensing cases.
</p>

<a name="51205-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Amendments Nos. 2 and 6 would also require airports making charges using the powers in new Section 38 of the 1982 Act to monitor their emissions and noise levels, publish the figures annually, and also publish their plans to reduce noise and pollution. We do not believe that these reporting requirements need to be statutory. While we believe that charges schemes have a valuable role to play, they are by no means the only influencing factor on noise and emissions from aircraft.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC63"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC63</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51205-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>Larger airports that are more likely to take up the powers in new Section 38 will already have been designated under Section 35 of the 1982 Act, and have consultative arrangements in place. We are confident that reporting on noise and emissions monitoring will take place through those arrangements. As regards noise, the largest airports are covered by the Aerodromes (Noise Restrictions) (Rules and Procedures) Regulations 2003, which implement the European directive on noise-related operating restrictions.
</p>

<a name="51205-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>Where operating restrictions are proposed, these regulations oblige the airport operator, or the Secretary of State in the case of the three designated airports, to take into account a range of information. That includes a description of measures already planned to lessen noise impact over the period that new restrictions would cover and forecast noise contours, including an assessment of the number of people likely to be affected by aircraft noise. The airport operator, or the Secretary of State, is also required to establish and publish an environmental objective for the airport concerned before making any noise-related operating restrictions. That covers the anxiety that clear information should be necessary for the noise imprint and that the problems must be defined in such a way that all interested parties can respond when a situation develops.
</p>

<a name="51205-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>The amendments would also require aerodrome authorities to say what actions they intend to take to reduce noise and pollution levels. That would overlap with the existing requirements on airport operators that I have just mentioned as far as operating restrictions governing noise are concerned. In the case of an expanding airport, charging and other measures to reduce noise and emissions will, of course, have to be set against the impact of any increase in movements consequent on expansion.
</p>

<a name="51205-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>Larger airports and other airports whose noise has an impact on certain urban areas will be subject to the requirements of the environmental noise directive to which I referred, and will need to carry out noise mapping and then draw up action plans for managing those noise levels. The first noise maps under the directive will need to be completed by June 2007, and the first action plans will need to be completed by April 2008. It is clear that the anxieties being expressed in this Committee are being addressed and are either covered by existing legislation or by European directives that require us to make a response.
</p>

<a name="51205-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has spoken of the Opposition&#039;s wish to see a coherent policy to deal with the environmental impacts of aviation. He made that important point at Second Reading. We share his objective but think we have the constituent parts in place. They were stated in the White Paper <i>The Future of Air Transport</i> and are expressed through international agreement, European legislation, some of which I have referred to, domestic policy and secondary legislation, as well as through this Bill and the Civil Aviation Act that it amends.

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>I understand what the noble Lord seeks to identify&#151;growing anxieties about noise and emissions and the growing need to effect proper controls, but I maintain that this is an area in which policy can move very quickly and we would be restricted if the amendments were made to the Bill. We would not be saying no to the amendments, and I would not be asking him to withdraw them, if they advanced the cause to which we all subscribe: the necessity for coherent policy in this area. But the amendments only rigidify the situation and potentially leave any future government disadvantaged in tackling this rapidly changing problem. Who in this Committee does not recognise that the demands with regard to noise&#151;and certainly with regard to emissions&#151;will be the very stuff of policy concern for British governments, on behalf of the British people, for any future that we can envisage?

</p>

<a name="51205-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>My noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis explained his Amendment No. 7, which would require economic, social and environmental factors to be taken into account by the airport manager or Secretary of State before they used their power to fix airport charges by reference to noise and emissions. Airport charges do not reflect solely these factors, but these factors relate to them. They will be based on many variables, and the noble Lord knows probably better than any Member of the Committee, given his declared interests and his previous role in relation to the airline industry, that the inbuilt factors can include the time of day at which an aircraft uses the airport, the maximum weight of the aircraft, the number of passengers it has on board, and the length of time for which it is parked at the airport. Noise and emission charges are only two variables in what is often a complex calculation, but I assure the noble Lord that they are important components.
</p>

<a name="51205-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>In fixing their charges generally, airports will be taking commercial decisions; they will need to cover their costs and make a return for their owners or shareholders. I do not believe it would be right to impose these additional requirements on them when they consider whether to make charges related to noise or emissions. I understand that the wording was proposed by the airline industry, which was concerned that these powers might be abused by airports or the Secretary of State to set unduly high noise-related or emissions-related charges. However, the Government do not believe that airports would take uncommercial decisions or that a future Secretary of State might abuse the power in subsection (4) of Section 38 in that way. To do so would only risk a legal challenge in the United Kingdom on the grounds of irrationality. In addition, an excessively high charge which limits or reduces access of aircraft to an airport might be argued to be a noise-related operating restriction. There are stringent international and EU rules regarding the introduction of such restrictions. Any move by the Secretary of State that was perceived as a breach of those rules could lead to EU infraction proceedings or <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC65"></a>

some other form of international sanction. So the Secretary of State would not use his powers in that context.
</p>

<a name="51205-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>The amendment also provides for airlines and local community representatives to determine jointly the charges an airport sets using the powers in Section 38. Again, the Government believe that these decisions are properly for the commercial discretion of the airport&#151;or, where he uses his power of direction, for the discretion of the Secretary of State. There are other, more appropriate means by which airlines and local stakeholders will have an opportunity to influence the airport&#039;s environmental and other policies, such as membership of the airport&#039;s consultative committee, when one exists&#151;as it will for major airports. The Secretary of State&#039;s power to direct by order in Section 38(4) is subject to the negative resolution procedure, allowing any Member to pray against him when an unreasonable order has been made. We contend that those are sufficient safeguards.
</p>

<a name="51205-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>It is also our belief that, in practice, airports will ensure that sufficient notice is given of any changes to their charges, in the context of updating their conditions of use, and that it is not necessary to put that requirement in the legislation. I have tried to meet every detail of my noble friend&#039;s anxieties&#151;many are the culmination of considerable experience and practice over the years.
</p>

<a name="51205-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Soley, introduced an extra dimension to the debate. I cannot see how I can fail in introducing that concept into a wide range of the groups of amendments before us, so I suppose that I must stand by for a war of attrition. We all sympathise with the noble Lord&#039;s point that emission levels are not just related to aircraft. Airports are industries with a lot of activity on the ground, capable of producing noise and, even more so, emissions affecting air quality. I hear his point that we should tackle that within the framework of the Bill but I have to disappoint him: although it certainly needs to be tackled, local authorities have powers in that regard, against a background of European directives on air quality.
</p>

<a name="51205-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>If I can stretch the analogy a little further, the problem with regard to emissions at Heathrow is that it is almost the only great international airport in the world within the M25 ring. By that I mean that its great problem is its proximity to such a very large population. The relationship between emissions and air quality affects so many people that Heathrow faces a particular challenge. That must be tackled in the air and on the ground. It is where local authorities adjoining the airport have a crucial role to play. I do not think that the issue of the groundwork of the airport fits exactly within the Bill but I am not so sanguine as to think that I will have allayed all the noble Lord&#039;s anxieties at this point&#151;I have not.

<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="51205-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   I agree with my noble friend but I am nonplussed about where my friend thinks local authorities figure in this connection. As an aviation Minister in the 1970s, I had a lot of trouble when I wanted local people to understand the problems of the airports. Some did not want to know. I recall an occasion in this building when I was shouted down. That is a not unimportant consideration. If you want to have rational debate about such matters, my noble friend ought to recognise the position of local people. I am not insisting that the Bill has the right direction.


</p>

<a name="51205-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>The local community is an important and integral part of the solution to our problems. Of course, there are some utterly unreasonable people with whom you cannot discuss any situation. However, a lot of people around airports are prepared to recognise that there has to be some expansion. But how will they be protected? I remain to be convinced on how they can mount an effective legal complaint about what is happening. Airport operatives are not the only people who need to be considered; people on the ground have to be considered. Words of amelioration are one thing, but some sort of redress and hope should be provided because that is what people are asking for.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="51205-32_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   That is an extremely persuasive plea, as is the position adopted by my noble friend Lord Soley. I do not want to appear negative&#151;very far from it. I share entirely the objective that we also need to deal with air quality at ground level. Earlier, in respect of the responsibility of local authorities, I referred to the Environment Act 1995 which places a duty on local authorities to review and assess the current and likely future air quality in their areas against the national objectives set out in the strategy and prescribed in the Air Quality Regulations 2000. When a local authority considers that one of more of the objectives is not likely to be realised, it has to declare so and draw up an action plan on how it intends to tackle that issue.
</p>

<a name="51205-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>To give another note of comfort to my noble friends&#151;I am not sure that I shall satisfy them entirely at this early stage in our deliberations&#151;airport operators do not have statutory powers enabling them to control emissions from airport vehicles, but they have incentives to do so. For example, the British Airports Authority has introduced a clean vehicle programme to encourage the use of cleaner fuels and technologies targeting vehicle emissions on the ground, which remains a key element of its air quality action plan for Heathrow and Gatwick. Of course, we recognise that it has the general good of the nation at heart. Equally clearly, it wants business and will run foul of emissions standards and the capacity to expand unless the air quality of the environment which so many people live in close to Heathrow does not reach appropriate standards. Those are my two responses to <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="51205-32_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   On the Environment Act and the duty on local authorities, try to imagine Hounslow deciding that it needs an action plan on air quality. What in practical terms could it do without completely destroying the economy of the area? Presumably, it could try to persuade BAA and the airlines to take action. Without massive expense by the local authority or massive prohibitions of people driving around, which would obviously affect the local economy, would it be reasonable to expect local authorities to do that on their own?

<a name="51205-32_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The whole point is that they will not be expected to do that on their own&#151;very far from it. This Bill is about ensuring that aircraft become less noisy and less polluting than at present, and it gives every incentive to airlines to improve the quality of their aircraft. My noble friend Lord Soley, supported by my noble friend Lord Berkeley, was discussing more broadly the issue of air quality at ground level and what can be done by airports in their ground-use activities with vehicles. I was responding to that point. The local authority is under an obligation to report on that and to identify where there are weaknesses. That weakness, if it were at its most crippling, would significantly impact on the operation of the airport, because the airport would not be able to both justify increased movements and meet our international obligations on air quality.
</p>

<a name="51205-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Both my department and the British Airports Authority are carrying out detailed work with the Highways Agency and with rail interests and other key stakeholders to assess the options for improving public transport access. All of us get caught up in those most unattractive of features&#151;traffic jams near Heathrow, on the motorway and adjoining roads. We all know the polluting qualities of the excessive traffic in the vicinity of Heathrow. We can improve public transport. As we know, the Heathrow link had some impact, and a lot more can be done to improve transport services generally. Less reliance on private vehicles arriving at Heathrow would do something to improve that area. It is so close to the M4 and the M25 that it is bad enough when those roads are flowing freely with just about a tolerable level of traffic, but we all know what they are like when there is excessive traffic. My department has a dedicated team producing a clear plan for taking the work forward, with the close involvement of the British Airports Authority and other stakeholders.
</p>

<a name="51205-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>Of course Heathrow is not the only airport with problems, but we all know that it is among the world&#039;s great international airports. Scarcely any other airport has anything remotely like its movements or is so close to such a large urban population. It is only right that we tackle the issue from every conceivable direction.

<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="51205-32_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   They apply to all licensed airports.

I give the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, full credit: with his first volley of amendments, ably assisted by one or two of my noble friends, he has identified some of the crucial issues in the Bill.

Something very important is being missed. This is about operations in the airport itself, not outside it. I agree with everything that my noble friend said about that, and no doubt he has been strongly advised not to include in the Bill things that can be overtaken by technology. There is a concern about global warming and other things related to the growth in air transport therefore the expectation is that people who operate aircraft&#151;airports&#151;should bear down on emissions in the airport itself. They can do so and we ought to encourage them. If it is any comfort to my noble friend the Minister, I simply say to him that that message needs to go out loud and clear because many airports, but not all, are prepared to adopt it.

The only reply I vouchsafe to my noble friend Lord Soley, to whom I hoped I had given as good a reply as I could manage, is to say that he is right that our Committee rules are very generous. However, woe betide the noble Lord if he misbehaves on Report.

<a name="51205-33_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   We have had an interesting and long debate on the first group of amendments. I thank <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC69"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC69</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Minister for his reply, at the end of which he said that our amendments hit the nail on the head as regards much of this part of the legislation. I suspect that we shall repeat much of the discussion on the next group of amendments, which is associated with the same issues. I hear what the Minister says and I agree with him that this primary legislation will last some years. However, I begin to suspect that Conservative policy on emissions and noise is slightly tougher than Labour policy. I want to strengthen the Government&#039;s arm in the creation of such legislation.
</p>

<a name="51205-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>I have some sympathy with the suggestions of the noble Lord, Lord Soley, and I might consider them for Report. At Heathrow, vehicles rush around all over the place. As the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, said, you could not possibly expect a small local authority to tackle that matter. More powers are needed regarding airport emissions. My next point does not constitute an argument for further expansion at Stansted, but obviously new airports are designed with better facilities for tackling pollution. The ones that grow like Topsy have vehicles rushing all over the place but new airports are designed to minimise pollution. I repeat that I am not using that point to argue for expansion at Stansted.
</p>

<a name="51205-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>We have had a good debate today. I shall reflect on how we can strengthen the Bill and create the right situation to tackle these problems, as we must do in the future. I will return to the matter on Report, as I am sure we all will, and we will discuss some more amendments associated with this issue in a moment. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51205-33_para2"></a>

</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="51205-33_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield </b>   moved Amendment No. 3:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>Page 2, line 21, after &quot;authority&quot; insert &quot;with the agreement of the local authority in whose area the aerodrome is situated&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>The noble Lord said: We return to the same issue with these amendments, which are designed to probe the Minister further on the considerable powers that the Bill will bestow on managers of aerodrome authorities. They are also designed to redress the imbalance that the Bill will create if it grants enforcement powers to airport managers.
</p>

<a name="51205-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>The Bill is in danger of ensuring the wholesale disadvantage of local people. The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, referred to that. Local people in the communities are very important. This is an issue of considerable concern and I am sure that we will come back to it as the Bill progresses.
</p>

<a name="51205-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>In another place, the Minister suggested that effectively the Bill would provide the same range of powers to airport authorities which control other airports as those currently available to the Secretary of State in relation to designated airports. It would be of serious concern to me if an airport manager were given the same powers as a Secretary of State. Whatever the Secretary of State&#039;s thoughts, at least he is accountable before Parliament and, ultimately, before the electorate for his actions. Airport managers are not elected; they are accountable only to their <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC70"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC70</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

shareholders. I find it alarming that the Government should propose to give them powers equivalent to those of a Secretary of State to exercise over non-designated airports.
</p>

<a name="51205-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>This issue could be remedied by ensuring that the local authorities responsible for the areas in which airports are situated are involved in the determination of noise-emission levels and they would be included in a charging regime. Again, I declare my interest as leader of Essex County Council.
</p>

<a name="51205-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>Permitting airport managers alone to establish charging regimes and impose charges on airline operators is unprecedented and alarming. I can think of no other industry where such a practice would be permitted. No other industry is allowed completely to ignore local authorities, which is what the Bill&#039;s provisions would seem to imply in this case. Again, the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, referred to that.
</p>

<a name="51205-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Of paramount concern to people living in the vicinity of airports are the noise levels and the pollution produced by aircraft. It would seem entirely reasonable for those people&#039;s interests to be represented in decisions on the levels and targets used to form the basis for such a charging or penalty regime. The inclusion of local authorities in the process would ensure that those vital interests were represented and that the whole process was made far more equitable and acceptable.
</p>

<a name="51205-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>The amendments are in line with the Government&#039;s own reasoning and reflect their desire to find local solutions. As the Minister stated at Second Reading, these problems are best resolved locally by those at the airport working with the local community. The amendments would formalise that process. They would ensure that airport managers were accountable and that local stakeholders&#039; concerns could be represented effectively prior to the imposition of a charging scheme. Unamended, the Bill lacks external accountability and runs contrary to democratic principles, contrary to the principles of sustainable development and contrary to the Government&#039;s own principle of local solutions. I beg to move.

<a name="51205-33_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Smith of Leigh: </b>   I declare two interests: one is as a director of Manchester Airport and the other is as leader of a local authority, so perhaps I am wearing two hats here. I am intrigued by the noble Lord&#039;s amendment. I am intrigued to know which local authorities he believes should be consulted on this matter. At Stansted, would it be the district or the county authorities? This may be a short-term problem if the views of the Minister with responsibility for communities and local government are reflected in the changes in the structure of local government, but we will see about that. In some ways, that may be the wrong thing. Manchester Airport was actually wholly within the boundaries of the City of Manchester because it was carved out of Cheshire, so it was within the city boundaries for easier planning purposes. But perhaps two-thirds of it borders on Cheshire, which would be more affected by the impact of what happened in Manchester than would be Manchester itself. So what do we do in that case?
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC71"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC71</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51205-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a> How do we define which local authorities would be consulted? I am intrigued by the difference between this amendment and the previous amendments that the noble Lord moved. There is a contradiction between what would be in the interests of the airline&#151;which would presumably like to keep all those charges down to a minimum&#151;and the local authorities, which want them to be raised to reduce noise and other emissions. The other thing, which has not been mentioned, is that airports are not without influence by local authorities, because, first of all, they operate within a planning environment. Therefore, the planning authority can impose on an airport, particularly when it wants to change its operation. When Manchester Airport wanted to build a second runway, the local authority in Cheshire imposed a Section 106 agreement which forced us&#151;although we were willing to comply&#151;to have 25 per cent access by public transport built into the airport&#039;s policy. So there are other ways in which an airport can be influenced by a local authority.
</p>

<a name="51205-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>The Minister referred to the consultative committees that exist at major airports and which are very important. With Manchester Airport, the consultative committee is almost entirely Cheshire-based, because that is where the areas that are influenced would be. I understand the sentiment behind the proposals, because airports must operate within the local environment. But the noble Lord&#039;s amendment would raise more questions than it solved.

</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="51205-33_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   The airport that I know best is Stansted, which comes within four local authorities&#151;two county councils in Essex and Hertfordshire, and two district councils in Uttlesford and East Hertfordshire. Those four authorities work very well together in working with or against planning applications; any such application must be given to Uttlesford District Council; big ones normally end up with the Secretary of State. I would want those four authorities to be involved. My amendment is mainly concerned with the power of airport managers. To confer more powers on the local authorities, or consortiums of local authorities, and involve local communities, would be the right way forward. We shall probably come back to this subject, but I believe that we should strengthen those consultative committees, because they are a very important part of the process and can involve local authorities and local people. They play a vital part in airports and with the public concern for the future of air travel.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="51205-33_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, that local authorities deserve to play a greater part in the issue of noise and emissions from aircraft, because they affect very many people who live adjacent to airports&#151;people who are very frightened by the various proposals in hand at the moment to expand airports. Airports cause a lot of people a lot of misery, and the Government would do well to strengthen the position of local authorities. It is unreasonable to expect local authorities to veto the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC72"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC72</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

propositions that the airport makes; on the other hand, they deserve to be convinced that what is proposed is necessary and that proper steps are taken now and in future to reduce noise and emissions that emanate from airports.

<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="51205-34_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   The problem that my noble friend faces, as we all do, is that to give anyone a veto in this matter is highly dangerous&#151;whether you give local authorities or local communities a veto. Speaking again from my experience, I believe that the important thing is to provide sufficient information on which local authorities can come to a conclusion. If that information is not provided, you do of course get an ill balanced debate. Equally, as far as local people are concerned, some people can be expected to be reasonable, but others are utterly unreasonable. How do you solve their problems? I am not arguing against the fact that there has to be some sort of effective and reasonable consultation, but to expect that it will solve all the problems&#151;notwithstanding what I have said&#151;is impossible.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="51205-34_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Soley: </b>   The Minister will be relieved to hear me say that it would be a great mistake to agree to this amendment. The bigger airports are part of a national infrastructure with a national interest for the economy. I flag that up so much because of my concern about Heathrow. I suspect that the Minister at times might underestimate the threat to Heathrow. It is under threat from continental airports, which are dramatically overtaking it now at a rapid rate in terms of regional destination flights. If we agreed to the amendment, we would give local authorities in the immediate area the power to bear down on the operations of an airport. Airports are too important for jobs and for the prosperity, not just of the United Kingdom but of the region, for that to happen. I urge the Minister not to move on that. He will be relieved about that, because I am sure that he will not move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="51205-34_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am grateful to my noble friend. We have had in microcosm the national debate that we had when we went out for consultation. Before we published <i>The Future of Air Transport</i>, we sought views on the extent to which local authorities should have a role in determining non-designated airports&#039; noise amelioration measures. We got responses not dissimilar to those we had in Committee this afternoon.
</p>

<a name="51205-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>I recognise the interest of local authorities in the environment that an airport creates; that goes without saying. They represent local people who often bear the significant external costs of the operation of the airport. As my noble friend Lord Smith first articulated, supported by both my other noble friends, there is a real problem if one suggests that a local authority should have some kind of veto over an issue of such significance. I rather like the point made by my noble friend Lord Soley&#151;that is probably the last time that I shall utter those words. I agree that airports are not local; significant airports are at the very least regional in their economic impact. That is why there is a genuine problem, as my noble friend Lord Smith <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC73"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC73</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

indicated, of who to consult. Who is most affected? How do you define that within this framework? It is difficult, although I recognise what the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield said. If they had any sense, local authorities with a common interest would get together on consultation and put up a joint front. We are all too well aware that the four local authorities involved with Stansted do so.
</p>

<a name="51205-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>We see local authorities having a role to play when an airport applies for planning permission that is not of sufficient strategic importance for the Secretary of State to call it in. They have the statutory right to be included in the consultative arrangements made by airports designated under Section 35 of the 1982 Act. They will have an opportunity formally to make their views known to airport management. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, said, and he was supported by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, that airport managers are not elected. They are executives with a job to do, and there are wider community interests to which they need to relate. Consultative procedures are in place, which is necessary to condition the way in which airport executives reach decisions on proposals.
</p>

<a name="51205-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>I emphasise that we had a thorough debate about this issue. The problem was, when it came down to the final point, that developments at any airport of any size are likely to be of such significance that to give a veto to a local authority&#151;and, in a sense, it would be almost arbitrary which local authority it was&#151;did not on balance meet the needs of the nation as a whole or the region that each airport affects, or often of local authorities. I hear what the noble Lord said. I predicted when preparing for the Bill that I would come under fairly heavy challenge on the local authority position. After all, who is better equipped on that than the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield&#151;apart from all the other Members in Committee who also have great local government experience? No, my Lords, I cannot follow him down that road and enter into a debate about the future of local authorities.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="51205-34_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I thank the Minister for that reply. We are certainly not going to get into a debate about the future of local authorities&#151;if we are going to debate that, we will leave that for other places. I did not want to give local authorities a veto; I wanted them to be more involved. From the first debate, I thought that other noble Lords wanted that as well. Local authorities are the elected representatives of the people around airports, and consultative committees can represent voluntary groups and other people. We will have to revisit at other stages in the Bill how local people can be involved. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="51205-34_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hanham </b>   moved Amendment No. 4:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>Page 2, line 24, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_0"></a><br>
&quot;(3A)   The Secretary of State shall report on the effectiveness of any charges made under subsection (1) for the purposes laid out in subsection (2) every twelve months after the passing of this Act, and shall specify the sources of information used in its compilation, and publish each such report in such manner as he thinks fit.

<br>
(3B)   The Secretary of State shall, by regulations following the publication of each report made under subsection (3A), set targets for emissions and noise related to aerodrome authorities for the following twelve month period and report on the systems and means for monitoring noise and emissions in relation to aerodromes and those areas along flightpaths and whether they shall be subject to change over the following twelve months.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_40"></a>The noble Baroness said: We are in danger of tracing over the same ground as the Minister has responded to at length. None the less, we need to continue to probe on Clause 1. The amendment follows up on Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 and underlines some of the points that have already been made. Its purpose is simple; it asks that the Bill does what it says it is designed to do. The wording of the Bill is specific; aerodromes may charge with reference to noise and emissions for the purposes of encouraging the use of quieter aircraft and those that produce fewer emissions. We must all accept that the intention of the aircraft industry is, over time, to produce quieter aircraft, but they have not arrived yet and we are faced with this problem for some time to come.
</p>

<a name="51205-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>If we are to charge with reference to noise and emissions with the aim of producing environmental improvement, we must surely decide whether those methods are effective. Otherwise, we are simply giving aerodrome authorities the legal justification under the guise of environmental improvement to increase the charges that they levy on airlines. Logically, the charge must achieve those goals and those achievements must be verified and reported on. There is not much point in having a scheme if you do not know how it is working. Unless we can establish whether charging with reference to noise and emissions achieves the goals outlined in Clause 1(2), the provisions are at best worthless and at worst grossly unfair.
</p>

<a name="51205-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Proposed new subsection (3A) asks that the Secretary of State co-ordinates, verifies and lists the sources for measuring noise and emissions. Given the fragmentation&#151;that is the number of airports owned by different groups that we have been discussing&#151;we ask that the Secretary of State should enable a strategic overview to be presented to Parliament. Furthermore, if the aerodrome authorities are permitted to charge with reference to noise and emissions, we must consider how those targets are to be determined and by whom. Is it to be the aerodrome authorities themselves, as the Bill suggests? If so, we must return to the issue of fairness. It would seem more equitable if the levels at which charges were to be made were made explicit and were universally applicable.
</p>

<a name="51205-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>As the Government have already admitted, their domestic target of reducing emissions by 20 per cent by 2010 will not be reached.


</p>

<a name="51205-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>I think that the noble Lord, Lord Soley, was the first person to mention carbon dioxide emissions. As we understand it, they are higher now than they were in 1997, the last Conservative government having managed to reduce them by 7.3 per cent between 1990 and 1997. Aviation now forms the largest growing source of CO2 emissions, and at the present <br>&nbsp;<br>

rate of growth aviation emissions will wipe out all the savings made by all other sectors of the economy. Given the seriousness of the issue, it would seem sensible for the Government to set some targets. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="51205-35_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   I support what the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said. Consistency and transparency are needed in the charging regime that is set up. That charging regime should be revised and should show, over the years to come, how noise and emissions are to be reduced. The airline industry needs to have a target, as do all industries. It cannot reach the target through sudden steps; it has to be done gradually. I would like to see in place a regime for emissions and noise that reflects that. Will the Minister consider seriously the permissive regime, as put here&#151;airports &quot;may&quot; charge&#151;and who is to set the limits. I do not believe that they are subjective things that can be determined by an airport authority; they are absolute matters that should be determined by a regulator such as the CAA.
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="51205-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   I have certain reservations about the amendment. It is as though Members of Parliament and noble Lords are entirely without a remedy. I do not think that is true. They can raise the issue through parliamentary questions and they can debate it, if appropriate. Local consultative committees can raise the issue, and raise it directly with the Minister, as I know personally. There is absolutely nothing that should stop the situation from evolving. Indeed, any Secretary of State, or anyone acting under his authority worth his or her salt, will hear any reasonable dissent which is voiced by the consultative committee and, moreover, act on it. I do not believe that any Secretary of State should be browbeaten. That is no way whatever to make progress. Reasonable discourse is to be encouraged.
</p>

<a name="51205-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>More importantly, the situation that we are contemplating is a changing scenario, not something that is written once and for all. Of course, the noble Baroness is asking that there should be an annual report. I do not think that is necessary. Local Members of Parliament will understand the representations that are made to them, and will voice the situation most appropriately in Parliament. Therefore, the obligation that it ought to be imposed on the Secretary of State is utterly unreasonable. What I think is appropriate&#151;I hope that the noble Baroness will agree&#151;is that the Secretary of State should have his or her ear to the ground. He will recognise the situation that is brought home to him, often in no uncertain measure. Imposing upon him or her an obligation of that kind is not altogether appropriate.

It is still the Government&#039;s case today.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC76"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC76</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51205-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>We do not believe it would be appropriate to seek an annual report on these issues. The levels of noise and emissions at an aerodrome may vary for reasons other than the imposition of charges relating to noise and emissions considerations; for instance, because of changes to the type of aircraft using the airport due to changes in the local economy or improvements in operational practice driven by an airline operator&#039;s wish to improve fuel efficiency. The Government do not believe that this level of oversight of non-designated airports&#039; noise and emissions monitoring systems is appropriate. We look to airport operators to consider their environmental impact and seek to mitigate them. Where there are problems, efforts should certainly be made to resolve them at the local level if at all possible. That is the best level at which both to monitor and to call attention to the issues that arise. Local monitoring is best. However, we shall draw up a national picture of the noise climate in the UK following the noise mapping and action planning associated with the environmental noise directive, which I mentioned when I replied to an earlier group of amendments. The Government will also have the power to set limit values or other criteria to be taken into account by those producing the action plans, including major airports. That gives the Government the power to take an overview and to set that in the context of other sources of noise.
</p>

<a name="51205-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>Nor do we believe that the Secretary of State&#151;as my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis so amply demonstrated&#151;should be required to set and publish annual targets for noise and emissions related to airports. The White Paper includes specific proposals for tackling aircraft emissions, including preparation for the inclusion of intra-EU air services in the EU emissions trading scheme. We raised that issue during our presidency of the European Union. As all noble Lords know, a greenhouse gas trading scheme is already in operation in Europe. We have been working to include intra-EU air services in an emissions trading scheme. That has been a priority during our presidency. European Ministers agreed last week with the UK Government&#039;s view that emissions trading is the best way forward in tackling aviation emissions. The Council of Ministers has called for a legislative proposal on this before the end of 2006. So this is being worked upon actively at the European level. This is an important step but nevertheless it will be recognised as inevitably only a partial step on this worldwide issue. We have a long way to go before we deal with aircraft from other parts of the world. This step relates only to flights within the European Community. However, we must start somewhere. Everyone who has ever contributed to these debates in the House has emphasised that we cannot do this on our own. I want to report progress but I give way to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="51205-35_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   Does the Minister accept that tackling aircraft emissions by means of emissions trading is abject surrender? It does not reduce emissions one bit. We are seeking at least to trace a path where airlines themselves reduce emissions. I will not indulge in technical talk about how emissions can <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC77"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC77</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be reduced, but the car industry has reduced emissions because it was told over some time that it should do so. The Minister has just said that we will do nothing about emissions and just hope that, some time or another, the European Union will turn up with an emissions trading scheme. That does not answer the question.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="51205-35_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   The noble Lord is ignoring the situation. In my experience, responsible airlines already apply, and continue to do so through research and understanding of the situation, the position that exists. For example, British Airways has made enormous progress on emissions and is continuing to do so. What does the noble Lord think airlines are doing at the moment?
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="51205-35_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   I shall come into this debate on emissions trading because I have just received an interesting article from <i>Energy in Buildings & Industry</i> magazine. It illustrates the problem of airlines joining heavy industry in emissions trading. Apart from the fact that they are joining three, four, five or six years after heavy industry, purchasing allowances represent for heavy industry a significant cost element for energy-intensive industries, where carbon dioxide emissions per-unit sales are high. It would have very little effect on airlines to buy it. The example given is &#8364;30 per tonne, which would just add &#8364;30 to a round trip from Paris to New York. There will be severe problems with the air industry starting off with enormous grandfather rights and then joining a trading system with heavy industry&#151;for example, cement and similar industries. I am not sure that it has been properly investigated. Now is not the time to go into it in any great detail, but we ought to look at it when it comes up.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="51205-35_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   Of course there are problems about the trading scheme. As the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, accurately said, it is not a complete solution to the problem. We all recognise that progress can be made within that framework. My noble friend Lord Berkeley introduced the question of heavy industry and we recognise that people will be looking for trade-offs where they can be most comfortably achieved. That is in the nature of an exercise like this. But we should not underestimate the fact that Europe is responding to the question of the contribution of air traffic to emissions. If I had been involved in this debate 10 days ago, I would have been attacked at least as vigorously by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, and probably by other Members on the Opposition Benches, about the fact that nothing was being done about aircraft emissions on a scale that looked remotely like facing up to the international problem. This afternoon, I present a gain. I concede to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, that it is a limited gain and that there is an enormous amount of work to be done, but Europe is responding to the issue of aircraft emissions. Europe is not unimportant in global aircraft issues, although none of us would be so crass as not to recognise the huge significance of the United States and of the airlines that belong to countries other than the United States.

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>We have a considerable way to go, but the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw and my noble friend are in danger of looking a gift horse in the mouth. Of course, they are right to identify that problems lie ahead in making this effective. All sorts of issues immediately arise when the principles behind the scheme are adumbrated, but we have made progress in this area. I hope noble Lords will recognise that and appreciate that it is because of those factors that we are indicating how committed the Government are to meet the requirements in response to this form of pollution. Our White Paper made clear that we expected to make progress in this area. We did not underestimate the challenges that lay ahead. I have no doubts. Some good warning notes have been sounded by the two noble Lords who have indicated that I cannot wave a flag of triumph with regard to progress. Of course not; this is the beginning of the development of the scheme. But it is what many people have worked hard to achieve, and it is an awful lot of what noble Lords have demanded on this issue in the past. I hope it will be recognised that an annual report from the Secretary of State would contribute very little to the real issues. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis for identifying the weakness of that argument.

<a name="51205-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   Will my noble friend strenuously point out that British Airways, the main British airline, has contributed a great deal to solving the problems that we are discussing? The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, rightly says that progress must be made along the lines of the motor car industry, but it is already being done. British Airways has acted utterly responsibly and continues to do so. Anything that we say that confutes that situation is unhelpful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="51205-36_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I do not think that any noble Lord was seeking to confute that position. I am glad that my noble friend has emphasised the point because we need progress among world airlines similar to that which British Airways has begun. But there is a great deal more to be achieved by that service, too. Nevertheless, it is an important contribution to the debate.
</p>

<a name="51205-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>I emphasise that the Secretary of State has the power to direct amendment or revocation of an airport&#039;s noise or emission-related charges. We have a framework in which those issues can be tackled. I do not see how an annual report would contribute significantly to the effectiveness of the legislation. That is why I hope that the noble Baroness, having given rise to an interesting debate, will withdraw her amendment.

<a name="51205-36_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I thank the Minister for his reply and noble Lords for their contributions.

areas, very little is achieved. So what I am looking for here is not a European directive but something specific and local to this nation.
</p>

<a name="51205-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>Clause 1 enables airports to make their own charges. As I understand it, that is what they do at the moment. They can assess the emissions of an aeroplane, but only when it is on the ground. We are looking for information on the pollution that occurs through aircraft. An aircraft will have the same polluting factor in Manchester as in Leeds or at Heathrow, unless one takes into account additional polluting factors. But the aircraft will have the same effect.
</p>

<a name="51205-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>The amendment asked for two things and speakers concentrated on one of them. It asked for an annual report on what airports and aerodromes charge in terms of emission factors. Secondly, it provided that, after the Government had looked at those charges, they should set additional targets to be achieved by airports and aerodromes in this country. As the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, told us, any airline that is achieving those targets has nothing to worry about, whether there is an annual report or not. It is doing it. The aircraft that we ought to be getting at are those not achieving the targets. We want to ensure that they are known about and, in some states, shamed into making things better.
</p>

<a name="51205-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>I do not think that this is something that the Secretary of State can renege upon. He ought to be keeping an eye on it and the public ought to be able to know the outcome of his deliberations on the information that he receives. I heard what has been said, but I am not satisfied that this matter has been properly addressed and thought about. I withdraw the amendment for today, but we may return to it.

<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="51205-36_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hanham </b>   moved Amendment No. 5:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>Page 2, line 28, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_1"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   The Secretary of State shall review the maximum noise limits on aircraft taking off from designated airports and shall take account of the target of reducing the perceived external noise of new aircraft by 50 per cent by 2020 compared to 2000, and shall report to Parliament in such manner as he thinks fit at regular intervals.&quot;

<p><a name="st_52"></a>The noble Baroness said: Noble Lords are no doubt aware that the aviation industry has published a sustainable aviation policy. One of the key targets of that policy is to reduce perceived external noise by 50 per cent for new aircraft by 2020 relative to their equivalents in 2000. That target has been endorsed by all UK airlines, airports and aircraft manufacturers. It has not, however, been endorsed by Ryanair or other foreign airlines.
</p>

<a name="51205-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>The purpose of the amendment is twofold: first, it is designed purely and simply to hold the aviation industry accountable to its own target. Secondly, it is designed to help prevent unfair competition from foreign airlines that might otherwise profit from the operation of noisier aircraft. The principal difference between this amendment and the target produced by the sustainable aviation policy is that, whereas the aviation industry target applies only to new aircraft, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC80"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC80</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the maximum noise limits of this amendment apply to all aircraft. This divergence is not overly burdensome; in fact, one would expect older, noisier aircraft to be gradually phased out as new aircraft are introduced, thereby enabling the maximum noise limits to be reduced.
</p>

<a name="51205-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>We must recognise that variable landing fees are a mechanism, not an outcome. To achieve the desired outcome one needs to stipulate targets, which takes us back to the previous amendment. One of the strongest drivers for introducing Chapter 3 planes was the fact that aircraft manufacturers were given a clear steer that they would have to achieve those targets. This Bill presents the opportunity to give the aviation industry a strong steer to ensure a reduction in the overall envelope of noise and emissions in the future. In addition, if clear targets were set for the reduction of noise it would give people living under flight paths and close to airports certainty and confidence that things were going to improve in the years to come.
</p>

<a name="51205-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>This amendment is based upon the aspirations of the airlines themselves and merely asks the Government to hold them to account. Moreover, it leaves how much the noise limits can be reduced to the discretion of the Secretary of State. It should therefore be acceptable to the Minister. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="51205-36_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   I support the amendment, because this sort of fairly long-term signal ought to be sent to the industry. As far as I am concerned, it could be longer, so long as there is a continual reduction. I hope that reductions will also apply emissions as well.
</p>

<a name="51205-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>To answer the last point made by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, I am not particularly targeting British Airways or any other good operator. I am targeting the keeping in place of very old aircraft that, after their time in passenger service, go into freight service. They create huge amounts of noise around airports and are thoroughly objectionable to the local community. I hope that the noble Lord does not seek to pass off what I am saying as an attack on British Airways, which it is not. It is an attack on aircraft noise, particularly that made by older aircraft, often operated by the less reputable operators.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="51205-36_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   Can the noble Lord give the Committee particulars of where older aircraft are being used?
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="51205-36_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   I shall give the simple example of Coventry airport, where the lives of people living around it are made a misery by old aircraft.

<a name="51205-36_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am grateful to the two noble Lords who have contributed to this debate&#151;three, if I count the interjection of my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis. We last made changes to the noise level limits in December 2000. A further review of departure noise limits was then carried out by the environmental research and consultancy department of the Civil Aviation Authority, overseen by the Department for Transport&#039;s aircraft noise monitoring advisory committee, which includes representatives from the designated airports&#039; independent <br>&nbsp;<br>

consultative committees. That review was published in March 2003. I do not therefore believe that this amendment would make any difference to the Government&#039;s current practice in respect of keeping departure noise limits under review: that is the Secretary of State&#039;s duty, and he fulfils it.
</p>

<a name="51205-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Amendment No. 5 also refers to the UK aviation industry&#039;s target. We welcomed that target and the release of the strategy upon which it was based, and we hope that the industry will manage to meet it. But it is a target adopted voluntarily by the industry. This amendment proposes that the Secretary of State should give that target statutory force and impose it. That seems a rather odd way for the Government to act.
</p>

<a name="51205-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>We continue to press for improvements in aviation technology, which was the burden of the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. The reduction of noise at its source is one of the four strands of the ICAO&#039;s balanced approach to dealing with aircraft noise. Members of the Committee will recognise that as aviation technology has improved, aircraft have become quieter. But older aircraft, although their environmental performance may not be as good as the most modern aircraft, meet ICAO technical standards and remain part of airlines&#039; fleets. The UK is obliged under its international agreements to allow those aircraft to continue to operate in the UK.


</p>

<a name="51205-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>As a country, we cannot arbitrarily and individually decide that certain aircraft are no longer able to enter this country when they meet ICAO technical standards.

</p>

<a name="51205-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>This Government and previous governments have accepted that it would not be compatible with our international obligations to set a daytime noise limit so low that a very large number of long-haul aircraft, certificated to ICAO standards and legally entitled to operate in the UK, would not be able to operate because we have reduced noise limits. Similarly, night-time and shoulder period departure noise limits must be broadly compatible with the night flying restrictions that we set under Section 73(3). Any new noise limit for departures that reduces or constrains access of aircraft to airports would be subject to Directive 2002/30, on noise-related operating restrictions, which we have incorporated into UK legislation by The Aerodromes (Noise Restrictions)(Rules and Procedures) Regulations 2003, so they are part of our obligations.

<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="51205-37_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   If an aircraft is found to be in breach of noise limits, and although it is supposed to conform to ICAO standards it does not do so, how do the Government take action against that aircraft? Do they rely on the country from which it came to take action against that aircraft through its own procedures? If it does that, I am not very impressed. I would like action taken against that aircraft here when it makes noise here.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="51205-37_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I understand that, but not if the action appears to carry that arbitrary quality that <br>&nbsp;<br>

noble Lord indicated. Of course, the noble Lord is right. If an aircraft meets ICAO technical standards, but fails our noise level standards, there would be real difficulties. The current power is to withhold only airport facilities. The power to set penalties is in Clause 13, but that is all the powers that we have. Otherwise, we are signatories to international agreements about the access of aircraft. The noble Lord dared not ask me to join in a cavalier approach to an aircraft&#039;s inability to respond to meet our requirements. I have just had a note to say that I made a slip: I said Clause 13 and I meant to say Clause 3. Perhaps the Committee will accept that it is in Clause 3 that we have the power to set penalties.
</p>

<a name="51205-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>The noble Lord appears to be arguing strenuously for a demand that we should have close to an arbitrary power to deal with infringements. I am not sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, was quite as assertive in moving the amendment. Given that the whole concept of air travel by definition is governed by international conventions and rules, we have great difficulty with that. We have to tread with some care in that area. However, we do not rely on the country of origin. We would be able to indicate to the offending aircraft that if it was outwith the range of our levels of acceptance, we would withdraw airport facilities. I am sorry that I have addressed most of my remarks to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. But he spoke last and, I think, rather more assertively than the noble Baroness who was her usual courteous self in expressing her arguments. I hope that she will accept that I have made a strong enough argument for her to reconsider the amendment.

<a name="51205-37_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   Perhaps I should change my style&#151;there is an opportunity&#151;but for this amendment I will keep my happy, ameliorating stance. I thank the Minister for his reply. He is managing to get the Secretary of State out of doing all the things that we want him to do and is getting him out of taking the responsibility that he ought to take under these clauses to ensure that these aspects are met. It is always the same: we have international and local agreements, and agreements for this and for that. If they are not monitored and looked after and the Secretary of State does not take interest, absolutely nothing happens and no one knows what is going on or understands it. Today, I have nothing more to say. It has mostly been said in my introductory remarks. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>Page 2, line 41, leave out subsection (2).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 2(2) must surely be one of the most contentious elements of the Bill. As it stands, it will amend the powers by which the Secretary of State currently controls noise at three designated <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC83"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC83</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

airports&#151;Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. Again, I must declare an interest as leader of Essex County Council, since Stansted is in that county.
</p>

<a name="51205-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>The current method of controlling night noise at the three designated airports relies on the effective operation of a movements limit and a noise quota system. By amending Section 78 (3)(b) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 in this way, the Secretary of State would be empowered to discontinue the application of limits on the number of night aircraft movements at Stansted, Gatwick and Heathrow. That the Government have included this provision is unsurprising. They set out their intentions in the 2003 Aviation White Paper, in which they made clear their commitment to introduce legislation including,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;An amendment to section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 so that controls such as night restrictions could, subject to public consultation, be set on the basis of noise quotas alone, without a separate movements limit&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>To do that would be a gross misjudgment on the part of the Government. The movements limit and the noise quota system cannot be viewed in isolation. They must be seen as complementing one another in the protection of local communities from the terrible consequences of night noise. I must say that I have had as much lobbying and discussion on this as on any issue with which I have dealt on the Front Bench. The Government&#039;s intention to move to a control scheme that relies solely on night noise quotas would result in a lesser standard of protection since the methodology is dramatically flawed.
</p>

<a name="51205-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>First, there is no official index in the UK that is specific to night noise. Consequently, the Government make no distinction in the method by which they measure noise during the day and the night. For residents on the ground, current methodology is highly unsatisfactory. While noise is measured in decibels, the index of exposure to aircraft is a measure of the equivalent continuous sound level that is averaged over the timeframe, which fails to recognise that noise has vastly different implications at night. Decibels alone are not a measure of nuisance. This method is wholly inadequate for assessing disruption of sleep caused by the impact of a relatively small number of noise events across the night. Cumulatively, those noise events may not break the relevant noise quota. However, they may result in a person being disturbed on multiple occasions throughout the night.
</p>

<a name="51205-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>Even more concerning is the implication that as aircraft become less noisy, more flights could be accommodated within the same noise quota. Less noise does not necessarily equate with less disturbance. Reliance solely on a quota system could dramatically exacerbate the situation that I have outlined, resulting in increased night disturbances for people living near airports or under flight paths. The problem is further increased in rural areas such as Stansted where ambient noise levels are very low at night. The noble Baroness, Lady McIntosh of Hudnall, made that important point at Second Reading. In such places, all night flights create disturbance. Consequently, the only truly effective way to address the problem is to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC84"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC84</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

retain the movements limit on night flights. Unlike the complexity of the noise quota system, a movements limit is easily understood, transparent and open to validation. In addition, it provides protection to people living near to airports, but not necessarily under flight paths, from the attendant problems of ground noise, which the quota system is unable to properly address.
</p>

<a name="51205-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>At Second Reading of this Bill in another place, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State gave assurances that night movements limits would remain in place at Stansted, Heathrow and Gatwick until at least October 2012. However, it is my opinion that if this section remains unamended it would be perfectly possible for night movements limits to be abolished as early as October 2006&#151;the start of the new night flights regime for Stansted, Heathrow and Gatwick.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="51205-37_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   In which way does the noble Lord suggest that the situation under the Bill is less strict than under Section 78 of the 1982 Act?
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="51205-37_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   At the moment, it is calculated on the number of flights, which is transparent and understandable. Obviously, that causes disturbance but there are restrictions. Under a quota, there could be a lot of flights because less so-called noise might be measured, which does not help people who are woken up by lower levels of noise. My contention is that there could be a lot more flights at night under the new legislation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="51205-37_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   Why could there not be a quota under the 1982 Act?

<a name="51205-37_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   We do not have a quota. The number of flights is the important thing. We would move in due course to a quota system, which would disturb a great deal of people. I have had an enormous number of representations on this. Particularly in London, people are very concerned that there could be a considerable number of extra night flights. If this legislation goes through, there could be a change as early as 2006. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say, but the deletion of this clause is paramount. We are very concerned about that. I beg to move.

<a name="51205-38_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   I have listened to what the noble Lord has said, and it is necessary to involve oneself in consultation. But those representations are mistaken. Under the 1982 Act, the situation is rather less stringent than is envisaged in the Bill. My two amendments are tabled in order to facilitate the Minister to describe to the Committee what is being done. First, all operators should be consulted about all restrictions under Section 78; I would be very surprised if they are not. No doubt the Minister can inform us about that. Secondly, ICAO insists on a balanced approach on economic, social and environmental benefits and concerns. I do not know whether they are properly taken into account, but I am sure that my noble friend will put my mind at rest.
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="51205-38_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   I support the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. I, too, have had representations from local authorities. I will endeavour to explain to the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, why we are concerned. As I understand it, the present arrangement for night flying consists of an overall noise restriction. As the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, says, it is an amount of decibels divided by an amount of time. It does not refer to each occasion on which there is noise. It is a broad average over the average of the night hours. I believe that in 1993 the Government decided on a &quot;noise only&quot; scheme, which had the potential to allow 24,000 night movements at Heathrow. Local authorities challenged that in the High Court. In the end, the Secretary of State was required to introduce a scheme that included both a noise quota count and an absolute movement limit, which allows 5,800 movements a year.
</p>

<a name="51205-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>Consultation on the regime, through a two-stage public consultation process, ended in September 2005&#151;so the consultation is pretty current. If the Government were able to abolish the movement limit and go back to a noise-only limit, there would be the potential to increase the present limit of 5,800 to 39,000 movements a year, which is what we are arguing about&#151;the number of times that people living around designated airports are to be woken up at night by aircraft. A potential six- or seven-fold increase in movements would be absolutely dreadful. It is mainly the volume of the noise at the moment when an aircraft takes off or lands which causes people to wake up. In this amendment, we are probing the motives behind the changes in the Bill. Are they a subtle requirement for the Secretary of State to remove the movement limit and to legitimise a noise restriction scheme? If they are&#151;I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and I speak from the same script&#151;we will seek to overturn it on Report if the Minister cannot give us a satisfactory reply.

Current regulations or rules were achieved after the Terminal 5 inquiry and the High Court case referred to by other noble Lords. I see little argument in favour of changing it. I shall not go into the details of that because it would take a long time and be rather tedious. The present regime seems to have been accepted, sometimes with a certain lack of enthusiasm, by local authorities, but I believe there would be a real outcry if the change proposed in the Bill went forward. I see nothing wrong with the present system. It seems to be a good compromise between the needs of the airline industry and the local residents to get some sleep.

<a name="51205-38_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I have several significant points to reply to on this very important debate. If the Committee will allow me&#151;I was going to say &quot;I shall demolish the canard&quot; but I suppose you shoot canard&#151;I shall destroy the canard that we are changing things from the present position in the period up to 2012. We are not. We have undertaken consultation on the regime that runs from 2006 to 2012. We are committed to not changing those arrangements, so anything in this Bill does not apply to the current regime. Any change that would affect it will come into being after that period. I sought to make that clear at Second Reading, but it is worth reiterating it today so that we can concentrate on dealing with formidably significant issues which relate to the longer-term future&#151;not too long in airport and aircraft terms, but long enough for us to be fully involved, to consult as necessary and to get the position right.
</p>

<a name="51205-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>We should take the opportunity to clarify our powers to control aircraft noise at the designated airports. Our intention to legislate in this way was announced in the White Paper <i>The Future of Air Transport</i>. At the same time, we said that that did not signal any intention to make controls less stringent. That remains the case. It is clear to us, and every Member who has contributed to the debate today and at Second Reading emphasised, that tight controls on night flying will still be needed. The issue is what kind of controls. In the Bill, we are seeking a future definition of such controls. The changes that the Bill would make in no way prevent movement limits being set in future. They just permit different approaches.
</p>

<a name="51205-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>We want different approaches because we think that different approaches will be more effective. We do not want to dilute or weaken but to render more effective the way in which we regulate night flights. The Government have no immediate plans to change the way in which they currently set restrictions. The period up to 2012 is clearly set. We recently consulted on it and we do not intend to renege on that. I reiterate that point.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51205-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>I also emphasise that if a future government established a night restriction regime that controlled noise by noise quota alone, which has been the burden of several contributions to the debate, that would not necessarily result in a dramatic increase in night flying as planes become quieter. It would be open to that government to lower the quota count accordingly, perhaps so that, with the quietest planes flying, no more movements would be made available than had been the case previously. We are taking into account new technology. All past experience shows us, and all pressures are being exerted to ensure, that new technology improves the quietness of aircraft. We then need the flexibility to consider what that means in terms of movements.
</p>

<a name="51205-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>The noise quota will limit the number of operations that can take place during the night quota period, even if there are no explicit movement limits; for example, airlines using noisier aircraft would use up the allocation of the noise quota more quickly than quieter aircraft. Therefore, an even lower number of operations could take place. In other words, it would provide a very strong incentive for airlines to use the very quietest aircraft, which must be what we all wish to see develop in the future.
</p>

<a name="51205-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>A movements limit is a less targeted method of setting controls at night as it has no influence on the type of aircraft operating. Although I appreciate that the advantage of considering movements gives a degree of certainty to local stakeholders because people can monitor the situation more effectively, a future government would have to carry out a full public consultation on any future night-flying regimes that came into operation after 2012. There has been a long-standing convention to hold full public consultation on proposed restrictions. Of course, how could it be otherwise? We are all too well aware of the salience of the issue for those who live near airports.

<a name="51205-39_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   It is unfounded. I intend to develop the argument which establishes that point. I am grateful to my noble friend for that; I had seen that representation. We receive a plethora of representations in the department so he will not be surprised that I was not going to address any particular one. Some have greater wisdom attached to them than others. I am happy to concur broadly with my noble friend&#039;s remarks.

representation raised by my noble friend with regard to Windsor and Maidenhead. We are concerned about the effectiveness of the regime&#151;there is no hidden agenda. We are obliged to consult, and all future governments will be bound by the European legislation which implements the directive in UK law. That requires us to set out our proposals, the reasons behind them and our assessment of their impacts, and to consult interested parties when considering a decision on noise-related operating restrictions at an airport. We must also allow a reasonable time for consultees&#039; opinions to be taken into account before reaching a decision. Further to the point made by my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis, that scarcely looks like a hidden exercise or a closed agenda.
</p>

<a name="51205-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>This measure will give stakeholders, including the airline operators and local residents, the opportunity to make representations on the specific details of how the government of the time propose to apply the noise-control powers available to them. The requirement for the government to consult applies to all noise-related operating restrictions made at the designated airports. Therefore, I appreciate the intention behind Amendment No. 10 tabled by my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis, but I hope that he will accept the assurance that there is no need to place in the legislation a requirement for the Secretary of State to consult because we are obliged to do that under existing legal requirements. He asked me about that point blank when he spoke to his Amendment No. 10, which I hope he will not press.
</p>

<a name="51205-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>My noble friend also spoke to Amendment No. 12, which would require the Secretary of State to provide notice of operating restrictions made using his powers under Section 78 and to ensure that he had regard to all relevant considerations in deciding on those restrictions. I can also give him categorical reassurance on that point.
</p>

<a name="51205-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>The Government do not believe that it is necessary to include a requirement for a review of noise-mitigation measures&#151;the burden of Amendment No. 47 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. We undertake an ongoing programme of policy development and evaluation, research and regulatory impact assessment. It will be for Ministers at the time of a future consultation to decide on the evidence base that they need for their proposals. But, as I indicated to the noble Lord, as they will be involved in an entirely open consultative exercise, the kind of consideration built into his amendment will, perforce, obtain by any government who wish to sustain public confidence in any action. I give way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="51205-39_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I am having a job in understanding this. Following the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, obviously people do not like night flights. They accept that they have them but they are concerned that there might be an increase in their number. The fact that planes are to be quieter will not help them if there are to be many more flights. Obviously people are pleased if planes are quieter but they do not want many more night flights.

It is only right that, when an aviation Bill is before the House, we look towards the future of the industry, which, as the noble Lord knows, has very long timescales in almost every aspect of its operations. We are not talking about issues which need to be resolved within a year; nor would any action produce a response within a year. There are long lead times, particularly with aircraft technology. That relates very much to the question of the extent to which people are disturbed by night flying and the problems for those who live near airports.
</p>

<a name="51205-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>In this Bill, we are looking to provide the necessary measures for the government of 2012 and beyond. I presume that that will be a government of my persuasion but, for the purposes of this debate, the noble Lord can look forward to them being a government of his persuasion. Given the problem of night flying, which we all recognise occurs, we are trying to give any government at that time a framework within which they can act to the best advantage of our fellow citizens.
</p>

<a name="51205-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>The answer to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, is that the existing legislation, on which we have consulted and reached agreement and on which we will work, I emphasise, until 2012, is not the best framework for post-2012. It is not the best framework because, as I think the noble Lord will agree, this is simply a question of the number of night flights, and I am indicating to him that movements are of great importance.
</p>

<a name="51205-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>We all have real problems with measuring disturbance on the ground. It is not easy to identify what provokes disturbance in people. I am not saying that planes flying overhead every five minutes and producing 115 decibels of noise would not keep any average citizen awake. I am not saying anything as absurd as that. I am trying to emphasise that people&#039;s disturbance, which is the issue that we have to confront in relation to airline traffic, requires very careful measurement. We recognise that the criterion is not just the number of aircraft taking off or landing, although take-off is the major issue.

But I hope that the noble Lord will recognise that the intention behind the Bill is to create the necessary flexibility to take account of new technology and changes to the position adopted by people in relation to night flying. I hope that he will recognise that the Bill is about giving extra guarantees to people&#151;not on the number of night flights but in recognition of the disturbance factor suffered by people.

&quot;(1)   The Secretary of State shall establish an independent body to establish, maintain and monitor a penalty scheme.&quot;

<p><a name="st_81"></a>The noble Lord said: At Second Reading, there was a lot of unease in your Lordships&#039; House that these measures were tantamount to a privatisation of justice. Concern was expressed about the appropriateness of allowing a private company to establish a charging regime in which it would not only determine the circumstances for the collection of such charges but would also choose how to distribute the proceeds of the fines.
</p>

<a name="51205-39_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>These amendments are designed to address those concerns and to probe the Minister further on the creation of penalty schemes for aircraft that breach noise requirements. I must emphasise now that I am by no means opposed to the concept of using financial penalties to control the impact of aircraft noise for the benefit of persons disadvantaged by it. However, I am concerned at the manner in which the Bill proposes to introduce and administer such schemes.
</p>

<a name="51205-39_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>I have already touched briefly on the serious concern that we discussed previously&#151;the prospect that an airport operator could be responsible for deciding which noise and emissions objectives should be adopted and could then create a charging regime to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC91"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC91</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

enforce them. As I stated at Second Reading, in effect that would enable the airport operator to act as judge, jury and policeman.
</p>

<a name="51205-39_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>In short, the &quot;relevant manager&quot;&#151;a person, I might add, whose interests are served by the very same airlines he would be licensed to charge&#151;would be empowered to determine the appropriate level of noise at which to charge. As we have already discussed, given that there is already considerable mistrust among local communities in relation to the fairness, objectivity and transparency of the current in-house arrangements for monitoring aircraft noise and emissions, the fact that such an individual should be sanctioned by the Secretary of State to oversee matters of such fundamental importance is very surprising.
</p>

<a name="51205-39_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>Serious concern has also been expressed by the country&#039;s two leading airlines&#151;British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. Despite agreement in principle to the use of financial incentives to encourage the use of lower noise and emissions, British Airways writes that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;these powers could easily create a conflict of interests where an aerodrome or the Secretary of State sets a limit or increases a fine so as to create a fund for local projects without cost to themselves . . . Governance arrangements are therefore needed to ensure the fines are proportionate, proceeds of the fines are spent appropriately and users are consulted&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-39_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>At the very least, it is reasonable to have some process for accounting for how monies derived from penalty charges are spent, especially when one considers that the individual who controls that spending is the same person who decided that the fine was applicable in the first place. Conversely, how can we be sure that the fines levelled are of a value commensurate with the severity of the breach? I understand from the Explanatory Notes that the proposed charges will not exceed level 5 on the standard scale, which amounts to &#163;5,000. Moreover, how can we be sure that the penalty scheme, once initiated, is properly enforced? Who will monitor such penalty schemes when they are established so as to ensure that the aerodrome managers are enforcing them effectively and justly? It is important for both the public and the airline operators to have confidence in the equity of such a scheme.
</p>

<a name="51205-39_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>Again, from my studies of the Bill I learn that, much like the incorporation of noise and emissions considerations into landing charges, penalty schemes will also be introduced on a voluntary basis. However, as the Secretary of State reserves the right in certain circumstances to compel an aerodrome to adopt a penalty-charging scheme, I am interested to know what those circumstances would be and how such a scheme would be designed, implemented and monitored. If an airport were reluctant to initiate a penalty scheme of its own volition, how could one be assured that, once compelled by the Secretary of State, the scheme would be properly enforced?
</p>

<a name="51205-39_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>Furthermore, how will the area to benefit from these charges be determined? For example, will the person who is affected in the small hours of the morning by a noise event resulting from an aeroplane having strayed from its flight path receive any benefit from the fining <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC92"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC92</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of the airline operator; or will these compensations be reserved only for people in the immediate vicinity of the aerodrome?
</p>

<a name="51205-39_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>These amendments offer the opportunity to inject some much-needed accountability and consultation, elements that are conspicuously absent from the Bill. At present, where and on what penalties are spent seems to be based entirely upon the judgment of an individual. As I mentioned at Second Reading, such an individual could have a vested interest, or even relatives in the vicinity of the airport. If these decisions are left entirely to the relevant manager, should there not be more transparency at the very least? How does a member of the public who feels certain that aircraft are in breach of a penalty scheme ascertain whether the aircraft have been appropriately punished?
</p>

<a name="51205-39_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>In its current form, the Bill lacks the requisite checks and balances necessary to ensure that the charges are administered in an appropriate fashion and that fines are collected for the direct benefit of those affected by aircraft noise. I beg to move.

<a name="51205-40_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   I am not persuaded that the remedy sought by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, is desirable. At present, Section 78 of the 1982 Act legalises the practice of aerodromes fining airlines for breaches of noise limits on departure. Their enforcement power is to withdraw aerodrome facilities. That is too much. As I understand it, airlines never challenge fines imposed for this reason and the amounts involved have been declining as airlines have renewed their fleets. These powers could easily create a conflict of interest when an aerodrome&#151;or the Secretary of State&#151;sets a limit or increases a fine in order to create a fund for local projects without any cost to itself. The cost could be disproportionate and, crucially, the proceeds would not have to be used to mitigate the noise problem. Arrangements are needed to ensure that fines are proportionate, proceeds are spent appropriately and users are consulted. There is no difference of opinion between us, but the amendment is not entirely right.
</p>

<a name="51205-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>I have not tabled this as an amendment, but British Airways has suggested that there should be a change to new Section 78A(8) to read:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;The aerodrome shall make payments equal to the amount of those penalties for purposes which appear to be likely to mitigate noise disturbance for persons who are affected by the relevant operations. The relevant manager shall make publicly available an annual account showing the total penalties received and every payment made under the scheme&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>I am not entirely sure about that, but it is worthy of consideration.

As we are aware from our experience in Manchester, there are different occasions when people decide to ring in, and a small number of people seem to bother to ring in rather than large numbers. My noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis gave a suggestion from British Airways; I always take things that British Airways say with a certain amount of scepticism. Most of the major airports have already implemented major noise mitigation schemes, so further schemes are not going to be effective. There is no way that further noise mitigation schemes could affect the noise that some people suffer from and that wakes them up at night.
</p>

<a name="51205-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>I accept the point about having more transparency. Certainly in the case of Manchester Airport it is in the hands of the consultative committee rather than the airport manager. The airport manager receives the money and then spends the money in consultation with the consultative committee, which will have a scheme that will mitigate a number of things and will bring further community benefits to those areas affected by the noise. That is probably a way forward rather than trying to do it any other way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="51205-40_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   So in Manchester there is a voluntary scheme and the consultative committee is involved in the spending of money; it is not just the airport manager?
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="51205-40_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Smith of Leigh: </b>   It is consulted on, and the implementation of the scheme is a matter for the <br>&nbsp;<br>

consultative committee as well. Reports go to them, and they will receive representations when aircraft go off flight paths and create noise in other communities. Those incidents are reported on, penalties are received, and the money is spent with the interests of the consultative committee and the local communities in mind, not in the interests of the airport manager. Going back to the earlier point; the chief executive of Manchester Airport lives under the flight path, so perhaps he could get direct benefits if the noble Lord&#039;s scheme were implemented.

<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="51205-40_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am extremely grateful to my noble friend Lord Smith. I was going to refer to Manchester Airport, but he has already done so. He is right: these schemes are in place, and I think that we recognise the value that they represent in two respects. First, they condition the behaviour of airlines, and, secondly, they obviously incentivise better behaviour on the part of airlines organising their flights.
</p>

<a name="51205-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>My noble friend raised a most interesting point. I was not sure of the mechanics of the decisions on where the resources should go. I am certainly grateful that the system is a little more sophisticated that someone phoning up, complaining and getting a &#163;10 cheque through the post, which the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, rather whimsically indicated might be the lowest level at which it would operate. Of course, it makes sense for there to be full consultation on that.
</p>

<a name="51205-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>I think we would all have reservations about airport operators answerable to no one making decisions about where such resources would go after the proper benefits had been achieved in terms of conditioning airline behaviour. We are also interested in where some of the rewards might go. That is an interesting point, which we might develop in due course. I am grateful to my noble friend for highlighting the experience of Manchester. Manchester is at least equalled by Heathrow in terms of the charging regime. I do not have details on where resources go in relation to Heathrow, but I am able to confirm that we currently have a regime of constraint on airlines which break existing arrangements.
</p>

<a name="51205-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>I recognise the significance of this issue, but I hope that I can persuade the noble Lord that the creation of a new independent body may not be necessary to meet the objectives to which he subscribes and which the Bill is certainly directed at achieving. After all, monitoring noise is part of the day-to-day operational business of airports, including the designated airports, and I can reflect the fact that they have done so with some success and that they have carried out charging. The Civil Aviation Authority&#039;s environmental research and consultancy department advises the Secretary of State on noise monitoring procedures at the designated airports, as does the aircraft noise monitoring advisory committee, on which there are independent advisers. The consultative committees of the airports receive regular reports on noise and track-keeping and have the expertise to make detailed queries about the information that they are given. Therefore, the airport manager is answerable through that framework.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51205-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>I do not believe that the designated airports will be unwilling to penalise airlines for breaches of their noise control procedures. As my noble friend Lord Smith indicated, they are active where action is justified. Clause 3 merely gives statutory force to their existing actions to encourage airlines to improve their operational noise performance and, indeed, to charge penalties for breaches.
</p>

<a name="51205-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>We consider that the current practice has been working well. I say that not only because Manchester Airport has been quoted in this case; there are other examples too. Achieving adherence to noise preferential routes requires investment in procedures and training, which have a cost and time commitment associated with them. Therefore, if airports are already doing this, it is clear that proper thought has been given to the issue and that proper procedures are in place.
</p>

<a name="51205-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>We believe that the penalty scheme provisions will helpfully put beyond doubt the airports&#039; powers to charge penalties for breach of their noise restrictions. Clause 3 gives the Secretary of State the power to direct the establishment, revocation or amendment of a penalty scheme at those airports. That is right because the penalty scheme is intended to drive compliance with the noise restrictions which have been put into force. Given that reserve power for the Secretary of State, I do not think that there is a role for an independent body.


</p>

<a name="51205-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>My noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis threatened me with additional amendments later on. Well, he did not threaten me at all&#151;he promised me them; it is only I who look on amendments as a threat in any way, shape or form. He indicated that some constructive amendments might come forth in the not-too-distant future. Let me assure him that all the arguments which he advanced today will probably relate to the issues around Clause 4, when we reach that point. In fact, the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has tabled an amendment that sounds remarkably similar to the one that my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis may propose. But he will recognise that we shall have plenty of time to debate these issues; the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has already identified the salience of that point.

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, referred to charging 10 per cent at level 5; he was referring to Clause 2. They are not penalties for what we are discussing, however; they are penalties for failing to put in place noise measurement equipment. There are no provisions in this Bill for the level of charging. I may be giving the noble Lord fertile ideas to introduce them, but there are none in the Bill, and I want to reassure him on that point.

<a name="51205-41_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   Indeed, we do not intend that this legislation should in any way inhibit good practice. As the noble Lord said, Manchester Airport illustrates a useful practice. I agree that the great objective behind charging is to condition airlines&#039; behaviour, but that does not alter the fact that the local community should rightly have some real interest in where resources go. But let us make the obvious presumption: airports want to be good neighbours. They work within the environment of local community support or, at times, heavy local criticism. The second is extremely uncomfortable to them and the first is a reassurance that they are doing a reasonable job. So we recognise that, as my noble friend Lord Smith said, that is a way in which Manchester Airport has been able to win community support to the extent that it has.

</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is repeated four times in the Bill. Although the Marshalled List lists only three, there is another one further on. The amendment would take away from the managers of aerodromes, as they are called in the Bill, the discretion whether they establish and maintain a penalty scheme so that they will establish and maintain such a scheme. It should not be a discretionary power in any way&#151;either on the part of the Secretary of State or the aerodrome operator&#151;whether such schemes exist. We believe that such schemes ought to exist, because the making of noise and emissions is a very objectionable procedure. There should be a scheme for reducing noise and emissions, and each licensed aerodrome above a certain size should contribute to that process. The amendment simply seeks to draw from the Minister why this is a conditional &quot;may&quot; instead of an absolute &quot;will&quot;. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="51205-41_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for the way in which he moved his amendment. Section 78 does not provide for aerodromes to impose financial penalties on aircraft operators for breach of noise requirements set out under that section. The only sanction that has been available is to withhold entirely airport facilities from that operator, but that is a draconian penalty that has never been used. The clause inserts into the 1982 Act new Sections 78A and 78B.
</p>

<a name="51205-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>The noble Lord asks why the scheme is discretionary.

The noble Earl will know that non-designated airports are in places such as Barra. Are we proposing to make the scheme mandatory on Barra? We are not&#151;and that is why the scheme is discretionary and not compulsory.

<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="51205-41_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   I was certainly not intending to regulate Barra, Scilly or the Shetland Isles.

I know that there are certain designated aerodromes&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Smith, who is here, is chairman of Manchester Airport, for example&#151;that comply. But there are lots of other quite big airports that may not be subject to restrictions on noise or emissions.

</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>The noble Lord said: I wait for the Minister&#039;s attention. This is a highly technical amendment, which I am moving to probe the Government on their thinking. Noise is measured in decibels, which is a measure of sound power. A decibel is the power exerted on the human ear by a sound wave. Strangely enough, the increase in decibels is measured on a logarithmic scale. That means that it is not a normal scale of measuring.
</p>

<a name="51205-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>I shall relate it to speed limits, with which the Minister is familiar. If a 30 mph speed limit is increased to 40 mph, 50 mph or 60 mph, we know what effect that has on a motorcar. If you go through a 30 mph limit at 30 mph you can expect no penalty; if you go through at 60 mph you can expect a fairly severe penalty; and if you go through at 90 mph you can probably expect to have your licence withdrawn. If you increase the output of decibels from 74 to 78, that means the sound has risen 2.51 times. If you go on to increase it to 82 decibels, it has risen 6.3 times. That is equivalent to going through a 30 mph limit at 180 mph. That is the simplest explanation that I can give of what we are talking about. If someone has increased the output of decibels from 74 to 82, he has in fact subjected you to more than six times the amount of noise. That is why aircraft noise is particularly objectionable, and it is why the measurements taken at night wake people up&#151;they impact on them very strongly. They are not to be treated lightly.
</p>

<a name="51205-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>My object in moving the amendment is to ascertain whether the penalty systems that are to be designed adequately reflect the amount of noise that is created. On the face of it, the amount of noise appears small because the numbers look small&#151;from 74 to 82 decibels&#151;but actually the noise is increased six times. As I said, that is equivalent to going through a 30 mph limit at 180 mph, where you would almost certainly not only lose your licence but go to prison for some time. I put it to the Minister that these are important technical matters, which need to be taken into account in any penalty system that is designed. I hope that I have put the case simply. I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="51205-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>I just about understand what the noble Lord is pressing for, and he is correct in stating that the A-weighted decibel scale used to measure sound energy is logarithmic.  However, I do not agree with him that airports which establish a noise control scheme should therefore be required to charge penalties on a similar scale. Where we are in agreement is that it would be reasonable for an airport to set a penalty scale for breaches of the noise control scheme that was proportionate to the degree of nuisance caused by a breach. I also suggest that an airport might wish to be able to set penalties that recognised the frequency with which an aircraft operator made breaches, so that persistent offenders were given an additional incentive to mend their ways.
</p>

<a name="51205-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>These principles are already reflected in the penalty charges made by airports that run such schemes. But the Government believe that decisions on these penalties should be for the airport concerned, as they will be closely linked to the aspects of the noise control scheme that the airport sets up to address the effects of its operations on its locality. The powers of airports to set up noise control measures under Clause 4 do not extend solely to measures such as a noise limit&#151;which was the burden of the noble Lord&#039;s remarks&#151;when the degree of excess can be measured. Clause 4 also permits the enforcement of operating procedures, such as observance of noise preferential routes, or continuous descent approach. In such cases, where it might be difficult to assess the effect of a degree of non-compliance with the procedures or to do so in non-noise specific terms, such as distance, penalties that recognised the frequency with which breaches were made would be much more relevant than the actual count of the breach itself.
</p>

<a name="51205-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>I understand the noble Lord&#039;s attempt at greater precision and therefore more effective enforcement, but the amendment would actually limit the bad procedures that operators were pursuing, which the airport would be able to penalise. For that reason, I ask him to think that he has made a good try but has not hit the objectives that both he and I share.

<br>
(7)   The Secretary of State may issue a certificate of public interest declaring that material loss or damage as aforesaid was caused by acts of terrorism or an act of a state and such certificate shall be conclusive for the purposes of subsections (5), (6) and (9).

<a name="51205-42_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I have a similar amendment and that is why I asked for it to be degrouped. The amendments cover slightly different issues. I have received a full briefing on it today and have not had a chance to digest it yet. That is why I thank the Deputy Chairman for decoupling them and we shall return to it on Thursday. I support the inquiries by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, because my amendment covers similar ground, although it covers different issues as well.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="51205-42_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am not the slightest bit averse to returning to the matter on Thursday. We are guaranteed that by the degrouping, which will give us a chance to consider this issue further. Perhaps I can state the Government&#039;s position so that noble Lords are aware of where we stand on this important issue. As the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, said in his opening remarks, his amendment proposes a fundamental change in the way that the United Kingdom legislates for airline liability for surface damage caused by an aircraft. Although the perpetrators of a terrorist act would be legally liable for their actions, the British state would carry the financial burden of the consequences. As the Committee would expect, the Government have given this amendment very careful thought. At this stage, we are not persuaded by the argument. We may be pushed to be persuaded at any stage unless my noble friend looks at this issue again.
</p>

<a name="51205-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>First, the international dimension is completely absent from this proposal&#151;but air travel, by its very nature, is international. It is not an area where it makes sense for the UK to try to act alone. It would be illogical to limit airlines&#039; liability for events in the United Kingdom, including the liability of foreign airlines on our territory, without also dealing with the liability of UK airlines for events on foreign territory. The trouble with my noble friend&#039;s amendment&#151;I commend him for his efforts and for raising an issue of such significance and salience&#151;is that it treats the United Kingdom as an enclosed bubble and would not resolve any incident, for example, when a British carrier was in a third country. International terrorism, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC102"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column GC102</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

particularly when it deals with international transport, requires international co-operation and international answers.
</p>

<a name="51205-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>The airline industry of the United Kingdom as a European Union member state is legally obliged to hold minimal levels of third-party liability cover, including for terrorist risk; so too are third countries whose airlines fly in, over or to EU countries. That is an important protection for British and European citizens. I fear that my noble friend&#039;s amendment would call into question the continuation of the EC insurance regulations&#151;No. 785/2004&#151;because one might ask why an airline should continue to insure when there is no liability.
</p>

<a name="51205-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>Secondly, the amendment makes no mention of airline negligence, which of course is possible. The pros and cons of the issue of contributory fault are not ones that I dare to go into here&#151;I am not sure that I dare to go into them in any circumstances, as I am not a lawyer, but I certainly dare not do so here. My noble friend will recognise that to leave airline negligence out of the issue entirely is a serious and important omission.
<a name="time_11"></a>
<a name="51205-42_time0"></a><h5>7 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="51205-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>I also regret to say that changing the status quo in the way this new clause proposes would strike a wrong note about the Government&#039;s resolve to deter terrorism by signalling that it is the responsibility of the state and that financial reparation should be transferred wholly to the British taxpayer.
</p>

<a name="51205-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>We have no plans to exempt or limit airlines&#039; liability through UK legislation. We cannot do it and we will not. So what is the way forward? In the longer term a solution to the problem of capping airlines&#039; liability with respect to third parties is most likely to come via international agreement. This looks most likely in the context of the work being undertaken by the International Civil Aviation Organisation to revise the 1952 Rome Convention on third party liability, though we do not expect speedy decisions in that area. We are talking in terms of years not months. I can see from the Committee&#039;s response that I have struck a chord of recognition at least on that point.
</p>

<a name="51205-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>In the shorter term we need to be ready in case airlines are exposed to uninsurable risks. As your Lordships would expect, the Government are monitoring developments in the aviation insurance market closely. We stated after 11 September 2001:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;Should another terrorist incident lead to a lack of third party insurance, such that the UK aviation industry was unable to operate, the Government&#039;s intention would be to intervene as it did after September 11th&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>That remains our position.
</p>

<a name="51205-42_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>We are aware of calls by the aviation industry for states to indemnify airlines against third party war and terrorism risks. However, in balancing the risk we favour a solution that maintains as much market involvement as possible, and seeks to maximise the amount of commercial insurance available.

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>I realise that I am on a collision course with my noble friend, and that he has tabled his amendment with the best of intentions as regards securing the future of the UK airline industry. However, these are very big issues indeed. My noble friend will recognise the measured response that I have sought to give to him. I am sure that this is not the last we shall hear of this issue, but I hope he will recognise that the Government&#039;s position is not compatible with the proposal he has put forward.

<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="51205-43_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   Regarding my noble friend&#039;s comments on insurance, will he confirm that if there is a problem with the third-party liability, given the need for all the airlines within the European Union to act in a similar competitive way, there is always a risk that some of the other airlines and some of the other member states might be tempted to avoid state aids problems by getting a quick subsidy from their governments? Will my noble friend take that into account in the ongoing negotiations? The European Energy and Transport Forum, of which I am a member, has recently published a very interesting report on transport security&#151;on which I am no expert&#151;which emphasises the need for common rules across the Community to avoid unfair competition due to state aids, or lack of.
</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="51205-43_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   We are in difficult areas here. I think my noble friend will recognise that we are aware of the insurers&#039; position. If they pulled out, we might be faced with a situation in which our airlines could not operate. After the 9/11 incident in 2001, the Government provided third party war and terrorism cover via the Troika company. The market recovered completely after one year and the scheme was ended. At the time it was wound up, the Government indicated that should terrorism cover be withdrawn,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;such that the UK aviation industry was unable to operate, the Government&#039;s intention would be to intervene as it did after September 11th&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51205-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>This could be done through reactivating the Troika scheme. However, we all hope that such an eventuality does not occur. These are difficult areas, but I think the Committee will recognise that, so far as possible, we want things to look as normal as possible.

I could go into this subject in rather more detail. However, at this hour it would be better for the Committee to adjourn to consider what my noble friend has said. I am sure the Committee will agree that the issue is of immense importance and should not be dealt with cursorily. Therefore, we should be given an opportunity to read what my noble friend has said rather than comment rather abstrusely on the subject matter. He has advanced no reason why due consideration has not been given to what has been before the Secretary of State for about three weeks. It <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="51205-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>We have made remarkable progress today. We have passed Clauses 1 to 4, but, as I say, we are considering a subject of immense importance to all of us. What my noble friend has put forward may be perfectly reasonable, but we should have an opportunity to consider it rather than responding to it immediately. I hope that my noble friend will be prepared to say that the Committee should adjourn to consider the matter.

I do not want to talk for 20 minutes. Noble Lords who can entertain us might like to do that but I like to keep my contributions fairly short. I wanted to go through the briefing and speak to it succinctly on Thursday. That is why I was told earlier today that we were likely to finish at Amendment No. 25. I was not too worried about.

If the noble Lord continued to speak, he could certainly take us to 7.30, but he would be asked to withdraw the amendment, otherwise we would stay in session until that decision was taken.

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column WS43</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="wms_subhd_0"></a>
<a name="51205-44_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Army: Northern Ireland Battalions</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="51205-44_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>As part of our normal process of keeping force levels under review, the General Officer Commanding Northern Ireland (GOC NI), in consultation with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Chief Constable of the Police Service Northern Ireland (PSNI), has concluded that the remaining roulement battalion can be removed from his command as it is not required for routine support to the police in Northern Ireland. This follows a rundown in the requirement such that the tasks currently performed by this battalion can be delivered instead by resident battalions. Accordingly, the battalion known as Northern Ireland Battalion 1 (NIBAT 1) can be removed from the command of the GOC NI to Commander-in-Chief Land on the 16. January 2006.
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>This is a prudent measure to provide military support to the police efficiently and does not reflect the Army&#039;s ability to support the PSNI in countering the threat from terrorism and preventing potential public disorder. We will continue to keep force levels in Northern Ireland under regular review to match the support required by the PSNI.
</p>

<a name="wms_subhd_1"></a>
<a name="51205-44_head1"></a><h3 align=center>EU Budget</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="51205-44_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   As presidency of the European Union, Her Majesty&#039;s Government are today circulating to all member states of the European Union for discussion comprehensive proposals for the European Union budget in the next financial period 2007&#150;13 inclusive. Copies of the proposal are available in the Library of the House and in the Printed Paper Office.
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>This Written Ministerial Statement outlines the context of the proposal.
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>These budget proposals have four policy objectives:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_0"></a>The first is tough budget discipline. They are below the level proposed by the Luxembourg presidency in June and 17 per cent below the level proposed by the Commission.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_1"></a>Secondly, they help the new member states in the enlarged EU by building their economies and societies, and they more fairly distribute the costs among the better-off nations. The UK is offering an extra contribution to these costs of enlargement amounting to &#8364;8 billion over the budget period.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_WS44"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column WS44</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>
</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_2"></a>Thirdly, these proposals keep the rebate. Indeed, the rebate will rise from an annual average over recent years of &#8364;5 billion to around 7 billion.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_3"></a>Fourthly, these proposals ensure there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy. All spending, including on agriculture, will be subject to a review during the coming budget period.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="51205-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>Let me explain in more detail.

</p>

<a name="51205-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><i>The budget overall</i>
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>Last year the Commission proposed a budget of &#8364;1,025 billion, or 1.24 per cent of the total national income of all member states (&quot;GNI&quot;). We said all along that this was far too high. There would be no chance of any serious budgetary reform in specific areas without strong downward pressure overall. Given this, and the demand of the six &quot;budget disciplinarians&quot; (France, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Netherlands and UK), the Luxembourg presidency reduced its proposed budget to 1.06 per cent, or &#8364;871 billion. This latest proposal would further reduce the budget to &#8364;847 billion (or 1.03 per cent on the commitments basis) and by the end of the budget period spending will be below the 1 per cent level the six had proposed. This would be a major achievement.
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>It is important to see these proposals in a longer-term context. EU spending hit 1 per cent of GNI in 1985 and rose rapidly under Baroness Thatcher and Sir John Major as a proportion of national income, by a quarter to 1.25 per cent by the early 1990s. And it started to come down only in 1998. These proposals would bring it down further.

</p>

<a name="51205-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><i>Enlargement</i>
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>The new member states will receive &#8364;150 billion in structural and cohesion funding. That is an enormous amount and would represent very large new funds. Total funding through all EU programmes to the 10 new member states is worth twice the Marshall Plan which funded the reconstruction of Western Europe nearly 60 years ago (*at today&#039;s prices).
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>And we are ensuring that these countries will be able to spend much more of what they have been allocated. This is a very important point because the record shows that year by year both the existing and new member states have not been able to spend their full allocation for many technical reasons. We have included a series of very practical changes to ensure that they are better able to do so. This means that while headline entitlements are lower by &#8364;14 billion than in the June proposals, we are confident that all these countries will be better able to spend what they have been allocated. And we are proposing strengthened financial management arrangements.
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>Under our proposals, for example, Hungary would receive &#8364;22 billion in structural and cohesion funding the Czech Republic &#8364;23 billion and Poland &#8364;56 billion.
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>Of course there are those who ask why our taxpayers in western Europe should pay for roads, railways and other reconstruction projects in the east. The answer is that all enlargements have benefited all members <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS45"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column WS45</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

economically by increasing the total volume of EU trade, investment and jobs in which all have a share. British trade with the new member states has already increased by 400 per cent since 1990, ten times the rate of growth with the rest of the world. That is an indication of the economic potential we will be helping to unlock by making this investment in Europe&#039;s future. It is very much in Britain&#039;s national interest for the world&#039;s largest single market to grow and become more prosperous. And the benefits of enlargement are not just economic. It must be in Britain&#039;s interest to have increasingly stable societies in eastern Europe.

</p>

<a name="51205-44_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><i>The UK contribution</i>
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>As I have spelt out, and as these proposals make clear, the UK Government recognise their responsibility to pay a fair contribution to the cost of enlargement&#151;an historic project supported across the political divide. It has been a strategic objective of successive British governments and, happily, has enjoyed very active all-party support. The opposition parties have called for significant increases in structural and cohesion funding in central and eastern Europe. This budget delivers that objective. But it has to be paid for. We are all prepared to pay our fair share, but no more than our fair share.
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>As EU spending shifts from older member states to the new, the British contribution will inevitably rise, along with the contributions of all the EU 15 member states. But the proposals tabled by the Luxembourg presidency would have left us with a bill of more than &#8364;20 billion over and above the &#8364;50 billion that would be our contribution under existing arrangements. That was not acceptable then, nor is it now. The proposal we have tabled today will take our contribution to &#8364;58 billion over the seven-year period of the budget.
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>This is the equivalent of halving the value of the rebate in respect of structural and cohesion funding in the ten new member states. This could be achieved either by not applying the rebate to a proportion of structural and cohesion funding in the new member states, or by a technical route to increasing our gross contributions.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>The UK will in any event continue to receive the full value of the rebate as it applies to the Europe of 15, and to all CAP spending throughout the union. And the rebate will rise, because it increases in proportion to our net contribution. The rebate will increase from an annual average of &#8364;5 billion in the current financial period, to around &#8364;7 billion.
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>The rebate was negotiated in 1984, but it did not prevent a very significant rise in the EU&#039;s take of member states&#039; national income. Nor did it deal with the underlying problem which made the rebate necessary. And it did not prevent the UK paying twice as much as France and Italy, countries with similar sized economies. With these proposals today, Europe&#039;s spending comes down as a proportion of income. And for the first time since the UK joined 30 years ago, we would pay roughly the same as France and Italy as a share of national income.

</p>

<a name="51205-44_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>This is a budget which seeks to invest in Europe&#039;s future, and not only through enlargement.
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>Our proposals provide for a comprehensive and wide-ranging review, covering all aspects of revenue and expenditure, including agriculture. This will be conducted by the Commission, which will submit a report in 2008. On the basis of the review, the EU would be able to make changes in the 2007&#150;13 financial period.

</p>

<a name="51205-44_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><i>Conclusion</i>
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>We have always made clear that our overall aim is to secure fundamental reform of spending which would remove the underlying justification for the rebate. The mechanism we propose for a review both of revenue and expenditure undertaken by the Commission would put us on a pathway to a reformed European Union better able to compete in the global economy. The budget we have circulated today is a tough package which recognises the responsibilities of all members of the EU to both pay a fair contribution towards the future well-being of the Union.
</p>

<a name="51205-44_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>It provides a sound basis on which all our citizens can thrive in an enlarged European Union. A bigger, more prosperous European Union means a stronger, more prosperous Britain. These are good proposals for the UK and good proposals for Europe.

The council debate focused on supporting the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in research projects and the implementation arrangements of the future European Research Council. This partial general approach will provide a good basis for adopting a common position once agreement has been reached on the financial perspectives.

It noted that the objective of GMES is to provide, on a sustained basis, reliable and timely information related to environmental and security issues in support of public policy makers&#039; needs. My honourable friend, Barry Gardiner, who sat in the UK national seat, intervened briefly to stress that it was important to utilise the existing capabilities of GMES alongside developing new ones. The council also held an exchange of views on international collaboration based on a discussion paper tabled jointly by the EU and ESA presidencies. The debate focused on: the need to develop an overall co-operation strategy; EU/ESA roles and responsibilities; and the financial principles that should apply in funding. The UK intervened briefly to support the development of a collaborative approach but noted that this should pay due consideration to community competence. Vice-President Verheugen (Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry) and ESA Director-General Dordain provided an oral report to the council on the progress of European space policy.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a>A key principle of the Government&#039;s approach to addressing the health concerns of veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict is that there should be appropriate research into veterans&#039; illnesses and factors that may have a bearing on these.

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column WS49</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51205-45_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a>In its 2003 review of research into 1990&#150;91 Gulf veterans&#039; illnesses, the Medical Research Council included the recommendation that information from existing epidemiological and mortality studies should be linked. The Ministry of Defence subsequently commissioned a study led by Professor Macfarlane, of the University of Aberdeen. A paper reporting the results of the study is available on the website of the <i>International Journal of Epidemiology</i> in advance of hard-copy publication. The study examined both the longer-term mortality of Gulf veterans and, for those veterans that participated in the main epidemiological surveys of UK Gulf veterans, whether there was any relationship between self-reported experiences during deployment or illness at the time of survey, and subsequent death. The researchers report that, 13 years after the end of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict, there is no difference in the overall mortality of Gulf veterans compared with a similar group that did not deploy. The paper also says that an increase in death associated with certain reported exposures is not statistically significant and that excess illness reported by veterans during health surveys was not related to an increased risk of death.

<a name="51205-45_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a>I am pleased to inform the House that I have today formally published the interim report of an independent panel that has been set up to consider whether the licensing fees are set at the right level.
</p>

<a name="51205-45_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a>The panel&#039;s terms of reference are to:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_5"></a>consider whether the fees cover the full cost to licensing authorities;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_6"></a>identify the scale, extent and nature of any problems encountered by licensees/licence payers and licensing authorities ;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_7"></a>make recommendations about how the existing fee structure and levels could be developed;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_8"></a>ensure best practice is being fully realised across all authorities; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_9"></a>identify how the regime could be developed to address any other issues including impact of the fee scales on sports clubs, village and community halls.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="51205-45_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a>While the panel, which includes representatives of local government, local communities and industry, has collectively concluded that it is too early to take a view on the current fee levels associated with the Licensing Act 2003, it has made the following initial recommendations to the Government:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_10"></a>there should be a central source of information on fees addressed to licence payers, which explains why the system has changed, what the new system <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_WS50"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column WS50</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>does for licence payers and their duties and responsibilities, as well as what licensing authority responsibilities are to licence payers;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_11"></a>an annual date should be set for the payment of the annual fee with incentives for paying it;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_12"></a>consideration should be given to simplifying the application process, particularly in relation to advertising applications and clarification of the requirement for &quot;professionally&quot; drawn premises plans; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_13"></a>there should be no impediment to licensing authorities making their monitoring, enforcement, and administration more efficient and cost-effective.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="51205-45_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a>We will now fully consider the panel&#039;s recommendations.
</p>

<a name="51205-45_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a>The interim report also identifies areas that the panel will now consider further, including:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_14"></a>Licensing authority income and costs.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_15"></a>Licensing authority inspection and enforcement regimes and the variability of Licensing authority approach.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_16"></a>The model for calculating fees.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_17"></a>Simplification and number of applications.

</p>

</p>
</ul>
<a name="51205-45_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a>The panel is due to publish a final report on the fee levels in the autumn of 2006. Where it is able to do so, it will make further recommendations in advance of its full report.
</p>

<a name="51205-45_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a>I can re-affirm today that costs incurred by local authorities in meeting their requirements under the new Licensing Act will (provided they have been incurred legitimately and efficiently) be fully met by fees within the national fee regime. There should therefore be no liability for the council tax payer because of the new licensing regime. My department and the Local Government Association will work with the independent fees review panel as a matter of urgency to agree the process for verifying these costs.
</p>

<a name="51205-45_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a>Everyone involved in the new fees system can rest assured that, if evidence proves that the current system needs fine-tuning, we are fully committed to doing just that.
</p>

<a name="51205-45_para28"></a>

Following initial consultation regarding established bio-medical ethics committees, it has been determined that a new and dedicated ethics group is required to provide independent oversight of board decision-making.

<p><a name="wms_st_9"></a>
<a name="51205-46_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My honourable friend the Minister of State for Northern Ireland (David Hanson) has made the following Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51205-46_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a>The Government have today published for consultation draft guidelines setting out how community-based restorative justice schemes should work with the police and other statutory criminal justice agencies in dealing with low-level crime. The guidelines establish a framework for implementing recommendation 168 of the review of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland, which recommended that community-based restorative justice schemes could, subject to specific safeguards, have a role to play in this area. The safeguards include upholding the human rights of all participants; receiving referrals from the criminal justice system; being open to inspection by the independent Criminal Justice Inspectorate; and adhering to high standards.
</p>

<a name="51205-46_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a>The draft guidelines make clear that it is for the Police Service of Northern Ireland to investigate crime and for the Public Prosecution Service to decide how offences should be dealt with. Community-based restorative justice schemes must have an acceptable and appropriate relationship with the criminal justice system, including the police, as envisaged in the review.

<a name="51205-47_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Planning Delivery Grant</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_10"></a>
<a name="51205-47_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"></a>In July 2002 my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced that he would be making an additional &#163;350 million available to local authorities over the period 2003&#150;06 to improve the delivery of planning services. Since then, we have announced that the planning delivery grant (PDG) will continue, with a further &#163;255 million being made available in the period to 2008. We have now decided the basis on which we will distribute the development control and enterprise areas allocations of the planning delivery grant of &#163;135 million in 2006&#150;07 and will be informing recipients of their provisional allocations.
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_81"></a>The grant is performance related. Our aim is to enhance the resourcing of the planning system in a way that drives performance improvement and ensures effective delivery of our objectives for sustainable communities. It is specifically targeted towards meeting the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s public service agreements (PSA) 5 and 6. PSA 5 aims to achieve a better balance between housing availability and demand. PSA 6 requires all authorities to have local development frameworks in place (in accordance with agreed local development schemes) and to meet the best value development control targets by 31 March 2007.
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a>I can confirm today that the development control allocation is &#163;78 million (57.7 per cent of the total grant), with &#163;71 million going direct to authorities to reward their improvement towards and achievement of best value development control targets in the period October 2004 to June 2005. The assessment is based on three quarterly performance figures this year because the announcement of the first allocation of PDG has been brought forward. It is now in line with other announcements of grant and this will help to increase certainty in local authority budget-setting processes. This allocation will be paid to local planning authorities at a district and county level, national parks, regional planning bodies, the Broads Authority and the Greater London Authority. A provisional &#163;2.2 million is also being made available to authorities with enterprise areas in their boundary.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS55"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column WS55</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51205-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a>This year we have increased the incentive for authorities to meet targets by allocating three-quarters of the overall development control allocation for meeting targets and a quarter for performance improvement. In addition authorities that meet all three targets will receive a bonus of &#163;50,000. The awards will be weighted to take account of workload and performance, and the rewards for meeting the major targets, or improving in this area, will be weighted more significantly.
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a>For the first time there will be a top slice of &#163;7 million from this development control total, which will be used to support authorities towards meeting the target. We agreed, following a review of development control carried out with the Prime Minister&#039;s Delivery Unit, that up to &#163;5 million would be made available to the Planning Advisory Service and ATLAS, the team supporting authorities dealing with large housing applications in the south-east. A top slice of &#163;2 million from this total will be used to reward and incentivise authorities that are proactive in performance management of applications, especially through the use of electronic tracking of applications, and handling of backlogs. I will make a further announcement on what this will entail early in 2006.
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a>As in previous years, the development control allocations are subject to an abatement related to performance on appeals. Where an authority&#039;s performance on appeal is 40 per cent worse than the national average (32.63 per cent of appeals upheld against the authority), 10 per cent of its development control allocation will be abated. Where this performance is 50 per cent worse than the average, this abatement will increase to 20 per cent of the development control allocation. This condition underlines the continuing importance we place on quality in decision-making.
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"></a>Grant allocations are not ring-fenced and authorities have complete discretion in the way they spend this money. However, to encourage investment for the future, 25 per cent of the total grant paid to any individual authority must be spent on capital. The remaining 75 per cent can be spent by the local authority on resource or capital budgets.
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_87"></a>The final condition imposed on authorities ensures that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has the power to act appropriately to partly withhold payment or recover part or all of grant paid where there are concerns over the accuracy or proven inaccuracies in the information on which allocations were made. I may consider withholding up to 10 per cent of the grant allocated to authorities whose best value performance indicator 109 (BVPI 109) has been qualified by the auditor until we have established to our satisfaction the reason for the qualification and the reliability of the data on which grant was allocated. Following this I may seek to recover some or all of the moneys paid to those authorities.
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_88"></a>Today&#039;s announced allocation remains provisional and so remains subject to a final determination of grant which will occur when the second announcement is made.

</p>

<a name="51205-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_89"></a>The second announcement will cover all other aspects of the grant, including rewards for e-planning (&#163;5.7 million), plan-making (&#163;20.8 million), high housing demand and growth areas (&#163;16 million) and low demand pathfinder areas (&#163;2.5 million). It will also include top slices for the Planning Inspectorate (&#163;2 million), regional planning bodies (&#163;6.5 million), the GLA (&#163;100,000) and a national initiative of planning bursaries (&#163;1.32 million). This second announcement is expected to be made in March 2006. All these figures, along with those for development control and enterprise areas, remain provisional and subject to final determination by Ministers with agreement by Treasury.

<p><a name="wms_st_11"></a>
<a name="51205-47_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_91"></a>This Statement concerns a package of changes to planning policy the Government are announcing today. We are consulting on draft planning policy statement (PPS) 3: <i>Housing</i>, draft planning policy statement (PPS) 25: <i>Flooding</i> and we are publishing a new green belt direction. Copies of these documents will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

</p>

<a name="51205-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_92"></a><i>Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 3: Housing</i>
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_93"></a>The Government&#039;s housing policy aims to deliver a step on the housing ladder for future generations of homeowners, quality and choice for those who rent, and, sustainable, mixed and inclusive communities. To do this, we need the planning system to provide for new homes which are well-designed and built to high environmental standards, in places that are well located, with good access to jobs and key services.
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_94"></a>Draft PPS3, which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is publishing today, is a key component of our strategy to deliver more homes where they are needed. It provides a national policy framework for those at regional and local level responsible for developing planning policies. It advocates an evidence-based approach, including the use of sustainability appraisals, in order to ensure that development plans provide a sound framework for deciding planning applications.
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_95"></a>Draft PPS3 introduces important changes in the approach to planning for housing. Planning needs to be more responsive to the housing market, and to take account of affordability alongside the social and environmental impacts of development. It continues the priority for brownfield sites. It attaches high importance to the design and mix of housing that is delivered in new developments to improve the quality of residential environments and contribute to the delivery of sustainable communities.

</p>

<a name="51205-47_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_97"></a>The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is also today issuing through a circular to local authorities a new Town and Country Planning (Green Belt) Direction.
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_98"></a>This new direction will come into force on 3 January 2006 and will, for the first time, specifically require planning applications for inappropriate development of certain types and scale in the green belt which local planning authorities are minded to approve to be referred to my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister. The direction will ensure that the Secretary of State has the opportunity to consider whether to call in for public inquiry and his own determination the more significant and potentially most harmful development proposals in the green belt before they can be approved. However, the Secretary of State will continue to use his powers of intervention selectively, in line with his call-in policy.
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_99"></a>The introduction of a new, free-standing green belt direction demonstrates the continuing importance that the Government attach to the protection of the green belt.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_100"></a><i>Planning Policy Statement (PPS 25: Flooding</i>)
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_101"></a>To strengthen the key role of the planning system in managing flood risk we are publishing for consultation:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_21"></a>a new planning policy statement (PPS)25: <i>Development and Flood Risk</i>;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_22"></a>a proposal for a flooding direction; and

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_23"></a>a proposal to make the Environment Agency a statutory consultee for planning applications in flood risk areas.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="51205-47_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_102"></a>The draft PPS25 strengthens and clarifies planning policy on development and flood risk to:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_24"></a>ensure flood risk is taken into account at all stages in the planning process;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_25"></a>avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_26"></a>direct development away from areas at highest risk.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="51205-47_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_103"></a>The proposed flooding direction will provide greater scrutiny for major developments proposed in flood risk areas. Where local authorities intend approve applications that the Environment Agency still objects to, ODPM could consider whether to call them in for decision by a Minister.
</p>

<a name="51205-47_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_104"></a>Making the Environment Agency a statutory consultee for planning applications in flood risk areas will reinforce implementation of PPS25 by ensuring that the agency is able to advise on all applications where flood risk is an issue.

<a name="51205-48_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Tax Credits</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_12"></a>
<a name="51205-48_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My right honourable friend the Paymaster General has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS58"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column WS58</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51205-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_105"></a>The child and working tax credits are today benefiting over 6 million families and 10 million children. Tax credits tailor support to families&#039; specific circumstances, providing more support when their need is greatest. They represent a more generous and inclusive system of income-based financial support than any previous system.

</p>

<a name="51205-48_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_106"></a>Over the past seven years the Government have reformed Britain&#039;s tax and benefit system to achieve three overarching aims: to provide adequate financial incentives to work; to reduce child poverty; and to recognise the responsibilities of parenthood by supporting families with children. These reforms have helped make work pay and reduce the numbers of children in absolute poverty by one and a half million. Tax credits have been an important part of this success and they represent the best way to continue it in the future.
</p>

<a name="51205-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_107"></a>In my Statement of May 26 I outlined six measures to improve the administration of tax credits. These aimed to improve HMRC&#039;s communications with tax credit recipients, reduce the risk of errors and improve the procedures for recovering overpayments. Significant progress has been made in each of these areas.
</p>

<a name="51205-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a>Building on these improvements to the administration of the system, the Government are today announcing a package of further improvements most of which will come into effect over the next 18 months. The measures reflect the experience of the first years of operating the tax credit system and strike a balance between providing more certainty and stability of financial support for families, while maintaining flexibility to respond to changes in their income and circumstances. The measures also include clear responsibilities for claimants to report changes affecting their award.

</p>

<a name="51205-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a>The tax credits system is an annual one&#151;integrated with the tax system&#151;within which payments can be adjusted to reflect changes in a family&#039;s circumstances and income. Under an annual system, given a family&#039;s final entitlement cannot be known until the end of the year, some level of end-year adjustment will be necessary. However, for some families, especially those on lower incomes, downward adjustments to tax credit payments&#151;to reflect changes in circumstances reported within the year or when awards are renewed&#151;can sometimes cause difficulties. This is a particular problem where claimants had not realised their payments were too high. Better communications, which is a key part of the measures announced on 26 May, will help by improving claimants&#039; understanding of the system.
</p>

<a name="51205-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_110"></a>Today&#039;s measures will improve matters further, providing greater certainty for claimants, especially those on lower incomes, through measures to reduce the need for adjustments caused by rising income and to limit the effects of adjustments. These are supported by measures to reduce the likelihood of unexpected downward adjustments resulting from inaccurate or out-of-date information about a family&#039;s income or circumstances.
</p>

<a name="51205-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_111"></a>Analysis of overpayments suggests that they result from a number of factors: income rises from one year <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS59"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column WS59</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to the next; families overestimating the extent to which their income has fallen when they seek extra support during the year; provisional payments made at the start of the tax year, which are based on out-of-date information that is subsequently updated when the award is renewed; and delays in reporting changes in families&#039; personal circumstances to HMRC.
</p>

<a name="51205-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_112"></a>The improvements announced today will provide greater certainty for claimants, particularly those on lower incomes, while maintaining flexibility to respond to falls in income and changes in circumstances.
</p>

<a name="51205-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_113"></a>To increase the flexibility of the system, from April 2006 there will be an increase in the limit on the amount that family income can rise over the current tax year without affecting tax credit entitlement for that year. The current annual income disregard of &#163;2,500 will increase to &#163;25,000. This will mean that, for instance, a family where a non-working partner moves into work on average earnings will not see their increased income lead to a fall in their tax credit entitlement during that year. This will maintain the incentives for people to move into work, while removing a major cause of the overpayments seen in the first two years of the system&#039;s operation.
</p>

<a name="51205-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_114"></a>To provide greater certainty of award for claimants, from November 2006, automatic limits will be imposed on the extent to which tax credit payments can be reduced to recover higher payments in the earlier part of the year which could lead to an overpayment for the year as a whole. These limits will be set at the same levels at which overpayments from a previous tax year are currently recovered. This will guarantee that low- to middle-income families do not face large and sudden falls in their tax credit income, and reassure people who report changes promptly.
</p>

<a name="51205-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_115"></a>To tackle the problem of families overestimating falls in income, from April 2007, when claimants report a fall in expected income during the year, their tax credit payments will be adjusted for the rest of the year to reflect their new income level, but will no longer include a one-off payment for the earlier part of the year. At the end of the year, their award will be finalised when their actual income is known. If they have been underpaid, a further payment will then be made. This approach will provide a buffer against any overpayment accumulated by the family during the year, especially where their estimate of income proves to have been too low.
</p>

<a name="51205-48_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_116"></a>Today&#039;s measures will also give claimants clear responsibilities to report changes promptly and more regularly. They will be helped to keep their records up to date, including through more proactive contact by HMRC, allowing HMRC to base tax credit awards on the best possible information.
</p>

<a name="51205-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_117"></a>In summer 2006 the deadline for providing information to finalise and renew tax credit awards will be brought forward by one month to shorten the period during which provisional payments may be made using out-of-date information.
</p>

<a name="51205-48_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_118"></a>From November 2006, the range of changes reducing entitlement that must be reported to HMRC <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS60"></a>

<b>5 Dec 2005 : Column WS60</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

within three months will be expanded to include changes in work status or in the number of children for which the family can claim support. From April 2007, the time allowed to report such changes will be reduced from three months to one.
</p>

<a name="51205-48_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_119"></a>In early 2007, towards the end of the tax year, HMRC will contact key groups of claimants to obtain more up-to-date income information on which to base the next year&#039;s payments while the finalisation process is completed. And from 2008&#150;09, the income figure used in setting provisional payments will be uprated by average earnings where up-to-date information has not been provided.
</p>

<a name="51205-48_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_120"></a>In line with their commitment when tax credits were announced in 2002, the Government have looked to learn from the early operation of the system and will continue to do so. Together these measures, and the six measures currently being implemented by HMRC, will lead to steady and ongoing improvements in the tax credits system, allowing it to deliver support even more effectively to millions of families. Without the changes announced today, initial estimates suggest that subsequent years&#039; overpayments would be of broadly the same level as in 2003&#150;04. When fully implemented, it is anticipated that today&#039;s changes will reduce the value of overpayments by around one third. I am still considering whether there is more that can be done to alert claimants about the recovery of an overpayment before HMRC starts to collect it but the scale of changes to the computer system that would be needed mean that this could not be done quickly.
</p>

<a name="51205-48_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_121"></a>I believe that these further measures will help to ensure that tax credits strike the right balance between flexibility and certainty for claimants and give clear messages about the need to report changes to HMRC. They are a positive response to the issues raised by the Ombudsman and others and will go a long way to meet the concerns they have expressed.
</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_123"></a>The PBR sets out the actions the Government are taking to continue improving compliance in the tax credit system. As announced on 2 December, as part of its ongoing compliance work, HMRC has identified and stopped attempts to defraud the tax credits system by making claims through the tax credits e-portal. HMRC has closed the e-portal while it develops new checks to ensure the system remains secure. A criminal investigation is also being undertaken into the apparent false use of a number of DWP staff identities in fraudulent tax credit claims. It would not be appropriate to make any further public statement at this stage. DWP and HMRC are carrying out an in-depth investigation into how this happened. They are also working quickly to identify the records concerned and to ensure they are corrected.</p>

<a name="51205w01_sbhd0"></a><h3 align=center>Breast Cancer</h3>


<p><a name="wa_qn_0"></a>
<a name="51205w01_wqn0"></a><b> The Countess of Mar </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>Further to the publication of <i>Breast cancer: an environmental disease&#151;the case for primary prevention</i> by the United Kingdom Working Group on the Primary Prevention of Breast Cancer, what powers the Health Protection Agency has to prioritise the primary prevention of disease and to reduce the exposure of the population to toxic substances.  [HL2524]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="51205w01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has an advisory and not a regulatory role with respect to control of chemicals to which the public may be exposed. It is the role of other government departments and agencies to enforce regulations to reduce the exposure of the population to toxic substances. These regulatory powers reside with the Health and Safety Executive for occupational safety, the Department of Trade and Industry regarding safety from consumer products used in the home etc, and the Environment Agency regarding environmental exposure from various sources. However, the advisory role of the HPA means that if it did have concerns it could influence the department/agency with the policy lead.
</p>

<a name="51205w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>There are many recognized risk factors for breast cancer. Some of the most clearly established are reproductive, and other known risk factors are age, ethnic group, family history of the disease, history of benign breast disease, socio-economic status, use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy; also, in postmenopausal women, obesity. In addition, the Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COC) made a statement in 2004, showing that alcohol consumption can cause breast   cancer (www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/coc/alco04.htm). The COC has also looked in detail on a number of occasions at the evidence to support the hypothesis that breast cancer is causally related to persistent organochlorine pesticides. They have consistently concluded that there the evidence does not support a causal association.
</p>

<a name="51205w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>The view of the Chemical Hazards and Poisons Division of the HPA is that there is no evidence to support the view that exposure to specific chemicals is a cause of breast cancer. Thus, the agency would not argue a case for any prioritization in this area.

<p><a name="wa_st_2"></a>
<a name="51205w01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   Article 4(1) of the delegation order places consultation requirements on the designated body, the Professional Oversight Board for Accountancy (the POBA), to consult in respect of regulations which it makes under the powers in the order. Article 4(2) provides that these requirements do not apply where the POBA considers that the delay involved in complying with them would be prejudicial to the public interest.
</p>

<a name="51205w01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>However, it is expected that reliance on the provision in Article 4(2) of the order would rarely, if ever, occur. The requirements in respect of consultation are in line with those set out in the Cabinet Office <i>Better Regulation Code of Practice on Consultation</i> (publication ref: 270621/0805/D5), which also provides for circumstances when full consultation may not be appropriate.
</p>

<a name="51205w01_para3"></a>

<p><a name="wa_st_28"></a>
<a name="51205w04_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   This information is not available centrally. Primary care trusts and the prisons in their locality jointly assess mental health need and commission services accordingly. The assessment that prisoners receive on reception will identify those at risk of having a significant mental illness. For those so identified, or who present later with mental health needs, follow up will include primary mental health care or assessment and intervention by the specialist mental health in-reach team. Across the National Health Service in England, 360 mental health in-reach staff are now in post and providing services to 102 prisons. This exceeds the NHS Plan commitment for 300 such staff to be in post by the end of 2004. The care programme approach aims to help to ensure continuity of care upon release. In 2003, 721 prisoners whose mental illness was too severe were transferred to hospital. Work is ongoing to improve this process so that prisoners can be transferred more quickly.

<p><a name="wa_st_31"></a>
<a name="51205w04_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   All maintained schools are obliged to meet the requirements of statutory national curriculum science, which includes elements of sex and    relationship education. Beyond the statutory requirements, schools are able to use the non-statutory framework for personal social and health education to deliver sex and relationship education, taking into account the views of parents and the age and the physical and emotional maturity of the children.

<p><a name="wa_st_32"></a>
<a name="51205w04_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   Animal studies provide useful data and are the best models that we have, if it is accepted that there are differences between species and a few types of adverse effects that are seen in humans cannot be identified in animal studies. It is recognised that there will be some differences in the results seen in various species, which may be interpreted as over or under-estimating toxicity. Nevertheless, this is allowed for using uncertainty factors, to allow for extrapolation between species and individual variation in the response in humans, using expert judgment to account for the uncertainties involved.

<a name="51205w05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   Since the Trident nuclear deterrent became operational in 1994 and 2004&#150;05, annual expenditure for capital and running costs, including the costs for the Atomic Weapons Establishment, has ranged between three and four percent of the annual defence budget. Comparable information on the costs of the UK&#039;s nuclear deterrent before 1994 is not available centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate effort.

Partnership and for them to judge priorities against the needs of their local area. Connexions Cornwall and Devon have taken decisions about their engagement with the voluntary sector and this has helped them to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in the number of young people not in education, employment or training during the period November 2002 to November 2004.
</p>

<a name="51205w05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_28"></a>Jobcentre Plus has also supported Wheels to Work schemes in Cornwall. Jobcentre Plus were able to provide substantial funding (&#163;34,100) to the Wheels to Work scheme in West Cornwall, in its initial stages, for the financial year 2004&#150;05. This was funded through the Transport Projects Fund, which is a national fund accessible only to action teams. To date the project has supported 130 people; 49 referrals to the project have come via Jobcentre Plus offices or European Social Fund (ESF) providers. Of these referrals, 61 have gone into employment and 17 are attending training courses at various colleges in west Cornwall.

<a name="51205w05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_29"></a>In Devon, Jobcentre Plus has provision under the District Manager&#039;s Discretion Fund to consider funding for local projects.
