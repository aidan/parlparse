<H4><center>Tuesday, 26th March 2002.</center></H4>
<H4><center>The House met at half-past two of the clock: The LORD CHANCELLOR on the Woolsack.</center></H4>
<H4><center>Prayers&#151;Read by the Lord Bishop of Gloucester. </center></H4>



<a name="20326-01_head0"></a><H3><center>House of Lords: Elected Member Options </center></H3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord McNally </B>  asked the Leader of the House:
<P>
<P>

<a name="20326-01_para0"></a>Whether an opportunity will be provided for the House to debate and choose among the various options on the size of the elected element in a reformed House of Lords.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, making time available for debate is a question for the usual channels. The consultation period on the White Paper ended not long ago and we want to make sure that we have considered the responses fully before we proceed any further.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, does the Leader of the House agree that taking refuge in the "usual channels" is the parliamentary equivalent of consigning the matter to a black hole? Will he take note of the cross-party Select Committee in the House of Commons and Early Day Motion 226 in another place which recommend a largely or totally directly elected House? Is not the noble and learned Lord's prevarication about consulting this House really because he is petrified that such consultation will reveal an identity of analysis and purpose between the two Houses which would allow for a rapid and radical reform of this House? Is he not clinging to a system of patronage which would have made James I blush?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   On the other hand, my Lords. It is very cruel and wicked to call Chief Whips a "black hole" as a collective noun. I have read the report of the Public Administration Select Committee&#151;it is an interesting document&#151;and I have looked at the EDM. We recognise that there are differences of view. But what unites us is the desire to make this place better, and that means looking at its composition and the way it works. Those matters are well in hand.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, on two occasions over the past 12 months the Government have asked the House to debate and vote on the issue of hunting, but they refuse to bring forward any further proposals on the House of Lords. In view of the disagreements that exist between the Houses&#151; and very often within the parties&#151;is it not time for the Government to review their position on the setting up of an authoritative Joint Committee of both Houses to examine these issues in the main?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, it is true that we have discussed hunting on two occasions. We have <P>


<a name="column_158"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>put our minds occasionally to House of Lords reform&#151;indeed, on 21 occasions&#151;including in 1999 a single debate which lasted 14.8 hours, although it felt longer. In the Session 2001-02 we improved ourselves still further by having a single debate for 16.6 hours. The one thing that no one can say with any semblance of accuracy is that we do not discuss the most important issue&#151;that is, our own future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, does my noble and learned friend's answer mean that there will or will not be a Bill in the next Session?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Barnett knows that it is quite inappropriate to guess or speculate about the contents of the Queen's Speech. However, your Lordships will have read with great interest the Prime Minister's speech at the London School of Economics. Should any of your Lordships not have had the opportunity to do so, I commend it. He said, quite unambiguously, that we are now in the third phase of the Labour Party's programme. The third phase&#151;this appears at page 9 of the speech&#151;includes,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"completing House of Lords reform, bedding down devolution and making the peace process in Northern Ireland durable for the long term".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-01_para1"></a>
So completing House of Lords reform is very much on the agenda for this present phase, which is the third phase. We do not intend to leave it as unfinished business.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, what is the object of debating this affair unless the Government are prepared to fulfil their undertaking and set up a Joint Select Committee of both Houses on all aspects of reform?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, that was not the undertaking. The undertaking was that there should be a Joint Committee on the parliamentary consequences, the parliamentary aspects, not on composition&#151;which, as the noble Lord is aware, was exhaustively debated by the Royal Commission chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham. The point of debating the future of the House of Lords, as I understand it&#151;apart from its intrinsic interest to all of us&#151;is to come to a conclusion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   My Lords, have the Government considered further the issue of indirect elections from the Assemblies and the Parliament to this second Chamber?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, yes, of course. I am most obliged to the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, for raising this issue. It is a proposal which is put forward quite often from those who are Members of either the Assembly in Cardiff or the Parliament in Scotland. The proposal has its attractions, but it also has disadvantages.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, is my noble and learned friend aware that if he wants to complete the process <P>


<a name="column_159"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of reform of the House of Lords, the Government have to produce proposals which are broadly acceptable to both Houses? Is he further aware that it now seems that the House of Commons would accept a division of 50 per cent elected and 50 per cent not elected as a minimum percentage of election? Is he also aware&#151;I hope that he is&#151;that the 50:50 proposal would probably now be acceptable to this House? If so, is not that what the Government should do?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with my noble friend Lord Richard, but obviously we shall need to look for broadly acceptable proposals. I also endorse his reading of what our colleagues in the House of Commons feel. It may well be the case that the 50:50 split might be acceptable in this House to avoid the revolutionary enthusiasm of the "80 percenters".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, would the noble and learned Lord agree&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I think that it is the turn of the noble Lord, Lord Renton.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, is the noble and learned Lord aware that democracy is fully represented in the other place, but only on a party basis&#151;and that there is a lack of the talent, expertise and experience to be found in this House? If this House were democratised, it would be shameful were we to lose the independent benefit and judgment of the Cross-Benchers and the vast amount of talent and expertise that exists here. Does the noble and learned Lord agree that to democratise this House to too great an extent would be to hurt the constitution?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, not long ago, the Conservative Party had a majority of about 300 in this House, and I never heard any complaints about party advantage on those occasions. I know the deficiencies of democracy. They offer themselves to my mind every single day.

<A NAME="20326-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<P>

<a name="20326-01_para2"></a>Whether they are taking action to anticipate the possibility of a serious outbreak of measles.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  My Lords, the Department of Health is working closely with health authorities with the aim of increasing the current <P>


<a name="column_160"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>rate of MMR uptake in order to reduce the risk of measles. The department has also taken advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation on strategies to respond to any resurgences of measles, mumps and rubella.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his reply. Do the Government accept that some parents are worried about the triple vaccine because it deals also with mumps and rubella, and because of rumours about side effects such as autism? What are the Government doing in order to reassure the public?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-01_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, let me make it clear that the Government's independent expert committee, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, and indeed the Committee on Safety of Medicines, have reviewed the kind of suggestions that the noble Lord has raised. Their advice is that there are no new data relevant to the safety of MMR vaccines. The Committee on Safety of Medicines has concluded that the current scientific evidence does not support a causal link between MMR vaccination and autism or bowel disease. I fully accept that there is a need to ensure that scientific information is available to parents who are concerned. It is our intention to let parents have that information&#151;not in a lecturing way, but by giving them the data so that they can then make their own judgment.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Taverne: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that, although there is no reason to suspect a link between the measles vaccine and autism, what is absolutely clear is that it will not make a hoot of difference whether three vaccinations are given at one time or they are given separately? Is it not the case that the immune system of babies is perfectly capable of dealing with a thousand vaccines at one time; and is not the campaign for separate vaccines the most illogical of all the campaigns against this matter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I have a great deal of sympathy with the noble Lord's point. If we go back to the arguments that Dr Wakefield has used, he is suggesting that there should be a year's gap between each of the injections. That would take a five-year timetable in order to give the six vaccinations that would be necessary as compared to the MMR, where two vaccinations are needed: the first between 12 and 15 months, and the second some three years later. In addition, if single vaccines are used, there is absolutely no guarantee that children will have all six vaccinations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, is it not equally important to draw the attention of the public, and particularly of mothers, to the dangers of not vaccinating? Should not the evidence now available from the German town of Coburg&#151;where a large number of mothers were persuaded not to have their children vaccinated, and where there is now a very serious outbreak of measles&#151;be brought to the attention of the public?
<P>


<a name="column_161"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, that is an important suggestion. It is clear, if one looks back over the past 20 years or so to 1980, that there were nearly 140,000 notifications of measles and 26 deaths; by 2001, the number of notifications had been reduced to 5,773 and the number of deaths was down to one. I have no doubt whatever that the introduction of the MMR vaccine has proved to be highly effective in this country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that all the professionals concerned in this matter are totally supportive of the way in which the Government have handled the issue? Does he further agree that the root of the problem lies in the rather irresponsible reporting of what is clearly anecdotal evidence which has given rise to alarm? Is not the base of the problem the difficulty of educating the public in the notion of risk and the need to focus on this in the future, so that we can prevent this kind of thing happening again?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, there is much in what my noble friend has to say. That is why the public information programme that the department is now developing is focused on providing information for parents, through NHS Direct and other mechanisms, about the scientific evaluation that has been undertaken so that they can make an informed decision. It is worthy of note that the recommendations on MMR that we have received have been supported by the WHO, the BMA, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the Royal College of Nursing and the Community Practitioners and Health Visitors Association.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I am the eighth of nine children, all of whom had measles. Why has measles become such a serious disease? Has the virus mutated? In my childhood, it was a normal disease that most children expected to get.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I have heard that theory put forward, but there has always been a high cost to some members of the community who catch measles. I quoted the figure of 26 deaths in 1980 compared with today's figures. That shows beyond any doubt as far as I am concerned that the introduction of MMR was one of the most effective public health measures that has been undertaken in this country. I have no doubt that it was the right decision at the time and that we are right to support MMR now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister bring us up to date on uptake figures for the MMR vaccine? I understand that there is a considerable difference between urban areas and country areas, with the country areas doing much better. Does that not show that countrymen have a lot more sense than urbanites?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Not exactly, my Lords. I do not think that the figures quite support <P>


<a name="column_162"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that interesting supposition. The noble Lord is certainly right to suggest that the uptake figures give cause for concern. The latest figures that we have, for 1999-2000, show an 88 per cent uptake. We need to get up to the middle 90s to have what is described as herd immunity. There are enormous variations. The figures for London are particularly worrying, with some of the London boroughs down to the 60 per cent mark. However, there are also urban areas with very high figures. Barnsley, which is not entirely a rural community, has 94.9 per cent coverage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   My Lords, I have a personal interest to declare in that my daughter-in-law is going to have a baby on 24th July, which will make me a grandmother. She asked me whether I think that she should have the triple vaccine. When I was a little girl, my mother used to send me out to play with children who had measles so that I would catch it and get it over and done with while I was very young. Now I believe that the triple vaccine is a wonderful thing and has advanced us enormously. My daughter-in-law wants to know whom she should ask to get an authoritative opinion on whether it will be the right thing for her.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I very much recommend that she asks her general practitioner. She may also contact NHS Direct, which will also be able to give informed advice.

<P>
<P>

<a name="20326-02_para0"></a>Whether they will move in the United Nations or the Security Council for the globally enforced abolition of nuclear weapons.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Grocott: </B>   My Lords, the Government have made it clear that we are committed to the ultimate goal of verifiable global nuclear disarmament. We continue to press for mutual, balanced and verifiable reductions in the numbers of nuclear weapons worldwide. When we are satisfied that sufficient progress has been made to allow us to include British nuclear weapons in multilateral negotiations without endangering our security interests, we shall do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend has given the affirmative Answer that I hoped for. As he says, the Government have long been committed to the idea of getting rid of nuclear weapons. Is not the time now right to follow the suggestion of the International Court of Justice to initiate discussions in the United Nations with a view to committing all the nations concerned to nuclear disarmament?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Grocott: </B>   My Lords, I know of my noble friend's long-standing interest in this matter. We are currently preparing for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty preparatory committee, which will be held in <P>


<a name="column_163"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>New York from 8th to 19th April. That treaty is very much the cornerstone of the Government's policy and has been for a number of governments. My noble friend will acknowledge that the goal will not be achieved overnight or by means of resolutions; it will be achieved by a long and sometimes arduous process of small steps. That is what the Government have been doing. He will know from the letter that he received from my noble friend Lady Symons following his previous Question on the subject that the Government have taken a substantial number of steps. A copy of that letter has been placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, does the House a great service by his persistence in raising this vital issue? Does he also agree that in this age of suicide bombers and rogue states, with the non-proliferation doctrine under severe pressure and with huge leaps in technology in anti-missile defence, the entire doctrine of mutual nuclear deterrence has now reached a crossroads? Does he further agree that your Lordships' House is an ideal place in which to debate the issue thoroughly and put the new choices before the British public? Will the Minister press his noble and learned friend the Leader of the House, the usual channels or whoever needs to be pressed to get us debating that as soon as possible after Easter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Grocott: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord knows that it is beyond my competence to deliver the precise agenda for the House. I very much agree that this House is extremely good at having extended debates on such issues. We had a very good debate last night on international terrorism, with particular reference to Afghanistan. Yes, the world has changed since September 11th and we need to be constantly vigilant in assessing the situation post that date.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, while we await that debate with some anxiety, will my noble friend confirm that the non-proliferation treaty rests on an undertaking by the nuclear powers to negotiate in good faith to bring about the end of nuclear weapons? Does he agree that that undertaking has not been honoured and that we might find that the non-nuclear powers will wonder whether this is perhaps a one-sided arrangement? Is not the time to save the world while there is still a world to save?

<A NAME="20326-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Grocott: </B>   My Lords, my noble and learned friend rightly draws attention to the central importance of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. I repeat that it is not fair to say that this Government have done nothing. I am sure that my noble and learned friend was not saying that. He was talking about the nuclear powers generally. We have taken a number of important steps. We have signed and ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, we continue to promote its entry into force and we continue to press for negotiations to begin at the conference on disarmament on a fissile material cut-off treaty. Those are all important steps. I would not <P>


<a name="column_164"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be so presumptuous as to overstate the Government's position, but the steps that we have taken have been important and have been an example to other states. With people such as my noble and learned friend pressing me and the Government, further steps will be taken in the direction that he would welcome.

<P>
<A NAME="20326-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   My Lords, in view of the meeting that is anticipated between Mr Putin and President Bush in the summer, at which those matters will be further discussed, is it the Prime Minister's intention to raise the issue of nuclear non-proliferation with President Bush at his Texas meeting shortly?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Grocott: </B>   My Lords, the relationship between the USA and Russia has obviously been even more important since the events of September 11th. Indeed, their close co-operation on a number of important issues has given cause for mild optimism. I am not able to give the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, an answer on the precise nature of the agenda for the meeting between the Prime Minister and the President. As he will know well enough, however, although great significance always attaches to this type of summit, the simple truth is that regular communication between friendly heads of government is, in a sense, far more important than the dramatic hype that sometimes attaches to such meetings. It is the regular communication between the two men that is important.

<P>
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para1"></a>Why the number of staff employed by the Railway Inspectorate this year will increase to over 200 compared with 31 employed in 1987.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, the Railway Inspectorate was under-resourced to monitor and enforce safety standards on the privatised railway, as confirmed by Lord Cullen's report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that reply. However, comparing the 1987 report with that for this year, one notices that this year's report is three times as large, lavishly illustrated and demonstrates, in my view, a concentration on presentation rather than substance. This week, large advertisements for inspectors have appeared in The Times newspaper and in the trade press for inspectors. I draw the noble Lord's attention to the fact that inspectors are drawn from the small pool of railway <P>


<a name="column_165"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 165</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>engineers. Moreover, the more people there are inspecting the work, the fewer competent people there are to do the work. That applies across many sectors.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I am not certain that I heard a question there. However, I think that the House would have substantially more sympathy for the argument that there are too many rail inspectors if there had not been such a disastrous sequence of appalling railway accidents over the past 10 years. I remind the House, as though it needed reminding, of Southall, Ladbroke Grove and Hatfield.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para2"></a>When the railways were privatised, there was a move from assigning responsibility for safety to one operator&#151;British Rail&#151;to assigning it to a plethora of bodies, train operating companies and Railtrack. The move substantially increased not only the number of bodies which had to be supervised for rail purposes, but the interfaces between those bodies which themselves had to be adequately policed. Lord Cullen's report was quite clear that the Health and Safety Executive, through the Railway Inspectorate, had to have more resources if it was to restore public confidence&#151;which has been so severely shattered&#151;in the safety of our railway network.

<A NAME="20326-03_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, was the Minister aware that there were not enough inspectors in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I can well believe it; recruiting high-quality public servants is often a problem. I am therefore sure that the noble Baroness will be delighted to celebrate the fact that this Government have succeeded in recruiting a substantial number of railway inspectors. Some 113 railway inspectors are now in post. In comparison, I believe that, in 1996, there were some 49.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, what are the other 87 people doing? Does my noble friend agree that, alongside railway safety, many of them are writing standards? It does seem a bit odd that there are several hundred people writing standards. What purpose does that serve?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I shall not enter into a detailed disquisition on how safety standards are informed in this country, as I suspect that many noble Lords know much more about the subject than I do. Essentially, however, the system does not attempt to inspect every single failure, but tries to put in place safety regimes. The bodies responsible for safety&#151;in this case, the train operating companies and Railtrack Plc&#151;must demonstrate that they have regimes to appraise risk and to establish safety and training regimes that adequately minimise the possibility of those risks becoming accidents. The Health and Safety Executive essentially monitors compliance with those safety regimes. Consequently, it is quite appropriate that people are writing the types of standards to which my noble friend has referred.

<A NAME="20326-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </B>   My Lords, could the Minister please answer the question asked by my noble friend Lady Blatch?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, was the question about why there were vacancies in the past?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the question was whether the Minister is aware that there was a need for more inspectors in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, no, I was not aware of that, and I do not see the thrust of the question. I have not inquired in detail into why there was a failure to fill inspectorate vacancies under the previous government. However, I have certainly been aware of the efforts made by this Government to fill vacancies in the Railway Inspectorate. That task has been remarkably successfully completed, and I am sure that the House celebrates that achievement.

The amendment which I am moving is of a somewhat unusual type, but there are good precedents. The ever helpful Public Bill Office showed me one, of 1887, which argued that,
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
My view of this Bill is similar. However, I thought that it might perhaps be less confrontational to take as a model a more recent amendment, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, in 1992. The noble Lord, Lord Peyton of Yeovil, I know, had it in mind to table a similar amendment.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para9"></a>Once again, I declare a marginal interest: my wife's small herd of Welsh Blacks on the Welsh hillside.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para10"></a>The debate on Second Reading can have left the Government in no doubt that most Members of your Lordships' House thought the timing and nature of the Bill profoundly unsatisfactory. Some 22 speakers were critical of it, many strongly so, and only three gave it their support. No fewer than 14 speakers, a number of them greatly respected authorities, made the point that it was wrong for the Bill to go forward without knowledge of the conclusions of the inquiries set up by the Government.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para11"></a>Having taken part in that debate and listened to so many powerful speeches, I thought that the Government might at the end of it have taken the advice of a song in one of the early Astaire/Rogers films, the theme of which was,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Pick yourself up, dust yourself down and start all over again".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-03_para12"></a><P>

<a name="20326-03_para13"></a>I expected that, at any rate, the Government would table amendments making major changes in their proposals. I waited week after week for a government reaction, but none came until last week, when we had from the Minister three useful amendments on detail but nothing fundamental. My wife suggested to me that the Government would probably have the Committee stage just before Easter when some of their critics might have departed on holiday. She was right.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para14"></a>I am sure that, in the light of what was said at Second Reading from all sides of the House, we need to make a fresh start. I do not believe that the present Bill, however extensively amended, will do. We must remember that the other place, which passed the Bill without amendment, would have to agree to any changes that we make. Nor are the Government likely to compromise on changes urged by this House, however reasonable, to judge from the announcement that they made about hunting last week.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para15"></a>Part 1 of the present Bill is based entirely on legalising and extending the mass slaughter of animals. Your Lordships may remember the conclusion of the notable speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, who said of the mass slaughter policy that she did not believe that farming families or the wider public would stand for a similar policy in the future. Once again, vets would be asked to take action against their professional judgment. Surely, that is not a road down which we should now go.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para16"></a>Part 2 of the Bill, on scrapie, which also appears to be based on disputed science, may result in the extinction of many rare breeds of our sheep and is, at best, premature. Therefore, I do not believe that it is sensible for us to devote time and effort to debating amendments to such a Bill. We can tinker with it and perhaps remove the worst aspects, but we cannot hope <P>


<a name="column_168"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 168</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to change its fundamental thrust. I see no prospect in Committee of turning it into a sensible and an acceptable piece of legislation.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para17"></a>However, it would be sensible to wait for the results of the Government's latest consultation exercise and, above all, for the relevant inquiries that they themselves set up. Will distinguished people be willing to take part in such official inquiries if the Government take no notice of them and go ahead with legislation on the very matters that they have been asked to consider without waiting for their recommendations? Can the Minister say whether it is correct, as reported in the press on 16th March, that the Attorney-General, during a hearing last month, argued that the inquiries would establish quickly the best ways of dealing with any future outbreak? If so, perhaps any Bill should wait until we know what are the "best ways".
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para18"></a>Once the conclusions of such inquiries, including the lessons learned inquiry chaired by Dr Anderson, have been received and studied, the Government can, if necessary, rewrite the present Bill or, preferably, replace it with a much better one, that would be acceptable to the veterinary profession, the farming community and countryside bodies and interests and which can go forward with general support.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para19"></a>The Government's case for the present Bill has been based throughout on what they perceive as an urgent need. As the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said in introducing it, the first part,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"gives government as rapidly as possible powers which they currently lack".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-03_para20"></a>
Yet, what kind of rapidity can there be if two-and-a-half months elapse between Second Reading on 14th January and the opening of the Committee stage today and if in a whole year nothing effective is done about the import of meat from countries where foot and mouth is prevalent, and nothing effective is done to put an end to illegal imports either in commercial consignments or in personal baggage?
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para21"></a>In any event, if, god forbid, foot and mouth breaks out again, as it may, given the Government's failure to act firmly on imports, the Government already have powers to deal with it. They have set out in their recently published contingency plan their preliminary thoughts on how it may be tackled. They foresee a countrywide ban on all animal movements on confirmation of an outbreak and, I am sorry to say, the continuation of the contiguous cull, which last year resulted in the slaughter of so many thousands of perfectly healthy animals. But at least the plan says that that is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an interim plan until the results of the official Inquiries into the 2001 Foot and Mouth outbreak are published".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-03_para22"></a>
It also says that the plan,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"does not aim to pre-judge the outcome of the Inquiries".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-03_para23"></a>
That is rightly so. Surely, exactly the same should apply to legislation.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para24"></a>I put forward this amendment as a Cross-Bencher, as an independent. In no way is it a political initiative, but an effort to facilitate a sensible and lasting solution to a very serious agricultural problem, which affects the lives and livelihoods of a great many people in our <P>


<a name="column_169"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>country. In considering what I now suggest that the House should do, I have tried to put myself in the place of the supporters of different groups in the House. We Cross-Benchers, of course, do not act as a group, but if I were a Conservative, I would have paid close attention to the notable speeches of those on my Benches who spoke with long experience, detailed knowledge and expertise. Criticisms, on which all those distinguished Peers agreed, would have strongly influenced me and would have led me to support an amendment such as the one that I have tabled.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para25"></a>If I were a Liberal Democrat, I would recall the amendment suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, at Second Reading. She said that there was quite a strong feeling that the  Government should have considered the recommendations of the inquiries that they had commissioned and that that would have been the time to bring forward comprehensive legislation. I have noted that she raised the point again at Question Time on 31st January when she received a dusty answer from the Minister. It appears to me that my amendment is fully in line with that for which the Liberal Democrats argued.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para26"></a>If I were a Bishop&#151;a position far above my humble aspirations&#151;I would have been strongly influenced by the speech made at Second Reading by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford, which drew more praise from around the House than any speech that I can remember. Once more, I would regard what he said as leading to an amendment such as mine.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para27"></a>If I were a Labour Peer I would reflect on the current perception of the Government as being unconcerned about the countryside and the people who live in it. I would be anxious to dispel that perception and to see the Government I support bring in a Bill that tackled the grave problems of animal diseases in a way that was accepted by vets and farmers and that was based on the best available scientific and practical advice. I would want to wait until the inquiries had reported and to see the Government respond to them.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para28"></a>Therefore, I conclude that this amendment is in the best interests of the Government. For reasons that appear good to them but that I do not myself find persuasive, I understand that the Liberal Democrat Party and the Conservative Party would, if the Government remained obdurate, prefer to put off any challenge until a later stage. It is not clear to me why, on a matter of such great importance to so many in the country, they are willing to allow the Committee stage to proceed, with the implication that the Bill may ultimately be acceptable. That may prove to be a waste of time and effort. I am surprised that they are willing to leave it to a Dad's Army of myself and like-minded colleagues to make a case for delay based on obvious common sense. Nevertheless, I hope that my amendment will commend itself to the House. In any event, I shall be glad to hear the views of other Members. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20326-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, I warmly congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Moran, who moved the amendment so ably. As he was kind enough to say, I had had thoughts of tabling a similar Motion. On reflection, I thought that it would come very much better from a noble Lord on the Cross Benches rather than from a somewhat more committed opponent of the Government.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para32"></a>The thought behind the Motion is that, before embarking on detailed consideration of the Bill, it would be helpful to have available as clear a picture as possible of what went on during the recent epidemic. The reports from the inquiries that are now in progress&#151;Anderson, the Royal Society and the National Audit Office&#151;would have shed some light on those events. Even more valuable would have been the report of a public inquiry, had the Government not run away from one. Had they not done so, they would now have the advantage of being able to say, as few governments can say with honesty, "We listened and we learned". The criticism that they face today would at least have lost some of its edge.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para33"></a>As matters stand, the Bill has few friends, and almost none in your Lordships' House. It is widely seen as an attempt to attribute what went wrong to the lack of sufficient powers and a yearning for new ones so drastic that they should not be granted without reasons far more cogent than any that have so far been advanced. Assurances that the powers now asked for would never be used are foolish. They leave quite unanswered the question, "Why take them?"
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para34"></a>In the event, it was not a lack of powers but a lack of any coherent strategy on the part of what was then known as MAFF that was the cause of the mess and muddle which were the main features of the epidemic. The impression given was that no one knew what to do or how to do it. Lessons of 1967 had been forgotten; defences against just such an event had been neglected, if not dismantled. The protection of their own image seemed to have an almost indecent priority in the Government's mind. Fairness to those who had been hurt and a chance to have their say, the need to learn from what had gone wrong, and measures to be taken to prevent a recurrence were subordinated to that one consideration.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para35"></a>Even now, one has to ask what has been done in the way of protection against imports of infected meat. If the Government have no idea what to do, perhaps they <P>


<a name="column_171"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 171</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should consult their French colleagues, who know a great deal about how to deal with unwanted imports. It might be helpful to the Government to take a leaf out of their book.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para36"></a>The subject of vaccination, too, appears to have been lost. It has become bogged down in endless discussion in Europe. It would be interesting, even at this stage, to know what view Ministers now take of vaccination. I hope that they will not keep it a close secret for too much longer.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para37"></a>I do not want to extend my remarks too much. I finish on this note. MAFF now has a new name and address. Although I dislike these acronyms, the fact that it has moved to what is now known as DEFRA, which recognises the intimate connection between agriculture and the environment, is welcomed. However, it would appear from the Bill that the move has done little to change the creature's habit of mind&#151;stubborn and unreceptive, as it showed itself to be in the matter of organophosphates, which was so consistently pressed by the noble Countess, Lady Mar. Its successor, thinly disguised, is now asking Parliament to furnish it with almost unfettered powers to order the slaughter of any animal and to authorise its inspectors to enter on land and there do more or less as they see fit. Surely, such powers should not be given to those who do not enjoy a degree of trust which, at least in this context, the department manifestly lacks.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para38"></a>It would seem appropriate to postpone further consideration of a Bill which is objectionable in its content, which has the support of few outside the Government, which most of us believe is wholly unjustified and one which, if the Government press ahead with it, will be greatly regretted.

I shall resist the temptation to follow my noble friend Lord Peyton in his castigation of the Bill, which is justified.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para39"></a>I should like to ask the Government two questions. They are both aligned to each other. First, what is the point of setting up committees if one does not wait to hear their findings before taking action? Secondly&#151;this is almost the same question in reverse&#151;what is the point of introducing a Bill when one does not know what those committees may say? It makes a total mockery of the exercise of setting up professional bodies. The urgency to which the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, referred earlier is not so great. If it were, it would surely not have been worth while to set up the committees in the first place, but the Government did set them up. Why did not the Government wait to hear the recommendations of the committees before introducing a highly controversial Bill?

<a name="column_172"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 172</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>legislation and to help the Government to dig themselves out of a black hole of their own choosing, so that the Bill may eventually be based on proper and sound knowledge and information. We shall have that knowledge when the reports of the National Audit Office and the Royal Society into the foot and mouth disease epidemic are published. As it currently stands, the Bill appears not to be about animal health. It appears to be about animal death, slaughter, killing, destruction&#151;a licence for mindless murderers to enter our houses and kill the pet goats in our kitchens. That, surely, cannot be what legislation is about. Law should be based on reason, logic and sense, so that people want to keep it. Anyone who supports that concept must also support my noble friend Lord Moran.

<A NAME="20326-03_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   My Lords, I was not present at the Second Reading of the Bill, for which I apologise. I was on part of a study tour to New Zealand. On entering New Zealand, we were confronted with very specific notices about foodstuffs that were not allowed in the country. People's cases were emptied and some of the contents confiscated. On entering Australia, where I stayed for only two days, my shoes were removed and disinfected. All those measures related to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease that had occurred in the United Kingdom in 2001. It struck me that there was far more consciousness about the insecurity of imported foodstuffs in those countries than there was in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para40"></a>In principle, I should like to support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Moran. He was formerly a constituent of mine, albeit as a Member of this House he was unable to vote. But I know of the sincerity of his concern that we do not have all the information that we require in order to legislate in an intelligent way about this huge tragedy of foot and mouth which struck the United Kingdom during the year 2001.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para41"></a>I believe personally that to debate the Bill as it stands is a test of whether the Government have good will towards the farming community and the rural areas. One of the reasons why later on we wish to test this matter in Committee is that we want to find out whether they will accept any of the tabled amendments which would much improve the Bill. Indeed if the Minister accepts those amendments then the Bill will be transformed.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para42"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Moran, that the Bill as it stands is totally unacceptable. The fact that we have not had the reports from the National Audit Office and from the Royal Society mean that there is a huge chasm of missing information and knowledge. That information surely will be contained in the reports of the Government's own committees which have been set up to investigate these matters. It is essential that we have this information before we can legislate properly. Let us test the Government on these matters.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para43"></a>As the Bill stands, the powers are draconian so far as concerns the disposal of animals, particularly those from contiguous culls. In my home area of Powys <P>


<a name="column_173"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 173</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>many farmers and their families suffered grievously during the recent outbreak of foot and mouth. The noble Lord, Lord Moran, at Second Reading described the situation as swirling around. It certainly was in Powys during the middle of 2001. It was almost like a medieval situation where the fear of a disease was enormous. One could understand&#151;looking back over the centuries&#151;what it must have been like with something like the Black Death. It was that bad.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para44"></a>I see no effort in the Bill to consider a properly constituted task force should an emergency of this kind occur in the future. Obviously, with regard to my previous remarks, we need to have equally good legislation to prevent the disease from coming into the country again, as do the New Zealanders, the Australians and others in the world. We urgently need legislation for that because that is a vital missing part of the equation.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para45"></a>The disease did not start in this country but we need a task force to be set up in readiness, rather like civil defence, that is properly directed and trained. The training should go down to civil servants, the farmers themselves and their farm workers. This should be tested from time to time as is civil defence. Therefore, if there is an emergency we are ready for it and know precisely what to do. That was not the case in early 2001. People's memories were not long. I was around in 1967 but many people had not even seen the disease.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para46"></a>So there are many matters of that kind that are not in the Bill but which should be there. The test of whether the Government have good will left towards farming and the rural areas will be in the way that they approach and accept amendments on the Bill. Therefore, it is sensible to wait and see whether this transformation comes about. We can on Report, if necessary, put the Government to the sword and to the test as to whether the Bill, as amended at that point, is in an acceptable state.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para47"></a>The Minister has had a very tough time, as have his colleagues, because foot and mouth is a terrible disease. I believe that he has, as indeed do the Government, the will to come to a sensible and humane conclusion that the co-operation of the farming community is needed to protect their animals from foot and mouth. One should never legislate on a worst-case scenario. We all know what happened when the poll tax legislation came along. It was totally unsuitable. It alienated the population. I make a plea to the Government not to alienate the rural dwellers and the farming community. We should all co-operate together. We can do that only by bringing forward a constructive Bill which will be substantially amended from its present form.

He said, "No". He explained that the Bill would cover part of what is needed. I believe that whether or not we like it, as legislators, we should support the Bill. There are many Bills that pass through this House that we may like or dislike, but we debate them and we debate the amendments. When we agree with the amendments we try to amend the Bill. I am quite sure that noble Lords in this House will do exactly that with this legislation.

<a name="20326-03_para49"></a>I believe that it would be wrong for us to hold up this legislation. Indeed, I feel more strongly than that: it would be totally irresponsible for us to do so, having been told by the Minister that we do not have the legislation at the present time to cope with foot and mouth.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para50"></a>It is rather strange that we hear this afternoon that there is no urgency for this matter. All the way through the debates on foot and mouth disease&#151;and I was here for almost all of them&#151;we were told how urgent action was needed; how the Government had dragged their feet; and how things had to be done as quickly as possible. Now we hear the opposite. As I previously said, it would be irresponsible for us to wait for the reports. That could put us back months. It would be irresponsible because as legislators we have a duty to act in the best interests of the people. In this instance I am sure that we need legislation.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para51"></a>If we do not take any action and&#151;God forbid&#151;foot and mouth comes back, we know who the people will blame. We need to firm up laws when they do not suffice. The laws on foot and mouth do not suffice. The livelihoods of many people were affected. There was tragedy throughout the countryside. We cannot afford for that to happen again. We need this legislation.

<A NAME="20326-03_spnew22"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Hereford: </B>   My Lords, I also wish to express my very strong support for the noble Lord, Lord Moran. He has most eloquently and persuasively moved the amendment. When I spoke at Second Reading I described the Bill as harsh, unjust and untimely. I have had no reason to alter my opinion.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para52"></a>Many of us had hoped that the long interval between the Second Reading and the re-emergence of the Bill may have suggested that the Government were really having second thoughts, significantly revising the Bill and working hard to improve it. Rumours had been circulating of welcome changes within the ranks of DEFRA. I suppose that in our most wildly hopeful moments some of us had visions of the Bill being scrapped altogether, sunk without trace after the barrage inflicted on it in January; although the response of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, to that debate was, as I remember it, fairly robust.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para53"></a>At the very least, we had visions of officials at DEFRA toiling late into the night, burning the candle at both ends to produce a fat volume of really significant amendments to the Bill, which, as it stands is indeed a very horrid thing, crude and delusive, in the <P>


<a name="column_175"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 175</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>language of that wonderful 1887 Bill that the noble Lord, Lord Moran, quoted. Alas! The Government amendments are derisory and pitifully inadequate. They are welcome as far as they go, but that is certainly not far enough. The Marshalled List owes its substance to the many noble Lords who have tabled their own, mostly excellent amendments.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para54"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moran, was right to say that there is no prospect of turning the Bill into sensible and acceptable legislation. The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, pointed to the omission of any serious attempt to portray the manner in which another outbreak would be dealt; who would have responsibility; and how the command chain would work. The noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, misunderstands the matter of haste. In debates, there was said to be a need for much greater haste in slaughtering infected animals and disposing of their carcasses, but that was not achieved because of the enormous scale of the slaughter.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para55"></a>The Bill asks for more slaughter. There is no evidence of any system being in place by which animals could be slaughtered quickly and the carcasses disposed of equally quickly.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para56"></a>The untimeliness of the Bill is the main reason that I support the noble Lord's Motion. There has been no Government justification for insisting on bringing back this Bill before the outcome of the two reports on the science of foot and mouth disease and the lessons to be learnt. The Government have just published their own contingency plan in case there is another outbreak. That is avowedly an interim plan, not intended to pre-empt or prejudge the results of the inquiries. That makes thoroughly good sense, but by what contorted logic can it be right to press on with the Bill with obstinate determination when, by definition, it pre-empts and pre-judges the results of the inquiries?
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para57"></a>The Government have locked themselves into an extraordinary contradiction and I am aghast at the sheer unreasonableness of their attitude. Every argument of logic and political good sense&#151;never mind the pressure of opinion in rural areas&#151;points to delaying the Bill, not spending three days in Committee at this premature stage.
<P>

<a name="20326-03_para58"></a>If the arguments of logic, good sense and reasonable political process are not sufficiently persuasive, I will resort to the ad hominem argument that to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Moran, means that your Lordships could go home early on Maundy Thursday&#151;which is no day anyway for political debate.

<A NAME="20326-04_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   My Lords, as always it is a great privilege to follow the right reverend Prelate, who very much reflected&#151;as he did on Second Reading&#151;the opinions of the House. I too support the Motion moved by the noble Lord, Lord Moran, which reflects not only the feeling in this House but, perhaps more importantly, in the countryside at large.
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para1"></a>In addition to the two reports&#151;and, for heaven's sake, it must be sensible to await their outcome&#151;a report has been instigated by the European Parliament. Presumably all three reports will result in recommendations that will demand further legislation. I am surprised that the Government Chief Whip has not intervened because the amount of parliamentary time required as a consequence of those three sets of recommendations will be considerable&#151;over and above the three days in Committee allocated to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para2"></a>The Minister argues that he needs the additional powers in the Bill to cope effectively with foot and mouth, yet the Government's own submission to the Anderson committee acknowledged that many mistakes were made during the sad outbreak that we all witnessed and that the powers afforded to the Government in the 1981 Act were not used as effectively as they could have been. The Bill seems to offer very little above what is already available to the Government under the 1981 Act, yet the damage that it will do in terms of its heavy handedness and confrontation with those who suffered so much over the past year is completely out of all proportion.
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para3"></a>There is one further point that I would like to raise with the Minister, and I did so on Second Reading; namely, the question of Scotland. I totally fail to understand why the Scottish Parliament does not appear to think that there is a need to rush through legislation. The chances of an outbreak north of the Border must be similar to England or Wales&#151;at least in proportion to the number of livestock in either country. Yet the Minister stated in a Written Answer to me:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I understand that Scottish Ministers hope to issue a consultation on proposed legislation shortly".&#151;[Official Report, 28/1/2002; col. WA9.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-04_para4"></a>
Consultation, not a Bill. I can only assume that Scottish Ministers do not regard the issue with the same degree of urgency as the noble Lord, Lord Whitty. I concur with virtually every noble Lord who has spoken with the exception of the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, that the sensible course is for the Government to wait until the reports have been published, reflect on their outcome and recommendations, then come forward with well-considered legislation that balances the needs of government and the countryside in a Bill that we could all support.

<a name="column_177"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lady Strange. I particularly want to pick up on one phrase used by the noble Baroness&#151;"mindless murderers"&#151;in referring to MAFF staff carrying out policies that are the responsibility of Ministers and the Government. The noble Lord, Lord Peyton, was his usual excoriating self about MAFF officials and their behaviour.
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para5"></a>Ministers and ex-Ministers have plenty of opportunities to defend themselves and to debate and change policy. I would be the last person to suggest that we should not learn from last year's outbreak or that we should not debate vaccination as against slaughter. I remind the House that when MAFF officials coped with last year's epidemic, together with many vets from abroad and in private practice, they did so without the opportunity to change policy.
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para6"></a>The right reverend Prelate reminded us that officials were urged to implement a slaughter policy as swiftly as possible, to curtail the spread of infection. That policy was part of the contingency plans of successive governments, in conjunction with farming interests across the whole of Europe, for many years. That does not mean that slaughter must be the policy for the future and should not be revised. However, we should be careful about criticising officials&#151;I say this in relation to the noble Baroness, whom I count as a friend&#151;and using intemperate language, when those officials were carrying out policies that had been endorsed across the board.

<P>
<A NAME="20326-04_spnew4"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, it is with a heavy heart that I support my noble friend Lord Moran. I express my gratitude to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford for so adequately articulating the feelings of the rural and farming community. A friend of mine rang me on Sunday night to say, "I hope that you are taking part in debate on the Bill. Can you kindly tell the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, that I am incandescent with rage about it?". I am not incandescent but I am disturbed about the content of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para7"></a>The Minister said that it is his Bill and that he wants to see it through. On behalf of the Government, he asks us to extend permission for them to perform contiguous culls in future. The Government's figures show that not a single one of the 3,305 farms that lost their animals under the contiguous cull tested positive for the virus. Of 3,873 farms slaughtered out as dangerous contacts, only one tested positive.
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para8"></a>At Second Reading, the Minister said of the Thirsk outbreak:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Luckily, the disease did not spread any further south east, although in other directions the spread did not stop. That was due to luck, although good organisation and the support of the bulk of the farming community also played a major role. In the end, given the delay in the contiguous cull, it was probably luck that stopped the disease from spreading further".&#151;[Official Report, 14/1/02; col. 837.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-04_para9"></a>
If delays in the contiguous culls and luck played a part in limiting the spread of the disease, should the Government not submit their existing control policies to rigorous scientific examination by international experts before they seek to amend the Animal Health Act 1981?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para10"></a>Of the Brecon Beacons, the Minister said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the situation in the Brecon Beacons, where there was a dangerous and rapid spread in the hills, is also instructive. There, the additional policy of contiguous heft culling proved to be essential to stop further spread of the disease".&#151;[Official Report, 14/1/02; col. 839.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-04_para11"></a>
In view of the figures that I have just cited, would the Minister care to provide the scientific evidence on which that statement is based, especially in relation to laboratory-confirmed foot and mouth disease, the results of serological testing and the interpretation of that serology?
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para12"></a>I am not in the least happy about the Bill; it is based on false science. We should get our language right. Culling means thinning; we were mass slaughtering animals. This was not an outbreak of foot and mouth disease; it was an epidemic. While I am at it, the Minister also said:
<P>
<br>

<a name="20326-04_para13"></a>
Can he confirm whether it was the biggest epidemic of foot and mouth disease in any country or whether this country was where the largest number of animals were slaughtered as a means of controlling the disease? I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Moran.

<P>
<A NAME="20326-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Monro of Langholm: </B>   My Lords, I warmly support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Moran, in his excellent speech. In a moment, I should like to expand a little on what my noble friend Lord Peel said about Scotland.
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para14"></a>I find it hard to understand why the Government are proceeding with the Bill. They announced it with a great fanfare of trumpets and urgency way back in the autumn, when the Bill received its Second Reading in another place. Proceedings were so urgent that they were guillotined; many amendments were not discussed and none was accepted. So there was not much consultation with Members in another place. Then the Bill came to this House in mid-January. One would think that there would be great urgency again, but no. Today it is two-and-a-half months since Second Reading. Presumably, urgency has dropped from the Government's mind.
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para15"></a>That additional point supports the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Moran, that we should delay proceedings until we receive the results of the inquiries&#151;not only those being undertaken in England but the important study being carried out by the Royal Society in Edinburgh to the highest scientific standard. We could then put together a Bill of practical use within about 12 months.
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para16"></a>A year ago, many of us called for a public inquiry and continued to do so all through last summer and autumn. Eventually, the Government refused to hold one and went ahead with their own separate inquiries with the obvious intention of minimising the criticism that they were bound to receive for their handling of the whole affair.
<P>


<a name="column_179"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para17"></a>I want to press the Government hard on their relationship with Scotland over the Bill. The epicentre of the outbreak spread from Northumberland to Longtown in northern Cumberland&#151;no more than 10 miles from my farm as the crow flies. I lost all my sheep in the contiguous cull. Easter Sunday last year was the worst day of my farming life, when the sheep were all killed and the lambs with them.
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para18"></a>It is ridiculous that we are legislating for a disease that is fluid and moves about quickly, yet there will be different legislation in Scotland, a few miles away. The Scottish Parliament shows no sign of urgency to follow with legislation on the lines of the Bill. That may be because, by and large, the authorities in Scotland&#151;not only the Executive but local councils and especially the Army&#151;carried out their job efficiently and well. Later, I shall talk about some of those procedures under amendments to the Bill in Committee and later stages.
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para19"></a>It is impossible to divide the United Kingdom in legislation on animal disease, which hops about all over the place across the Border, one way or another. We cannot have two separate sets of legislation, compensation and a whole host of different procedures either side of the Border. Another outbreak may be right on the Border, as was the last one.
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para20"></a>I urge the Minister to think carefully about what the noble Lord, Lord Moran, and other noble Lords have said and to postpone the Bill until we receive the results of the inquiries. We can then draft an effective Bill to cover the whole of the United Kingdom&#151;jointly with the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly&#151;so that we have a United Kingdom attack on the disease and, most importantly, a United Kingdom attack on imports, which are the root of the problem and about which the Government seem to do little at present.
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para21"></a>We heard what happens in New Zealand. A few weeks ago, I was in America. On return to this country, absolutely nothing was said about agriculture or animal husbandry, whereas if one goes to America, one has to sign forms about where one has been and whether one has been on a farm. We do not seem to be taking such import controls seriously. Even in answer to a Question this week, the Minister said that things are developing. Why cannot they develop quicker than the Bill?
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para22"></a>We really must wait until the detailed inquiries report to the country. We can then put together a Bill that we can be proud of.

<A NAME="20326-04_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Bledisloe: </B>   My Lords, I had not intended to speak to the amendment because, while I fully agree with many of the sentiments expressed by those in favour of it, I thought that there might be advantage in seeing whether we can improve the Bill in Committee. My intention to remain silent was altered by the powerful speech made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman. It is admirable that she should come forth to defend so powerfully officials of the ministry <P>


<a name="column_180"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of which she was such an industrious and popular Minister. But surely, what she said demonstrated conclusively that we need to know what happened.
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para23"></a>The noble Baroness told us that the officials did their job, and that, if things went wrong, it was because they had been given the wrong policy. There is no doubt that, in the country at large, MAFF&#151;or DEFRA, or government or whatever we choose to call it&#151;has lost its credibility with those on the farm. If the noble Baroness is right to say that that is because there was disorder and chaos at the top and that the officials and the people on the ground were commendable, sensible, hard-working people, we can work on that basis in deciding what is needed. If, on the other hand, contrary to the noble Baroness's plucky and admirable defence, the officials were, in fact, clots who were making a mess of it, we need other legislation. Until the inquiries have told us about such things, how on earth can we know what is needed?
<P>

<a name="20326-04_para24"></a>I am afraid that the noble Baroness has, perhaps unintentionally, converted me to the theory that the Motion is right, although I entirely accept, like her, that until we know, we should not be abusive about individuals.

<A NAME="20326-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I want to clarify what I said for the noble Viscount. I did not say that we should not take action until we knew. Nor did I suggest, in anything that I said, that there was chaos at the top. What I said, though perhaps not explicitly, was that the House had a rather short memory about how effusive it was in its praise of officials during the action and that we might well wish to review policy as the whole of Europe has done. In Australia they have torn up their contingency plan and want to think again, because of the scale of the epidemic that we encountered.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para0"></a>It is right that we consider policy. All that I was suggesting was that, if officials were implementing a policy that was accepted, agreed and unchallenged before the epidemic, it would be wrong to castigate those officials in the terms that were used in the debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-05_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Bledisloe: </B>   My Lords, I fully accept that the noble Baroness did not say that that was a reason for postponement.

<a name="20326-05_para1"></a>There can be no doubt that major errors were made during the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. No one is likely to contradict that. If it were not so, why would there be three inquiries, as well as the European one, which will probably be almost as important as our own. My friend the MEP for the South East, Caroline Lucas, has been selected to be vice-chairman of that inquiry, and I have no doubt that it will be conducted with extreme rigour.

<a name="20326-05_para2"></a>The history of MAFF in the past few months&#151;if not longer&#151;is a sad one. As noble Lords know, many highly competent civil servants did their best, but, largely, they got it wrong. They got it wrong in all sorts of ways, including their approach to dealing with the disease and in their dealings with farmers. MAFF and the Treasury, between them, have reduced our farmers to a level of subsistence that is about half that of any of their colleagues in Europe. That takes some doing.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para3"></a>We should not follow the suggestion that has been made by my former friends in front of me that we should embark on the Committee stage and see what happens.

For that reason, I hope that your Lordships will vote for the Motion tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Moran, and that he will put it to the vote.

<A NAME="20326-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, we should be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Moran, for giving the House the opportunity to defer discussion on the Bill. We should be grateful for several reasons. It gives the Government the opportunity to think again and gives people generally the opportunity to give their views, which they have not been able to do so far. The noble Lord's Motion refers to two reports. It is essential that we should receive those reports before we proceed with the Bill. The Government, the Liberals and&#151;I believe&#151;the Conservatives believe in pre-legislative hearings.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para4"></a>If there were ever a case in which a Bill should have a pre-legislative hearing, this is it. The Bill damages so many people and involves the entry by the Government into people's property and allows them to destroy that property at will. Ordinary people everywhere will understand that and deplore it. As there is no urgency, the passage of the Bill ought to be suspended while a pre-legislative hearing goes ahead.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para5"></a>It is not only people in the country who are concerned about what went on during the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Millions of people throughout the country were appalled at the destruction not only of diseased animals but of animals which were perfectly fit and well and were destroyed in a manner such as people had never contemplated or seen before. The general public must be satisfied that any legislation will take into consideration all aspects of an outbreak&#151;not only foot and mouth disease, but BSE and others&#151;to ensure that, if the Government have to deal with such an outbreak, they do so in the best, most humane way, with regard both to people and animals.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para6"></a>Recently, we heard about the Government's policy on fox hunting. I am bound to make a comparison. During the foot and mouth outbreak, the Government destroyed 9 million animals&#151;mostly fit ones&#151;by dubious and cruel means. It would take 300 years to destroy that number of foxes by hunting. I hope that that point will be taken on board.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para7"></a>I support the noble Lord's Motion, and I hope that the House will do so too. It would help farming, people in the countryside and, indeed, the <P>

<A NAME="20326-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Jopling: </B>   My Lords, the speech that we have just heard from the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, was an extraordinarily important one. I join those who congratulated the noble Lord, Lord Moran, on tabling the Motion. The speech that we have just heard made it clear that the sentiments behind the Motion are held in all parts of the House. The Chief Whip is here. I hope that the Government will take on board the fact that the mood of the House is overwhelmingly in favour of the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Moran.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para8"></a>A little earlier we listened again to a quite outstanding speech from the right reverend Prelate, the Bishop of Hereford, which I hope the Government will reflect on very carefully indeed. I believe that the noble Lord's amendment is particularly justified at this stage of the Bill's proceedings. The Government come to your Lordships' House now looking a great deal more hapless and foolish than they looked when we had the Second Reading over 10 weeks ago. At that time the Government were still telling us that the Bill, as my noble friend Lord Monro of Langholm, said, came from another place with a tag of urgency attached to it with a background, as the noble Lord said, of a guillotine in the other place.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para9"></a>But what do the Government do after your Lordships dismembered the Bill at Second Reading? What do they do with this urgent Bill? They wait over 10 weeks before they start the Committee stage. It is no good them saying, "Oh, parliamentary time"&#151;I have used that argument in another place on many occasions&#151;"did not allow us to proceed". If the Government really felt that this Bill was urgent, they could have perfectly well dealt with the Committee stage in that ridiculous half-term holiday which we had a few weeks ago.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para10"></a>Until this moment, when we were told that we were going to have the Committee stage starting now, I thought the delay was because the Government had paid attention to the way in which your Lordships' House dismembered the Bill on 14th January. But what do we find? No way was that in their minds; they wanted to press on with this most unfortunate Bill.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para11"></a>It seems to me that what has happened is that the Government now have the worst of both worlds. They can no longer argue that the Bill is urgent because they wasted 10 weeks in allowing it just to lie on the table, but they are still mindlessly pressing on with it against the view widely held across the House that it is unnecessary and premature.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para12"></a>When the Minister replies, he has to answer two questions above all. First, what has been the reason for the 10-week delay? Why could we not have dealt with the Bill earlier if it is urgent? Secondly, if it is not urgent, why go on with it now when there are inquiries waiting to report? The Government cannot have it both ways. It seems to me that the Government have the worst of both worlds over this matter.

<a name="20326-05_para13"></a>About a year ago I was one of the first to ask for a broad public inquiry on similar lines to the Northumberland committee of 1967. I was in the House of Commons at that time. I remember it vividly. At that time I said that I thought a public inquiry should start at once. My noble friend Lord Plumb was a member of the Northumberland committee. His distinction over matters of this sort as a former president of the European Parliament and of the National Farmers Union, confirm that his credentials to lead that committee were irrefutable. When I asked for an immediate start to the public inquiry it never occurred to me that there would not be one sooner or later. But I believed that it ought to start straightaway. I was totally astonished when the Government refused to have a similar inquiry to the one which Fred Peart set up when he was Minister for Agriculture all those years ago.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para14"></a>It occurs to me that if a Conservative Government had still been in power last year when this outbreak began and they had behaved in the same way as the current Government have behaved over setting up public inquiries, I could not envisage the extent of the howls which would have gone up from Opposition Members in this House and in another place. I am totally horrified by the way the Government have behaved over this matter. I believe that there has been incompetence from top to bottom in handling this recent outbreak.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para15"></a>As my noble friend Lord Ferrers rightly said, what is the point of setting up these inquiries and then embarking on legislation? It is the old case over which many of us castigated Labour governments in the past of the gentleman in Whitehall knowing best and ignoring inquiries and the experts on the ground who could give&#151;and I hope they will still&#151;advice as to how these things have come about and what ought to be done in future.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para16"></a>It seems that we are in the process of a great cover-up of government incompetence over the course of the last year. I hope that the House supports the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Moran.

<A NAME="20326-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Willoughby de Broke: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Moran. Contrary to what the Minister said at Second Reading, he does not need the Bill. As the noble Countess, Lady Mar, said, the Government have already slaughtered millions of animals. It was not a cull, but a slaughter. If they have slaughtered 5 million animals that were not infected then the Minister cannot possibly need this Bill. He may want it, but he certainly does not need it.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para17"></a>At the leisurely pace at which this Bill has been proceeding, I have had time to make my own private inquiry in the absence of a public inquiry. My sister lives in Hatherleigh in Devon which, as noble Lords may know, was the centre of the disastrous outbreak of foot and mouth. She arranged a meeting for me there with local farmers as did the local Devon NFU which, I may say, differed considerably from the London branch in its attitude to this Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_184"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 184</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para18"></a>The point which emerged most tellingly from both those meetings was the lack of local organisation and communication. Vets, the police and the Army all seemed to be uncertain of their role. Local vets were sidelined and put under the control of MAFF. The bureaucrats did not have the faintest idea of what was going on. That was the information that I received.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para19"></a>For example, the local auctioneer had not got a job because there were no cattle auctions at all. It is an old-established firm there. He put at the disposal of officials the services of his employees, their expertise, vehicles and maps and intimate knowledge of local farms, but they were turned down. There were large numbers of lorry drivers going down small Devon lanes laden with sleepers and coal, but going in the wrong direction and without maps. That is an example of the short-sightedness which should never have occurred.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para20"></a>Both the groups of farmers to whom I spoke for quite a long time on both occasions made the point that disease control operations must be handled at local level and not by remote control from London. At the end of our meetings I asked them all what they thought about the Animal Health Bill. They said unanimously that it should be held over until the Government's own inquiry had reported. That is the reaction that I received on the ground since our last debate at Second Reading.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para21"></a>While I was there I spoke with Professor Ian Mercer who chaired the Devon County Council inquiry into foot and mouth, which I believe is the only report which has been completed and published on the foot and mouth epidemic so far. As your Lordships know, his conclusions were pretty damning. However, it is worth quoting a few lines from his conclusion. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The reports received by the Inquiry of insensitive and even belligerent operatives and bungled culls do little to enhance the professional reputation of those involved, from Ministers downwards . . . the evidence presented to us is overwhelmingly critical of the balance of effective need against unnecessary killing of healthy stock under the contiguous cull policy as carried out by MAFF".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-05_para22"></a>
Yet that is the policy which was so roundly condemned by his report and which the Government ask us now to sanction in the Bill. That is like a drunk driver saying, "I'll drive much better if I have another bottle of Scotch".
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para23"></a>What I saw and heard on my visit to Devon has been borne out by the evidence given to the two inquiries that the Government set up: the lessons learned inquiry and the Royal Society inquiry. That evidence is available on an excellent Internet site, which I recommend to noble Lords who may not be acquainted with it. It is www.warmwell.com. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said that the public and many people have not had their say. Many have had their say on that website. It makes extremely instructive reading. One can see many of the submissions made to the inquiries.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para24"></a>There are constants in the evidence presented by farmers and scientists, including Dr David Shannon, who until December 2001 was chief scientist at MAFF and DEFRA, the CLA, senior veterinary experts and <P>


<a name="column_185"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 185</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>other organisations and individuals. The constants involved are that the so-called contingency plan was ineffective and outdated; the remoteness of the centralised bureaucracy in Page Street was divorced from the reality in the field; and that there was lack of effort to ensure that infectious diseases such as foot and mouth disease do not come into this country. The United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada seem successfully to keep those diseases at bay. Why are we so slack when it comes to keeping out those diseases? If we cannot stop illegal imports, it seems utterly unrealistic to pretend that we can be a foot and mouth disease free country.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para25"></a>The final constant is the Bill. The contiguous cull was not necessary. It must be stopped. It was a highly expensive disaster for animal and human welfare and did nothing to prevent the spread of the disease&#151;rather to the contrary. Evidence I have seen indicates that the contiguous cull may have contributed to the spread of the disease through movements of vehicles and people from infected areas into contiguous cull areas. What it did very successfully was to kill 5 million uninfected animals and divert resources away from essential disease control efforts in infected areas.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para26"></a>The noble Countess, Lady Mar, mentioned the outbreak in the Brecon Beacons. I add my voice in asking this question. What is the evidence that the contiguous cull in the Brecon Beacons stopped the disease from spreading further? My information is that that was not the case. I shall be interested to hear evidence indicating that that action was successful. The noble Countess mentioned DEFRA's own figures. Of the 3,305 farms which were tested, one only was positive. DEFRA now seems to disagree with its own figures and has amended them. According to its most recent figures, there were 120 "positives" out of 2,960 contiguous culls. Perhaps in answer to a Written Question the Minister will explain the difference between the figures and state which figure is correct.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para27"></a>I conclude by quoting from the evidence presented by Dr Sheila Crispin to the lessons learned inquiry. She is an extremely experienced vet and reader in comparative ophthalmology at the University of Bristol. She says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If one single improvement is to be achieved after all the Inquires it is that the culture of MAFF/DEFRA must change . . . they must realise, or be made to realise that their own inadequacies cannot be hidden beneath draconian and unscientific measures such as contiguous culling policies and the amendment to the Animal Health Act".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-05_para28"></a>
DEFRA has forfeited the trust of the rural community. Until that trust is restored, I can see no reason for the Government to be given the powers they request in the Bill. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Moran, will press his Motion to a vote. If so, I shall vote with him.

<A NAME="20326-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Chorley: </B>   My Lords, unfortunately, I was not able to take part in the Second Reading debate. If I have an interest to declare, it is that I live in Cumbria which was at the heart of the dreadful outbreak. I do not farm but I am acutely aware of the enormous <P>


<a name="column_186"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 186</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>damage that the outbreak did to the tourism and recreational industries on which much of the economy of the Lake District, where I live, depended. As I believe the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, said in her Second Reading speech, I am well aware that if the foot and mouth disease were to break out again there the wide support which the tourist industry and recreational bodies gave to Her Majesty's Government last year would not be repeated. If this Bill were to become an Act of Parliament, it would not help.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para29"></a>I rather sympathised with the Prime Minister when he decided against having a public inquiry because I believed that that would take years and we wanted good, quick post hoc investigations. The three inquiries were set up. We have had the Curry report on farming, a first-class report. I should have thought that we were not that far away from receiving the other two important reports. But apparently the Government cannot wait. They want draconian measures. They want measures which make criminals of ordinary people. Yet it is 10 weeks since the Second Reading debate.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para30"></a>The Second Reading debate demonstrated that the Bill was exceptionally controversial. The fact that we have spent an hour and 19 minutes on the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Moran, shows equally how controversial it still is. Yet apparently we cannot await the two reports. As the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, asked, what was the point of commissioning those reports? What an insult it is to the distinguished people who make up those committees if we cannot wait before we leap into legislation. We all know that legislation in haste&#151;and if any measure was legislation in haste it must be this one&#151;usually ends in tears. How can it be right to proceed with such highly controversial measures when we do not know what the two important reports will say?

<A NAME="20326-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, I shall briefly state the reason that I shall vote for the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Moran. I refer to one lacuna in the Bill. There is nothing about protecting animal health by the proper processing of imports. I have been putting down a series of Questions for Written Answer. Those answers I have received reveal a shambles. I have put down subsequent questions which the Government have some difficulty in answering. But that consideration must be taken into account if the Bill is intended to protect animal health.

<P>
<A NAME="20326-05_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Plumb: </B>   My Lords, I do not speak because of the kind compliments paid by my noble friend Lord Jopling. He referred to earlier days. It is amazing how much one can remember of what took place 34 years ago. How many lessons we have learned during that time is debatable. There are plenty of lessons to be learned from the outbreak of last year. The noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, reminded us of the tremendous job that many people did in the field, working for periods of 24 hours. I wholly support that. <P>


<a name="column_187"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The noble Baroness said that of course they did not cause the chaos, but chaos there was. We saw chaos in abundance throughout the whole country. We all hope that that kind of thing will be avoided in the future.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para31"></a>After a debate lasting one and a half hours, the Minister must be anxious to respond to the many comments that have been made, and I am sure that the Chief Whip will be keen to get on with the business of the House. But in his excellent opening speech leading the debate, the noble Lord, Lord Moran, reminded us that some 10 weeks were allowed from the last debate we held in this House for evidence to be taken from those concerned in the industry. That was made clear. It will not surprise the Minister to learn that I have read the submissions of the majority of those who gave evidence over that period. I have to say that I see no comparison between the evidence that was submitted and what is contained in this Bill. The problem we have to face is that, while the Minister has tabled one or two amendments, they are not sufficient to satisfy people in the country.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para32"></a>As my noble friend Lord Peel pointed out earlier, it is those people with whom we are concerned. They have already reacted and they will react further unless we are given something that looks towards the future and which is satisfactory. I regret therefore that the changes we called for on the last occasion have not been included.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para33"></a>What will happen when Professor Anderson's "lessons learned" report eventually emerges? If we have come to certain conclusions in this place and the Bill has been passed, I ask the Minister whether we shall then have to have another Bill. Will further legislation be produced in light of those further reports? I know from my previous experience that I would have felt insulted if, after the government had accepted our recommendations, they had then suddenly decided to ignore them and to bring forward a Bill.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para34"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Moran, in his comment that further time needs to be given to consider this. That does not mean that I or anyone else is anxious to delay matters. Contingency measures have been put in place so that action could be taken in the disastrous event of another outbreak of foot and mouth disease or, indeed, any other disease, because the legislation seeks to cover all diseases and thus they have to be dealt with in this way.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para35"></a>I have every confidence in the veterinary services of this country. I have every confidence that we have sufficient scientists and epidemiologists, who are already considering and preparing for the possibility, God forbid, that we suffer another outbreak. I would only submit that if we did have another outbreak, we would never see the same situation again. I truly believe that greater concentration would be made on "ring" vaccination which&#151;who knows at the moment?&#151;could prevent the massive contiguous culls which have caused the slaughter of so many clean cattle during this outbreak.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para36"></a>Much has been said about the importance of dealing effectively with meat imports. Following our previous debate 10 weeks ago, I asked the Minister for a figure which was then sent to me in writing. At the time I was told that over the course of the foot and mouth disease outbreak, some 180,339 tonnes of meat had been imported from seven countries where foot and mouth disease is endemic. That was absolutely crazy, given the measures taken by certain countries that have been referred to during the course of our debate. They take firm measures to prevent products or even people from countries where there is a disease outbreak from entering their areas. I suggest that we concentrate far more on dealing with problems before they arise, rather than concentrate now on what measures would have to be taken in the event of such a terrible tragedy taking place again.

<P>
<A NAME="20326-05_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, deserves some praise for being the only supporter of the Bill over the entire one-and-a-half-hour discussion so far. But her argument that the Bill is needed because the Government do not have the essential powers to deal with an outbreak of foot and mouth disease have been completely undermined by the Government's actions since Second Reading.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para37"></a>In addition to the two questions put to the Minister by my noble friend Lord Jopling, I should be grateful if he could tell noble Lords what action he took after the scare in Yorkshire some weeks ago? It was thought that we were about to suffer another outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Did the Minister have in hand emergency legislation that would have been presented to the House? Was this Bill going to be brought forward as a matter of urgency? What action was taken at that stage to remedy the alleged lacuna in the Minister's armoury to tackle foot and mouth disease? It is clear that this Bill did not appear on the Order Paper at that stage and, so far as I know, no attempt was made to bring it forward.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para38"></a>I believe, therefore, that the Minister himself has destroyed his own argument, one which he used in response to the House in the debate on Second Reading. He said then that he needed the provisions of this Bill and that he needed them quickly. I hope that he will be able to give a full answer to my noble friend Lord Jopling in response to the question that I have just posed.

My view then was that this House should hear the Government's reasoning as to why they needed the Bill in this form. This afternoon noble Lords have again expressed their anger in the strongest terms because they have not been offered a Bill in a form that they had expected.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para39"></a>The Government have claimed continually that what they seek is a simple amendment to the Animal Health Act 1981 in the form of emergency legislation. The anger that has been expressed by noble Lords this afternoon reflects the fact that this Bill goes far beyond that by conferring new powers on the Minister and his officials, while&#151;as many noble Lords have pointed out&#151;it does nothing to improve controls on imports. My party has pointed out both in this House and in another place that the Bill is not proportionate.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para40"></a>I had hoped that, between the debate on Second Reading and today, the Government would have brought forward a raft of amendments or would have indicated that they were willing to accept many of our amendments, along with those put down by other noble Lords. They would have vastly improved the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para41"></a>The two inquiries which have been referred to this afternoon are supplemented by the European Union inquiry which will look more deeply into the balance between vaccination and vaccination and cull. That inquiry may well reach different conclusions with regard to what the European Union will allow in terms of vaccination, as well as with regard to the whole policy approach to the control of foot and mouth disease. That is something which we should bear in mind.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para42"></a>I do not expect my position to be popular with noble Lords this afternoon because I continue to believe that we should allow the Government at least the Committee stage so that they are given an opportunity to explain how they might intend to bring forward simple emergency legislation. I recognise that the Government are responsible here and that they must do their best to control outbreaks of disease in animals. However, I firmly believe that the Government must accept into the provisions of this Bill some of the duties and responsibilities that are incumbent on them.
<P>

<a name="20326-05_para43"></a>Beyond the matter of import controls, I return to the issue of the public inquiry, which is the subject of another amendment to the Bill. However, despite calls from all sides of the House and from all over the country, the Government have dug in their heels and have refused to allow a public inquiry. Thus, at the moment, the Floor of the House is probably the most public place in which we are likely to get any answers to our questions.

<a name="20326-06_para0"></a>The Government now have some choices before them: they can amend the Bill&#151;indeed, there are many helpful hints as to how to do that in the amendments now before the House&#151;or they could delay the Bill until they can benefit from the findings of the inquiries. I believe that the quality of the forthcoming evidence will be most useful. Alternatively, I ask noble Lords to consider a third option; namely, that we go for a thoroughly amended Bill that we debate on Report. I draw noble Lords' attention to my proposed sunset clause, which would allow the Government simply to take forward emergency powers that would then lapse. In tabling the amendment, I have given the Government time to consider the results of the inquiries, as well as the reactions to them, and to draw up legislation as a result.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para1"></a>If I do not vote for the Motion moved by the noble Lord, Lord Moran, this afternoon, noble Lords can be absolutely assured that that is not a sign that the Liberal Democrats are of the view that the Government have come anywhere near striking the right balance in this Bill thus far. We should explore the issues further in public. I believe that the Government could still table amendments that would provide us with a constructive way to proceed. I urge the Government, therefore, to take that opportunity. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.

<A NAME="20326-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, I have much sympathy for the Motion moved by the noble Lord, Lord Moran, about which we have spoken together. A similar amendment was moved and debated on Second Reading by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, when there were two to three speakers only who spoke in favour of what I regard as an odious Bill. The Government should have no doubt about the feeling on the Bill&#151;namely, that it should be held over. To date, there has been only one supporter for the proposition that we should go ahead; and, indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has just expressed her concerns in that respect.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para2"></a>As other noble Lords have said, this Bill was brought forward in great haste. As my noble friend Lord Jopling observed, if this legislation was urgently required why have we waited these 10 weeks for its introduction? The Minister urged that there could be another outbreak. He said that the draconian powers in the Bill would be necessary, and that such legislation was urgently required. Second Reading took place on 14th January&#151;I should remember because it was my birthday&#151;and some two months plus have elapsed since then. Having waited those two months, why is it not appropriate to wait for the findings of the Government's own inquiries that are due to be completed this summer, given the fact that we are unlikely to complete the proceedings on the Bill before that time? Indeed, that even adds weight to the suggestion that we should wait.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para3"></a>My noble friend Lord Plumb said that the evidence being given to the various ongoing inquiries does not reflect the thrust of the Bill. Indeed, Scottish Ministers are not pushing for an equivalent Bill, as is the case <P>


<a name="column_191"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 191</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with the Northern Ireland Ministers. Animal health and disease control are not dependent on national boundaries. My noble friend Lord Peel spoke about the consultation in Scotland, without the introduction of a Bill, while my noble friend Lord Monro referred to issues that need addressing as regards the Scottish and English borders.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para4"></a>The National Audit Office and Dr Anderson's inquiries are well under way. On top of that, as several of my noble friends observed, there have also been various county inquiries. The Mercer inquiry in Devon was particularly critical, and stressed that the first matter to be addressed should be the question of import controls. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford referred to the need for the Government to address the prevailing situation. Although the Government have brought forward one or two amendments to the Bill, none of them appear before Clause 6. I believe that the first government amendment is Amendment No. 58.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para5"></a>The Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Moran, asks for a delay until,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the responses to the consultation . . . have been published".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-06_para6"></a>
The consultation period on one of the matters that the Government are considering ended on 15th March of this year. But, to date, we have not heard anything from them. Can the Minister say why we are taking up this Bill again, when the Government know the results of those consultations? Indeed, they are privy to those results, while noble Lords in this Chamber and those outside are not. Surely the completed consultation ought to inform the Government's thinking and aid our debates.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para7"></a>The second part of the noble Lord's Motion deals specifically with the government inquiries into the foot-and-mouth outbreak. The Government should hold a proper, independent public inquiry. They should wait until such inquiries have been completed and reported; and, as several noble Lords have said, such findings should be incorporated in the legislation. In fact, looking at the situation logically, if we go ahead with the Bill today it will not complete its passage through both Houses of Parliament until the time when both inquiries will report. Therefore, is it not logical to wait until such inquiries have reported, so as to have something firm upon which to build? If proceedings on the Bill go ahead today, we shall press that argument strongly during its passage.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para8"></a>Amendment No. 151 goes further than the Motion moved by the noble Lord, Lord Moran. It is bad enough that the Government have set themselves against holding a public inquiry; but, in doing so, they risk losing the important information that the inquiries in progress could bring forward. Some of that information might help to restrict and to prevent the disease spreading in any future outbreak.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para9"></a>Does the Minister accept&#151;I hope that he does&#151;that the self-congratulatory style in the Government's submissions to the official foot and mouth inquiry dated 22nd March of this year do not inspire confidence in his department from those who were <P>


<a name="column_192"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 192</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>affected by the foot and mouth outbreak? I heard the pleas made earlier by the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, in that respect. As she knows, I have supported the way in which many officials carried out their work. However, there were criticisms. It seems strange that, in the submissions, the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We already have drawn up revised interim contingency plans which will build on our experience and are in place to guide our response to any further outbreak".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-06_para10"></a>
The noble Lord continued to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There are further lessons to be learned. The lessons learned and Royal Society inquiries will be comprehensive and fully independent; they will identify what should be done if we were faced with any future outbreak of animal disease".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-06_para11"></a>
Does that not add weight to the argument that your Lordships have put forward this afternoon as regards the delay?
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para12"></a>Perhaps I may refer the House to an animal health centenary document printed in 1965, which some noble Lords may remember. I believe that the statements made in that document are as relevant today as they were at that time. Under the heading "Principles and practices", it said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"All these and other inconveniences will only be accepted by farmers if they are made fully aware of the objects of the policy and kept informed of the progress of the campaign at every stage . . . The farming community must be willing to co-operate in every aspect of the work".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-06_para13"></a>
Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, and my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke commented on the fact that we need to take communities with us.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para14"></a>Bearing all that in mind, is not the Minister prepared to accept some of the criticism of the way in which the foot and mouth outbreak was handled? If not, how does he expect the Government to take these farming and rural communities along with them, while at the same time giving themselves huge powers in the Bill to slaughter on suspicion?
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para15"></a>The forum on illegal food imports, which was announced last week on 21st March, is to start work to address this issue. It has been asked to bring forward an action programme. What is the time-scale for this forum to report to the Government? When will its report be published? When will we have an opportunity to debate it?
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para16"></a>Numerous reasons have been given today as to why we should not proceed with the Bill at this time. As I said, my only criticism of the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Moran, is that it does not go far enough. Amendment No. 151 goes a step further and seeks a full independent public inquiry. That is what should happen.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para17"></a>The killing of millions of animals&#151;as the noble Countess, Lady Mar, said, it was not a cull, it was a slaughter&#151;brought untold suffering to animals and to farming communities. It also brought devastation to rural communities, rural businesses and the tourist industry. Compensation for consequential loss was not available and many people are still struggling to regain lost income.
<P>


<a name="column_193"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para18"></a>In addition, different practices were adopted and different decisions were taken. For example, no scientific evidence was produced for allowing Phoenix the calf to live. Recently, Kirsty, the girl who attacked an official&#151;I am sorry that she did&#151;when her goat was killed, was given an absolute discharge because the judge felt that the circumstances warranted it.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para19"></a>Those two examples highlight the Government's difficulty. There is no logicality and no scientific grounds for many of the proposals in the Bill. The Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Moran, seeks to delay the Bill, but it totally fails to address the issue of the importation of meat and food products into this country, an issue which has been raised many times by my noble friend Lord Marlesford. The Government have announced the setting up of a forum to address the issue, but we need to know more about it.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para20"></a>We want to know what has been said to the Government by those who have been consulted during the inquiry which finished on 15th March. If we are to discuss these issues in Committee we shall need to know what people have said. If the Government refuse to hold a public inquiry, then, as far as the wider world is concerned, a public inquiry will be held in Committee and on Report in this House. The responsibility will fall on us.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para21"></a>I sympathise with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Moran, and I note the strength of feeling that has been expressed in this area. My role is to ensure that the Bill does not come into force until a full inquiry has been held.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I very much regret that the Motion has been moved in this form. Let us be clear, if the Motion were agreed to the Bill would not pass in this Session of Parliament. If that is the aim of noble Lords rather than to delay the Bill to obtain information, let them be frank about it&#151;because that would be the result.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para22"></a>A number points have been made, both about the conduct of the response to the foot and mouth epidemic and about the powers in the Bill. I shall deal primarily with procedural points and with the reasons why we believe that this Bill needs to be enacted as rapidly as possible. That is not to say that the other points are not important, but many of them will be touched on if we proceed into Committee on the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para23"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moran, and others&#151;including the noble Baronesses who have spoken from the Front Benches opposite&#151;asked why, if the matter was so urgent, there has been a delay between Second Reading and the Committee stage, which I hope will begin today. The answer is contained in part of another question of the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, in regard to the results of the consultation which ended last week.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para24"></a>During the course of Second Reading, I was asked whether we would consider before Committee stage the response to that consultation in respect of the protocol on the slaughter powers in the Bill. I believed that that was a reasonable request. I did not <P>


<a name="column_194"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 194</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>immediately accede to it, but it seemed reasonable that we should consider those responses&#151;and we have done so. Had we proceeded directly to the first group of amendments in the Marshalled List I would have indicated in broad terms the outcome of that consultation. I would have placed in the Library a summary of those responses in order to inform the Committee during the subsequent stages of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para25"></a>It seemed a reasonable request. Although it has meant delay&#151;and I would have preferred not to have had that delay&#151;it is a clear example that the Government listened to the voice of the House during a fairly robust Second Reading.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para26"></a>The normal position with Bills at Committee stage in this House&#151;certainly in my experience&#151;is that the Government listen. My own personal conduct at Committee stage is also to listen. More than 200 amendments have been tabled by noble Lords who have taken the trouble to register their views as to why they believe the Bill is deficient and why we should take a different course with some parts of the Bill. I have indicated that I would very much be prepared to listen to some of those arguments. The Government have not closed their ears or their mind to the possibility of adopting some of the amendments, or something very like them, in the course of the Committee stage. That is what Committee stages are for. We would come forward with amendments at later stages if we were convinced of the arguments during Committee stage. But to deny the House a Committee stage seems to be an odd departure from the normal procedure of the House.
<P>

<a name="20326-06_para27"></a>Indeed, at Second Reading, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, moved an amendment which, if taken literally, would have delayed the Bill. She was persuaded that it would be sensible to proceed to the Committee stage, and she has rightly reiterated today that the House should move to the Committee stage to hear the Government's responses to the amendments and the arguments. She made the correct decision and did not press her amendment on that occasion. I therefore regret to see a rather more specific amendment, which would cause more delay, on the Order Paper today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, is the Government's mind open to the concept of a full, honest and open public inquiry into this matter? Or is that something the Government will not accept during the Committee stage?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, that is not something the Government will accept during Committee stage. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, indicated that she has tabled an amendment to that effect, but we have made it clear that we believe the two inquiries will more rapidly establish the lessons to be learnt that are not already apparent. We shall proceed along those lines and take very seriously the outcome of the inquiries. A full quasi-judicial and very legalistic public inquiry would take far too long. There have been a number of examples where public inquiries have led to that kind of delay.
<P>


<a name="column_195"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 195</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-07_para0"></a>I find it slightly ironic that the people who argue for a public inquiry, which could take years, are the same people who are now arguing that we should delay until one has been held. We need to know the results quickly and we believe that the independent inquiries will give us those results.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-07_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord undertake that if the inquiries come up with something which runs contrary to the Bill, and if the Bill has by then become an Act, the Government will immediately introduce an Act repealing those sections of the Bill which have been found by their own inquiry to be inadequate? If he will not give such an undertaking, the case for the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Moran, will be overwhelming.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, we have always said that the inquiries&#151;both the scientific inquiry and the lessons learned inquiry under Dr Anderson&#151;could well lead to recommendations for legislation which is different from the existing Animal Health Act or any amendment to that Act carried during the passage of this Bill. Therefore, if the inquiries recommend that we should legislate on these issues, and the Government accept the recommendation, we shall take the matter very seriously. Therefore, I do not think that that issue arises. The issue is whether the House wishes to deprive the Government of powers which in their judgment the Government consider are wanting for the period between the passage of this Bill and a point at which we can further legislate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-07_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, I have asked the Minister this question previously regarding interim recommendations that may be coming forward. The terms of reference for the lessons learned inquiry specifically state:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If there are important emerging recommendations that should be passed to the Government sooner, the inquiry will publish interim findings".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-07_para1"></a>
Will the Government encourage the inquiry to do so, and bring them before the House so that we might learn what they are? Has the Minister inquired whether such findings are forthcoming?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, Dr Anderson's inquiry has the ability to bring forward interim recommendations. However, the conduct of that inquiry and whether he wishes to do so is a matter for him; it is not a matter for the Government. It is an independent inquiry and the procedure adopted by Dr Anderson at present does not seem to be leading to interim recommendations. But, as I say, that is a matter for him.
<P>

<a name="20326-07_para2"></a>The point that I as a Government Minister have to face&#151;and, frankly, the House has to face&#151;is what powers are available to the Government were a disease, whether foot and mouth or any other, to occur over the coming year or so, which would be the minimum period which would ensue were we to legislate post the outcome of these inquiries.
<P>


<a name="column_196"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 196</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-07_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. Will he define to the House exactly what powers he needs that he does not have?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-07_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, that is fairly clear in the Bill. We consider that the Bill does not answer all the questions as to what lessons can be learnt. We do not expect all those lessons to be learnt until we have the full outcome of those inquiries. But we already know what some of those lessons are. Some are now incorporated within the interim contingency plan. But some are also about legislative powers. It is clear to us&#151;in particular in carrying out a contiguous cull, but also in potentially carrying out other strategies to contain diseases, whether vaccination, blood tests, serology or alternative approaches&#151;that we do not have adequate powers of entry or rapid enough powers for enforcing entry in order to contain the disease.
<P>

<a name="20326-07_para3"></a>However many specious cases and statistics are raised in the Sunday Telegraph, they are not relevant to this matter. What is clear is that the more rapidly we achieved our targets under the contiguous cull strategy, the more rapidly the disease was contained. That is not to say that there is not an alternative strategy that we might at some stage have to pursue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-07_spnew8"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, of course, if you kill all the animals, they will not get the disease. We need to have rational grounds for showing that those animals would have caught the disease. There is absolutely no indication of that. Using DEFRA's own figures, less than 2 per cent of the animals killed in the contiguous cull had the disease&#151;and that even includes the 120 mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-07_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I have tried to explain this matter to the House on numerous occasions. I tried again in response to one of the supplementary questions to the noble Countess's Question the other day. A contiguous cull is to eliminate the spread of a disease. We should not expect the majority of animals, or even a significant minority, to have developed the disease if a contiguous cull is carried out within 48 hours of the disease appearing on the initial farm. Indeed, the more effective the contiguous cull, the lower would be the level of post-mortem tests showing the disease to have spread. If anything, the statistics reported in the Sunday Telegraph, and quoted by the noble Countess, are an indication of the relative success of the contiguous cull. The whole point of a contiguous cull is to ensure that other animals do not die; and the degree to which we achieve success in a contiguous cull reduces the ultimate number of animals that will be exposed to the disease.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-07_spnew10"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord himself, in relation to the Thirsk outbreak, pointed out that the contiguous cull had been delayed in Thirsk. He said&#151;believe it or not&#151;that it was a matter of luck and the good will of the farmers and other people in the <P>


<a name="column_197"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 197</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>community who took care with disease control. We do not have the scientific proof that it was the contiguous cull that prevented the spread of the disease.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-07_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the noble Countess completely misinterprets what I said at that time. The point was that, in the Thirsk outbreak, there were a number of delays to the contiguous cull. Where there was delay, there were a number of cases of animals having the disease&#151;within a very few days in some cases. The disease was therefore spreading. At one point, it looked as if it was spreading in the general direction of the south east, towards the intensive pig units of the East Riding. It would have been an utter catastrophe had the disease got into those pig units. In fact, the disease spread in a different direction. When I referred to "luck", it was a matter of luck that the delay in the contiguous cull led to the disease spreading in a northerly direction. Had it spread to the south east, the pig industry and the whole of the East Riding and the East Midlands would have faced utter catastrophe. That was the point I was making.
<P>

<a name="20326-07_para4"></a>The fact that we eventually contained the disease did depend to a large degree on the co-operation of the vast majority of farmers. But we are not talking about the vast majority of farmers; we are talking about those very few farmers who, one way or another, delayed the undertaking of the contiguous cull.
<P>

<a name="20326-07_para5"></a>Nor am I saying that at some future point, either as a result of the inquiries or as a result of a reassessment of what the correct strategy should be at European level, a different strategy might not be adopted. But, whatever strategy is adopted, whether contiguous cull, vaccination or a mixture of the two, entry to premises will be required. The Bill provides a greater rapidity of access to such premises and greater rights of access. Those are the powers that we currently lack. Were there to be a further outbreak&#151;let us all hope and pray that there is no further outbreak of foot and mouth or any other such virulent disease&#151;the lack of those powers will inhibit the Government.
<P>

<a name="20326-07_para6"></a>It would be utterly irresponsible of any Minister in this House&#151;having the hindsight which neither the authors of the Animal Health Act 1981 nor my predecessors at the beginning of the recent epidemic could possibly have had, and knowing that we could have those powers&#151;were he able to persuade the House to agree to them, to sit back and say: "Oh, sorry. Okay, I will take the view of the House and delay pressing for those powers".
<P>

<a name="20326-07_para7"></a>I am talking about interim powers in many respects. We need to have the full reports of the inquiries. But those interim powers could be crucial: for the health of our agricultural industry, and possibly, in the case of some exotic diseases that might enter this country, for public health and for human health as well.
<P>

<a name="20326-07_para8"></a>I believe that neither the noble Baroness opposite, nor the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, were they in government, would take a different view from mine. The Government need to <P>


<a name="column_198"></a>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Prior: </B>   My Lords, in circumstances where the powers were needed urgently because of an outbreak, surely the House of Commons and this place would give the Government those powers straightaway&#151;and, not only that: the Minister must know now what powers he might need, because he has just tried to tell us what powers the Government would be given under the Bill which he considers to be essential. Why does he not put those into the form of a Bill which he could introduce and push through this House and the other place in a matter of 24 hours?
<P>

<a name="20326-08_para0"></a>I do not see why we have to go into this great difficulty now in order to solve a problem which could easily be solved if it came to the crunch. In doing so, the Minister could then start to win the support of the rural community, which is longing to get together and stop all this stuff that is going on at the moment, at a time when the farming industry is in very serious trouble indeed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, it seems odd to argue that powers that we know we could get through the normal legislative process should be sought only in an emergency situation. I may be wrong, but I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Prior, was the Minister for Agriculture at around the time that the Animal Health Act was passed. Had he and his colleagues had the terrible experience of this epidemic and known what we know now, I believe that they would rightly have written into that Act the powers that I am seeking. They would not have waited to rely on emergency powers. I am therefore seeking parliamentary time, which is always precious, to do that in the normal, considered way in which Parliament undertakes these things. I hope to avoid finding that there is already an epidemic before we bring the matter to the House.
<P>

<a name="20326-08_para1"></a>We know what we need. It is not the totality of what we need. We do not know everything that we need, but we know this. In that situation, it would be irresponsible for the Government not to urge on the House the adoption of the Bill and it would be irresponsible of the House to prevent us from gaining those powers. I hope that the House will reject the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-08_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, will he address the question of Scotland? Why has the Scottish Parliament decided, in its wisdom, that it is not necessary to bring in an emergency Bill and instead issued a consultation document? I wonder whether the reason is that they managed the affairs in Scotland so admirably under the powers that they already have under the 1981 Act. As my noble friend Lord Monro said earlier, it is crazy to have legislation in England that will be different from that in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I am constantly amazed at the rejection of devolution in many contexts, which the Opposition continue to pursue. In this respect, <P>


<a name="column_199"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 199</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>agriculture is a devolved issue. Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Parliament are entitled to take a different view from that taken in England. In addition, the fact that Scottish Ministers are engaging in a period of consultation shows that they, too, believe that they need additional powers. I also point out tentatively that if, at the end of that consultation period, Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Parliament are convinced that they need legislation, the legislative process in the Scottish Parliament will be somewhat more rapid than it is in Westminster. For that reason, they have, perhaps, the luxury of being able to engage in consultation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, the argument that Ministers use&#151;that devolution means that Scotland will do something different&#151;cannot apply when we are talking about a disease in cattle that wander backwards and forwards over the Border. Surely it is the responsibility of any government and any Scottish Parliament to come to an agreement before they legislate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   With respect, my Lords, no. The criminal law in Scotland is different from that in England. Criminals also cross the border with a fair degree of rapidity. There is no reason why the Scottish Parliament should not take a different view on animal health legislation, just as it can on criminal legislation. As a matter of good practice, it is important that Scottish Ministers and English Ministers should keep in close touch and that their powers should not be significantly different. However, the right of the Scottish Parliament to take a different view and to adopt a different timescale is a consequence of devolution. I wish that some noble Lords respected the logic of that position in this context as in many others.
<P>

<a name="20326-08_para2"></a>I repeat, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Moran, does not pursue the amendment to a vote, and that if he does so the House will reject it.

<P>

<a name="20326-08_para3"></a>My main concern on tabling the amendment was that, on this very important matter, it is necessary to get any legislation right. Almost everybody agrees that the Bill as it stands is not what we want. I am sure that, to be right, the legislation needs to be based on the inquiries that the Government set up. I believe that it is very much in the Government's interests to do that.
<P>

<a name="20326-08_para4"></a>At the start of the afternoon, I was firmly of the opinion that it would not be sensible to divide the House, because I did not have the marshalled support of the Liberal Democrat and Conservative Parties. It seemed to me dotty that I should try on my own to challenge the Government. At various times during the debate, the noble Lord, Lord Carter, has given me a baleful and rather intimidating look.

<P>
<A NAME="20326-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Cox </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what is their response to recent developments in Indonesia.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am extremely grateful to all noble Lords who are to speak. I express my gratitude to those noble Lords who had intended to speak, but who now are precluded from doing so because of the change of time. I especially express gratitude to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford who had hoped to speak despite all the commitments of Holy Week, and to the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool. Our debate will be the poorer for not hearing their contributions.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para3"></a>Indonesia is a vast nation with enormous potential for prosperity. It has abundant natural resources, rich cultural traditions, magnificent scenery and people who are famous for hospitality and graciousness. Its parliamentary democracy has withstood challenges and its economic development is encouraging.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para4"></a>However, there are bitter conflicts in regions such as Aceh, Irian Jaya, Sulawesi and the Moluccas which could endanger the fragile democracy and destabilise national unity. I shall focus on Maluku and Sulawesi, <P>


<a name="column_203"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which I visited recently with a small interfaith, independent delegation. We went to the epicentres of recent violence and met both Muslim and Christian political and religious leaders.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para5"></a>Indonesia is the world's largest Islamic nation, with a population of 220 million. It has a long and well-respected history of religious tolerance. About 10 per cent of Indonesians are Christians, but in Maluku and Sulawesi the proportions are approximately 50:50. The communities lived peaceably together until the end of the 1990s, when the previous government's policy of population transmigration generated some tensions, but nothing resembling the bitter conflict that erupted in Maluku in January 1999. Since then violence has escalated, with several thousand deaths and over half a million people displaced. Last year serious fighting broke out in Sulawesi, mainly around Poso, which only ceased when the government sent in massive security forces.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para6"></a>One of the main reasons for the violence was the influx of Laskar Jihad militant extremists. They began to come in significant numbers in the spring of 2000. Now there are some 3,000 in Maluku, with many more in Sulawesi. They have received international financial support and personnel from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen and other Islamic countries. They have set up training camps: one on the outskirts of Ambon is clearly visible and well established. We were told that there are several in Sulawesi and they can easily relocate in the dense jungle when approached by government security forces.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para7"></a>Both Muslims and Christians have suffered death, displacement and widespread destruction of homes, places of worship, schools and hospitals. Psychological scars have left the communities segregated by fear and intimidation. Those beautiful, once prosperous lands&#151;famous tourist attractions&#151;have been reduced to a state of devastation.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para8"></a>Many attempts to end the conflict, such as the grassroots Baku Bae process have failed, causing resurgence of violence. Then the government initiated a new series of negotiations resulting in the Malino agreements. The first related to Sulawesi and the second, this February, covers Maluku. Successful implementation is crucial. Failure would bring widespread disillusionment and fear that the government cannot maintain law, freedom, stability and protection of their own citizens.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para9"></a>The first Malino agreement was concluded last December against a background of attacks against Christian villages in Sulawesi, involving a two-month offensive by thousands of Laskar Jihad militants. Christians fled to the remaining stronghold of Tentena, doubling the population of the city. Tens of thousands of refugees faced death at the hands of the jihad warriors when the government sent in thousands of security personnel to restore order.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para10"></a>The Malino agreement is the fifth attempt to reconcile the two communities since the start of the conflict. Muslim and Christian representatives in Sulawesi support the agreement, but emotions run <P>


<a name="column_204"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 204</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>high. The massive security contingent in the area is the main reason for the cessation of violence, but it had only a six-month mandate. Local people fear what will happen if the government forces leave, especially as Laskar Jihad has military training camps in the area.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para11"></a>The conflict has affected other communities, such as the Hindus, originally from Bali. The mayor's office in Poso told us that one Hindu temple had been destroyed, but we saw numerous temples destroyed and local Hindus claim that over 40 have been destroyed. They are devastated. The destruction of their temples is sacrilege. They do not know how they will raise money to restore them and they are living among the ruins. Therefore, it is disturbing that the mayor's office gave inaccurate information, which trivialises the suffering of the Hindus. It is essential that they are included in confidence-building and reconstruction programmes.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para12"></a>In Maluku, the Christian and Muslim communities are tired of the violence and ready for reconciliation. But when the Malino signatories returned to Ambon, there was opposition to the agreement from some militant Muslims. The Muslim signatories' car was pelted with stones and there were bomb explosions on 13th February. They took refuge at the governor's residence. The Laskar Jihad radio was calling for a violent response against them, claiming that they had betrayed the Muslim community. The violence was inter-Muslim and it was not, as reported in the Jakarta Post, Christians who had thrown stones at the Muslim delegates.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para13"></a>The national authorities, including the head of police, the Co-ordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs and Vice-President Hamzah Haz, all reaffirmed that strong measures would be taken against provocateurs who tried to disrupt the agreement. Leaders of the Muslim and Christian Malino delegations have also emphasised the importance of the military and the police in the coming months.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para14"></a>However, concerns remain about the government's commitment to translate promises into action. For example, the Co-ordinating Minister for Welfare, Yusuf Kalla, reportedly stated in an Australian radio interview that there was no necessity to remove Laskar Jihad militants from the region, as they would automatically convert their violent activities to social work if the conflict were to stop. The head of national police expressed similar sentiments.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para15"></a>There is concern over the growth of militant Islamism in these areas, with a fear that Indonesia will become a new base for the training and support of international terrorists. As Afghanistan can no longer serve as a primary base, it could be an ideal alternative, with its island terrain of jungles and mountains. The substantial proportion of its population with Arabic backgrounds would enable incoming jihad warriors from the Middle East to be easily absorbed.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para16"></a>During our visit two foreign militants&#151;a Kuwaiti and an Algerian&#151;were arrested when entering Ambon. They had an inflammatory jihad video and were reportedly planning to preach in a mosque <P>


<a name="column_205"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 205</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>against the Malino agreement. They had married girls from Poso&#151;a tactic commonly used by Islamist militants, as it legitimises their presence. They were due to be deported, but it was unclear whether they would be sent back to their own countries abroad or back to their wives in Sulawesi.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para17"></a>The presence of both Christian and Muslim militants is the greatest threat to the achievement of peace and stability. We were also told that the agenda of Islamist militants in Sulawesi was to continue their military offensives against all areas with significant Christian populations, finishing in the Tana Taraja region. Having killed, converted or evicted the Christians, they would achieve demographic change with Muslim populations who would apply for the right to implement Sharia law. That would have far-reaching implications for the principles of religious freedom and the quality of life in those communities.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para18"></a>The presence of militants includes both Christians and Muslims and poses the greatest threat to the achievement of peace and stability. That is reflected by a commitment in the Malino agreement. However, their eviction will present a serious logistical and political challenge. Unless the government act, their presence will undermine the confidence of local communities, which is an essential ingredient of the reconciliation and normalisation processes.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para19"></a>It is important to mention that there have been some positive developments. Members of the military forces and the police had been implicated in the violence in Sulawesi and Maluku in a very one-sided way, but their recent interventions have contained violence in a professional and impartial way, which is to be welcomed.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para20"></a>I turn to reconciliation and reconstruction. Millions of dollars of aid have been provided by western governments for emergency assistance and rehabilitation. However, local people are concerned about corruption among local and regional officials responsible for distributing the funds. Therefore, essential economic assistance should be accompanied by evaluation procedures to ensure that funds reach the intended recipients. Ineffective assistance exacerbates tension and provides breeding grounds for militants.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para21"></a>Reconciliation, inter-communal peace, stability and trust are preconditions for the normalisation of everyday life, with reconstruction of homes, places of worship, schools and healthcare facilities. There is also an urgent need for economic investment to provide employment. The costs will be very great.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para22"></a>I therefore ask the Minister whether Her Majesty's Government will urge the international community to offer whatever support might be appropriate to assist the Indonesian Government to implement the law enforcement and security measures recommended by the Malino agreements; take the strongest possible measures against those inciting hatred and engaged in violence; bring to justice the perpetrators of violence; invest adequately in programmes of reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction of devastated communities; and provide employment opportunities.
<P>


<a name="column_206"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 206</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para23"></a>In conclusion, what is at stake today in Indonesia is not only the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people but the stability of the world's largest Muslim nation&#151;a nation that has a highly respected tradition of religious tolerance and cultural pluralism. If its somewhat inevitably fragile democracy succumbs to threats from militant Islamist minorities, supported by external forces, the price will be very high for its own people and for the international community. This great nation plays a significant role in regional and global affairs. It must be in everyone's interests that its government are supported in their endeavours to resist militant Islamist subversion and maintain the best and most honourable traditions of the Indonesian people, including their tolerance, friendliness and historic cultures, which elicit respect and affection from all who visit their beautiful land.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clarke of Hampstead: </B>   My Lords, the House is once again indebted to the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, for initiating a debate drawing the attention of the House to what is happening in Indonesia.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para24"></a>The noble Baroness has graphically described some recent events that have taken place in parts of Indonesia. No reasonable person could fail to be moved by her tireless efforts on behalf of the people of many countries. I am confident that every Member of this House will agree that her work in pursuing the human rights of individuals to live in peace and enjoy freedom of worship is an inspiration to many both inside and outside this House.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para25"></a>Violence has continued in the Moluccas for more than three years. As the noble Baroness said, the traditional peaceful communities have grown weary of the attacks perpetrated by minorities determined to sabotage the current efforts to bring about reconciliation by trying to restart the violence. Recent developments have resulted in Muslims who support reconciliation being subjected to attacks. Muslim and Christian peace meetings have also been attacked. The object of those attacks was to heighten tension between the communities within the region.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para26"></a>During the debate in this House on 20th June 2000 I drew attention to the influx of jihad warriors in the Moluccas. At that time, almost two years ago, in answer to a Question in another place expressing concern about reports that a number of extremists had travelled to the province from outside Maluku, our Government confirmed that they were aware of the situation. They said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We have urged the Indonesian government to ensure that the security forces maintain law and order and the protection of all citizens".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-09_para27"></a><P>

<a name="20326-09_para28"></a>The recent Malino agreement, which has already been referred to, dealing with the situation in Maluku was signed by the Indonesian Government. It made clear that the Indonesian Government were responsible for the enforcement of the law and for security aspects.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para29"></a>When the Indonesian Government signed the Malino 2 agreement they effectively undertook to carry out a number of commitments which were spelt <P>


<a name="column_207"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 207</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>out. The first commitment was to end the conflict and to bring an end to the violence. Importantly for all the Indonesian people, they also undertook to uphold the supremacy of justice in a lawful, stringent and honest way, at all times acting impartially and supported by the whole population.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para30"></a>In the time available today&#151;although I accept that we now have a few moments longer&#151;it is not possible to deal in detail with the 11 tenets of the Malino 2 agreement. It is sufficient to say that it confirmed the right of the people of the Moluccas to live and work and to be active in the whole of Indonesia. That right was spelt out as being a responsibility that there should be respect for local cultures and that security and local regulations would be upheld.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para31"></a>A major tenet of the agreement was that a national independent team would be established to investigate conclusively the events of 19th January 1999. That was the date when the conflict started. The hope that was widely expressed at the time of the Malino 2 agreement has still a long way to go before being fulfilled. In my view, the international community must press for the agreement to be implemented as a matter of great urgency.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para32"></a>The peace process is in constant danger all the time that there are individuals&#151;many who come from and are supported by outside countries&#151;who are determined to wreck the efforts of those brave people who strive for peace and in many cases suffer violent attacks for what they are trying to do.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para33"></a>Another important part of the agreement was about rehabilitation. Quite clearly, the Government were committed to undertake the programme of rehabilitative training and understanding that would help rebuild the economy and public facilities in that country.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para34"></a>It was said at the time of the agreement that a national independent team would look into the whole question. It was hoped that there would be open doors. Unfortunately, that has not happened. There is still a tremendous amount of obstruction to people who want to find out what is going on.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para35"></a>I ask my noble friend to comment on the recent reports of a number of attacks on those who support the peace efforts. It is very important that those people, who are fighting both physically and with any other thing at their disposal, see that governments such as ours are supportive of the need to implement the intentions of that Malino 2 agreement.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para36"></a>I should also like to mention that it is time for an international monitoring team to be sent, outside of the independent review team that was mentioned in the Malino agreement. As a matter of urgency it should be sent to look into what is happening and to initiate moves to involve the international community to become more involved in the peace process in this troubled part of the world.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para37"></a>As I have said&#151;and as the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, said&#151;the Indonesian people are traditionally peaceful and harmonious. They have a long history of peaceful co-existence among the various communities <P>

<A NAME="20326-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, it is always a great pleasure to follow, if not my noble friends, certainly kindred spirits&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Clarke of Hampstead, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cox. I apologise to the noble Baroness that I was unable to hear the first part of her remarks today in the light of this debate coming slightly earlier than some of us had perhaps anticipated. However, I was very pleased to hear what she had to say in the part of her speech that I was able to hear. I know from my conversations with her prior to this debate that we should all listen with great care to what she has said to the House today.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para38"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, always has my admiration in raising these questions. Many of us are united in our admiration for her. When travelling in various parts of the world, all of us encounter people whose first question is to ask how the noble Baroness is. Whether it is people from the Sudan, Armenia or, in my case, when I visited the Karen on the Burma/Thai border. In refugee camps there the noble Baroness was already known because she had been there. She has been a great standard bearer for people who suffer intimidation and violence in many parts of the world. Today she has been properly raising the situation in Indonesia.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para39"></a>I should like to add my voice to that of the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, and also to convey my thanks to Ministers at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for extending invitations, as they have done, to the noble Baroness, myself and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. I suspect that the noble Lord is still recuperating from his recent period in hospital, but I know he would otherwise want to be associated with the remarks which are being expressed in the House tonight.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para40"></a>I found those information briefings helpful. It was through one of those meetings that I met the retiring Indonesian ambassador. During his time in London he did a great deal to try and address the concerns of parliamentarians and agencies working in the field. I was particularly pleased when he invited me to the embassy to discuss human rights issues. He clearly had a great interest in how we in the United Kingdom saw the language of human rights and how that must become a common language for the discussion of foreign affairs and Foreign Office issues in the future.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para41"></a>I am also very glad that there is now an all-party group dealing with the Indonesian question. A few months ago, along with the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, I was able to meet a number of parliamentarians from Indonesia who were visiting the Palace of Westminster. It is good to see that there are the beginnings of a more stable democracy. Whether <P>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 209</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people come from Muslim or Christian backgrounds, they are prepared to discuss the necessary conditions for the flourishing of a civil society in their country.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para42"></a>The great tragedy of the last few years is that&#151;whether people are Muslim or Christian&#151;those who have incited violence in Indonesia have been undermining a long-standing relationship of co-existence that has previously existed in that country. Also they have been destabilising the position in parts of the country of both Muslim minorities and Christian minorities.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para43"></a>The Jubilee Campaign is a human rights group which I helped to establish in Parliament some 15 years ago. I know that the Minister in a previous incarnation was always a great supporter of that organisation's work. I have always been grateful to him for that. Through that campaign I became increasingly concerned about the deepening problems which the Christian minority in Indonesia faced.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para44"></a>Perhaps I may at the conclusion of today's debate give the Minister a copy of a report entitled Indonesia: Poso and Maluku Fear for Life's Safety Overcomes the Urgency of Humanitarian Needs which has been prepared by the Jubilee Campaign and specifically by Ann Buwalda and Kie Eng Go. In January of this year they were in Indonesia taking evidence. As the Minister will see, it is a voluminous and detailed report. In their summary of conclusions they state:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We observed overwhelmingly clear and convincing evidence of the Laskar Jihad's well-organised and well-funded campaign to destabilize Poso and Maluku. This report provides the basis of our conclusions based on our observations. Our team encountered a number of sightings and examples of an international terrorist presence that appears to be training and coordinating Laskar Jihad militants. Early indication also exists of coordination with the Laskar Mujahidin, despite denials by the Counsel of Mujahidin, Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), and others. Numerous credible reports show that the Laskar Jihad will resume attacks on Christian villages in the target area in Central Sulawesi. Despite what has been voiced within the Malino Declaration"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-09_para45"></a>
to which the noble Lord, Lord Clarke of Hampstead, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, referred&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there is no indication that the extremists are stepping down their threats of attack, nor their capabilities. After direct investigation on Ambon Island, we uncovered the same well-founded fear of Islamic militant attacks within the remaining Christian areas".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-09_para46"></a>
The evidence for their remarks is contained in that report, which, as I say, I shall give to the Minister at the conclusion of our debate today.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para47"></a>Fighters from Laskar Jihad, the militant Islamic group responsible for killing thousands of Christians in the Molucca Islands and in Sulawesi in eastern Indonesia, have now infiltrated into the Indonesian province of West Paptia&#151;where those militants are training local militia who support Indonesian control over that province. The Laskar Jihad has sent more than 100 of its armed fighters into the West Paptian district of Fak Fak and is operating military training camps there.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para48"></a>Some Indonesian authorities are supporting the training that Laskar Jihad fighters have been giving members of the pro-Jakarta, East Merah Putih militia. Unrest and fear have also spread through the Christian community in the Sorong district of West Paptia, <P>


<a name="column_210"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 210</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>following further recent arrivals of Laskar Jihad fighters who have lately been trying to provoke religious tensions in that district.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para49"></a>The Laskar Jihad started by invading the Moluccas in 2000, then moved to Sulawesi. Now it is starting to infiltrate West Paptia, which has a large Christian community. Laskar Jihad's devastating effect on the people of the Moluccas and Sulawesi make it amply clear that there will be a lot of bloodshed if it is permitted to operate in West Paptia, as it has been able to do with impunity elsewhere in Indonesia. Urgent action is needed once and for all to stop Laskar Jihad from implementing its strategy of inciting religious hatred and carrying out systematic violence against Christian communities in Indonesia.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para50"></a>The Laskar Jihad is comprised of Islamic extremists from different parts of Indonesia. Some come from outside that country, from some other Muslim states such as Afghanistan and Pakistan. In May 2000, just as sectarian violence in the Moluccas appeared to be starting to wane&#151;many of us hoped that it might be abating at last&#151;the Laskar Jihad invaded the islands with about 7,000 fighters to wage a jihad or so-called holy war against the Christians of the Moluccas.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para51"></a>That invasion brought the levels of violence in the Moluccas to unprecedented levels, resulting in the deaths of thousands of people. Months before the Laskar Jihad invasion of the Moluccas, it had vociferously declared its intention to go to the Moluccas to wage a jihad against the Christians there&#151;yet sadly, the Indonesian Government did nothing to stop the Laskar Jihad. Some elements of the Indonesian military even supplied Laskar Jihad fighters with automatic weapons and mortars.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para52"></a>Last December, the head of Indonesia's National Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant General Hendropriyono, publicly confirmed that members of the notorious Al'Qaeda terrorist network were joining Laskar Jihad militants in fighting against Christians in Sulawesi. Due to pressure from more fundamentalist people operating in Indonesia, General Hendropriyono later retracted that statement. It is important to note that he withdrew it only because of political pressure, not because he had got his facts wrong. Intimidation was placed upon him by people from a far more extreme background.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para53"></a>While peace agreements signed between Muslim and Christian leaders from Sulawesi in December 2001 and from the Moluccas in February 2002 indicated a positive step towards peace and reconciliation, it is most unlikely that there will be long-term peace until the Laskar Jihad is completely expelled from the Moluccas and Sulawesi and its leader, Jafar Umar Thalib, is detained and prosecuted for inciting and carrying out sectarian violence. Not surprisingly, the Laskar Jihad has publicly denounced those peace agreements. It is self-evident that the Laskar Jihad has no intention of abiding by either peace accord. Numerous Christian villagers in Sulawesi report an intimidation campaign, in which they have been threatened that harm will come to them after the Indonesian troops are withdrawn in the middle of this year.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para54"></a>In central Sulawesi, about 20,000 Christians have fled their torched villages for Tentena, a village of about 8,000 inhabitants. Since June 2001, despite the absence of provocation by local Christians, Laskar Jihad-supported fighters undertook planned offensives to clear the town of Poso of Christians and systematically to target and destroy surrounding peaceful Christian villages. Thousands of Christians have become internally displaced as a result of violent attacks by Laskar Jihad and its allies.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para55"></a>The villagers' resources are limited, so they are living in miserable conditions. The Christians in Tentena are cut off and surrounded by thousands of hostile fighters. If the Indonesian police and military fail to protect Tentena, there will be a massive bloodbath.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para56"></a>While the president's despatch of thousands of additional soldiers to central Sulawesi to help keep the peace is much to be welcomed, it is deeply disturbing that those troops will only be there six months and are scheduled to be withdrawn by June. It is highly unrealistic to expect that the Indonesian military will no longer be needed to keep the peace in central Sulawesi after only six months. The peace agreement between the Muslims and Christians of Sulawesi will have little value unless there are Indonesian troops present and willing to act impartially in enforcing the agreement's terms.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para57"></a>In the Moluccas, the scandal remains of the desperate plight of at least 3,000 Christians who have been forced by Muslim militants to convert to Islam on the islands of Halmahera, Bacan, Buru and Seram. The Indonesian Government has so far refused to evacuate these forced converts to a place of safety where they can safely revert back to practising their Christian faith.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para58"></a>The Indonesian Government needs to take firm and long-term measures to control and disband the militant Islamic groups such as the Laskar Jihad. If the Indonesian authorities simply try to appease and accommodate those militant groups, they will only grow stronger and more effective in inciting sectarian violence throughout the country.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para59"></a>I refer your Lordships to an article by Andrew Marshall in the New York Times Magazine on 10th March entitled "The Threat of Jaffar". That article sets out precisely the nature of the man with whom we are dealing, the admiration that he has expressed for Osama bin Laden and his rejoicing after the tragedy of September 11.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para60"></a>I urge the British Government to put strong pressure on the Government of Indonesia to remove all Laskar Jihad members and militants from the Al'Qaeda network from Sulawesi, the Moluccas and West Papua&#151;and to detain and prosecute the Laskar Jihad leader, Jafa Umar Thalib. The Indonesian Government should also be prepared to maintain for at least two years the current level of troops in Sulawesi to keep the peace&#151;and to ensure that the police and military in the Moluccas and Sulawesi act impartially to preserve law and order. Furthermore, the British <P>

<A NAME="20326-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, I also congratulate my noble friend Lady Cox on sponsoring this important debate. Indonesia has embodied principles of religious tolerance and has served as an example not only to other Islamic countries but to the wider international community. It is unfortunate that the latest image of Indonesia in international news is of a safe haven for militant extremists and religious strife.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para61"></a>That is especially the case regarding the activities of militant organisations in the provinces of Moluccas and Sulawesi. While members of Christian and Muslim communities have been implicated in both conflicts, the recent violence is associated with the militant extremist organisation Laskar Jihad. That is the most organised militant faction in Indonesia, with reportedly more than 10,000 members. Although relatively small numerically, according to experts in the region it enjoys high-level military and political backing.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para62"></a>Some reports suggest that members of the Indonesian armed forces have provided the organisation with training, funds and weapons and have ordered Moluccan officials not to intervene in the violent activities of Laskar Jihad in the region.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para63"></a>I should also stress that the great majority of moderate, peaceable Muslims do not want the Laskar Jihad to remain in their midst, and the Moluccan Muslims have insisted that the Indonesian Government should remove them from the region. When the Laskar Jihad leader, Jafar Umar Thalib recently visited the Aceh region, a predominantly Muslim area, he was asked to leave by the Achenese Muslim leaders.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para64"></a>However, despite opposition to the organisation's extremist activities, no concrete action has been taken against it. Instead, according to the latest tragic reports from Moluccas, Laskar Jihad has been allowed to jeopardise the Government's negotiated reconciliation agreement. For example, participants in spontaneous peaceful demonstrations were attacked, sustaining serious injuries. The attackers intended to intimidate Muslims supporting reconciliation and disrupt the fragile reconciliation process. There have been no reports to suggest that the perpetrators of that act have been brought to justice.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para65"></a>It is in the areas of law enforcement and security that the international community and the British Government could play an important role. The Indonesian Government have committed themselves to uphold law and order in the Moluccas and Sulawesi and to act swiftly against those parties trying to re-ignite the violence.

<a name="20326-09_para66"></a>Have the Government offered any assistance to the Indonesian Government to help to bring about a peaceful conclusion? Such an initiative would be of particular importance given the recent reports of possible Al'Qaeda connections in Indonesia.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para67"></a>The militant extremist organisations enjoy numerically little support. At the same time, however, they have been able to destabilise two crucial regions in the country, with plans for a violent campaign in a third, Papua to tarnish Indonesia's international reputation and undermine foreign investment and tourism in the country.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para68"></a>The latest developments in Indonesia are both a hope for the future and cause for concern. The Indonesian Government needs our friendship and our assistance at this crucial time.

<A NAME="20326-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the debate initiated by the noble Baroness, Lady Cox. Being from the North, I should have realised that a dinner-hour debate should start at 5.30 or six o'clock.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para69"></a>Indonesia is a country that has seen little respite from its turbulent politics, the faltering economy and simmering conflicts since a mass uprising forced President Suharto from office in 1998 after 32 years of autocratic rule. Since then, it has had three presidents, with B. J. Habibie removed in an election in 1999 and Abdurrahaman Wahid ousted by Parliament after a lengthy impeachment process involving corruption charges in the summer of 2001. Megawarte Sukarnoputra, daughter of Indonesia's founding leader, Sukarno, now heads a fractious and deeply troubled country.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para70"></a>The President faces a myriad of dark legacies from the Suharto era, including weak institutions, and a corrupt and untrained judiciary and a pervasive military structure that exists in parallel with the civilian government. Separatist conflicts in Aceh and Irian Jaya remain unresolved, and plans for greater autonomy for those provinces have not come to fruition. Communal violence has flared in Kalimantan and Maluku and simmers away elsewhere. Little has been done to fix an economy that nearly collapsed in 1997 and has shown few signs of recovery. Corruption and lawlessness are still defining themes of a Government that have spent most of their time preoccupied with political scandal.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para71"></a>That is a bleak picture for Indonesia. However, there are bright aspects. The Malino agreement mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, and the noble Lord, Lord Alton, is a bright spot. We should commend the work of all the NGOs that have worked so hard and the tirelessly in all the trouble spots to bring the trouble to an end.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para72"></a>I should like to focus on a different aspect of the recent troubles, which is their international context. Indonesia has been seen, especially by the Americans, as one area from which Islamic fundamentalism and support for Al'Qaeda have derived. Indonesia has two prominent radical Islamic organisations, the Front To Defend Islam and the Laskar Jihad, which were <P>


<a name="column_214"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 214</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reported to have received money, men and arms from bin Laden's group and its allies, but no evidence was presented.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para73"></a>Indeed, in the case of Laskar Jihad, affiliation with the Al'Qaeda network must be doubted given the openly contemptuous attitude of its leader towards bin Laden, whom he accuses of rebelling against Saudi Arabia, a state that applies Islamic law. The group has vigorously condemned the United States attack on Afghanistan, but it has not been in the forefront of the current anti-American demonstrations. The Front To Defend Islam has taken a more aggressive stance towards America, but within Indonesia it is not reckoned capable of carrying out some of the threats that it has made.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para74"></a>Other militant groups are also engaged in protesting against the United States and threatening to expel Americans and citizens of allied countries from Indonesia, several of which registered volunteers who were sent to Afghanistan. Indonesia's radical Muslim organisations represent only a tiny proportion of the population of 210 million. Nevertheless, the outrage expressed by radicals against the United States is widely shared by the moderate Muslim majority, as well as by secular groups. They accuse America of having double standards by fighting terrorism with terrorism.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para75"></a>That has created a dilemma for the government of President Megawarte Sukarnoputra. They have pledged to support international action against terrorism, but do not want to be seen to support a US  attack on a Muslim country, with inevitable civilian casualties, as there unfortunately have been. Further, the government desperately need US assistance to restore an economy that has still not recovered from the 1997 financial crisis.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para76"></a>The demonstrations, which have rarely involved more than 1,000 demonstrators, are not in themselves a serious threat to the government, but in a context where Indonesia's democratic transformation is being accompanied by a crisis of lawlessness, it is feared that anti-foreign sentiment could prejudice prospects of economic recovery. Little could do more harm to the government's efforts to persuade investors to return to Indonesia than attacks on western property or isolated physical assaults on westerners.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para77"></a>Obviously, Indonesia is to a degree outside the Government's sphere of influence. However, I ask them to use their influence to ask the American Government not to be too proactive in aggressive action within Indonesia, because that could have the undesirable effect of provoking action rather than combating terrorism.

That has enabled us to have a debate against a highly informed background, introduced by a highly informed expert.
<P>


<a name="column_215"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 215</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para78"></a>People forget something on which the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, touched. Until five years ago, Indonesia was regarded as a good investment bet. Indeed, it was regarded as one of the new tigers of Asia and attracted considerable foreign capital. All the major investment banks&#151;I declare an ex post interest; I was working for one of them&#151;ran enormous operations in Jakarta and saw it as a part of the future. Then the Asian turmoil came out of the blue, knocking the Indonesian rupiah way down. After that, there were the IMF remedies, which proved totally unsuitable and ill adjusted to the situation, plus the usual dose of disastrous advice from economists who seemed unable to perceive the relationship between economic matters and the social and political condition of the country, as they have done in many other areas. The consequences shook the country to its foundations. It was, as we have been reminded, a dictatorial autocracy, but it had one quality, which it has struggled to regain ever since, namely enormous enterprise and energy, leading to a rapid rate of economic growth. There was also some social development, even under the dark shadow of the former president, Suharto.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para79"></a>All that is history. Since then, political and social instability has increased. Mixed up with that has been the opening of old sores and divisions and the sinister presence of terrorist activity. We see that pattern all around the world; terrorism feeds on nations in difficulties and re-activates old problems. Of course, none of that began in the past few years&#151;we are dealing with ancient rivalries and difficulties&#151;but what has developed in the past few years is the enormous opening up of ancient quarrels, with a terrifying level of violence. Is it all related to the Al'Qaeda global terrorist network? No one really knows. We get various stories and assertions. Were there training camps on some of the islands? Again, that is said to be so and then the statements are retracted and contradicted. It is hard to get a clear picture, except that it is clear that, in this world of e-enabled terrorism and global interconnection, there are international terrorist links.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para80"></a>Recently, some of us, including my noble friend Lady Cox, hoped that the communities on the islands, particularly the Moluccas&#151;Maluku and Sulawesi&#151;were weary of the endless strife and violence and that moderate groups on both sides were seeking to bring the communities together again to live in peace. We also hoped that the attacks&#151;not just those by one side against the other but those on all moderates who talked of reconciliation&#151;would cease. I was particularly fascinated by the fact, revealed by my noble friend Lady Cox, that there was a triangular battle of faiths. I had not appreciated that. Not only were Muslims attacking Christians and, in some cases&#151;we must be realistic&#151;Christians attacking Muslims, but the Hindu community was being exposed to murderous violence. There, too, the Hindu-Muslim disaster that we saw so recently in Gujarat and elsewhere is being played out.
<P>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 216</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para81"></a>A new factor has come along, about which the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, spoke eloquently. That factor is Laskar Jihad. When I visited that group's website, when preparing for the debate, I found some chilling indications of what it believed in and what it was up to. As always, the matter is not straightforward. I do not deny that, in some areas, the group may have done some social good. It may have given some impoverished and frightened Muslim communities some protection and a better standard of living. There are some testimonies in the group's favour. Generally, however, the group seems to be fully committed to violence and intent on carrying out jihad, not in the moderate Islamic sense but in the violent sense.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para82"></a>The group has links with Saudi Arabia, Yemen and the Philippines, where the United States recently identified major activity by the Al'Qaeda network. Some of the group's language is very sobering; it says that it will "deal" with Christian problems and will do it "by force". That identifies it as a highly undesirable and, in many aspects, evil movement, even if there are, as always, some less evilly motivated people attached to it and believing in some of the things in which it believes.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para83"></a>It is a situation of enormous concern. As the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, said, it may not be within the Government's scope or bailiwick to do much about it immediately. However, we are all, as never before, part of an interdependent global network. The continuing sagging of Indonesia's giant economy, in contrast to its brilliant performance in early years, is all part of the slow-down in Asia and may even be interconnected with the continued stagnation in Japan. It is in our interests, as a prosperous trading nation, to see Indonesia prosper again.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para84"></a>Even if we cannot have a direct effect, are there some things that we can do? By holding this debate, we can show the Indonesian Government that we recognise their pain and difficulty in the face of the violent clashes. We must give them the strength to ensure that the security forces act professionally, as they appeared to be doing in Sulawesi and may still be doing. If they act in an even-handed and professional manner, it will be possible to start generating the first shoots of peace, compromise and reconciliation. In the broader Indonesian context, it is encouraging that members of the armed forces and police who, in East Timor, were not even-handed and may even have promoted atrocities, are being brought to trial. Cynics will say that they are only small fry and that the real offenders are not being brought to trial. Nevertheless, there is an important attempt being made by Indonesia to bring to justice the offenders who were in uniform and may have promoted or accelerated terrible doings in East Timor and, for all I know, elsewhere. We should welcome that.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para85"></a>Laskar Jihad must be confronted and, sooner or later, disarmed, before it continues to undermine the stability and cohesion of the whole of Indonesia. I also agree with my noble friend and others, who said that economic assistance had, of course, a role to play. I would not put it all that high; enormous sums have <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>already gone into Indonesia, since the collapse of the currency in 1997. Not all of the money is traceable, and there are serious questions about accountability, as my noble friend Lady Cox reminded us. It is difficult to monitor whether the aid is used for the right purposes. In any case, there is a question whether outside aid is the answer to the problems of a series of communities that have torn themselves apart for political and social reasons. Although there is serious poverty and deprivation, which has grown since 1997, they are enterprising people, capable of turning their assets and skills into capital if they are given the chance and the rule of law is allowed to prevail. Justice and peace can give them the conditions in which they can operate.

<a name="20326-09_para86"></a>It is right that the British Government and other governments should indicate their full support for the two Malino agreements, as noble Lords have urged. Those agreements must be pursued and implemented. I am sure that the Government will do what they can from a distance to send that message. We must all recognise that it is a country in a precarious condition. Visiting Singapore a few years ago, I was told that the Singaporeans foresaw the total disintegration of Indonesia in a few years. That was at the time when the violence in Aceh was particularly prominent and also when East Timor was at its worst stage of difficulties.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para87"></a>Through some miracle the country has not disintegrated: it has held together. If we work and support the right forces, express the right sentiments and work with the rest of the international community in a sensitive way&#151;and dare I repeat it, keep some of the economists with their absurd propositions well out of the way&#151;we may see Indonesian society yet stick together.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para88"></a>Mrs. Megawati is on a tightrope and everyone recognises that. It is a similar kind of tightrope to that which confronts, say, the rulers of Saudi Arabia. The tightrope is with the extremists who have very strong appeal. They are anti-American and give very strong support to Islamic culture and ways, often of a very extreme kind. They have immensely powerful propaganda with some admiration for Osama bin Laden and some readiness to condemn the whole of the West. That is the constituency that Mrs Megawati has to recognise because it exists. She has to take it on otherwise it will destroy her and democracy totally in Indonesia.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para89"></a>On the other side there is the need to maintain Indonesia as part of the global capitalist system and to make it attractive again for foreign investment and to mobilise the colossal enterprise, which I have just mentioned and which exists in Indonesia to attract once again the huge investment flows that were so happily going into that country in the early 1990s.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para90"></a>This is not an area where bankers and economists can really understand what is going on. Indeed, the bankers were all predicting that Indonesia was the ideal investment spot almost up to minutes before the entire system collapsed. It is an area where we need to understand, as in many other areas, the inner workings of the society. There our intelligence and the skills which this country has long had in coping <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>originally with our former vast empire, and with our understanding of peoples and cultures around the world and their differences will be particularly valuable.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para91"></a>People say that they are worried that the Americans believe that they can go it alone. They cannot because the curbing of extremism and the attack on terrorism is a totally collaborative venture and our skills here are just as much needed as the vast military might and the 13-carrier fleets of the United States of America.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para92"></a>That is the picture and we have had a fascinating glimpse of it, thanks to my noble friend Lady Cox. I personally am very grateful to her. We look forward to hearing the Minister's views on how the situation stands and on what we can do here to improve it.

<P>
<A NAME="20326-09_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Grocott: </B>   My Lords, as we might have expected, this has been an extremely well-informed debate with a very wide measure of agreement. I do not believe that anything I shall say&#151;at least, I hope not&#151;will in any way detract from the views which have been expressed by most speakers. As ever, we are indebted to the noble Baroness, Lady Cox. She introduced the debate with characteristic sincerity, passion and commitment. We have all benefited from the first-hand experience which she brought to bear.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para93"></a>It is sometimes easy to forget that Indonesia held its first democratic elections for 44 years in 1999. Today, Indonesia is a young democracy facing many difficult challenges. We must judge the country from the progress it has made so far.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para94"></a>I know that the noble Baroness is a keen follower of events in Indonesia and this Government share her concern at the ruinous inter-communal conflicts that have blighted central Sulawesi and Maluku provinces.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para95"></a>I would like to place on record our appreciation of her constructive interest in the country, its many problems, and for her consideration in sharing her findings with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. I also appreciate the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, in his expression of gratitude for the various briefings which have taken place.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para96"></a>We take some encouragement from the Malino peace deals which have been referred to by a number of speakers. The Government recently supported an EU statement which called on the Indonesian authorities to do their utmost to nurture the fragile peace.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para97"></a>The House will be aware that in the weeks since the signing of the Malino peace agreements, efforts have been made in implementing their terms. The agreements were described by the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, as one of the bright spots of recent times. Multi-faith gatherings have been held in Maluku and attempts by extremists to trigger violence have met with little success.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para98"></a>For their part, the Indonesian Government have facilitated the surrender of a significant number of weapons and begun deportation procedures against suspected extremists. I can assure my noble friend <P>


<a name="column_219"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 219</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Clarke that we continue to urge the Indonesian Government to implement in full the security and law enforcement measures agreed in the Malino peace accords. We continue to monitor closely developments in the Moluccas and Sulawesi through our embassy in Jakarta. Additionally, we draw on a large international presence already active in the provinces. A UN resource centre is permanently stationed in Maluku and international personnel undertake frequent trips to the provinces.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para99"></a>But these agreements are but a first step in a long process to reconcile warring communities, rehabilitate families who have been forced from their homes and reconstruct the many buildings destroyed during the violence. The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, will also be aware of this Government's actions in bolstering Indonesian efforts to promote reconciliation, having recently met with our ambassador in Jakarta. She will have heard about the United Kingdom support to the UN Conflict Prevention and Recovery Unit in Jakarta, which monitors developments in areas of conflict in Indonesia. We are also undertaking a three-year strategy using funds from the Global Conflict Prevention Pool to promote reconciliation and facilitate reconstruction in all parts of Indonesia affected by violent conflict.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para100"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness that the conflicts in Maluku and Sulawesi, which are primarily inter-communal in nature, have been made much worse by the activities of Muslim and Christian extremist groups. Laskar Jihad was the group specifically mentioned by a number of speakers&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Howell, described it very well&#151;and the chilling language used by the group. The noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, also made an important point. They do not just intimidate Christians, but Muslims as well.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para101"></a>With our European Union partners, this Government have consistently urged the Indonesian Government to take firm action against extremists and to bring all persons guilty of human rights abuses to justice. As regards terrorism, the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, drew our attention to the fact&#151;it is quite important to make this point&#151;not just that Indonesia is the largest Muslim nation in the world, but that it has a moderate and tolerant interpretation of Islam and a history of religious tolerance. She is also right to point to the worrying speculation that post September 11th organisations with links to Al'Quaeda could operate out of Indonesia. The Government have been following closely Indonesia's approach to counter-terrorism. President Megawati was very quick to condemn the acts of September 11th and shortly after she visited President Bush in Washington.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para102"></a>A number of speakers have raised the point that there is as yet no conclusive proof of strong institutional links between Al'Qaeda and Laskar Jihad. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has written to President Megawati to share with her his thoughts on the war on terrorism. He has urged her to take firm action against individuals suspected of having links to terrorist organisations and in particular to investigate allegations of terrorist camps <P>


<a name="column_220"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>in Sulawesi. With our partners in the United States and the wider coalition against terrorism, we will continue to monitor the situation closely and explore ways in which we may support Indonesian efforts to counter terrorism.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para103"></a>The problems facing Indonesia, of course, go wider than the inter-communal conflicts in the two provinces we have been speaking about and our concerns about possible terrorist links. Separatism poses a particular challenge in the two furthermost Indonesian provinces of Aceh and Papua. Bills for special autonomy have been passed devolving significant financial resources to both these provinces. They also offer a stronger sense of local democracy. These laws now need to be implemented in full and we strongly urge the Indonesian Government to ensure that that is done.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para104"></a>Continued efforts are needed to reach a peaceful negotiated settlement with secessionist groups in these provinces. The murder of the Papuan leader, Theys Eluay, last October was a particularly worrying development. We have made clear to the Indonesian leadership that it is vital that a full and open investigation is carried out and that those implicated in the murder are brought to justice.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para105"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Astor of Hever, and Lord Howell, mentioned security sector reform. The noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, described the situation in Indonesia as cause for concern but hope for the future. That is a useful phrase. It is very important within Indonesia's new democracy that the security forces operate within a framework of democratic control. During the impeachment of President Wahid, the armed forces played an even hand. Military participation in Parliament will cease entirely in 2009. But much remains to be done, in particular with issues on human rights and budget transparency.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para106"></a>Britain is playing a part in pushing forward the debate about the need for reform of the security forces. I can tell the House that Ministers in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development have agreed a three year &#163;2.5 million security sector reform strategy for Indonesia. It aims to foster the debate about the need for democratically accountable security forces. In taking it forward, the British Embassy in Jakarta is engaging with Ministers, parliamentarians, the media and other local groups, academics and security forces. That is an important point.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para107"></a>A number of speakers referred to human rights. There is a legacy of human rights abuses committed in Indonesia under the Suharto regime. Soon after her installation, President Megawati issued a decree to extend the jurisdiction of ad hoc human rights courts to cover events in 1999 prior to the popular consultation in East Timor. Those courts started to consider cases on 14th March 2002. We are pressing the Indonesian Government to ensure that the cases are tried in a transparent and open way and that wider concerns about the jurisdictional limitations of the courts are addressed. In particular, progress is needed on accountability for past human rights abuses in Aceh and Papua.
<P>


<a name="column_221"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 221</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para108"></a>On corruption, President Megawati has begun to tackle the legacy of corruption, collusion and nepotism from the Suharto era that percolates through many tiers of government, business, the judiciary and the military. The president has established an anti-corruption commission. We were heartened recently to see a resolution of the corruption case against the Governor of the Bank of Indonesia and the steps being taken to prosecute those implicated in the latest scandal involving BULOG, the State Logistics Agency. But much work remains to be done and our Government are using the United Nations Development Plan and the World Bank Partnership for Good Governance to push forward the debate about governance reform within Indonesia.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para109"></a>The justice sector also needs a major overhaul. We and other partners are lending a hand, for example, through the Partnership for Good Governance and visits to the UK by representatives of the Indonesian Supreme Court. Recently there have been some encouraging signs: the upgrading of the convictions in the Atambua murder case where three UN aid workers were killed in West Timor; the conviction of Jacobus Bere for the murder of New Zealand peacekeeper Leonard Manning in East Timor; and the charging of Tommy Suharto for involvement in the murder of a High Court judge. Yet perseverance and political will will be needed to make lasting changes.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para110"></a>I must mention briefly the economy and the problem of poverty in the country. Indonesia still faces tremendous economic and social challenges. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, referred to that issue. Total public debt amounts to 90 per cent of GDP, and poverty has risen sharply as a result of the east Asian <P>


<a name="column_222"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column 222</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>financial crisis. Debt repayments claim over 30 per cent of government expenditure, limiting the scope for effective poverty reduction measures.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para111"></a>The Department for International Development is supporting Indonesian efforts to develop policies that support the poor. Sustained structural reform is the only way Indonesia can revive its economy and stay on track with the IMF and its Paris Club creditors.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para112"></a>On relations with East Timor, Indonesia continues to try to mend the wounds in its relationship with East Timor. We warmly applaud this rapprochement. President Megawati has met Timorese leaders Xanana Gusmao and Ramos Horta and has been invited to the independence celebrations in Dili on 20th May. High level bilateral talks continue between the countries about outstanding issues of concern&#151;for example, refugees and judicial co-operation on human rights cases.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para113"></a>Our Government and their strategic partners in the European Union, United States, Australia and Japan believe strongly that the important foundations of democracy laid down in Indonesia in 1999 must be built upon. President Megawati assumed office in July 2001 in a constitutional and peaceful way, following the impeachment of former President Wahid. She has made a positive start but we all acknowledge that the challenges facing her government remain formidable.
<P>

<a name="20326-09_para114"></a>Indonesia needs our help if the reform process is not to falter. It is in all our interests that Indonesia delivers the prosperity and security that its people demand.

<A NAME="20326-10_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden </B>   moved Amendment No. 167:

<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-10_para2"></a><P>

"( ) Nothing in this section applies to a case in which the employer has effected a constructive dismissal of an employee."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20326-10_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: We now turn to a discussion on constructive dismissal, which we have mentioned at various times throughout the discussions in Committee. This is one of the most difficult areas of industrial relations work. Constructive dismissal can be said to occur when working is made so difficult for an employee that it becomes impossible for him or her to continue in work.
<P>

<a name="20326-10_para4"></a>It can take many forms. Demands may be made upon the employee that he or she simply cannot meet and that is being done knowingly by the employer. There may be a series of demotions or transfers to work for which the employee is not suited and has not trained. There can be overwork. There can be subtle forms of harassment. There can be bullying, which&#151;as my union knows because it has done a great deal of research on the matter&#151;occurs often within industrial and commercial environments. In fact, one of my colleagues is promoting a Bill backed by my union called Dignity at Work Bill, which will be discussed tomorrow in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="20326-10_para5"></a>There could be failure to pay wages or deductions from wages. On a construction site, an employee may be asked to do work which he may feel is unsafe for him, although it is true that an employee blowing the whistle has some protection. That protection is largely thanks to legislation originally promoted in this House by my two noble friends when we were successful in getting the Offshore Safety (Protection Against Victimisation) Act on the statute book following the "Piper Alpha" disaster. We do, therefore, occasionally have some successes. That Bill was promoted by me but was drafted by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn and supported and spoken to by my noble friend Lord McCarthy.
<P>

<a name="20326-10_para6"></a>Nevertheless, there are industries where the whole working environment is inherently hazardous and where the availability of so-called "illegals"&#151;perhaps illegal immigrant workers&#151;who are prepared to do any work at low rates and not to make any complaint, can act as a pressure on existing workforces. Many <P>


<a name="column_CWH368"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH368</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>examples can be given of pressure that can be exerted by employers to get rid of employees without incurring any financial penalty.
<P>

<a name="20326-10_para7"></a>If there is a union environment, protection can usually be given to such an employee. However, I remember when I was a union official and was approached for advice by employees who were not members of a union, I would tell them that the last thing they should do was resign. I would say, "Never resign. Stick it out if you can because if they want to get rid of you, make them pay for it".
<P>

<a name="20326-10_para8"></a>However, the situation can sometimes be much too stressful for that to be a workable possibility. The employee may then feel that he or she has no alternative but to resign from the employment. What we call "constructive dismissal" then takes place.
<P>

<a name="20326-10_para9"></a>The object of our amendment is to ensure that constructive dismissal should be treated as an exceptional case and the individual concerned should not be expected to go through the various procedures laid down in this part of the Bill. The relationship will have broken down anyway and it will simply not be a reasonable and practical proposition.
<P>

<a name="20326-10_para10"></a>I hope, therefore, that my noble friend the Minister will agree that this is an exceptional set of circumstances as regards an employee and that therefore the full procedures laid out in Section 33 should not be expected to be followed before the individual concerned can proceed to an employment tribunal. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   As my noble friend Lady Turner rightly says, constructive dismissal is one of the most difficult areas of employment law and for that reason I approach it with considerable care. The amendment deals with the application of the admissibility criteria to cases of constructive dismissal. We have made it known that, unlike other cases of unfair dismissal, we are minded to apply the admissibility regime&#151;that is, the regime set out in Clause 33&#151;to some cases of constructive dismissal. Perhaps I may explain why. In cases of unfair dismissal, the employer is obliged to use one of the statutory dismissal procedures. Therefore, the employer should be in no doubt about the employee's attitude towards the dismissal.
<P>

<a name="20326-10_para11"></a>In contrast, employers may be entirely unaware of the employee's concern in cases of constructive dismissal. Millions of employees resign or quit voluntarily each year. Most leave without ever giving a full explanation to the employer, and there is no reason why they should do so. In a proportion of those cases, the employee left because he had a serious grievance against the employer. He may not have raised that grievance with the employer while in employment. In some cases, the first an employer hears about a grievance is when he receives a copy of the tribunal application claiming constructive dismissal. That is the situation which we want to avoid. We want an issue to be aired to enable the parties to find a resolution themselves before an application to a tribunal is made.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH369"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH369</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-10_para12"></a>However, we recognise that constructive dismissal cases come in a variety of forms. Some may present particular difficulties when applying the admissibility regime. For example, what should happen when an employee resigned because the employer disciplined him unfairly without following the statutory procedure? We shall need to give careful attention to this issue when drafting the relevant regulations. Of course, we welcome the views of those whom we shall consult when we prepare the regulations. For that reason, I said that we are minded to apply the admissibility regime to some cases of constructive dismissal because we are minded not to apply it in other cases. The guiding principle in drafting the regulations is clear. We want to ensure that both parties are aware of a complaint before a formal application is made to a tribunal.
<P>

<a name="20326-10_para13"></a>My noble friend Lady Turner of Camden asked what happens where constructive dismissal involves serious prior harassment of the individual. The general exemptions from the application of the admissibility criteria will also apply to cases involving constructive dismissal. Therefore, if an employee resigns following a physical assault. for example, we shall ensure that the regulations exempt such an individual from the admissibility criteria. That is another example of a case where the admissibility criteria would not apply.
<P>

<a name="20326-10_para14"></a>We believe that there is a good case to apply the admissibility regime to some, but not all, constructive dismissal cases. However, as I and my noble friend Lady Turner said, it is an extremely complicated area and it will require careful drafting in the regulations. I hope she will agree that the matter should be sorted out in regulation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-10_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   I thank the Minister for that explanation of the Government's position. I am not entirely happy with it, as he can well understand. As I believe he will have realised, my noble friends and I have been anxious to have some of these issues included on the face of the Bill rather than be left to regulations. It seems from the Minister's explanation that there could be a great deal of uncertainty. Some cases will be subject to the admissibility rules and other cases will not. It seems to me that no one will quite know where he stands. I consider that to be a rather an unsatisfactory situation. We shall have to think about it carefully to see whether we need to proceed with the matter any further. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20326-10_para15"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

"(11) An employee has the right not to be subjected to any detriment by any act, or any deliberate failure to act, by his employer, done on the ground that any action was taken, or was proposed to be taken, by or on behalf of the employee to comply, or which would comply, with any of the requirements of Schedule 2, Part 2.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20326-10_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment touches on various analogous points that we have already debated but it raises a new point. The amendments in this group are designed to give free-standing protection to an employee who complies with the steps of the statutory agreements procedure and, as a consequence, is subject to any kind of detriment by his or her employer. Obviously, in many cases where complaints relate to breaches of statutory rights, the employee will already have protection from detriments, but the clause would extend the protection to all grievances. Members of the Committee may well ask why, in the circumstances of the Bill, this is necessary, but it is really necessary because of the penalties that an employee will face for failure to comply with statutory procedures.
<P>

<a name="20326-10_para18"></a>For example, under Clause 31, his or her award would be reduced and under Clause 33 he or she would be prevented from making a claim. If, under the legislation, the employees are required to raise grievances internally, we feel that they should be protected from detriment by their employer when they do so. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20326-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   I rise to speak to Amendment No. 190 because it is grouped with the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall. As regards Amendment No. 190, I am indebted to Professor Hepple for the text. Members of the Committee will know that Professor Hepple is a distinguished expert in the field of labour law and is well known to a number of us. He expressed considerable surprise that the Bill, which introduces a number of new concepts, does not include a no-detriment clause. As my noble friend Lord Wedderburn said, "no detriment" means "no victimisation" in lay terms.
<P>

<a name="20326-11_para0"></a>It is essential that an employee should not be afraid to exercise the rights which Parliament has said he should have. The aim of the two new sections in the amendment is to provide some protection for an employee in such circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20326-11_para1"></a>The first part of the amendment, proposing new Section 47D, lays down that an employee has the right not to be subjected to any form of victimisation because he has presented, or is presenting or proposing to present, a claim to an employment tribunal, or because he proposes to utilise the statutory or other disputes resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="20326-11_para2"></a>We all know that unscrupulous employers exist&#151;if they did not, much of our legislation would not be necessary. However, vulnerable employees exist as well. The unions are there to protect such people, but as we know only too well, there are non-union environments. We have to enable an individual who feels that he has rights that he wants to pursue, to be able to do so without being intimidated in any way.
<P>

<a name="20326-11_para3"></a>The second part of the amendment, proposing new Section 104C, deals with dismissal and spells out very clearly that if an employee is dismissed and the reason, or if more than one reason the principle reason, is that he has presented or proposes to present a claim to an ET, or has sought to use the statutory or other disputes resolution procedure, that dismissal will automatically be regarded as unfair.

<P>

<a name="20326-11_para4"></a>The amendments are admirably clear and direct. We have been talking about deterrent effects mainly because some of the provisions of the Bill seemed directed towards deterring employees. It is hoped that the amendments which we have proposed will have a deterrent effect on an employer. An employer who is enraged because one of his employees has dared to challenge him by taking a case to an ET will know that if he tries to take out his anger on his employee in any way&#151;and particularly if he attempts to dismiss or does dismiss the individual concerned&#151;he will automatically be regarded as having unfairly dismissed the employee, with the financial consequences that this may entail.
<P>

<a name="20326-11_para5"></a>It is no use having rights in legislation if people are too scared or too intimidated to enforce them. I hope that the Minister will agree that these amendments are entirely desirable and that they should be included in the Bill&#151;and if not this wording, similar wording&#151;to ensure that employees are enabled, without being scared or intimidated, to utilise the rights the law gives them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, will not mind if I say that our proposal for the new clause has certain advantages.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   I think it is better.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   The noble Lord thinks it is better&#151;that is admirable. It is a disadvantage of our procedure that in merely speaking to Amendment No. 190 it probably will not be printed in full in Hansard. Could I make a plea that Hansard prints Amendment No. 190 in full? If that is not likely to be done, I shall read it but I do not believe that Members of the Committee will be happy if I do so. My noble friend summarised it.
<P>

<a name="20326-11_para6"></a>The other point that has caused a great deal of attention among commentators who have been looking at the Bill is why on earth the Bill does not have a victimisation clause. Every employment protection piece of legislation from, I believe, 1971 onwards has had provision that where you create a right for employees, and in some respects obligations, one puts in a provision that the employee has a remedy if the employer imposes upon him or her a detriment&#151;that is, victimises him or her&#151;for exercising those rights and pursuing those obligations. It is perhaps the most glaring omission from the Bill that it does not contain such a provision. I wonder whether the Minister can give us any reasons for that, other than the fact that workers' interests are not entirely fully dealt with in the draft of the Bill?

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   There is a significant difference, quite apart from issues of drafting, which is that the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, deals only with detriment, whereas Amendment No. 190 deals also with dismissal. That is a significant point and I need to address myself in particular to Amendment No. 190.
<P>

<a name="20326-11_para7"></a>We sympathise with the underlying intention of the amendment and have looked carefully at it. There is no criticism of its drafting. As regards unfair dismissal, there is protection in the Employment Rights Act 1996, and elsewhere, for employees who are dismissed for asserting a wide range of statutory right; for example, the right not to suffer unlawful deductions from wages. To dismiss an employee in those circumstances is regarded as automatically unfair. That applies whether the employee asserts a right simply by alleging that his employer has infringed it, which might be done by instituting a grievance procedure, or by complaining to a tribunal.
<P>

<a name="20326-11_para8"></a>Under the general unfair dismissal legislation, a dismissal must be fair in the circumstances. It is beyond dispute that since dismissals for asserting a statutory right are automatically unfair by statute, no sensible tribunal would find a dismissal for using one of the statutory dispute procedures fair. It is implausible to suggest that such a dismissal could ever be fair&#151;any more than it could be fair to dismiss an employee for making use of voluntary procedures. An employer who said, "I sacked him because he raised a grievance against me, or said he was proposing to", would never be able to convince a tribunal that the dismissal was fair.
<P>

<a name="20326-11_para9"></a>Turning to detriment short of dismissal, there is currently protection against detrimental treatment on a range of specific grounds, mainly set out in the 1996 Act. While additional protections against detriment have, from time to time, been added to this list, the Government have not added to them wholesale and are, in my view, entirely right to have taken this cautious view. There is no evidence that broad rights not to suffer detriment are needed and I need hardly say that any such broad rights would add greatly to the potential for tribunal complaints.
<P>

<a name="20326-11_para10"></a>I do not therefore believe that the case for having a protection against detriment, as is proposed in the amendment, is made out. Our aim is to get employers and employees to sort out disputes in a sensible way, ideally within the workplace. I cannot feel that it would be helpful to that aim to allow employees to complain to tribunals helpful to that aim to allow employees to complain to tribunals if they think that any reversal or failure to progress in their working lives is traceable to some past attempt to resolve a dispute.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   Hansard will tell us what the Minister said, but we do not know when we are going to meet again. I would like to clarify what the Minister <P>


<a name="column_CWH373"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH373</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>said. He seemed to me to be saying that he accepts that workers might suffer a detriment. He regretted that they might well suffer a detriment, but the trouble was if we did anything to mitigate their suffering it would add to the number of tribunal cases. Is that what he said?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-11_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Hansard will indeed record what I said. I said that I sympathise with the idea but, as regards unfair dismissal and detriment, I said there are remedies in the existing legislation, in particular in the 1996 Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-11_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I understand that, but my noble friend said two things. First of all, as regards dismissal, he said there could never be a case where the employee would fail if detriment in the way of dismissal were imposed upon him for presenting or proposing to pursue a complaint.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-11_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I did not say never.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-11_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   The Minister says that he did not say never. We will look at Hansard. Then I moved from dismissal because I thought the Minister had some case on dismissal, although I did not like the word "never". Let us move to detriment. He says there are remedies available already in a case&#151;and I want to be quite clear about this&#151;which the individual specified by the amendment could pursue under the 1996 statute. The individual is someone who, let us say, is suspected of presenting, or proposing to present, a complaint by reason of Section 33, or one that is contrary to Section 33. He says, "I do not like being shut out from the tribunal", and then he is victimised. The employer says, "No more overtime", or whatever it is. Which section of the 1996 Act could he rely upon for his remedy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   Before the Minister replies, could he perhaps also answer the question I would like to put, which may be the same question in similar form? If an employee has failed to comply with the statutory procedures under Clause 31 his or her award will be reduced, and under Clause 33 he or she will be prevented from making a claim. Is the Minister saying that if employees are required to raise grievances internally, have failed to comply with the statutory procedures but detriment thereafter ensues, under no circumstances will those clauses be applied against that employee?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I did not say, "prevented from making a claim". This is a common misunderstanding. There is no possibility of preventing people from making a claim. We say that when the admissibility criteria apply there has to be a letter and there has to be a wait of 28 days. Once those very minimal requirements have been gone through there is no question of preventing anybody from making a claim. Indeed, if a claim is made which is not <P>


<a name="column_CWH374"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>admissible, that can be corrected by overcoming the objections to the claim and the claim can then be made subsequently.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I repeat my question to the Minister: which section?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I said that currently there is protection against detrimental treatment on a range of specific grounds, mainly set out in the 1996 Act. I do not have the facilities to go back to all legislation. On that matter I will have to write to the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I appreciate that but I must protest that the Government come to this Committee and reject an amendment which is quite specific and which adds a normal remedy for workers who are victimised. The Minister says there are remedies already. When I ask him where they are, he does not tell me; he is not prepared for it. He does not come with a section, he does not come with an Act. I am not asking him to survey hundreds of years of legislation. He mentioned the 1996 Act; I assume he knew where to find it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   What I said was that currently there is protection against detrimental treatment on a range of specific grounds mainly set out in the 1996 Act, but not necessarily only in the 1996 Act. The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn of Charlton, is entitled to an answer, but I cannot give him an answer off the cuff, and I have offered to write to him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   It is not a question of giving an answer off the cuff; it is central to the argument. I must protest again. I am sorry. The Minister looks bored and fed up. I can well believe he is fed up because he has made a case which he cannot substantiate. If one says to workers "You have a remedy already", one must tell them, or at least their advisers, where it is. The Minister says it might be in some other Act. Which other Act? If it is in the 1996 Act, which section?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   May I dare to suggest that the Minister should reflect on what the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn of Charlton, has said, perhaps before we get to Report stage, and provide us with the answer to the question the noble Lord has put and in the meantime the amendment should be withdrawn?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-12_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Before the amendment is withdrawn, I have undertaken to write to the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn of Charlton, already. I will copy the letter to everyone else who has taken part in the Committee, and my letter will include a reflection on the matters that I am asked to reflect on.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-12_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, would he perhaps look again at the two new Sections 47D and 104C that we are proposing? The Minister said that he sees nothing wrong with the drafting of the new sections, nor do I get the impression from him that he is anything other than <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-12_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Certainly, and if the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, would like us to have a meeting with Professor Bob Hepple on the subject, we would be happy to do that as well.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 33, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-12_para2"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "AVAILABILITY OF ACAS CONCILIATION
<br>
 Where a complaint is communicated to a tribunal but section 33(2), (3) or (4) prohibits its presentation to that tribunal, then notwithstanding that section, the communication shall be treated as an application falling within section 19 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996 (c. 17) (conciliation procedure), and regulations shall provide for a copy to be sent to a conciliation officer together with such other information as will assist that officer to bring about a conciliated settlement of the claim, and for the Secretary of the tribunal to send to the applicant and the named respondent a notice of the availability of the services of a conciliation officer."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20326-12_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: I am in a hinterland between Clause 33 and Clause 34. Clause 33 has gone, but not quite gone.
<P>

<a name="20326-12_para4"></a>This amendment is another example of what they call "a probing amendment" in this place. I did not know about probing amendments until I came to this place. If I understand what they are for, they are where one does not know any more than the Government seem to know why something has been done or not done. Without knowing what the answer will be, because one is puzzled and perplexed one tables what is called a "probing" amendment.
<P>

<a name="20326-12_para5"></a>What we are probing is the absence of ACAS in this new system. The Government say&#151;and I want to quote from them subsequently in the Government response to Routes to Resolution&#151;that one of their central objectives is the promoting of conciliation. After all, conciliation comes before a hearing and is the way in which, as the Government say, a very substantial number of settlements are in fact arrived at, or workers abandon their claims for various reasons. The Government want to promote conciliation. Of course they do; it is much cheaper than hearings, and it can work quicker than hearings. It might also provide better remedies than hearings. It may after all, if it works quickly enough, provide re-employment or reinstatement. One does not know what conciliation can do. The Government want to promote conciliation, I see that.
<P>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH376</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-12_para6"></a>Why, therefore, is it absent from this period when the 28 days run? If one looks at the words of the amendment, noble Lords will see what we propose:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where a complaint is communicated to a tribunal but section 33(2), (3) or (4) prohibits its presentation to that tribunal"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-12_para7"></a>
we are in the dead period&#151;then, notwithstanding that section, it states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the communication shall be treated as an application falling within Section 19 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-12_para8"></a>
That section authorises ACAS to come in in all other ordinary tribunal cases, after the application has been sent. The parties are told that ACAS is sent a copy and that there is a possibility of conciliation. They are told what it does and if applicants say that they want to get into the conciliation process, that is it. They get a telephone call and the process begins. Why is that taken up during this period, if the aim is to promote settlements?
<P>

<a name="20326-12_para9"></a>We have some guidance in that regard. On 8th December, the Minister in another place said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The applicant should be required to complete at least one step of the procedure, the sending of the written complaint, before the tribunal can admit an application. In addition, a period&#151;say, four weeks&#151;should elapse after the step one letter".&#151;[Official Report, Commons Standing Committee F, 18/12/01; col. 195.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-12_para10"></a>
At that point, I thought that the Minister would go on to talk about conciliation, but he continued,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"has been sent before an application can be admitted".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-12_para11"></a>
He went on to explain the reason for that. It is that that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"ensures that the parties have time to begin discussing the grievance, which should ensure that the grievance is at least aired and clarified before an application is made. If the dialogue proved productive, I would expect many potential applicants to defer submitting their tribunal application beyond the end of set period while the procedure was used more fully".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-12_para12"></a>
Why can they not have help during that period? After all, ACAS specialises in the discussion, elaboration and clarification of agreements. It specialises in trying to get the parties to see that they have some area in common and in narrowing the area of difference and not promoting a specific settlement, because that would be mediation. It hopes that the parties will come to see that there are some grounds for a meeting or that one side or another wants to give in. That is what it is all about. Why should that not happen during this period if the Government want to promote a settlement that is not a settlement using the tribunal?
<P>

<a name="20326-12_para13"></a>The Government's response to Routes to Resolution contains a strange page and a bit about the promotion of conciliation. One fundamentally disagrees with almost every part of that. It says, for example, that the ability to have a fixed period of conciliation and a period when there is not conciliation will promote conciliation. I cannot see why that is. It states that as a form of conciliation, which it is not,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if you broaden the scope of compromised agreements you promote conciliation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-12_para14"></a>
You do not; you provide a substitute for conciliation. It continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We should promote the use of alternative dispute resolutions",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-12_para15"></a>
but it says nothing further about that.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH377"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH377</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-12_para16"></a>The interesting thing is what the response says about conciliation as it sees it. It admits that three-quarters of tribunal claims are settled or withdrawn before a tribunal hearing takes place&#151;presumably, it gives conciliation credit for a significant part of that. It goes on:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In many of these cases, the tribunal would have wasted time and effort on these claims, which would have been better spent on claims which do require a determination".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-12_para17"></a>
I suggest that that sentence is absolute nonsense. It asserts that the tribunal would have wasted time, but that is not the case because literally, this arises before it gets to a tribunal. If anybody was wasting time, it would be ACAS. Perhaps they really meant to say, "In many of these cases, ACAS will have wasted time", or, "In many of these cases, the tribunal might have wasted time". How do they know? What is the evidence that tribunals or ACAS are going around wasting time, which would have been better spent on cases that require a determination. I do not think that they understand the first thing about conciliation or that they appreciate the way it works. I do not think that the people who wrote the government response know the difference between what happens when the parties get together and argue (that is one process), when ACAS comes in and conciliates (that is another process) and at the appearance at a hearing (that is a third process). Those are discrete and different processes and they are the reason why, if it works, people get something out of the system. My question is a simple one: during this period, when you condemn inaction for 28 days unless the parties can reach a settlement with themselves, why do you exclude a process that most people would say can solve most of the disputes? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The first criticism that my noble friend Lord McCarthy makes involves the lack of an explicit reference to ACAS in this part of the Bill. Basically&#151;on the availability of ACAS&#151;ACAS can already provide conciliation to parties in advance of a tribunal application in certain circumstances. There is no reference because that facility will remain in place&#151;the Bill does not affect that position.
<P>

<a name="20326-13_para0"></a>It is possible that ACAS could be involved in a case in the period before the employee presents an admissible application to the tribunal. What I think lies behind this amendment is the assumption that failure to meet the admissibility criteria will debar or prohibit the employee from applying to the tribunal a second time. As we have said in response to a number of earlier amendments, this is not the way in which we intend the admissibility regime to work. As a general rule, applicants who originally make an inadmissible application would be given a second chance to make an admissible application.
<P>

<a name="20326-13_para1"></a>In other words, employees would be given another opportunity to open up a dialogue with the employer by initiating the statutory grievance procedure. If they then fail to sort out the problem between themselves using the procedure, the employee can make a second application to the tribunal which meets the <P>


<a name="column_CWH378"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH378</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>admissibility criteria. Where that happens, ACAS would be informed that an admissible application had been made and ACAS's conciliation services would be offered to the parties in the normal way.
<P>

<a name="20326-13_para2"></a>The failure by applicants to meet the admissibility criteria with their first application does not close off the opportunity to involve ACAS at some stage before the matter reaches the tribunal. We do not need to make special provision to secure ACAS involvement, as the amendment seeks to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   I am sorry, but I shall read the conciliation procedure, which is the basis on which ACAS intervenes, as stated in Section 19 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996. It states that employment tribunal procedure regulations,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall include in relation to the employment tribunal proceedings, in the case of which any enactment makes provision for conciliation&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-13_para3"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) provisions requiring a copy of the application".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-13_para4"></a>
But he cannot have it, because he has to complete it within 28 days. However, it states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"provisions requiring a copy of the application by which the proceedings are instituted, and a copy of any notice relating to it which is lodged by or on behalf of the person".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-13_para5"></a>
But we do not have those pieces of paper. It goes on,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"against whom the proceedings are brought, to be sent to a conciliation officer".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-13_para6"></a>
That is how they get in in the first place. Paragraph (b) goes on,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"provisions securing that the applicant and the person against whom the proceedings are brought are notified"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-13_para7"></a>
they have to be notified&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that the services of a conciliation officer are available to them".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-13_para8"></a>
They are available to them because ACAS has authority, based upon the fact that there has been an ET1. That is their authority. It continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(c) provisions postponing the hearing".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-13_para9"></a>
Someone has to postpone the hearing; otherwise, as happened in the old days, one might get to a hearing; of course, one would not get there now, but never mind. But never mind. Paragraph (c) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"provisions postponing the hearing of any such proceedings for such period as may be determined in accordance with the regulations for the purpose of giving an opportunity for the proceedings to be settled by way of conciliation and withdrawn".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-13_para10"></a>
That is how the arrangement works. I am not saying that there never has been a case in the history of man when ACAS has been involved in a hearing before they got the piece of paper.
<P>

<a name="20326-13_para11"></a>That is not what is supposed to happen. In all other cases, it is absolutely clear when ACAS becomes involved. What the Minister does not answer is why the Dickens that cannot apply in this case. He says, "We know that ACAS sometimes gets in round the back door". How is it supposed to know what is going on, what its authority is and what papers to work from? Why the Dickens cannot that be in the Bill?

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH379</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that being prohibited from presenting a complaint is, in the view of the Minister, not a terribly serious matter, because one will go away and make a second complaint? Therefore, it does not seem that the tribunals will be relieved of many hearings. The Minister says that the prohibition will generally be followed by a second complaint that will get to the tribunal. How can the Government save 40,000 cases out of that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Perhaps I may try again because I have not come very far with what I have said so far. First, many grievances are handled internally by employers without ever involving a third party. I believe that that is common ground. It is the normal way in which disputes are resolved between employees and employers That is a matter of fact and that is the pattern of behaviour that we want to encourage. We certainly do not want to say that ACAS should always be involved and the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, does not want that either.
<P>

<a name="20326-13_para12"></a>What I said was that ACAS can already provide conciliation to parties in advance of a tribunal application in some cases. That is provided for in Section 18(3) of the Employment Rights Act 1996. It provides for ACAS to conciliate before an application is made. The point I am trying to make is that that will continue; that is not affected in any way by the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   The point is that in the good old days nothing got in the way of the application. There was no possibility that one would needed a barrier. The worker could not even write a postcard. If the worker could write a postcard, he would be sent an ET1 and the whole process would begin; the data would be collected and off we would go.
<P>

<a name="20326-13_para13"></a>Unless the Minister can bring me figures to show that the great bulk of ACAS entries are brought in without using the formula, I do not see why he objects to the proposal. I do not see why he is being so difficult. Of course, a great number of settlements are achieved in the normal way without bringing in ACAS. However, at present if the individual worker thinks he is getting nowhere he can blow a whistle. The whistle he can blow is to send either an ET1, or whatever, to the ET service and say, "I want conciliation". He is really saying, "I want some help. I want conciliation". He gives notification and ACAS has authority. The applicant has asked for him to come in and that is the usual way forward. The Minister does not answer me by saying that the normal way is not to use it or that the normal way is to settle the matter domestically. That is a completely de novo situation.
<P>

<a name="20326-13_para14"></a>One of our main criticisms of the Bill, and we have made it over and over again, is that it has been produced in a factual vacuum. Provisions have been put on the face of the Bill by people who do not understand the consequences of what they are doing. They are now imposing conditions. They say they impose those conditions to help the worker and I accept that. However, the critical condition in this context is they have their 28-day wait. In that period, they give no help at all.

<a name="20326-13_para15"></a>If we were living in the 1970s&#151;I am not saying that I want to go back to living in the 1970s&#151;there would be a stoppage and, by God, ACAS would come in then. Things would happen and the Bill would be changed, but all we have are our arguments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, was thinking of withdrawing the amendment but I want to make an apology first. I said wrongly that Section 18(3) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 provides for ACAS to conciliate before an application is made. It is Section 18(3) of the Employment Tribunals Act, not the Employment Rights Act. I apologise for that.
<P>

<a name="20326-13_para16"></a>I am grateful for what the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, said about the context in which we are debating the issue. After all, the Bill, for the first time, gives all employees access to dispute procedures. Three million employees will be covered by procedures who were not previously covered by procedures, and that is the context in which we have to look at it. In those circumstances, surely the issue of what happens in 28 days is of secondary&#151;I will not say minor&#151;significance.

<A NAME="20326-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, will he not appreciate that Section 18(3) applies at a time where,
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-13_para17"></a>
The situation we are discussing is a case where he is prohibited from presenting a complaint. I appreciate that Section 18(3) is a general provision about conciliation, but it applies where action has been taken in respect of which
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"proceedings could be brought by him before an employment tribunal".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-13_para18"></a><P>

<a name="20326-13_para19"></a>I do not understand why even the citation of the right Act and this section does not help the Minister.
<P>

<a name="20326-13_para20"></a>Secondly, does the Minister not understand that the Government have already amended Section 18 in Clause 24, to cut out a duty to conciliate in certain situations and impose a power. We objected to that at the time, but how Section 18 helps the Minister I do not know.
<P>

<a name="20326-13_para21"></a>The point that my noble friend and I are pressing is that under Section 19 there is the natural route for the case to reach the ACAS conciliation officer. Section 19 provides that where one has a complaint that is presented to the tribunal one sends it as a matter of course to the conciliation officer. When the Government's provisions prohibit access to justice, why not allow the matter to go as a matter of course to the conciliation officer? It might help to get a settlement. That is all there is.

<P>
<A NAME="20326-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   There is no question of prohibiting access. We are saying that in order for an application to be admissible it has to pass some very minimal criteria. We are talking about writing a letter and we are talking about waiting 28 days. When there <P>


<a name="column_CWH381"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH381</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is a failure to meet the admissibility criteria, there is no debar or prohibition on the employee from applying to the tribunal a second time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   This is why I say that the Government do not answer questions. They never answer questions. The question is a simple one. Why not allow the employee to go to ACAS in the usual way? What damage does it do? Why should he wait 28 days? What assistance would that be? If ACAS cannot solve the matter, he will have to wait 28 days. If the Government want to facilitate settlements, in the name of God why cannot that be put on the face of the Government's Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Because we want first to encourage settlements of the kind which nearly all settlements are&#151;that is, settlements between employer and employee&#151;and we want to do that first.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   The Government want to promote settlements but in order to do that they do not send the case to the conciliation officer in the normal course of things. Conciliation officers help settlements. Has not the Minister met a few? Has he not talked to them about what they do? Of course they are not present in all settlements, but I am surprised that the Government under-rate the value of ACAS conciliation officers. They are enormously important in promoting settlements. We are trying to help the Government here. Why are they so resistant?
<P>

<a name="20326-14_para0"></a>The Minister must understand that there are people who say that these perfectly reasonable and sensible amendments are resisted because the CBI will not have them. That is what people way. If we are left without any rational argument for rejecting them, we will have to listen to those people more.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   We must bring the matter back on Report. We cannot let this go here. I believe that the Government are simply being obstinate. Let them to go ACAS; let them ask ACAS; and let them tell us what ACAS says in particular about this part of the Bill. What do they think the conciliation officer does on the telephone? What do they believe the first question is? The conciliation officer rings an applicant&#151;that is the usual way&#151;and asks, "Where have you got to?" If the applicant says, "We've had a settlement"&#151;God knows the organisation has enough work to do&#151;he says, "Do you think we can help?". No one is getting in the way of domestic settlements; why the hell should they? I urge the Government to think about it, and we shall come back to the issue on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20326-14_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<A NAME="20326-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton </B>   moved Amendment No. 169:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 33, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-14_para2"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "COMPLAINTS PROHIBITION PROVISIONS
<br>
(1) Where an employee is prohibited from presenting a complaint to an employment tribunal by reason of section 33, the following provisions shall apply.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_CWH382"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH382</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(2) A breach of duty or unlawful act under a jurisdiction specified in Schedule 4 by any party named as respondent or otherwise in the complaint, shall constitute and remain, if proved before a court or tribunal, an illegal act or unlawful means for the purposes of any enactment or any rule of law notwithstanding the prohibition."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20326-14_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: I fully appreciate that Amendment No. 169 is a somewhat technical amendment. It posits a situation where,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an employee is prohibited from presenting a complaint to an employment tribunal by reason of section 33".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-14_para4"></a>
In view of what the Minister said, he will not like the word "prohibited" and he may prefer the situation to be described without that word. I cannot think why he does not like the word "prohibited". But under subsections (2), (3) and (4) of Clause 33 as it now is, the employee,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall not present a complaint to an employment tribunal".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-14_para5"></a>
Therefore, perhaps we can rephrase it with the words "arising in that situation".
<P>

<a name="20326-14_para6"></a>An employee alleges that an unlawful act has taken place for which he wants a remedy but he is not able to present the complaint. In the general law, an act which is a breach of duty, in particular under a statute but generally, is capable of being unlawful means for the purposes of a general common law.
<P>

<a name="20326-14_para7"></a>This is a complex area but I hope that I may summarise it accurately in the following way. Unlawful acts can be relied upon by a person whose business, trade or employment is interfered with by a person in an action in the High Court, or, indeed, county court, for damages and perhaps even an injunction. In other words, it is not an action in the tribunals but it impacts upon that because here the employee is alleging&#151;by hypothesis, for the moment we assume that it is correct&#151;that it is an unlawful act on the part of the employer. However, he cannot present that to the tribunal. In other words, this is an act by the defendant in respect of which his right is unenforceable. Whether he goes a second time is not within the purview of the argument. I am talking about a case where he does not. The Minister's confidence that every worker will go a second time is perhaps an important message to trades union advisers. However, in this case there is, by hypothesis, an unlawful act which is unenforceable.
<P>

<a name="20326-14_para8"></a>Unlawful acts include not only a breach of statute but also a breach of contract. That arises under the Bill since the House of Lords decision in Rookes v Barnard [1964] Appeal Cases 1129. According to Lord Justice Dilhorne in the case of Department of Transport v Williams [1993] in The Times of 7th December in the Court of Appeal, it also includes the breach of any statute.
<P>

<a name="20326-14_para9"></a>Here a breach of contract arises if it amounts to a failure to operate the procedures properly because Section 30 of the Act will make it so. It is also a breach of the statute because Schedule 2 and Section 29 require it to be operated. Therefore, we have a case that falls strictly within the doctrine, with an exception. Where the employee suffers damage therefrom, he can sue in tort&#151;that is, "t", "o", "r", "t", which usually gets spelt, but not in Hansard&#151;for <P>


<a name="column_CWH383"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH383</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unlawful interference with his employment. So an employer who refuses to answer a written statement&#151;that might happen&#151;is giving the employee that situation as he is deprived of his remedy at that point.
<P>

<a name="20326-14_para10"></a>Without going into the very complex case law that governs this point, the essential ambiguity in the law is that the cases do not make it wholly clear whether an unenforceable act of an unlawful kind is still actionable under this doctrine. It is my submission that the better authorities suggest that the action would still lie in the ordinary common law courts. All that the amendment does is to clarify that ambiguity, if there be one, and to state that where the unlawful act is unenforceable, it remains&#151;I quote the amendment&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an illegal act or unlawful means for the purposes of any enactment or any rule of law notwithstanding the prohibition".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-14_para11"></a>
That is, notwithstanding the fact that the employee cannot present a complaint to the tribunal and enter the doors of its jurisdiction. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I shall not make a point about the word "prohibition"&#151;my noble friend generously anticipates what I shall say. I will only say that, rather than prohibiting applications on a permanent basis, the proposed regime will apply in ways that will ensure that employees have a second opportunity to make an admissible application, if their first was inadmissible.
<P>

<a name="20326-14_para12"></a>The issue is about whether an illegal act somehow becomes lawful. Clause 22 is about the circumstances under which employees may have access to the tribunal system. Of course, there have always been conditions limiting access to the tribunal system. Most notably, applications must generally be made within a specific time limit. Clause 33 adds new conditions&#151;it is not a legal question, but a political question. We think that the conditions are both reasonable and proportionate, and we think that they bring significant benefit to both parties in encouraging mutual dialogue before an issue has to go to a tribunal. That is an issue of policy, however, and not an issue of law. The issue of law is that there are already conditions limiting access to the tribunal and Clause 33 adds to them.
<P>

<a name="20326-14_para13"></a>However, what Clause 33 does not do is to change the underlying employment rights themselves. When an employer has infringed those rights, that infringement does not of course become lawful simply because the employee has not&#151;or has not yet&#151;been able to challenge the legality of the employer's action before a tribunal.
<P>

<a name="20326-14_para14"></a>In that sense, Clause 33 operates in the same way as the existing time limits on making applications to a tribunal. The tribunals can already refuse to accept an application that is out of time. When they do so, an unlawful act does not become lawful as a result, but it means that the employee cannot seek a determination or remedy from the tribunal for the alleged unlawful act. We do not have provisions of this nature that apply to the existing law on the time limits and there is no reason to suppose that they will be necessary in this context either.

<A NAME="20326-14_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his reply and for not making too much about our use of the word "prohibited", which is quite accurate, but which he does not like. I make these comments only: the case of two applications is irrelevant. I am concerned with the application. I am not concerned with time-barred claims; limitation of action. Limitation of action is a quite different juridical category. I am not concerned with policy questions, other than making the law clear. I do not understand why this is such a high political issue. I thought it was an issue that arose from the case law, which the Minister has not discussed. I refrain from citing the case law on unenforceable rights. They leave a slight question mark, which is in all the books. I thought that the amendment might clarify the matter. The Government, for reasons I still do not understand, will not have it, but there is nothing to do at this stage but to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="20326-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton </B>   moved Amendment No. 170:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 33, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-15_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "COMPLAINTS ON ONE OR MORE GROUNDS
<br>
(1) The Secretary of State shall by regulations make provision for applications to an employment tribunal which include more than one ground of complaint, including complaints under more than one jurisdiction.
<br>
(2) Where such an application is made on one or more grounds to which section 33 applies, and one or more grounds to which that section does not apply, subsections (2) and (3) of that section shall not apply to it."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An employee shall not present a complaint".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-15_para5"></a>
I have always wondered why the clause was drafted in that way. I take it it was more to do with the instructions to the draftsman than the draftsman himself because I cannot believe that the draftsman would not have wanted to refer to the technical terms which exist at present in the law and would not have drafted it as:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An employee shall not present an originating application to an employment tribunal".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-15_para6"></a>
However, the subsection does not say that. It says "a complaint".
<P>

<a name="20326-15_para7"></a>The reality is that in many cases a complaint, or at least an originating application, will include a number of cases. If the Minister would like to look at the statistics of cases which come to a hearing in employment tribunals, produced annually by the Employment Tribunals Service, he will find that the <P>


<a name="column_CWH385"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH385</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>130,000, which are enumerated, are listed under the major head of what is being presented in the applications. If one looks at the number which present multiple grounds of complaint, one gets a much larger total by specifying them all out.
<P>

<a name="20326-15_para8"></a>Many complaints have multiple grounds. The subsection provides that where the tribunal&#151;we have learnt most valuably in our debates that there is to be a tribunal, or at any rate, a tribunal chairman notified through the secretary&#151;sees an originating application submitted on multiple grounds, some of which fall within Section 33, in order to avoid the tribunal having to engage in a long process of assessing which grounds fall within Section 33, those complaints or originating applications should not be prohibited from being presented under the section. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Let me start by agreeing that applications which are called multi-jurisdictional&#151;in other words, which involve two or more complaints&#151;are by no means unusual. My noble friend Lord Wedderburn is saying that they are the majority of cases and that seems entirely possible. Employees often allege in a single application that an employer has infringed a number of employment rights. That often occurs in cases of unfair dismissal. However, as we have explained, the admissibility criteria will not be applied to cases of unfair dismissal, other than in some constructive dismissal cases, nor will they generally be applied to former employees. The scope for the admissibility regime to be applied to multi-jurisdictional cases is not as great as may appear. However, we recognise that such cases will occur and that we need to have systems in place to deal with them.
<P>

<a name="20326-15_para9"></a>The amendment highlights this issue. It proposes a rule for the application of the admissibility criteria to cases where proceedings are brought both under a jurisdiction or jurisdictions to which Clause 33 applies, and under a jurisdiction or jurisdictions to which it does not apply. It proposes in these circumstances that where the admissibility criteria do not apply in relation to any one or more of the complaints, they are not to apply to any of the complaints made at all. I hope that I describe the impact of the amendment correctly. It appears that I am.
<P>

<a name="20326-15_para10"></a>We recognise that the regulations will need to deal with the special circumstances raised by complex cases involving several complaints. In drawing up the regulations, we will be guided by several considerations. Where possible, we want to avoid unnecessary and wasteful processing of complaints. It follows that we do not want to compel employees in all circumstances to treat each element of a complaint separately, thereby forcing both them and the employer to undertake separate rounds of the three steps for each part of the complaint.
<P>

<a name="20326-15_para11"></a>On the other hand, we see no reason in principle why in the case of multi-jurisdictional applications, the admissibility regime cannot normally be applied successfully to those complaints which attract it. That is, however, a matter that can be dealt with in the <P>


<a name="column_CWH386"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH386</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regulations to be made under the clause. We do not think it is desirable to limit the discretion we have in this area by imposing limitations in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20326-15_para12"></a>The regulations will need to deal sympathetically with situations of the kind encouraging closely related complaints to be linked. We will also need to cater for circumstances where a complaint evolves through a dialogue between the employer and the employee. Sometimes, an employee only recognises the full nature of the complaint through the discussions. Again, we will need to allow for those circumstances, ensuring wherever possible that employees are not required to send a second letter listing a further grievance where that grievance has already been aired orally at the meeting under the statutory procedure.
<P>

<a name="20326-15_para13"></a>I can assure my noble friend Lord Wedderburn of Charlton that we appreciate the issues raised by multiple complaints. They are certainly complex issues. We will need to address them carefully in the regulations. As we have said, we will consult on the draft regulations to find the best approach. However, I am afraid that that does not mean that we can accept the general exclusion of the admissibility criteria in these cases.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for what he says. Of course the amendment is not primarily about unfair dismissal; it is about grievances because they fall within paragraph 6 or 9 of Schedule 2.
<P>

<a name="20326-15_para14"></a>However, as regards the record and what we know about it, we have raised a new point. I am glad that the regulations will purport and try to deal with this matter. I am not entirely sure from what the Minister has said how he will deal with it. I appreciate that like so much in the Bill we will have to wait until the tablets of stone are delivered in what are likely to be volumes of regulations as far as I can see. We look forward to that. I am glad that it is being considered. In that spirit, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-15_para18"></a><P>

<a name="20326-15_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 176A and 176B, which make different points technically but the same point in substance. That point is very straightforward. It goes back to the issue of detriment which we touched on during debate on an earlier amendment. The parts of Schedule 4 all relate to claims of detriment where the employee claims that he or she has suffered a detriment as a result of claiming a statutory right. In those circumstances, the employee has already put the employer on notice that he or she is taking steps to enforce a statutory right. Therefore, it is difficult to see the justification for preventing the employee bringing a claim when the new complaint is that the employer has reacted badly to the initial complaint. Simply <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>deleting the sections may be a cumbersome way in which to attempt to deal with this matter, but I am sure that the Minister takes the point on board. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20326-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The grouping has betrayed us to some extent because we discussed much of this issue previously when we debated the amendments which paved Amendment No. 172 and so on. However, I must take these four amendments on their own. They seek to leave out a number of detriment jurisdictions from Schedule 4 to which, of course, Clause 33 applies. A number of amendments relating to detriment have already been debated. Our view is well known. We do not believe that these jurisdictions should be omitted from Schedule 4 but there is a case for exemptions in some circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20326-15_para20"></a>Amendment No. 172A seeks to omit Section 146 of the Trade Union & Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, which is concerned with detriment in relation to trade union membership and activities, and paragraph 156 of Schedule A1 of the same Act, which is concerned with detriment in relation to union recognition rights.
<P>

<a name="20326-15_para21"></a>Amendment No. 173A seeks to leave out Section 48 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which is concerned with detriment in relation to such issues as health and safety cases, working time cases, employee representatives, protected disclosures and leave for family and domestic reasons.
<P>

<a name="20326-15_para22"></a>Amendment No. 176A seeks to omit Section 24 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, which is concerned with detriment in relation to the national minimum wage. Amendment No. 176B would leave out Schedule 3 to the Tax Credits Act 1999, which deals with detriment in relation to tax credits.
<P>

<a name="20326-15_para23"></a>It has been argued that employees who have already had detrimental action taken against them will be inviting further victimisation by initiating the statutory grievance procedure. However, I do not see why writing a Step 1 grievance letter to an employer should normally be an intimidating step to take. After all, as my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer pointed out yesterday, if the employee subsequently wanted to make a complaint to an employment tribunal, that would need to be set down in writing.
<P>

<a name="20326-15_para24"></a>As we said earlier, there should of course be exemptions for things such as bullying or the threat of violence, and the regulations will address that. I hope that it will provide some reassurance to the noble Lord, Lord Razzall. But I do not see any need to provide what, in effect, would be a general exemption where detrimental action has been taken by omitting the lines in Schedule 4 as proposed by the amendments.

<FONT SIZE=3>procedures&#151;that is, Step 1 or any other step&#151;must be gone through where the employee has been victimised. This is not a case where he is simply pursuing his rights.
<P>

<a name="20326-15_para25"></a>I understand the Government's arguments, although I do not agree with them, in relation to a case where a worker is pursuing his rights. There they are adamant, even under the Disability Discrimination Act, that he must satisfy their procedures before he can go to a tribunal. I do not understand the logic in saying that the worker will be excluded when he is bullied&#151;or, as I understand it, that that will apply in certain cases of bullying&#151;but that he will not be excluded where he is victimised for pursuing his rights. A large number of the cases in Schedule 4&#151;that is what we are again discussing&#151;are detriment jurisdiction cases. In fact, if one added them up, one would, I think, find they constituted a very high minority of cases&#151;not half but a high percentage of cases are detriment cases, in which a worker is victimised for proposing to pursue his rights. If you want to protect him where he is being bullied, why will you not protect him where he is being victimised?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton </B>   moved Amendment No. 179:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 39, line 5, at end insert "or in Part 2 of that Schedule (grievance procedures)"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-16_para5"></a><P>

<a name="20326-16_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: We now come to Clause 34, which is generally known in the discussion of the Bill as the Polkey clause. However, the amendment is not essentially to do with Polkey; it concerns the first provision in new Section 98A, which Clause 34(1) would include within the provisions of the Employment Rights Act.
<P>

<a name="20326-16_para7"></a>New Section 98A would provide that an employee who is dismissed is to be regarded as unfairly dismissed if three conditions are satisfied. First, if one of the <P>


<a name="column_CWH389"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH389</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>procedures concerning dismissal and discipline applies; secondly, that that discipline procedure has not been completed; and, thirdly, the non-completion of the procedure,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is wholly or mainly attributable to failure by the employer to comply with its requirements".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-16_para8"></a>
We understand that, and we do not need to be told what subsection (1) of new Section 98A means. What we ask in the amendment is why is it so limited? What is inserted is a discipline procedure under Part 1 of Schedule 2. Our amendment would include grievance procedures in Part 2 of that schedule.
<P>

<a name="20326-16_para9"></a>If I may put the Bill's proposal in this way, if the employer does not complete, because of his failure, the discipline procedure and dismisses, that is an unfair dismissal. However, we have already seen in a number of debates that the ACAS code is right in saying that, in the course of discipline&#151;or, indeed, a number of other things&#151;a grievance can arise and the employee may be pursuing a grievance procedure.
<P>

<a name="20326-16_para10"></a>The amendment raises the question: why should it equally not be an unfair dismissal if dismissal eventuates where the employer has failed properly to complete a grievance procedure? The Minister, I am sure, will not say that that could not happen. It may happen in a small number of cases but it could plainly happen that the employer fails to write or does not take whatever other step is required under the standard procedure or under the modified procedure.
<P>

<a name="20326-16_para11"></a>Its seems to us a matter of even-handedness that the employee should be equally protected in a case where a grievance procedure has not been completed, because he is quite properly protected in a case where a discipline procedure has not been completed by reason of the failure of the employer. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-16_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  New Section 98A(1) of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which will be inserted by Clause 34, will make it automatically unfair to dismiss employees without following specified minimum procedures. Those specified minimum procedures are the disciplinary and dismissal procedures in Schedule 2, and the new protection provides both an extra incentive for employers to use them and compensation for employees if they do not. Where an employee raises a grievance and is later explicitly dismissed, nothing would be added by providing that failures by the employer in the course of the grievance procedure would render the dismissal unfair. It would be a superfluous protection since, in these circumstances, it is for the employer to follow the disciplinary and dismissal procedures; any failure to do so will be automatically unfair.
<P>

<a name="20326-16_para12"></a>However, the amendment may be intended to apply where an aggrieved employee resigns because of the employer's conduct and claims that this was a constructive dismissal&#151;in other words, in cases where it is assumed that the disciplinary and dismissal procedures have not been followed because the employer did not consciously dismiss the employee. <P>


<a name="column_CWH390"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH390</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Although I cannot support the amendment, I should like to take the opportunity to tell Members of the Committee how we expect to deal with constructive dismissals.
<P>

<a name="20326-16_para13"></a>We intend to provide in regulations under Clause 31 that employees who resign and complain that they have been constructively dismissed will generally have to follow one of the grievance procedures, either before or after resigning, if they want to take a case to a tribunal. In such cases the employer is liable to an enhanced penalty if he has not complied with his side of the grievance procedures, but I think it would be wrong for any such failure to render the dismissal automatically unfair. The link between the employer's action or inaction and the potential consequences would be too tenuous.
<P>

<a name="20326-16_para14"></a>However, where an employer takes disciplinary action against an employee, he will of course have to follow the disciplinary and dismissal procedures in doing so. If the employee considers that the disciplinary action was a fundamental breach of contract entitling him to resign and claim constructive dismissal, and the tribunal agrees, there may be a case for providing that any failure by the employer to follow the disciplinary and dismissal procedures when taking that action will render the constructive dismissal automatically unfair under new Section 98A(1) of the Employment Rights Act 1996. But this is a difficult area. It is arguable, for instance, that it should only be the case where the employer contemplated dismissal rather than some lighter punishment. This is the kind of issue which we shall need to consider before making regulations about the application of the procedures. I can assure Members of the Committee that we will consider it and we will of course consult on whatever we propose. However, I believe that it would be unwise to make specific provision at this stage. I therefore invite my noble friend to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the Government's position. Of course, I understand that they do not want to put anything in the Bill&#151;they never want to put anything in the Bill&#151;but we have some glimmer now of how they might deal with some of the cases that could arise in respect of our amendments. He has been rather more forthcoming than my noble friend Lord McIntosh was in his discussion about constructive dismissal. If I understand him right, in at any rate most constructive dismissal cases, the employee must follow the grievance procedure&#151;I think that that is what he said.
<P>

<a name="20326-16_para15"></a>We know that, in certain situations, which in law will be dismissal, the employee has got to follow the grievance procedure. Yet he will not be protected by the protection of automatically unfair dismissal if the employer fails to fulfil and complete the grievance procedure&#151;at any rate, not on that ground alone.
<P>

<a name="20326-16_para16"></a>I thought the Minister was hinting that our case could not really arise because in order to dismiss properly, the employer must complete the discipline procedure. But, with great respect, that does not <P>


<a name="column_CWH391"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH391</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>finalise the argument. Under the grievance procedure in Step 7(3), an employer must inform the employee of his decision as to his response to the grievance. That is nowhere mentioned in the discipline procedure because the discipline procedure is drafted separately. So if the employer does not inform,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the employee of his decision as to his response to the grievance"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-16_para17"></a>
he is in breach of the grievance procedure.
Perhaps I may give one example; there could be others. If he is in breach of the grievance procedure, fulfils the discipline procedure but then dismisses, why on earth should the employee not be able to say, immediately and automatically, "That is an unfair dismissal" and why should the tribunal not agree with him?
<P>

<a name="20326-16_para18"></a>With the greatest respect, I believe that once again the Government's response is technically inadequate and in policy terms quite indefensible. Why should this apply only where the discipline procedure has been broken by the employer? Why should it not arise, as in the example I have given, where the grievance has not been completed by the employer?
<P>

<a name="20326-16_para19"></a>I ask that question again. I shall read Hansard with great interest. On what I have heard today, I do not think I shall find an answer, except that the Government will not do it. The Government must understand that there is a theme running through their refusal even to consider the amendments. I do not ask that our wording should be accepted, but they refuse even to consider these amendments as proper for the Bill because they are always amendments that improve the position of the employee. It is therefore not unreasonable to believe that they are under pressure from employers' organisations not to accept any amendment which improves the position of the worker.
<P>

<a name="20326-16_para20"></a>Ministers must understand the history of this matter. We objected to some of the proposals put forward in Routes to Resolution. We said that the research, which was unpublished, did not justify the conclusions the Government raised. We are then told that that has little significance from the point of view of policy making. The Secretary of State drives Clause 33 through the Joint Committee on Human Rights; through what, with great respect, last time we called a misleading prospectus. We then receive a refusal to accept any amendment that improves the position of the employee. The record will show that that is so.
<P>

<a name="20326-16_para21"></a>Therefore, why do the Government have to object so strongly to a tiny amendment that would, I accept, apply only to relatively few cases, but cases where the justice of the case would demand that the dismissal be automatically unfair? I place that on the record. The Minister may not wish to answer it now but I put to Ministers that they have a case to answer. I suggest that a pattern is emerging whereby every measure which would improve the position of the employee is rejected. It is not even taken away for further consideration. I hope that organisations which represent workers in this country will notice that and <P>

<A NAME="20326-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Perhaps I may respond to the last point. My response clearly covered the technical position that the noble Lord raised. We have two criteria to this Bill. The first is whether it improves industrial relations in the workplace; and the second is the criteria of fairness. That is what we shall judge all the aspects of the Bill by and we are under considerable pressure from all parties in that. The first of the two criteria in which we are interested is improvement of the workplace relationships and the second is social justice. We shall stick to those two principles.

<a name="20326-17_para1"></a><P>

"(1A) In cases of unfair dismissal falling within subsection (1), the tribunal shall, if the employee expresses such a wish under section 112(3), make an order under section 113."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20326-17_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 180 refers to what is already in the Bill; namely, that where an employer has failed to complete the discipline procedure but dismisses, that is an automatically unfair dismissal.
<P>

<a name="20326-17_para3"></a>In unfair dismissal, in our law in the tribunals, the primary remedy is, theoretically, that the worker should get his job back. That is called "reinstatement" or "re-engagement on similar terms". I shall call it reinstatement. Other systems regard it as obvious that this should really apply. In practice in our system, something like 0.03 of the successful cases achieve reinstatement. Of course, there are some cases where the employee does not ask for reinstatement, and it would be absurd to provide the remedy there. However, that does not explain the astonishingly small number of orders for reinstatement or re-employment in our system.
<P>

<a name="20326-17_para4"></a>In Italy, reinstatement is the primary remedy and in enterprises of above 15 workers, where it applies at the moment in full, that is effective. Let me underline what we are talking about; a very large number of workers who are unfairly or arbitrarily dismissed. We are talking about workers who are just shoved out without justificatory motives, as the Italian system puts it&#151;justified motives. It really works there and that is why Sylvio Berlusconi has put forward a programme to decimate the remedy under pressure from employers in Italy. There is more than an echo in the Bill of a stony Berlusconi approach. I am perhaps assuming too much. Perhaps I am assuming that the Minister will resist this amendment. We have to become accustomed to such things.
<P>

<a name="20326-17_para5"></a>I want to put to the Minister a case in which an employer has dismissed a worker without regard. Let us take a really bad case. The employer has ignored the <P>


<a name="column_CWH393"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH393</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discipline procedure and he has not investigated the case. That happens and there are cases in the law reports. I can think of a case where the employer simply said, "Go and clear your desk in the office and get out. Be off the premises in five minutes". When the worker was not, he was escorted out.
<P>

<a name="20326-17_para6"></a>The worker may say, "I want to pursue the primary remedy of reinstatement". He may be misguided and if it were me I would not go near the place again. However, there may be all kinds of reasons&#151;for example, continuity of employment and pension rights&#151;why he wants an order of reinstatement. Surely, in such a case he should receive it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   The amendment deals with the part of Clause 34 which will make it automatically unfair to dismiss an employee without following the new statutory procedures. The effect of the amendment would be to replace the discretion which tribunals have to order an employee's reinstatement or re-engagement, if that is what he wants, with an obligation to make such an order where the dismissal is found to be unfair because the minimum procedures have not been followed.
<P>

<a name="20326-17_para7"></a>I cannot agree that this should be the case. Whether reinstatement or re-engagement is desirable can depend on many variable factors that are unrelated to the reason for the dismissal being unfair. It would not therefore be wise to require these remedies to be ordered simply on the say-so of the employee where one particular reason for the dismissal being unfair applies.
<P>

<a name="20326-17_para8"></a>There is a very simple case here as to whether one replaces the discretion of the tribunals or not. We do not wish to do so, and I therefore ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am not sure whether that was the short answer or the long answer. In my submission and with great respect, it is a pretty inadequate answer. The Government do not think it is wise to give a worker this right and yet he is a worker who has been put out on the street without regard to the dismissal procedures and the disciplinary procedures on which the Government place so much reliance to improve industrial relations. I refer to people who do not improve industrial relations but dismiss workers arbitrarily. It would not be wise to give an automatic remedy of re-employment against them, because, of course, the remedy of re-employment or reinstatement may have legal consequences, quite apart from the reality of any reinstatement.
<P>

<a name="20326-17_para9"></a>The Government do not seem to want to bother about such cases. They tell us that is not wise and that the tribunal has a discretion. Of course, the tribunal has a discretion; that is why we moved the amendment. But in this case there should be no discretion in terms of application of the primary remedy and consequences which flow from it.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-17_para12"></a><P>

<a name="20326-17_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 181 is a drafting amendment which we hope the Government will accept. With Amendment No. 181 are grouped Amendments Nos. 185 and 187.
<P>

<a name="20326-17_para14"></a>Amendment No. 185 relates to Section 112 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 which deals with remedies, orders and compensation in the case of unfair dismissal. Where the employee is unfairly dismissed by reason of the failure of the employer to observe discipline procedures, the employment tribunal is told to make a special award of four weeks' pay to be paid by the employer to the employee.
<P>

<a name="20326-17_para15"></a>This raises a very central point. The Government's case is that their new structure improves industrial relations&#151;in our view an admirable objective&#151;by getting a settlement of cases rather than litigation (an objective which we have shared and said so) by a variety of provisions, especially those in Clauses 25 and 30, Schedule 2 and Clause 33, and now Clause 34.
<P>

<a name="20326-17_para16"></a>When we come to the particular point in Clause 34 of an extension of what is regarded as automatically unfair dismissal and the remedies for that, the purpose of the sanction&#151;and no right is worth much without an adequate sanction&#151;must be to deter the employer from ever doing such a terrible thing. It is our case that throughout the Bill&#151;and I just make the general point&#151;the sanctions which are inserted by the Government are wholly inadequate to be a deterrent against these acts which are regarded as disruptive of employment and industrial relations.
<P>

<a name="20326-17_para17"></a>Here, the additional award is to be four weeks' pay for an automatic unfair dismissal which breaks even the most minimal rules of civilised employment life. First of all, we ask whether the Government have done any research as regards who is deterred by one, two, three, four, 10 or 12 weeks' pay as an award? Have they done any work on the question? There has been work done in the past. It may be that that is some time ago and they have better research.
<P>

<a name="20326-17_para18"></a>Quite frankly we are a bit sick and tired of being told that it is a matter of judgment, or it would not be wise to do anything different from what the Bill does. Those are semantics of the lazy. The semantics of the lazy always advance their arguments as wise and tell you nothing else. What I want to know is whether the Government have done any social research on the effect of sanctions. Perhaps I have missed it; I would be delighted to know about it as it would extend my knowledge.
<P>

<a name="20326-17_para19"></a>If the Government do not have the results of inquiries on the reasonable period of an award, whether that is four weeks' or 10 weeks' pay, they must tell us what other reason they have for referring to the <P>


<a name="column_CWH395"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH395</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>period of four weeks. Our belief, looking at the work that has been done on unfair dismissal cases generally, is that for these very bad employers&#151;we are talking about an employer who cannot even operate minimal civilised standards on the Government's own hypothesis&#151;an award of four weeks' pay is not likely to have a deterrent effect.
<P>

<a name="20326-17_para20"></a>A good employer, of course, will not want to behave in this manner anyway, quite apart from the matter of an award of four weeks' pay. However, bad employers have to be deterred by something rather large. Our amendment seeks to replace the figure four with 12 because we could not think of a better figure. It could be 24, or it could be higher. There are systems in western Europe which impose penalties much larger than this for certain types of unfair dismissal. Indeed, there are some that go beyond the award of compensation but that is not our culture and custom.
<P>

<a name="20326-17_para21"></a>What led the Government to say "four weeks" here? In connection with that, what thinking about sanctions generally informs their proposals in the Bill? I beg to move.

<A NAME="20326-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I speak to the group which comprises Amendments Nos. 181, 185, 187, 188 and 189. Most of these amendments deal with the part of Clause 34 which will make it automatically unfair to dismiss an employee without following the new statutory procedures. An important aspect of it is that an employee who is dismissed in these circumstances will generally receive four weeks' pay, whereas at present an employee whose dismissal is unfair on purely procedural grounds may receive no compensation at all. The mechanism for achieving this in most cases is that the tribunals must increase the employee's basic award to four weeks' pay if it would otherwise be less. Where the tribunal orders his reinstatement or his re-engagement in a comparable job, and there is therefore no financial compensation on which that lower limit of four weeks' pay can be set, the tribunal must make a separate award of four weeks' pay.
<P>

<a name="20326-18_para0"></a>One of these amendments, Amendment No. 185, would increase the award where a dismissal was found to be unfair because the minimum procedures had not been followed, and the employer was ordered to reinstate or re-engage the employee, from four weeks' pay to 12. I consider this excessive, especially since another amendment, Amendment No. 186, which we are debating separately appears, if I am right in thinking that it inadvertently refers to Section 112(6) of the 1996 Act instead of Section 112(5), to provide tribunals with the power to increase compensation from 12 weeks' pay to as much as they see fit. We believe that employers should generally incur a penalty for not following the new procedures; we believe that a "one size fits all" penalty is right, and we believe that four weeks' pay is a reasonable amount.
<P>

<a name="20326-18_para1"></a>I should point out, of course, that this is the minimum for dismissal simply because the procedures are not being followed. I believe that it is right and proper to adopt our figure rather than trying to seek a deterrent.

<P>

<a name="20326-18_para2"></a>At the moment, a tribunal does not order both a financial award and reinstatement; it is one or the other. In future, because we are introducing a minimum four-week penalty for an automatically unfair dismissal under Clause 34, it will be possible for a reinstatement order to be accompanied by a four-week penalty. Amendment No. 187 relates to the circumstances where an employer then fails to comply with an order for reinstatement or re-engagement. In those circumstances, the 1996 Act provides for the tribunal to award the employee both compensation for his loss as a result of that failure and compensation for unfair dismissal in the normal way. In other words, the tribunal considers what level of financial penalty is appropriate in the light of all the circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20326-18_para3"></a>Under our proposals, the penalty could never be less than four weeks' pay if the dismissal was unfair on procedural grounds, although in practice it is almost certain to be more. The reason that it cannot be less than four weeks' pay is because we are providing a minimum award for dismissals in breach of the statutory procedure. But that is the same reason why the employee will already have received his four weeks' pay. Therefore, we propose that the four weeks' pay that he has already received should be deducted from the compensation that he now receives. The employee in this particular set of circumstances would otherwise benefit twice from the four-week minimum, whereas employees in the generality of unfair dismissal cases would not. That deduction therefore strikes me as entirely right but Amendment No. 187 would prevent it, and that, by the same token, must be wrong.
<P>

<a name="20326-18_para4"></a>In cases where reinstatement or re-engagement is not ordered&#151;in other words, in the great majority of cases where financial compensation is awarded&#151;the mechanism that we have chosen for awarding four weeks' pay where the dismissal was in breach of statutory procedures is that the tribunals must increase the employee's basic award to four weeks' pay if it would otherwise be less, as I mentioned at the beginning. Amendment No. 188 would change that to at least four weeks' pay, while Amendment No. 189 would remove the discretion given to the tribunals not to make an award if it would result in injustice to the employer.
<P>

<a name="20326-18_para5"></a>To give the tribunals discretion to vary the size of the award would risk complicating their proceedings while they attempted to delve into the extent or nature of the employer's failure or the motives which lay beneath it, which might be far from easy to discern. As to removing the tribunals' ability not to make an award if it resulted in an injustice to the employer, I do not believe that it would be right to fetter their discretion in that way.

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH397</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>way in my earlier argument, so I shall go back to the beginning of the paragraph that I was in the middle of, rather than right to the beginning of the whole speech.
<P>

<a name="20326-18_para7"></a>In cases where reinstatement or re-engagement is not ordered&#151;in other words, in that great majority of cases where financial compensation is awarded&#151;the mechanism we have chosen for awarding four weeks' pay where the dismissal was in breach of statutory procedures is that the tribunals must increase the employee's basic award to four weeks' pay if it would otherwise be less, as I began by mentioning.
<P>

<a name="20326-18_para8"></a>Amendment No. 188 would change that to at least four weeks' pay, while Amendment No. 189 would remove the discretion given to the tribunals not to make an award if it would result in injustice to the employer. To give the tribunals discretion to vary the size of the award would risk complicating their proceedings while they attempted to delve into the extent or nature of the employer's failure or the motives which lay beneath it, which might be far from easy to discern.
<P>

<a name="20326-18_para9"></a>As to removing the tribunals' ability not to make an award if it would result in injustice to the employer, I do not think it would be right to fetter their discretion in this way. However, we expect an award to be made in the vast majority of cases. This provision is certainly not a get-out for employers who plead ignorance or poverty, if that is what Members of the Committee fear. "Injustice" is a tough test, and we do not expect it to be met in many cases.
<P>

<a name="20326-18_para10"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 181 addresses the second part of Clause 34. The clause currently refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a procedure in relation to the dismissal of an employee",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-18_para11"></a>
and the amendment would substitute "connected with" for "in relation to". It is not quite clear to me what difference the wording is meant to make. The essential feature of this provision is that, if a procedure is in principle potentially relevant to the reasonableness of a dismissal, but a failure to follow that procedure in fact makes no difference to the decision, that failure will not by itself make the decision unreasonable.
<P>

<a name="20326-18_para12"></a>The procedures that are relevant in this context seem to be procedures "in relation to" the dismissal, and that is what the Bill says. It may be that Members of the Committee feel that the phrase "connected with" would somehow narrow down those procedures to which a "no difference" argument could be applied but, even if that were true, I do not think it would be helpful.
<P>

<a name="20326-18_para13"></a>What is important, for the clarity of all concerned, is that the "no difference" argument should clearly be available in respect of all those procedures that go beyond the statutory minima, which may be relevant to the outcome. I believe that that is what the Bill does and, therefore, no amendment is needed. I ask the noble Lords to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend for his explanation of&#151;or, at any rate, his attention to&#151;the amendments. Dealing with his last <P>


<a name="column_CWH398"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH398</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>point first, there is some reason to believe that a procedure "connected with" the dismissal of an employee would be a little wider than a procedure "in relation to" the dismissal of an employee, and that is why we moved the amendment; "in relation to" is somewhat circumscribed, but I leave it there.
<P>

<a name="20326-18_para14"></a>So far as concerns the other amendments, the proposed deletion of what I might call the deduction subsections&#151; that is, new subsections (4) and (5) in the new Section 98A of the Employment Rights Act, which are printed on page 39 of the Bill&#151;about the way in which deductions should be made from a compensatory award, might well, we think, operate unfairly as against the employee. Compensatory award is for his actual loss and these amounts are to be deducted from his actual loss compensation. We do not believe that that is fair; that is why we proposed their removal.
<P>

<a name="20326-18_para15"></a>So far as the other matters are concerned, once again we felt that the sanctions that were proposed are inadequate to provide any deterrent effect against an employer taking part in dismissals which, on any showing, cannot possibly be justified and would, in fact, automatically be unfair under the Bill. Our sitting was suspended, so I hope that my noble friends will forgive me if I am wrong, but I do not believe that the Minister advanced any real justification for particular sanctions, such as four weeks and the like. Our proposal is that this should lie, as it were, on the table, to be addressed perhaps on some other occasion. In that regard, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="20326-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall </B>   moved Amendment No. 182:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 39, line 14, leave out from "that" to end of line 15 and insert "the fairness of the dismissal was not affected by his failure to follow the procedure"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-19_para0"></a><P>

<a name="20326-19_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment concerns the Bill's provisions to overturn the House of Lords' judgment in the Polkey case. This case was originally judged in a lower court in 1979 and reversed in the House of Lords in 1988. The judgment stated that procedural failings could render a dismissal unfair but that if following them would have made no difference, compensation should be reduced or eliminated. My noble friends will say more about the details of the judgment; let me simply say that it was a very reasoned&#151;and indeed reasonable&#151;judgment. There is no independent evidence to show that it has been operated since then in a capricious or unreasonable way.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para2"></a>The Government appear to argue that, nevertheless, that places too much weight on minor procedural breaches, creating havoc with the real intentions of the law. That in turn is hotly disputed in relation to the debate which has been going backwards and forwards about Routes to Resolution and so on. Some of us had the impression that some of the arguments are just being straightforwardly taken from employer representations.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para3"></a>In committee in the other place on 18th December, Mr Alan Johnson agreed to an amendment tabled by Mr Rob Marris, with the result that new Section 98A(2) of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which is about unfair dismissal, appears as it now does in lines 11 to 15 on page 39 of the Bill. The burden of that provision, I think, is that failure to follow a procedure would not by itself make action by the employer unreasonable. However, Mr Marris would be the first to say that that does not go very far in addressing the problem. The fact is that procedural niceties are at the heart of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para4"></a>Moreover, this matter involves not only the question of the scope and interpretation of the statutory default procedure in Part 2 but also the scope and interpretation of enhanced voluntary procedures, including the vital question of the ACAS code and the danger of the statutory procedure now being a safer bet for the employer than the ACAS code.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para5"></a>In using such language&#151;"a safer bet for the employer"&#151;some Members of the Committee may ask whether that is just a product of a rather fevered imagination. Let me quote Alan Johnson. In the other place, he argued:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If we did not reverse the no-difference test, employers would rightly wonder why they should move to a more sophisticated code if they could be found to be wrong".&#151;[Official Report, Commons Standing Committee F, 18/12/01; col. 228.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-19_para6"></a>
I have to say that I have now read that sentence several times and the more I read it, the more I seem to find myself taking part in the Mad Hatter's tea party. I will read it again:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If we did not reverse the no-difference test, employers would rightly wonder why they should move to a more sophisticated code if they could be found to be wrong on a minor error of procedure, irrespective of the fundamentals of the case".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-19_para7"></a>
It has unfortunately become a general perception that the Government are showing some lack of confidence in the tribunals at a time when we know that they would like the number of cases to be reduced. On that aspect, let me repeat that we would like the number of cases to be reduced as well, but on the basis that domestic procedures are at least up to the basic ACAS standards, with a degree of joint ownership and commitment for which the Government, so far, are not making provision.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para8"></a>We cannot reiterate too often that the best way to reduce the gap between the default procedure and the ACAS procedure is to introduce the major benchmarks of the ACAS code into the default procedure. It is a dangerous path down which we would be treading if we were to juxtapose, as did Alan Johnson&#151;and perhaps he would not wish to repeat what he said word for word but he juxtaposed in a slightly unfortunate way&#151;the statutory code and the ACAS code. Indeed, it is that gap which I and many of us find the most worrying feature of the Bill as a whole.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para9"></a>Perhaps we should take some comfort from the thought that this will be easier when we have a sight of the promised, or hinted at, amendment to the statutory procedure on the examination of the facts of the case and so forth. Be that as it may, Amendment No. 182 cuts through some of the ambiguity and clearly states <P>


<a name="column_CWH400"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH400</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the employer would have to show that the fairness of the dismissal was not affected by his failure to follow the procedure. That, as we understand it, is precisely what the Government are aiming at, and we cannot see why we cannot say so on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   I intervene early in what will undoubtedly be a prolonged debate because I want to widen the considerations that should govern the Government's approach towards procedure and the whole issue of deciding discipline and grievance applications. More detailed arguments will subsequently be put forward by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn in relation Amendments Nos. 183 and 184.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para10"></a>The point I am trying to make is that the Government are misunderstanding the function and role of procedures in doing the two things which the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, said were the central criteria that he wanted; namely, fairness and improvement in industrial relations. Fairness and improvement in industrial relations are closely bound up with the provision of adequate procedures.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para11"></a>The trouble is that the whole debate about the amendment of Polkey has become highly politicised and highly divisive. It would be impossible for anybody who had not studied this subject in considerable detail to understand the position taken, for example, by the CBI.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para12"></a>The CBI sees this once again as a crucial change. It states in its evidence to us that it is essential that we should clear away the procedural considerations. It states that all procedural failings, no matter how minor, could lead to a finding of unfair dismissal. That is not true, but that is what the CBI believes.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para13"></a>The CBI states that this change will enable firms to introduce internal procedures beyond the statutory procedure without leaving themselves open to a finding of unfair dismissal based on a minor technical error. Again, I suggest that that is not true. It even states that it is not in the interests of the worker that there should be a procedural element. They will disadvantage employees who are able to bring successful cases under the current law, but under the current rules successful claimants typically receive little benefit. They are awarded minimum compensation since they have suffered no loss and are often confused about whether they have won or lost. That is a very extreme view to take of the significance and importance of the procedural element, saying that it is absolutely essential to get rid of the procedural element in this context.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para14"></a>One cannot square what the CBI says with what Judge Prophet said&#151;the man who is supposed to know what goes on in tribunals. In his evidence to the Minister in another place, he said that the Government are putting in a potentially disastrous clause, and he goes on and on about the consequences of that.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para15"></a>It seems to me that what is being lost in all this is the function of procedure in deciding between workers on the basis of fairness, and on the basis of a desire to <P>


<a name="column_CWH401"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH401</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>improve industrial relations. They are the two important elements which the Minister earlier told us he was concerned about and what he wanted to see.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para16"></a>It seems to me that the opposite is the case. This element of employment protection law has no downside. There is no disadvantage in encouraging an employer to go through a procedure, even if he were to come to exactly the same result if he had not gone through a procedure. Going through a procedure is an educated element; it is an educated process. There is no downside.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para17"></a>It is right and proper that an employer should be encouraged to see whether he is being fair, and to let the worker see that he is being fair. It is right and proper that an employer should give dismissal on the grounds provided by the legislation. There is nothing wrong with sacking people on grounds of conduct and capacity rather than anything else, and there is nothing wrong in asking people to use the procedure in order to demonstrate to the worker that they are being fair.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para18"></a>I would have thought that the amendment would particularly lend itself to the Government at this time. They would want to accept it especially because of what they want to do; they want to discourage people going to tribunals. I want to discourage people going to tribunals, if I can provide them with a satisfactory alternative.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para19"></a>We disagree about the elements of the satisfactory alternative; we want to see other measures put into the statutory procedure. However, there is one thing that will make some workers&#151;I do not say large numbers&#151;see the point of staying within their domestic procedure; it is because in some way they have a fair investigation of the kind they believe they might receive if they go to a tribunal.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para20"></a>Let us suppose that the employer says to the workers, "We are going to have a hearing. You are going to have somebody who represents you, and we are only going to dismiss you if we have clear legal grounds. We do not dismiss anybody in this organisation illegally because we want to obey the law&#151;in fact we want to go further than the law". If the employer takes that approach to the organisation, if he takes that approach in his industrial relations, if he is manifestly fair and if he makes a point of being fair, that will encourage workers not to go to tribunals. Inside their organisation they will be getting the full rigour of an adequate procedure.
<P>

<a name="20326-19_para21"></a>I do not care whether it turns out to be that the employer might find that it was an unfair dismissal even in some significant aspect or if, on other grounds, there would not have been an unfair dismissal. This is not important. What is important is that employers should be seen to be fair. They should be seen to practise what is a small shadow, sign or example of the kind of practice one receives in tribunals. In such circumstances ACAS can say, "Well, you seemed to have the elements of a fair procedure when you reached this point. The employer was there and you had an opportunity of making your case. Do you think you will get anything different if you go to a tribunal? <P>


<a name="column_CWH402"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH402</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>You have had a fair crack of the whip". That is what people want&#151;a fair crack of the whip. They do not want to be told, "Because you could have been sacked anyway, we are not bothering with the procedure". That is not good industrial relations, it is not equity and it is not fair. On the basis of their own beliefs and their own statements to us this afternoon, it is not what the Government should want.

<P>
<A NAME="20326-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I support the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall and I speak also to the two amendments standing in my name and in the names of my noble friends Lady Turner and Lord McCarthy. All three amendments aim to do not quite the same but very similar things. They aim to put in Clause 34(2) an explicit statement that whatever else the subsection provides the dismissal must remain fair if it is to pass muster.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para0"></a>This is a complex area of the law and I would hope that for the first time it receives full treatment from the Committee and from Ministers. When the Government published their response to consultation in 2001, on page 23 they stated the following about unfair dismissal legislation:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The consultation document also proposed that, provided the minimum procedural standards set out above are met, tribunals should disregard a procedural mistake by an employer making a dismissal, if this made no difference to the outcome. Responses were mixed on the merits of this proposal. Employers and their representatives, including the CBI, strongly supported it. They considered the emphasis should be on the merits of the case . . . Others including the TUC opposed the proposal, which they thought sent wrong messages about the correct use of procedures".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para1"></a><P>

<a name="20326-20_para2"></a>There were the opinions set out, and the Government have taken the side of the CBI proposals&#151;except that they cited one other authority. They quoted the evidence sent to them by the Northumberland County Council. I have not been able to trace the litigation in which the Northumberland County Council has been involved and I did not know that it was a leading authority on this area of the law and of practice. However, the Government chose to quote its evidence as follows:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It would seem good sense to allow tribunals to disregard procedural mistakes if there would be no difference to the outcome of the case".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para3"></a><P>

<a name="20326-20_para4"></a>The Government were misled into using the same phrase,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para5"></a>
But even that, if it were justifiable, which, in my submission, it is not, is not what is provided in Clause 34(2), which introduces the new Section 98A. Subsection (2) states that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subject to subsection (1)&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para6"></a>
that is, subject to the rule that an employer who does not observe minimal procedures and dismisses is guilty of an unfair dismissal&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"failure by an employer to follow a procedure in relation to the dismissal of an employee shall not be regarded for the purposes of section 98(4)(a) as by itself making the employer's action unreasonable if he shows that he would have decided to dismiss the employee if he had followed the procedure".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am sorry, I misunderstood what was going on. What the section deals with is not an outcome but a decision by the employer. Discussion of abstracts where what is dealt with is concrete are always somewhat Hegelian and often rather misleading. The new section states that, where the decision of the employer would not have been different, albeit that he has not followed a procedure which he supposedly should have followed, that by itself will not make his action unreasonable. If it is not unreasonable under Section 98, it will not be an unfair dismissal.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para8"></a>As my noble friend Lord Lea pointed out, there has been considerable confusion about what the effect of this clause, now as redrafted in Committee and in another place, would be. My honourable friend the Minister, Mr Johnson, said at on 18th December (col. 210 of Commons Hansard) that where the statutory minimum procedures are concerned the Government are strengthening the position and the principle in Polkey. He went on to say that he would give examples. In my submission, looking carefully at the record, he never did.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para9"></a>He said more than once that the aim was to strengthen Polkey but later at col. 228, which my noble friend Lord Lea read and which was a very puzzling pronouncement, at least one thing is clear. The Minister used the words "if we did not reverse the no difference test". Also at col. 228 he makes clear the fact that the change to Polkey referred to disciplinary procedures above the minimum. So he is strengthening Polkey but he is changing it. We do not understand what he really had in mind at all.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para10"></a>One of the reasons for that was that he was fed with the argument that although page 39 of the Bill changed the law&#151;there would not be much point in enacting it if it did not&#151;it did not change the basic principle that a dismissal must be reasonable and fair in order to be justified by the employer. It does not change that rule totally but, if the Government mean that the employer's decision to dismiss what the employer would have decided if he had followed the procedure that he omitted to follow&#151;if they mean that that decision to dismiss must be on the supposed facts fair or reasonable&#151;they can take their pick among the three amendments and accept one or the other, or say they accept them in spirit and will put forward their own words.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para11"></a>One cannot read the transcript of the Committee stage in another place without realising that there is a terrible mess. How has this mess arisen and, more importantly, how has the lack of confidence among trades unions and commentators on a wide scale arisen as regards the effect of the Government's amendment to the law in Clause 34 under new Section 98A(2)?

<a name="20326-20_para12"></a>In my submission, it has arisen from two factors. It has done so, first, by underrating the vital importance of procedure in employment relations, to which my noble friend Lord McCarthy has already spoken. I underline what he said. The second reason is that everyone discusses the case of Polkey v AE Dayton Services Ltd, reported in 1998 appeal cases, without ever bothering to see what the noble and learned Law Lords actually said in deciding that case. I intend to put on the record what they said in that case because it illuminates the manner in which this clause could well alter the law unless an amendment of the type that we have tabled is accepted.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para13"></a>It is often thought that, by talking of a failure by an employer to follow a procedure in respect of or in relation to dismissal, new subsection (2) refers to an extra contractual procedure or something which is specifically laid out at the place of work. Of course, it could refer to such a case. But Polkey was not such a case. In Polkey, in a reorganisation van drivers' duties were changed such that four van drivers were replaced by three other workers. However, only one of the four drivers was considered suitable for transfer to new duties. Accordingly, the other three were made redundant.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para14"></a>In Mr Polkey's case, the first that he knew about it was when he was called into the branch manager's office and told that he was being made redundant. This was a flagrant breach of the principle that one must consult the employee before redundancy and, indeed, warn him of the impending redundancy. That procedure was suggested in the industrial relations code of practice at the time and, as the industrial tribunal said, nothing excuses the failure of employers to consult. It was not a written procedure which they failed to operate; it was the basic procedure of warning and consultation.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para15"></a>What did your Lordships' Judicial Committee decide? The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the then Lord Chancellor, giving the leading judgment, said&#151;I quote from the Industrial Relations Law Reports of 1987 at page 504; I do that because it is easier to bring a copy of the volume to your Lordships' Himalayan meeting rather than carry the full volume of the appeal cases:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the subject matter for the Tribunal's consideration is the employer's action in treating the reason as a sufficient reason for dismissing the employee. It is that action and that action only that the Tribunal is required to characterise as reasonable or unreasonable. That leaves no scope for the Tribunal considering whether, if the employer had acted differently, he might have dismissed the employee. It is what the employer did that is to be judged, not what he might have done. On the other hand, in judging whether what the employer did was reasonable it is right to consider what a reasonable employer would have had in mind at the time he decided to dismiss as a consequence of not consulting or not warning [a worker]".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para16"></a>
Later, as part of that strand of the judgments, in criticising the judgment of one member of the Court of Appeal, he also said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"With much of what he says"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para17"></a>
that is, the Lord Justice in the Court of Appeal&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I would respectfully agree but I cannot accept it all. For example, in referring to a case of dismissal for misconduct where the evidence of misconduct could be capable of explanation and no <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>explanation has been invited before dismissal, the examination of which the learned Lord Justice speaks is an examination of matters other than the [employee's] conduct which could not be known to the employers until after the decision to dismiss had been reached and therefore it was not available to the employer at the time he reached that decision. Perhaps the point is highlighted most plainly in the very last sentence which I have quoted. The consequences of the failure determine whether or not the employee suffered an injustice".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para18"></a>
He continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This is not to be confused with the question whether the employer acted reasonably".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para19"></a>
He says quite clearly that the two questions are separate.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para20"></a>Those are the first two matters that are addressed in the speeches in the Polkey case. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bridge of Harwich, sets out the third, which is a similar strand of argument but which in fact is materially different. Perhaps I should say what we have covered already. What we have covered already shows that this whole matter is part of not allowing the employer to add extraneous and other reasons to those that were with him at the time. The question immediately arises whether, in upsetting the Polkey rule in new subsection (2), the effect of the Government's Bill would be to upset that rule. There are many who believe that it will.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para21"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bridge of Harwich, added the third strand of argument. He said at page 508 of the same report,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the application of the so-called British Labour Pump principle",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para22"></a>
that is, the previous case law,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"tends to distort the operation of the employment protection legislation in two important ways. First, . . . if the Industrial Tribunal, in considering whether the employer who has omitted to take the appropriate procedural steps acted reasonably or unreasonably in treating his reason as a sufficient reason for dismissal, poses for itself the hypothetical question whether the result would have been any different if the appropriate procedural steps had been taken, it can only answer that question on a balance of probabilities. Accordingly, applying the British Labour Pump principle,"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para23"></a>
that is, the previous case law,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if the answer is that it probably would have made no difference, the employee's unfair dismissal claim fails. But if the likely effect of taking the appropriate procedural steps is only considered, as it should be, at the stage of assessing compensation, the position is quite different".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para24"></a><P>

<a name="20326-20_para25"></a>He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The second consideration is perhaps of particular importance in redundancy cases. An Industrial Tribunal may conclude, as in the instant case, that the appropriate procedural steps would not have avoided the employee's dismissal as redundant. But if, as your Lordships now hold, that conclusion does not defeat his claim of unfair dismissal, the Industrial Tribunal, apart from any question of compensation, will also have to consider whether to make any order under s.69 of the Act of 1978".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para26"></a>
He went on to explain&#151;I quote again&#151;that it could,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if it thinks fit, make an order for re-engagement under that section and in so doing exercise a very wide discretion as to the terms of the order. In a case where an Industrial Tribunal held that dismissal on the ground of redundancy would have been inevitable at the time when it took place, even if the appropriate procedural steps had been taken, I do not, as at present advised, think this <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_CWH406"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH406</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>would necessarily preclude a discretionary order for re-engagement on suitable terms, if the altered circumstances considered by the Tribunal . . . were thought to justify it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para27"></a><P>

<a name="20326-20_para28"></a>From those passages I draw these points. First, the matter is of particular importance where appropriate procedural steps should have been taken and were not, and one cannot allow the failure to do so to justify the dismissal. That goes to the very root of the entire structure of the employment protection legislation, which the Government on their own ascertain are leaving unchanged in other parts of the employment protection legislation in the Employment Rights Act 1996. It leaves that legislation unchanged, they say, and claim that it will operate without any difference. Yet it changes the very rule which, in the words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bridge of Harwich, is fundamental to its operation, and then says it will make no difference. The matter is a logical absurdity. It is changing what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bridge, said was the basis of his decision and thinking about what is now the Employment Rights Act, and then says that it will make no difference to the Employment Rights Act. That is Polkey. It is only in later cases that we have had it confirmed&#151;most of the discussion is assumed&#151;that it does apply. Its rationale, its reasoning and the three strands of its reasoning apply to other cases of unfair dismissal.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para29"></a>The latest case, I think, is that of Whitbread v Hall, in 2001, IRLR page 275. Mr Hall was a manager of a hotel. While he was away on holiday, irregularities took place in the stock control operations. On his return, the area manager suspended him, pending further investigation, but a disciplinary hearing was immediately held, chaired by the area manager herself. In the face of this, Mr Hall admitted the offences. The area manager decided to dismiss him for&#151;the report says&#151;"gross misconduct". He appealed against that decision, which was heard by the operations manager, but was still dismissed after it.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para30"></a>The tribunal was particularly concerned about the role of the managers, especially the area manager who had acted as prosecutor and judge. It was quite clear that, since he had admitted the misconduct, the employer would have dismissed anyway&#151;in the words of the clause, "would have decided to dismiss". But, under the Polkey rule, the Court of Appeal had absolutely no difficulty in a short judgment in saying that the employer could not use that argument&#151;that he would have dismissed anyway&#151;to cure the fact that he had not even operated the elements of natural justice in the procedures that he should have operated.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para31"></a>Lady Justice Hale says that this view is supported by&#151;and I quote from page 278:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"authority at the highest level, albeit in the context of unfair dismissal for redundancy rather that misconduct".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para32"></a><P>


<a name="column_CWH407"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH407</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
She then cites Polkey v A E Dayton Services Ltd in the House of Lords. She continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"These expressions of principle undoubtedly apply to dismissals for misconduct as much as they apply to dismissals for redundancy. They are binding upon us. They clearly indicate a procedural as well as a substantive element in the band of reasonable responses open to employers faced with such misconduct".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para33"></a>
She cites another case to the same effect. She says it is difficult to say,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that the offences were so heinous as to admit of only one answer. Dismissal had been decided by the employee's immediate superior who had a bad relationship with him and had gone into the process with her mind made up".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para34"></a><P>

<a name="20326-20_para35"></a>The clause would include the case of an employer who went into the process with his mind made up. That is why there is this lack of confidence in the Government's curious argument that the arrangement will not affect tribunal decisions in respect of reasonableness and fairness.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para36"></a>If the Government have some answer why the facts in Whitbread v Hall would not be affected by this clause, they had better give it. The reason they had better give it is that, in Committee in another place, the Minister, my honourable friend Mr Alan Johnson, said on more than one occasion, in reply to the decisions of tribunals with which he was pressed in that case, that the Government had looked at all the cases since Polkey, and they thought that the great majority would not be changed by Clause 34.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para37"></a>I want to know which were the minority cases that would be changed by Clause 34. I say that Whitbread v. Hall might well&#151;indeed probably would&#151;be one of them. I want to know what survey the Government did of all these cases which Mr Johnson said on numerous occasions they had considered and the majority of which would not be changed by Clause 34. It is the opinion of eminent authority who have looked at the Bill that many such previous cases might well be changed by Clause 34 which inserts the new Section 98A(2). It would very likely include an employer who,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"would have decided to dismiss the employee if he had followed the procedure".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para38"></a><P>

<a name="20326-20_para39"></a>Such an employer would be one whose mind was made up, who was adamant that this employee must go, who had said, "Get out and clear your desk", and who would not have changed his mind if he had operated either the ACAS code procedures or any other procedure that he should have consulted. It is quite absurd to say that it is impossible for a tribunal to see this clause as something which would affect that argument. Tribunals have great experience and the employment appeal tribunal in particular is likely to look very carefully at this clause.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para40"></a>Therefore, if we look at it carefully, the question for the Government is: why not say what you mean? The Government say they mean that this clause should be enacted but that it has to it a hidden extra; namely, that it will only operate to exculpate the employer where the dismissal is reasonable or fair in every respect. We say in these amendments that the decision should have been fair and reasonable and for a sufficient reason, or, if you like, in the amendment of the noble Lord, <P>


<a name="column_CWH408"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH408</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Lea, that the decision and the dismissal are in all respects fair. Alternatively, in our other amendment in the group we propose a formula on fairness.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para41"></a>I cannot understand why the Government should insist on not saying what they mean. That is what it comes to but they have to address, not simply by a few words here or there, what they are doing in changing the law as expressed in the Polkey judgment of your Lordships' Judicial Committee. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bridge, made clear and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, with respect, agreed, that was an assessment of the basis of the entire employment protection legislation in regard to dismissal&#151;not allowing the employer to rest upon some reason other than those known to him at the time and not allowing the employer to escape from procedures which he should have followed by saying that it would have made no difference to his decision to dismiss, including the case where his mind was so closed that nothing could affect his decision to dismiss.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para42"></a>The Government must not legislate things that appear to be absurd or uncertain or, indeed in this case, what may well turn out to be again unfair to workers who are unfairly dismissed. Please will the Government say what they mean? Please can they accept at least the spirit of one of this congeries of amendments?

<A NAME="20326-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Gladwin of Clee: </B>   Understandably, my noble friend Lord Wedderburn is concerned with details of the law and the effect of cases heard not only in the employment appeal tribunal but also in the Court of Appeal and in your Lordships' Judicial Committee. My concern is with the industrial relations impact of this. The clause refers to the failure by an employer to follow a procedure. That is not the statutory procedure but a procedure which, in my experience, is often fairly comprehensive and sophisticated.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para43"></a>New Section 98A(2) states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"failure by an employer to follow a procedure in relation to the dismissal of an employee shall not be regarded . . . as by itself making the employer's action unreasonable if he shows that he would have decided to dismiss the employee [even]"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-20_para44"></a>
and I have inserted the word "even"&#151;

<a name="20326-20_para46"></a>It just so happens that I have been in contact with a number of human resource directors. I hate the title; I used to call them personnel directors and that means something to me. It is offensive to use the term "human resources" in that connection. They are concerned&#151;I refer to the Industrial Society's brief&#151;about the impact that this measure will have on companies. Most of the major companies represented by the CBI have these procedures. They are not caught by the statutory procedure. We know who is caught by the statutory procedure&#151;the 600,000 workplaces that have nothing at all.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH409"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH409</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para47"></a>Where an employer has fairly sophisticated procedures, human resource managers have told us that it will be even more difficult to persuade managers to follow a procedure if they think they can get away with it by arguing that the employee would have been dismissed anyway.
<P>

<a name="20326-20_para48"></a>I cannot interpret subsection (2) to mean anything else. If the employer shows&#151;to whom, to an employment tribunal?&#151;that his decision to dismiss the employee would have been taken anyway, even if he had followed the procedure, my fear, which I know will be denied, is that the impact of the statutory procedure will encourage the sophisticated ACAS-type procedures to wither on the vine. Why should an employer, under pressure from his own line managers, maintain sophisticated procedures if he can get away with sacking people who, it may be considered, were going to be sacked anyway? I cannot interpret the clause to mean anything else. My concern is the impact of the measure on industrial relations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   The amendments before us propose alternative wording for the "no difference" element of Clause 34. It may be useful if we first remind ourselves of what Clause 34 does.
<P>

<a name="20326-21_para0"></a>I am not seeking to hide the fact that this clause changes existing unfair dismissal law although I do not believe that the changes are quite as fundamental as some have suggested. I make no apologies for that. We are making changes to statute which we believe are right and necessary.
<P>

<a name="20326-21_para1"></a>I believe that these changes contain two key elements of our package of measures which, taken together, will promote better procedures and core minimum standards in handling workplace disputes.
<P>

<a name="20326-21_para2"></a>In the first place, as we have discussed, Clause 34 underpins the importance of the statutory minimum procedures by making it automatically unfair for employers to dismiss employees without following the procedures, thus reinforcing their central and escapable importance to all dispute resolution.
<P>

<a name="20326-21_para3"></a>Secondly, of course, the clause provides for a partial return to what is known as the "no difference" test in unfair dismissal cases. I recognise that this in part reverses the Polkey judgment, and that it interacts in complex ways with various other judgments over the years which the noble Lord has mentioned. However, I want to focus on the substance of the new law which we are introducing. Is it fair? Will it contribute to better workplace relations? I believe that the answer to both those questions is yes.
<P>

<a name="20326-21_para4"></a>As to the first question, the fundamental fairness, if, first, the employer can demonstrate a fair and substantial reason for the dismissal; if, secondly, he has followed all the relevant statutory procedures; if, thirdly, he has acted reasonably in all other respects; and if his only error is a procedural one which the tribunal is satisfied has made no difference to the outcome, then I believe it is right that the dismissal should be considered a fair one. That is what this clause provides for. I do not believe that it is a <P>


<a name="column_CWH410"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH410</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fundamental change to the principles of existing unfair dismissal law. It does not alter the basic tenets that there must be a fair reason for the dismissal and that the employer must act reasonably. But I believe that, taken for what it is, it is a sensible change and I make no apologies for it.
<P>

<a name="20326-21_para5"></a>Will this change enhance dispute resolution in the workplace? I believe that it will. Many employees have expressed real concerns that tribunals currently place too much weight on minor procedural breaches. As a result&#151;I make this point to my noble friend Lord Lea&#151;many employers believe that introducing detailed in-house procedures is a losing game. Because they can never plead "no difference", they fear being caught out by a tribunal if they are found to have made the slightest error in following their own procedures.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am most grateful to my noble friend. I appreciate that that is what employers complain about, but can my noble friend cite a case where he believes that that is so? Will he tell us which of the cases decided in the reports would have fallen within that compass? And will he tell us the effect of the clause upon the law which will apply? The law here is trying to improve industrial relations. Is he confident that the effect on the legal principle will do what he says it will do? Which cases is he thinking of?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   It is important to focus on practical realities here. Perhaps I may quote the well-known British Airways case. An employer who dismissed a number of employees for racially harassing their colleagues lost his case solely because of procedural error, even though the tribunal acknowledged that it would make no difference to the outcome and awarded no compensation to the employees.
<P>

<a name="20326-21_para6"></a>Perhaps I may give the full facts of the case. Following investigation of an allegation, there was a full initial disciplinary hearing during which the employees were given the opportunity to comment on records of interviews with those who had complained about them. The manager charged with hearing the appeal held interviews with the dismissed employees but also decided to speak personally to those who had complained of harassment in order to gain a feel for their credibility. Because the dismissed employees did not see transcripts of the second interviews with the complainants, the tribunal found that the dismissals were unfair on procedural grounds. Under the new proposals, the tribunal would have discounted the procedural error since it made no difference to the dismissals, which were fair in every other way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   In order to ensure that I have understood my noble friend the Minister, would that now be a fair dismissal?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Yes. As I said, the tribunal would have the ability to discount the procedural error since one could form the view that it made no judgment to the dismissals, which were fair in every other way. That is what we are talking about when we discuss these particular cases. If my noble <P>


<a name="column_CWH411"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH411</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>friend considers that it would be fair to say that those people were unfairly dismissed in that particular case, of course he has the right to do so. However, I believe, and it is the Government's view, that it would not be a case of unfair dismissal because, if the tribunal had formed a view, it would have made no difference that that procedural error was not followed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-21_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I intervene in order to ensure that we understand what my noble friend is saying. In a case where employees have not been provided with transcripts of what they are alleged to have done wrong, that would now be a fair dismissal. The Government are happy that the clause would change the law in respect of the Polkey principle in that regard and in similar cases where employees have not been told what they are doing wrong and not given the details. The Polkey principle would be changed and they would all be fair dismissals. My noble friend is quite happy about that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-21_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I believe that my noble friend should read what I have said in Hansard tomorrow. I was referring specifically to a procedural error. The error was that the transcripts of the interviews had not been given to the people in those circumstances. On that basis, which is regarded as a procedural error, the view is that the tribunal could find in those cases that it was not an unfair dismissal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-21_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My noble friend reads one case. On the basis of what he says, I agree with my noble friend Lord Wedderburn, or I think I agree with what I think he thinks. It does not seem to me that that is proof of the need for a change. We do not know how significant, how important, that was, and we do not know what might have happened. No one knows; one makes guesses. An employer comes in and says, "I would not take any notice of it", but there you are, we do not know.
<P>

<a name="20326-21_para7"></a>In any event, it is one isolated case. I want to know whether the Government have done any research or whether they intend to do any research in order to find out how frequent that has been. What are the cases where the existing law has resulted in people being declared unfairly dismissed exclusively on some failure of procedure? How often does that happen, what are the circumstances and what are the cases?
<P>

<a name="20326-21_para8"></a>Other people say other things and I have read Judge Prophet many times in this Committee, and I do not apologise for doing so, because the man is the president of the tribunals service in England and Wales. He has an exemplary record of dealing with these problems. After saying this is a potentially disastrous clause, he says:

<FONT SIZE=3>
I have made that point and he makes it too. This is the point I am trying to make to the Minister. This is what Judge Prophet says generally happens,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"tribunals every day accept that minor procedural lapses"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-21_para10"></a>
and the Minister's position is that that was a minor procedural lapse,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"by employers do not necessarily cause a dismissal to be unfair. However, if the lapse is more serious"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-21_para11"></a>
the Minister says his lapse was not serious&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for example, in not showing the employee a proper hearing, it is sensible for the finding to be one of an unfair dismissal with the justice of the particular case . . . deciding the appropriate compensation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<a name="20326-21_para13"></a>Is it the case that most cases where the Polkey rule comes in are of the kind that Judge Prophet describes, or is the case that most of them are of the kind that the Minister says is exemplified? This is a matter for research. I ask, almost certain of the answer I shall receive, whether any research has been done into which is the typical case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-21_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I think there is a rather more fundamental issue. The issue here is whether those cases are fair or not. We cannot have a situation where we say, "This is the situation. It does not happen very frequently, therefore we should pay no attention to it even though it is unfair". I find that an extraordinary argument.
<P>

<a name="20326-21_para14"></a>The noble Lord said quite specifically that if this case is unfair, we should take action to tackle that. The fact that there may be a few or many cases like that is irrelevant to the issue that it should be tackled. I find it extraordinary that the noble Lord should argue that simply because it happens infrequently it should not be tackled.
<P>

<a name="20326-21_para15"></a>However, when we turned to this issue, I was asking what impact that has on human resource managers or, as I also like to call them, personnel managers.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   The Minister misrepresents me and I must protest. I did not say that at all. Judge Prophet says that there are insignificant cases and there are significant cases. He says,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the insignificant cases we do not declare unfair dismissal".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-22_para0"></a>
However, he goes on to say,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the significant cases, we do declare unfair dismissal".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-22_para1"></a>
I do not believe the Minister wants to say that even in the significant case, where it made a real difference, Judge Prophet is wrong and that both significant and insignificant cases should go down the river. I think what he is trying to say is that most cases are insignificant. The overwhelming majority of cases are insignificant. There are very few significant cases which we would call an abuse. I say that that can be settled only by research.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   The noble Lord is not focusing on the fact that there is the no-difference test here. That is used to determine whether these procedural issues are of importance and that seems a very good way to do it. I return to the point that if one does not have that situation, one will have a situation where many personnel directors will feel that they will <P>


<a name="column_CWH413"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH413</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not put in elaborate additional procedures. If on a small procedural matter they can fall foul of it, why should they put in the more elaborate procedures?
<P>

<a name="20326-22_para2"></a>The argument that managers will, therefore, not follow procedures&#151;because they will take the view that they can always fall back on the no-difference principle&#151;is not one that people would take. They would then have to argue that it would have made no difference and it is for the tribunal to make that decision. My own view is that on that balance, one is more likely to have a situation where personnel directors say they will have the minimal kind of procedures, rather than one in which personnel managers say that they will just not bother about the procedures because they will rely on the no-difference test. That situation is unlikely to arise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I have tried to listen carefully to what the Minister is saying. I have two difficulties. First, as the Polkey case and hundreds of other cases show, this is not only about putting in extra procedures. It is about that and of course the effect of the clause will, arguably, cause people not to have elaborate procedures and just to rely on the minimum. But in the Polkey case, what was wrong was a failure to consult in line with what has become the ACAS code. The Minister's argument has to be addressed to that.
<P>

<a name="20326-22_para3"></a>Secondly, the Minister appears to be saying something different from his honourable friend Mr Johnson in the other place. I quote what Mr Johnson said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the great majority of such cases that we have looked at, the failure was in procedures that would have fallen within the new minimum standards and clause 34 will be in line with the Polkey judgment. Less frequently, the procedural breach relates to a procedure that would have gone beyond the new minimum procedures. It is only in such cases that we propose to allow employers to argue that following the procedure would have made no difference to their decision to dismiss".&#151;[Official Report, Commons Standing Committee F, 18/12/01; col 211.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-22_para4"></a>
He seems to be saying that there are very few such situations. What the Minister said was that there were quite a number of such situations, as in the case that he cited, where the employer failed to follow basic principles of&#151;some people would say&#151;natural justice, or a right to be heard, or a right to see the evidence. In all those cases, my noble friend says he would be happy to see the dismissals fair. I am not sure whether that is what the Minister said in another place at col. 211. He indicated that most of the cases they have looked at would be in line with the Polkey judgment after Clause 34. Which is it?
<P>

<a name="20326-22_para5"></a>People want to know and they want to know because this is very uncertain. My case rests on the great uncertainty which will be injected into the law at this point because the Government are changing judgments which are fundamental in their attitude to the entire structure of the law. You cannot tinker about without taking a concluded view as to how far this change will go. The Minister seems to say it will go quite a way, but the Minister in another place did not seem to agree. What is this survey of the majority of <P>


<a name="column_CWH414"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH414</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cases? Can the Minister tell us something about it? As my noble friend said, the Government say they have looked at it, but can the Minister tell us what they looked at and what they concluded?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I was asked to give an example of the kind of situation we are talking about. I gave an example of that. I gave no view on their frequency and I am not differing in any way from what Alan Johnson said in the other place. He said that that was the judgment that had been formed from the ones that we have looked at.
<P>

<a name="20326-22_para6"></a>I turn to the amendments. I understand that in tabling the amendments the noble Lords sought to shore up reasonableness and fairness in unfair dismissal cases where the employer presents a "no difference" defence. Similar concerns about whether the measure ensures that a decision must be fair in all other respects and whether it means that employers who successfully argue "no difference" will be found to have acted reasonably on that ground alone were raised in the other place.
<P>

<a name="20326-22_para7"></a>I cannot stress too much what I have already said. Even when an employer is able to show that following a procedure beyond the statutory minimum would have made no difference to his decision to dismiss, for the tribunal to reach a finding for the employer the dismissal must be otherwise fair. The employer must still show that he dismissed the employee for one of the potentially fair reasons that are set out in the Employment Rights Act 1996&#151;we are not changing that. And he must still act reasonably in all other respects in dismissing the employee, as Section 98(4) of the 1996 Act requires&#151;we are not changing that either. The amendment we accepted to the clause in the other place has, I think, made this crystal clear. It spells out that a "no difference" line of defence where a procedure has not been followed does not by itself mean that the employer has acted reasonably.
<P>

<a name="20326-22_para8"></a>To the extent that the amendments seek to clarify this point, they are unnecessary. Moreover, they introduce undefined concepts of fairness and reasonableness which would risk the development of a different test of these concepts for new Section 98A from that which the tribunals otherwise apply in dismissal cases. I do not think that that would be desirable.
<P>

<a name="20326-22_para9"></a>Amendment No. 184 seems to go further, unless I mistake its purpose, by putting an obstacle in the way of ever successfully invoking a "no difference" defence. I take that to be the purpose of the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>""having regard to procedures which he was obliged to, but did not, follow".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-22_para10"></a>
Their flavour seems to be that failing to follow a procedure which one is obliged to follow is intrinsically unfair and unreasonable. That is not our view. We believe that failure to follow the absolute letter of procedures beyond the minimum, no matter to how small a degree, should not be unfair if following it would have made no difference to the employer's decision to dismiss.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH415"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH415</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-22_para11"></a>Finally, the amendments all put the burden on the employer to demonstrate the fairness of the dismissal, or its reasonableness, or both, without defining those concepts. As Members of the Committee will be aware, once the employer has demonstrated that he has dismissed the employee for a potentially fair reason, it is neither for him to show that he acted reasonably nor for the employee to show that he did not. It is for the tribunal to make that judgment. That has been the position for more than 20 years and I see no reason to change it.
<P>

<a name="20326-22_para12"></a>I ask my noble friends to accept my assurance that the effect of this measure will not be as far-reaching as they may fear, and to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   It is very clear that there remains the greatest anxiety about the consequence of this clause being left as it stands. It was put most vividly by my noble friend, Lord Gladwin. The issue of who is right and who is wrong about this interpretation&#151;us or the Ministers&#151;leads me to say that we do not want to come back in X years' time with various negative consequences for industrial relations and say, "We told you so". We want to take this debate forward. Between now and Report in particular we trust that Ministers will read very carefully what we have been saying; we will do the same.
<P>

<a name="20326-22_para13"></a>In support of my noble friends, Lord Wedderburn and Lord McCarthy, we seem to have the paradox that we are looking at a case which has been going backwards and forwards where no compensation was awarded and that was thought to be a terrible thing. Of course, in one respect it can be put the other way round&#151;here was a case where the result was that there was no compensation. Even if that is not a very satisfactory position, it has to be set against the first point that has been made very strongly&#151;commensurately strongly&#151;with the problem we are confronting. Moreover, I have to say that on the question of human resources directors thinking that they might as well get out from under the sophisticated procedure, I do not think that characterisation of most human resource managers is accurate, for the reasons that my noble friend Lord Gladwin gave earlier.
<P>

<a name="20326-22_para14"></a>That is not what is being said by the people who are attempting to put in a quality benchmark&#151;a kite mark&#151;which is what we all want for the ACAS-type voluntary procedures; we also want improvement in the default procedures. We wish to ensure acceptable procedures but the main disincentive to the ACAS-type procedures involves whether there is a very much softer option in the default procedure. That is the area which I understand Ministers will take some time over Easter to look at. We understood from comments on the clauses concerning the examination of facts and so on in the default procedure&#151;which of course has some procedural consequences&#151;that there can be no doubt that there will be some procedural strengthening of the default procedure. This is what was said the other day. I trust that the indication from my noble friend Lord Sainsbury is that I am not totally wrong on that and that the matter is being considered.

<a name="20326-23_para2"></a><P>

<a name="20326-23_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: I simply interpose that I did not move Amendment No. 184A, which deals with the case of misconduct, because we took the view that this had been dealt with in our earlier discussion.

I understood that that is what the Minister indicated at the end of our debate on the previous amendment.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="20326-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I apologise to my noble friend&#151;the word "fundamental" did not pass his lips. Perhaps what he regards as serious reconsideration we shall try to see as fundamental, or vice versa. Anyway, some reconsideration is going to take place, and we look forward to it. In that reconsideration, we hope that Amendment No. 186 could also be considered, even if only as a footnote. We are rather keen on the footnotes to this discussion because every single word will matter. When this arises in litigation&#151;it will do so as soon as this part of the Bill is put into force and comes into effect&#151;it will be tested. We hope that it might include some even-handedness; that is, albeit at present the Bill allows for adjustments in cases where there might be an injustice to the employer, as set out on page 39, line 32, we have a case where an employment tribunal, even in the case <P>


<a name="column_CWH417"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH417</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of unfair dismissal, which is automatically unfair, is not required to make the mandatory award where it would,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"result in injustice to the employer".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-23_para5"></a><P>

<a name="20326-23_para6"></a>First, I hope that the Minister will explain what that means. If he cannot explain it in terms of a general formula, perhaps he can give us an example of a case where an employer has dismissed in a manner which is automatically unfair and in breach of the fundamental procedures and where normally an award will automatically be made against him of at least four weeks' pay, if that is thought to be an adequate sanction. However, now the proviso runs:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An employment tribunal shall not be required to make an award under subsection (5) if it considers that such an award would result in injustice to the employer".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-23_para7"></a>
What kind of injustice do the Government have in mind? What kind of case are they thinking of where the employer throws out the employee without consideration of any procedure, deprives him of his job and his wage and then says, "It would be unjust to make an award against me"? I wonder whether we could have an example of that.
<P>

<a name="20326-23_para8"></a>However, accepting that that is what the Government want&#151;no doubt they have some real life cases in mind&#151;we wish to add in Amendment No. 186,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"but in a case where it considers that an award limited to that provided for under section 112(6)"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-23_para9"></a>
my noble friend kindly indicated in a previous debate that that should be Section 112(5), but we are very happy to accommodate his suggestion&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"results in injustice to the employee, it shall award such sum in addition to the award under that subsection as it considers just and equitable".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-23_para10"></a>
If there is provision for a case, which we cannot imagine, where it would be an injustice to award the amount against the employer, there may well be a case for saying that such sum should be awarded as just and equitable if the limit on that award would be an injustice to the employee. We have deployed "sauce for the goose, sauce for the gander" arguments in relation to previous clauses in the Bill. This is another example. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   The amendment also deals with the part of Clause 34 which will make it automatically unfair to dismiss an employee without following the new statutory procedures. As I explained when speaking earlier to Amendment No. 185, an employee who is dismissed in such circumstances will generally receive four weeks' pay. In most cases, that will be achieved by increasing his basic award to four weeks' pay if it would otherwise be less. Where the tribunal orders his reinstatement or re-engagement, it must make a separate award of four weeks' pay.
<P>

<a name="20326-23_para11"></a>The earlier amendment would have increased the award where the employer was ordered to reinstate or re-engage the employee from four weeks' pay to 12. As I explained, we consider that to be excessive, all the more so since the current amendment appears&#151;it is obviously referring to Section 112(5), as my noble <P>


<a name="column_CWH418"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH418</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>friend said&#151;to provide tribunals with the power to increase compensation from 12 weeks' pay to as much as they see fit. Not only do we believe that four weeks' pay is a reasonable amount; we believe that a "one size fits all" penalty is right. To give the tribunals discretion to vary the size of the award would risk complicating their proceedings while they attempted to delve into the extent of the nature of the employer's failure or motives which lay beneath it, which might be far from easy to discern.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-23_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, would he not agree that there is in new subsection (1B) on page 40 provision to make an award or not make an award&#151;or not increase the amount of an award&#151;where an increase would result in injustice to the employer. However, there is no parallel provision to provide similarly to an employee who otherwise might suffer an injustice and there does not seem to be any kind of equality about that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-23_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   The purpose of this amendment is to say that if this does appear to lead to an injustice it should be removed. This is what, in the context of this particular clause, seems to me to be the right thing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-23_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I understand what my noble friend the Minister says in reply to my noble friend Lady Turner. However, the Bill is concerned with the matter in two places. A special subsection is introduced to deal with "injustice to the employer". When we suggest that perhaps some even-handed introduction should be made to deal with injustice to the employee, it seems we are outside the scope of the Bill's imagination.
<P>

<a name="20326-23_para12"></a>This again illustrates the way in which this is a one-sided Bill. When the Government reconsider matters over Easter, I earnestly ask them to consider whether this is not a one-sided Bill. The minimum statutory procedures are unfair in a variety of respects which we have shown, and after indicating the same point on a large number of clauses, we now come to the fact that the Government are willing to make express provision&#151;although it is still not at all clear to me exactly where it would apply&#151;for cases of what they call "injustice to the employer".
<P>

<a name="20326-23_para13"></a>As soon as we suggest that the Bill should deal with cases which are very easy to imagine where an amount of four weeks' wages or any other award might create an injustice to the employee because he has been dismissed&#151;not just dismissed, but dismissed in a way that breaks the very fundamental rules of civilised behaviour&#151;no, the Government cannot possibly introduce a provision that might give the tribunal a discretion, which is what we are asking for, to deal with cases of injustice to the employee. The Minister really must understand that he is defending a Bill which is unfair, lop-sided and not even-handed.
<P>

<a name="20326-23_para14"></a>I am sorry the Minister will have to spend so much time on the Bill over Easter. I wish him well in the break to which we are all coming. However, in his labours over Easter could he possibly suspend disbelief <P>


<a name="column_CWH419"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH419</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and imagine that it is possible that this Bill is one-sided? The refusal of this amendment is the final proof that someone, in of all things a Labour government, can introduce provisions for injustice to the employer. I cannot quite imagine what the cases are, but I do not make complaint fundamentally of that. What I complain of is that a Labour Government, however new or old, have put themselves into a Berlusconi mindset where they cannot even consider or take away for Easter, and in bed read before they go to sleep, some provision for injustice to the employee.
<P>

<a name="20326-23_para15"></a>I did not expect the Grand Committee to be such a shock. I have been a member of my party for some 56 years, and I have never heard anything of the kind ever suggested before. However, perhaps times are changing. It may be that those who reconsider over Easter regard my suggestions as quite outrageous; that the only thing that Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill are capable of dealing with are injustices to employers, as they are seen by the draftsmen, and not injustices to employees.
<P>

<a name="20326-23_para16"></a>It may look a small amendment, but it speaks volumes for what has gone into the construction of this Bill. All I can do at the moment, is beg to leave to withdraw the amendment.

 "INTERIM RELIEF
<br>
 In section 128(1)(b) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18), after "or in" there is inserted "section 146 or in"."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20326-24_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: It has been shown already that it is possible to discuss the remedy of interim relief within the confines, perhaps generously understood, of the new structure of unfair dismissal law and detriment law that is introduced by the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20326-24_para2"></a>Interim relief now applies to a large number of cases, including the right to be accompanied. It seems to us that it should include an interim relief against the suppression of trade union membership and trade union activities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   This amendment concerns interim relief, which is a remedy that employees may apply for if they consider that the reason, or principal reason, for their dismissal was on certain inadmissible grounds. One such ground is that they were dismissed on grounds of their membership, or non-membership, of a trade union, or their participation in the activities of an independent trade union. That is provided for in Section 161 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH420"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH420</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20326-24_para3"></a>The interim relief procedure, which has to be started promptly after dismissal, is designed to protect the employee by securing either that he is reinstated, or re-engaged, or, failing that, that his contract continues. As its names suggests, it is an interim remedy that does not determine the merits of the case.
<P>

<a name="20326-24_para4"></a>The amendment seeks to add Section 146 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act to the list of jurisdictions in respect of which interim relief is available. That section is concerned with action short of dismissal on grounds related to union membership or activities. It does not mesh at all with the interim relief provisions because, as I have indicated, they are available only when an employee claims to have been dismissed for certain automatically unfair reasons. Therefore the amendment is defective not just in form, but also in substance. An employee claiming under Section 146 has not been dismissed (unless he has been dismissed since for a different reason), and the remedies of reinstatement or continuation of the employment contract available under the interim relief provisions are therefore incapable of being applied.
<P>

<a name="20326-24_para5"></a>Those who suffer detriment because they are trade union members, or because of trade union activities, may already complain to a tribunal and get a remedy. Interim relief is available for dismissal for certain inadmissible reasons because in that case the employee has lost his job. It is relevant only in that case, and I can see no case for a procedure beyond what is already available. I therefore hope this amendment will be withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. He is of course quite right that acceptance of this amendment would require some further changes in the detail of the notion of what is interim relief.
<P>

<a name="20326-24_para6"></a>However, it is quite remarkable that although, when the employee suffers the final detriment of being deprived of his job, he can get interim relief. It seems that the Government are quite happy with the suggestion that the remedy should be expanded&#151;and that would need further amendments to the 1992 Act, where he suffers perhaps the most catastrophic reduction in his earnings or in his position at the place of work&#151;and that he cannot get any interim remedy. This goes to speed in the tribunals, and it is time, as has been said in various commentaries, that the notion of interim remedies should be considered on a wider basis. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20326-24_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: There is a sense in which some of this matter has been discussed already but it refocuses the minds of Members of the Committee on a very important matter. The amendment asks the Government to consider adding to Section 1 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. That is the section under which the employer must give&#151;I note the phrase that has been used since it was first introduced in 1963&#151;to the employee a statement of written particulars. It is true that under Section 3 of the 1996 Act, the employer must give to the employee, along with the written particulars, a note which specifies, as Section 3 puts it&#151;a note about disciplinary procedures and grievance procedures and, as a matter of fact, about pensions, other than procedures relating to health or safety at work. The employer must give a note informing the employee of:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(ii) a person to whom the employee can apply for the purpose of seeking redress of any grievance relating to his employment, and the manner in which any such application should be made, and
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-24_para10"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(c) where there are further steps consequent on any such application"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-24_para11"></a>
that is, of a grievance procedure&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"explaining those steps or referring to the provisions of a document explaining them which is reasonably accessible to the employee".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-24_para12"></a><P>

<a name="20326-24_para13"></a>As a matter of practice, we know that the ability of the employer to refer to other documents reasonably accessible to the employee causes workers considerable difficulty when they are advised to go and look at what the grievance procedures are. And now they have a new situation created by this Bill. The new situation is created because into their contracts of employment is implied the provisions of Schedule 2. Schedule 2 sets out the statutory provisions in regard to procedures concerning disciplinary matters on the one hand and grievance procedures on the other. So, when one takes a job and makes a contract which contrary to lay opinion is not always a written contract&#151;one makes a contract of employment as soon as one is taken on if one is lucky to find a job. Then the employer gives one the written particulars and a note, as he is required to do under the Employment Rights Act 1996. But he can say in that note, in regard to disciplinary procedures and grievance procedures, "You must go and look at some other document about the details of these matters". I have quoted from Section 3 on grievance procedures.
<P>

<a name="20326-24_para14"></a>We do not think that that is good enough. When an Act of Parliament says, "These are the procedures which must be fulfilled on each side, by the employer and by the employee. Here in Schedule 2 are the procedures", it is not good enough for the employer simply to say, "Go away and look at Schedule 2, which is reasonably accessible to you in the woodshed, or even behind it". We think that the obligation should be to give to the employee something which both sides will understand, so that they will know where they stand. The employer, after all, has to give a huge number of details in the written particulars. I will not read out paragraphs (a) to (k) of Section 1(4) of the <P>


<a name="column_CWH422"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH422</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Employment Rights Act 1996, but anyone who has not read them should go away and have a look at them because they contain a long list of things which the employer must set out&#151;although in some cases he can refer to other documents, limiting what he actually has to write.
<P>

<a name="20326-24_para15"></a>We say that, among that list, should be a new paragraph (hh), which is in the amendment. The employer should explain the effect of all relevant statutory procedures. It is no good saying that an explanation is more than he is required to do at the moment. If I take Section 1(4)(d)(iii), he must set out details as to the pension schemes.
<P>

<a name="20326-24_para16"></a>I often wonder whether some of the details which are put into written particulars really fulfil Section 1(4) in that and similar respects, but this is no greater burden. Indeed, it is not a greater burden because what in fact will happen is that the Department of Trade and Industry, in its somewhat subsidiary Employment Relations Department, will issue to employers a little leaflet which explains what the statutory procedures are. They provide all sorts of regulations and forms and all sorts of documents. I am sure that they will provide employers&#151;big, small and medium&#151;with a document that explains the statutory procedures. The employer will not have any great difficulty in attaching one of those, or even a photocopy, explaining the statutory procedures to the written particulars which, at the moment, he is obliged to provide under paragraphs (a) to (k) of Section 1(4) of the Employment Rights Act 1996.
<P>

<a name="20326-24_para17"></a>I have tried to puzzle what sort of objection there will by from the Government to this proposal. I am sure&#151;I have an apprehension&#151;that there may be some objection, as there is to so much of what we suggest. It cannot be that things would be too clear, because that would contradict the Government's aim for clarity. It cannot be that it is a big burden, because it is a very small addition to what is already in Section 1. I apprehend that the Minister's department will assist this process by having an explanatory document.
<P>

<a name="20326-24_para18"></a>My noble friend Lord McIntosh nods his head&#151;there will be such documents. It would be quite reasonable&#151;indeed, it would be in the employers' interests&#151;that everyone should know where they stand under the contract of employment as fashioned by the Act. I appear to be getting approval even from the official Opposition for these notions. They are not very revolutionary&#151;they are very modest. They will allow everybody to know where they stand. I begin to feel that possibly the Government could accept the spirit of the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20326-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Let us start with the common ground, because the ground of difference is relatively minor. The common ground is that the essential purpose of the Bill is to ensure that all operators operate, and all employees have access to, certain statutory minimum disciplinary and grievance procedures. Once those procedures are in place, it is clearly essential that all concerned are made aware of <P>


<a name="column_CWH423"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH423</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the procedures so that they can make good use of them in practice. The written statement of employment particulars is a key document in the employment relationship, setting out the key terms and conditions of that relationship. Other clauses in the Bill strengthen the role of this statement by ensuring that there can be potentially significant penalties on employers where they fail to provide it properly.
<P>

<a name="20326-24_para19"></a>It is clearly right that it is in the written statement that the application of the new statutory procedures should be communicated. That is where important issues such as pay, hours and so on are formally set out between employer and employee. It equally forms the best mechanism for formally setting out the disciplinary and grievance procedures which will be operated between the two parties to the employment relationship.
<P>

<a name="20326-24_para20"></a>I would like to stress, in case there is any doubt, that the effect of existing law, taken together with the amendments which we are introducing under Clauses 35 and 36 of the 1996 Act, will be to make it obligatory on all employers to issue a written statement that includes details either of the statutory procedures or of something better but not something less. That is not at issue. The problem with the amendment is that it goes beyond this basic position and would oblige employers to explain the effects of the statutory procedures.
<P>

<a name="20326-24_para21"></a>The advantage of the current position is that those employers who simply operate the statutory procedures will know, clearly and unambiguously, what it is that they must set out in the written statement. They must set out the statutory procedures. There is no need for these employers to agonise or worry. They will be able to copy out the information which the Government and other agencies will provide. I confirm&#151;I did so by nodding my head to my noble friend Lord Wedderburn&#151;that we will of course be producing a document, I hope in plain English. We shall do in consultation with ACAS and the other relevant agencies. That means that employers will be able simply to cut and paste the relevant text from our website if they want to. They will know that in doing so they are fulfilling their legal obligations. Everybody will know where they stand.
<P>

<a name="20326-24_para22"></a>If we were to force employers to explain the effect of the statutory procedures, we would be introducing the possibility of doubt and differences between different employers. I believe that the Bill sets out the statutory procedures in clear and simple terms, but it is far from obvious what "explaining their effect" would mean in practice. I notice that in all the citations that my noble friend made from legislation, none involved explaining the effect. Since this would be a statutory requirement, employers would worry about what it meant. Some would want to cover their backs by setting out at length, in lawyer-speak and with all sorts of caveats and complications, all the possible effects of the statutory procedures in practice, which would be very difficult to do. Others might take a more minimalist view. It would not be clear who was right.

<P>

<a name="20326-24_para23"></a>The written statement is designed to be a simple, clear and understandable picture of the employment relationship between the two parties. It would not be right for us to turn it into a legal textbook and, though I recognise that that is not the intention of the amendment, I am afraid that that could be the result. I noted what my noble friend Lord Wedderburn said about going away and looking at Schedule 2. That certainly would not be an acceptable way of presenting the statutory requirements.

<P>
<A NAME="20326-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for giving way but, before he leaves this point, I want to clarify something. My noble friend Lord Wedderburn explained, as we all know, that it is one thing to have a statutory requirement to glue something to the noticeboard. We earlier discussed whether "explain" is the right word or whether another word should be used. In relation to XYZ Electronics in Kings Lynn, Schedule 2 requires somebody to say, "If you have a grievance and you are in the transport depot, you have to write to Mr Struthers. You must do that within X days. Then we will have a meeting within Y days". That is not the same as saying that we rest on something that is a standardised DTI/ACAS procedure which is circulated on the website and glued to a noticeboard at the headquarters in Kings Lynn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   No. Clearly, the procedures which the noble Lord, Lord Lea, describes are part of what it is required employers should do. That is the procedure. That is not explaining the effect. Clearly, if you set out the requirements and you set out the procedures whereby they are brought into effect, you then say, "You go and talk to Mr Struthers" or whoever else it may be. That is not the same thing as is asked for in the amendment, which is explaining the effect.
<P>

<a name="20326-25_para0"></a>If there is any explaining of the effect to be done, it should not be done on an individual basis by individual employers, who may come to different conclusions from the next door employer about what the effects of statutory procedures would be. If there is any explaining of the effects to be done, surely it should be done&#151;as it will be done&#151;in a booklet produced by the Department of Trade and Industry in collaboration with ACAS and with the other agencies, which will be made available to employers and to employees. Is not that the right way to do it?
<P>

<a name="20326-25_para1"></a>I make one final point before I sit down. It needs to be made clear that the obligation on employers is not to operate the statutory procedures, full stop; it is to operate the statutory procedures or something better. Many employers will have procedures in place which go beyond the statutory minimum. To oblige employers to spell out the effect of these statutory procedures would be a distraction from the task of setting out what the detailed procedures are&#151;that is what my noble friend Lord Lea and the Government want&#151;and that could easily lead to confusion about what procedures actually apply in a particular case.

<a name="20326-25_para2"></a>I hope that the distinction between procedures and explaining the effect is clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   It is clear, but the effect of the relevant statutory procedures means explaining to the worker how they affect him. My noble friend asked me for a precedent. The Act has a precedent. In the note which accompanies the written particulars, the employer is obliged to include in a note&#151;and I quote from Section 3(1)(b)&#151;

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326-25_para5"></a><P>

<a name="20326-25_para6"></a>I appreciate that the department, in its usual helpful way, is going to give to every employer the advantage of having a piece of paper in which&#151;without being a legal textbook that the Minister referred to&#151;the general understanding of the department of the nature and effect in general terms of the relevant statutory procedures will be set out. Employers will be able to rely on that as part of what they give to the employee at the time of engagement or some weeks afterwards, as they are entitled to do.
<P>

<a name="20326-25_para7"></a>In addition to that I thought that we needed an explanation of the legal effect. "Effect" may be the wrong word. The Minister has understood it to mean precisely beyond what his department can say about the legal effect&#151;some further words on the legal effect. As usual, he may have a better word than effect.
<P>

<a name="20326-25_para8"></a>The amendment was meant to take up the model of Section 3 of the Act, to which he has not referred; namely, the effect of the relevant statutory procedures at that place of employment. He says that there may be further procedures. Very good; let them be set out. Presumably they will be set out in the note on disciplinary and grievance procedures. However, the Act as it stands will not refer explicitly to Schedule 2 of the 2002 Act, even though&#151;I know that Ministers do not like to refer to this&#151;the Government have made it obligatory in every contract of employment. We believed that the employer might welcome the chance of saying, "Here at this place of work, these are the relevant statutory procedures and this what the Department of Trade and Industry employment relations department or section says they generally mean in their application to all contracts of employment. This is the effect of them here. If you have a grievance under these statutory procedures, just as in regard to Section 3, you go and see Joe Bloggs or Mary Poppins".
<P>

<a name="20326-25_para9"></a>The employer cannot use Section 3 to refer to some other document. In a sense, we consider it to be wrong and unfair to both parties that the employer should be able to use Section 3 to say that one must go and look at some other document. We believe that the note, or, as we say here, the written particulars&#151;of course, we would not object if it went into the note&#151;should set out some explanation of what the "effect" means here and now, today, tomorrow and at this place of work. <P>


<a name="column_CWH426"></a>

<B>26 Mar 2002 : Column CWH426</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>There is probably a better phrase which will cure the ambiguity which has arisen between my noble friend the Minister and myself.
<P>

<a name="20326-25_para10"></a>At this place of work, surely the employer and employee should have a document to which they can refer in a case of complaint. After all, we are not dealing with a situation where everything is at peace and all is right with the world. The Bill impacts on situations where there is a complaint, or where, under the previous Clause 34, there is an unfair dismissal or where there is a grievance. There, the statutory procedures come into play. We believed that it would be advantageous if both the employer and employee could have a document which not only said what the statutory procedures were but which also set out what they meant in general legal terms or in lay language&#151;the department will provide that&#151;and if in the written particulars there was also an explanation of the effect at that place of work.
<P>

<a name="20326-25_para11"></a>I take it that the Minister does not accept that if the amendment made it absolutely clear that it would be desirable for the employer to say, "Here at this place of work, this is the way that we apply"&#151;he nods; I am confused.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I believe that I said so in answer to my noble friend Lord Lea, but let me set it out. The parts which state that if one is in the transport department one talks to Mr Struthers are part of the procedure. They should be set down.
<P>

<a name="20326-25_para12"></a>As I listen to my noble friend Lord Wedderburn, I believe that the difference between what he calls "effect" and what I call "procedures" is getting a little closer than seemed to be the case at the beginning. I agree with him that certainly the document which is required from an employer should not hide behind references to other documents; in other words, it should be as self-sufficient as it reasonably can be. When it comes to interpretation, as he calls it in non-legal language, so far as possible that should not be the statutory responsibility of an individual employer, as proposed in the amendment, but the responsibility of the department, of ACAS and of all the agencies.
<P>

<a name="20326-25_para13"></a>I hope that if we agree on that, we can agree that that is a better way forward than the amendment which we have before us. I do not find myself disagreeing in objective with what my noble friend Lord Wedderburn is arguing; it is simply the wording of the amendment which could be confusing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am immensely grateful to my noble friend the Minister. If it is only the wording of the amendment, we can rely upon its spirit. If only we could spend this time over Easter together, when all this work is going to be done. My noble friend must not reject these offers! My noble friend would do well to listen to us over Easter and indeed, for much longer.
<P>

<a name="20326-25_para14"></a>In view of what he has said, I feel sure that the Government, when they reconsider these matters, will come up with a proposal. It will not have the word "effect" in it, I see that because the word "effect" is <P>

<A NAME="20326w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   A contract has been awarded to Annes Gate Property plc for a new development on the site of the former Department of the Environment offices at Marsham Street. The contract is for a period of 29 years and involves the construction of new office accommodation, its long-term maintenance and provision of facility management and business support services. The net present cost of the contract is around &#163;311 million at current prices. The demolition of the existing building at Marsham Street will start as soon as possible. On current plans, completion of the new development is expected to be spring 2005. Westminster City Council has already given planning consent for the re-development of the site, which includes mixed office, residential and commercial development. The department plans to vacate five of its existing office buildings in central London after the move to Marsham Street.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20326w03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Compliance statistics for the nine months to 31 December 2001 show an increased effectiveness in the Inland Revenue's compliance programme. Of the 16,016 inquiries completed in this period, 5,427 cases (34 per cent) were found to contain discrepancies and these produced a compliance yield of &#163;10.4 million.
<P>

<a name="20326w03_para0"></a>I very much regret having to report that the Inland Revenue has advised me that some previous statistics relating to tax credit compliance have proved to be incorrect or incomplete. The correct equivalent figures for the year ended 31 March 2001 are that, of the 31,211 inquiries completed in that year, 5,573 cases (18 per cent) were found to contain discrepancies producing a compliance yield of &#163;7.7 million.

<P>

<a name="20326w03_para5"></a>The Parliamentary Answer also referred to accountability for the prosecutions function moving from the commissioners to the Attorney-General on 1 April 2002.
<P>

<a name="20326w03_para6"></a>Final agreement has not yet been reached on the implementation of Recommendation 4 of the Gower/Hammond recommendations which recommends that in relation to the prosecution function the solicitor for the Customs and Excise should not be funded by the commissioners but should have his own ring-fenced budget and be accountable for his own expenditure.
<P>

<a name="20326w03_para7"></a>This recommendation is accepted in principle by the Government but there are technical issues relating to the estalishment of a separate vote which require further time to resolve. The Government are committed to the full implementation of Recommendation 4 no later than 1 April 2003, but in the meantime the Prosecutions Group budget will remain as part of the Customs and Excise vote, though it will be separately identified and managed by the solicitor for the Customs and Excise and financial accounts reports will be produced as if that budget had been established as a separate vote.
<P>

<a name="20326w03_para8"></a>As a consequence of these revised arrangements, the Attorney-General will not assume full accountability for the prosecutions function from 1 April. Instead, from that date the following arrangements will apply:
<P>

<a name="20326w03_para9"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(1) The commissioners (and Treasury Ministers) will be responsible for and accountable to Parliament for: anything done in the course of an investigation; enforcement policy, including the resources to be deployed; prosecution policy, ie the seriousness with which offences should in general be treated and wider issues of departmental policy such as the disclosure of informants; decisions on alternatives to prosecution such as compounding, civil evasion action etc.

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326w03_para10"></a><P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(2) The Law Officers will be responsible for and accountable to Parliament for: the quality of legal advice given by investigation legal advisers; the quality of the Prosecutions Group casework decision-making in relation to cases referred to that group for prosecution; the application (the Prosecutions Group having consulted with Customs administrators, as appropriate) of prosecutions policy and public interest factors to individual defendants in cases referred to the Prosecutions Group for prosecution.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20326w03_para11"></a>Inspection of the Prosecutions Group by the CPS Inspectorate will commence on 1 April 2002, and the Prosecutions Group will proceed with the trials referred to in the previous Parliamentary Answer.
<P>

<a name="20326w03_para12"></a>The Government are satisfied that the arrangements that will apply from 1 April strengthen the involvement of the Attorney-General with the difficult and complex criminal casework conducted by the Solicitors Office, maintain the momentum of change that has been established and preserve an appropriate position on parliamentary accountability.

Expressions of interest will be assessed by the SSDA against the criteria detailed in the SSC development guide published in December. Successful sectors will receive funding to develop a full proposal within six months. The SSDA will recommend licences for those sectors whose proposals meet the SSC standard.
