<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Chan </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is their response to recent reports of racist attacks against black and other ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spmin0"></A><B> The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos):</B>  My Lords, the Government have frequently put on record our abhorrence of all forms of intolerance. We have developed a co-ordinated response and will be publishing our race equality strategy for Northern Ireland this summer. Enforcement action by the Police Service of Northern Ireland will continue to be key. Today, the Government published legislative proposals to deal with what is often termed "hate crime". The Government are committed to eradicating all such manifestations of hatred, and to the creation of a safer and more tolerant Northern Ireland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Chan: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that helpful reply, but is she aware that there have been more racist attacks against the Chinese community in Belfast this January than in the entire 12 months of 2003? Further, is she concerned that racial attacks against Chinese businesses and families in England have increased since 2000, especially during the Chinese new year season of January and February?
<P>

<a name="40210-01_para0"></a>Finally, will she confirm whether the Government will take steps to prevent any perverse racial attacks against the Chinese community as a result of the tragedy at Morecambe Bay, which indicates that it is about time that the Home Secretary's brave proposal of an amnesty for migrant workers who are here illegally was put in place?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord. I am aware of the increase in racial attacks against the Chinese community in Northern Ireland, about which we are very concerned. The noble Lord will be aware that the Chinese community makes up the bulk of the ethnic minority community in Northern Ireland. We have been in discussion with members of community organisations about the best way to tackle the problem.
<P>

<a name="40210-01_para1"></a>With respect to the wider question and the tragic incident in Morecambe Bay, the noble Lord will be aware that we have a clear, three-pronged strategy. The first prong is to tackle asylum; the second is to ensure that we work to build community cohesion; and the third concerns managed migration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the lack of police activity in the Village area <P>


<a name="column_1034"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1034</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of south Belfast has enabled loyalist terrorists to grow in strength there? It is not the first time that they have used their muscle: they have cleared students and Roman Catholics out of the area in the past. How many arrests have been made in recent weeks by the police dealing with those activities in the Village area?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the situation in Northern Ireland is somewhat complex and, as I understand it, there may be a number of reasons why those attacks have increased. We have nationalist parties operating; we have protection rackets and people trafficking; and there is an allegation that some attacks are linked to the paramilitaries, although the noble Lord will be aware that the paramilitary organisations have made it absolutely clear that those attacks are unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="40210-01_para2"></a>Policing is more visible and I understand that there have been three arrests, although I am not aware of what has happened about charging.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, to put the matter in perspective, ought not a great tribute be paid to the police for the wonderful and difficult work that they have done in stopping Chinese terrorist gangs victimising their own countrymen in this country? They have done a fantastic job and, if we are to talk about the subject, there should be some balance to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the Question concerns the situation in Northern Ireland, but on the noble Lord's point, of course the police are to be congratulated on the higher visibility policing that we have seen in areas where ethnic minority communities feel vulnerable. He will be aware of the announcement yesterday of a government initiative to tackle organised crime.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, first, I declare an interest as a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board. Is the Minister aware that liaison officers have recently been appointed in each district to deal with ethnic matters? Is she further aware that the day after tomorrow, the Community Involvement Committee, of which I am a member, is gathering representatives of minority communities, especially the Chinese, and of the senior police responsible for community involvement to a meeting to help to sort out the problem?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the appointment of ethnic minority liaison officers in each neighbourhood in Northern Ireland. I was not aware of the meeting, but I am pleased that it is going ahead and that the community, the police and the government agencies are coming together in this way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Laird: </B>   My Lords, as the Minister may recognise, I used to represent the Village area of Belfast. I am sure that the Minister will join me and every other right-thinking person in Northern Ireland to condemn these attacks without reservation, no matter who they are on, no matter what race or for <P>


<a name="column_1035"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1035</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what reason. I am sure she will agree that we should ask all right-thinking people to report any information that they have to the police immediately, to make sure that this nonsense is stopped for once and for all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is right. Of course I agree that we want to see condemnation of these attacks and we want to see these attacks stop. That is why the work of the Police Service of Northern Ireland is so important. We also need to work together to build community cohesion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew10"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Southwell: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister encourage and facilitate both Christian and other faith community groups and their leaders to work more closely together to combat xenophobia? Will the Minister investigate the schools curriculum to find imaginative, new, creative ways in which to help to build social cohesion?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, of course I agree with the right reverend Prelate. We need to work across the faiths. I will discuss the issue of education with my colleagues, and I will make the right reverend Prelate's point to them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   My Lords, given the extent to which the paramilitaries have been able to exercise their will in particular parts of Belfast, do the police believe the paramilitaries when they say that they have no part in what has been going on?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, as I understand it, the police consider that a complex range of issues are coming together. In answer to another question, I said that not only were there issues with respect to people trafficking, but with nationalist parties from Great Britain that are seeking to organise in Northern Ireland, as well as allegations with respect to the paramilitaries. All of these issues are being investigated by the police.


<a name="40210-01_head1"></a><H3><center>Chlamydia Screening Programme</center></H3>
<P>

<a name="40210-01_time0"></a><H5>2.45 p.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spopq1"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the chlamydia screening programme will only cover a quarter of primary care trusts; and, if so, what significant impact they expect this screening to achieve.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, the aim of the chlamydia screening programme is to implement, by 2008 at the latest, a national prevention and control programme in England. We have already achieved coverage of over a quarter of primary care trusts in just over two years. Early detection and treatment of chlamydia not only reduces the prevalence of lower <P>


<a name="column_1036"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1036</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>genital tract infections, but decreases the incidence of costly longer-term complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. I am glad that the Government are doing something. Unfortunately, it is not enough. Is the Minister aware that in the six years before 2002, chlamydia infection increased by 141 per cent, and in the most recent year's figures it increased by 14 per cent? Does she agree that one of the real problems is that 70 per cent of women and 50 per cent of men with the infection are totally unaware that they have it, and are symptomless? It is for that reason in particular and in view of the young age of those mostly affected that screening is the only thing that works.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-01_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   Yes, my Lords, all the figures that the noble Baroness has given are absolutely right. They present a depressing story, particularly because so many young women and men do not know that they are at risk. We have followed the National Strategy for Sexual Health and HIV, which is one of the first in Europe, and we have emphasised the screening programme that was introduced last year following the pilot. We are now at phase two, and by the summer we will have reached phase three, by which time over 100 PCTs will be involved. We will be reaching a lot of people in opportunistic screening where real use can be made of the findings. We are putting a lot more money into screening: #40 million in the past two years and another #26.4 million following the Health Select Committee's report.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend reassure me that the screening programmes take adequate account of the role that men play in the spread of this infection? In sexually transmitted disease clinics, it is normal to ask the patient to inform their partner, and if that is not possible to slip them an anonymous calling card. At this time of year, it would be rather an unwelcome Valentine. Would she agree that to treat patients who then go back to their infected partners is rather a waste of time?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, we are certainly targeting young men. We are conscious of the fact that young men are less confident about coming forward than young women. We have commissioned the Men's Health Forum to look at ways of helping us to develop the right strategies. We are looking at ways of reaching young men, through men's magazines, men's clubs, armed services bases and other places where we can be effective. In schools, the DfES is working with the National Children's Bureau to develop guidelines about how sex education can reach boys more effectively.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister think that in the long run it would be cost effective to make chlamydia notifiable?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, we have chosen an opportunistic screening programme simply because <P>


<a name="column_1037"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1037</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we know that it is effective. We are reaching those people who we need to reach. For the moment, that is the most effective thing to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister have an estimate of the cost of delaying the full roll-out of this programme to 2008, as opposed to the cost of increases in infertility and ectopic pregnancies and the cost to the department of treating those conditions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I do not have a comparative cost. It is difficult to cost infertility. I take issue with the word that the noble Baroness used&#151;"delaying". We are actually rolling this programme out faster, because as each phase comes on stream, we can learn from what we have achieved. Introducing a screening programme is not an instant fix, especially something like this where there must be a framework for follow-up, testing and treatment. We are actually making better progress than we thought at the beginning.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Perry of Southwark: </B>   My Lords, given that the 16 to 24 year-old age group is most affected by chlamydia, is it not particularly important that clinics in universities and colleges, and those dealing with upper secondary schools, are given priority in this programme, and that the educational programme carried out in schools emphasises the dangers and risks?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   Yes, my Lords. That is precisely why we are phasing in the programme to target educational establishments, such as colleges of further education, in particular. The reason for the age limit of 24 is that that is the age of greatest sexual activity. In addition, I understand that women are less likely to contract chlamydia as they grow older. We need to focus our resources where they would be most useful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Gould of Potternewton: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as the chair of the Independent Advisory Group on Sexual Health and HIV. Is my noble friend aware that last year NICE recommended free IVF treatment on the NHS, but in doing so it did not refer to the relationship between infertility and chlamydia, which has been raised in this Question? What action is being taken to ensure that if the NICE proposals are implemented, that causal effect will be taken into account?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, one of the reasons that we are accelerating the programme is the devastating consequences of infertility. An estimated 20 per cent of infertility cases are caused by chlamydia. The guidelines are scheduled for publication at the end of this month. The Government's position will be determined in the light of the final version. I am afraid that I shall have to ask my noble friend to await that outcome.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew10"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister clarify her earlier answer in which she said that 100 PCTs would <P>


<a name="column_1038"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1038</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be eligible for the screening programme later this year? Am I not right that the Department of Health's own report into the pilot screening programme in 2000 said that chlamydia screening should be introduced nationwide? What is the time-frame for doing that? Although the Minister is keen to tell us that the rate of progress has been good, I am not sure that I see it that way. Why has progress not been faster?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, by the summer one-third of all PCTs will be in the screening programme. The noble Earl is right; it followed a highly successful pilot in which the efficacy of screening was proved by the take-up and the outcomes. I believe that in my original Answer I said that it would happen by 2008 at the very latest. We might be able to make faster progress if we can learn as the programme evolves. We are quite optimistic. We are taking radical steps to inform people, as I am sure noble Lords will have seen, about the need to be aware that they are at risk. It is to be hoped that we will make fast progress.


<a name="40210-02_head0"></a><H3><center>Winter Fuel Payment</center></H3>
<P>

<a name="40210-02_time0"></a><H5>2.53 p.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the winter fuel payment can be extended to the 1.27 million severely disabled adults and children who receive the middle or higher rate of the disability living allowance care component, or the higher rate of the mobility component.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  My Lords, winter fuel payments were created to ensure that the elderly can afford heating in cold weather. After all, 95 per cent of all the additional winter deaths are of pensioners. There are no plans to extend the payments to any groups below 60.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that response. Does she recall that on the previous occasion on which I made this request she rejected it and gave the unconvincing excuse that, of those in fuel poverty, only 4 per cent were severely disabled, and that disability living allowance was available to help with fuel costs? Regardless of whether the figure is 1 per cent or 4 per cent, many severely disabled people&#151;there are more than 1 million&#151;cannot afford fuel to heat their homes or water, or to cook. It is irresponsible to leave such people unable to live a normal life. Will my noble friend remember that disability living allowance, which she said can help with fuel costs, is also supposed to help with the costs of food, laundry and care, so there is precious little left to cover fuel costs? Do the Government still say "no" to extending those payments to severely disabled people?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that, again, I shall have to challenge my noble friend's assertions. Disabled people, including severely disabled people under 60, receiving DLA are not only half as likely to be in fuel poverty as pensioners, they are less likely to be in fuel poverty than the rest of us. That is because disability benefits, including DLA, are doing their job, and I am delighted that they are.
<P>

<a name="40210-02_para0"></a>I shall give just one example: a lone parent with a non-disabled child will get #2,500 a year&#151;about #50 a week&#151;in financial support. If that child were severely disabled, the lone parent would get, not #2,500, but #10,000 a year in financial support&#151;four times as much. I am delighted about that, but it means that the non-disabled child, not the disabled child, is more at risk of fuel poverty.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, not for the first time, the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, has made the point that the winter fuel payment should be extended to severely disabled people below the age of 60, a number of whom, despite what the noble Baroness has said, could be in fuel poverty. In that connection, does she agree that fuel poverty is closely linked with poor housing? Can she assure us that severely disabled persons, particularly those who are housebound, will be given priority in ensuring that their homes are effectively insulated and provided with good heating?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is absolutely right that fuel poverty is not only about income; possibly at least as importantly, it is about the state of housing. It is about whether the house is insulated; the fact that one quarter of our stock is pre-First World War; and pensioners, in particular, are likely to be under-occupying. In rural areas, pensioners are often not attached to gas mains so that their heating costs are proportionately higher. That is why pensioners are at most risk.
<P>

<a name="40210-02_para1"></a>Whereas in 1997 nearly half of all our housing was below what we regard as a decent standard, primarily because of lack of thermal efficiency, we have brought that down to one third. Around 700,000 families on income-related benefits have received warm-front grants, and local authorities have received nearly #8 billion to bring the housing stock up to decent levels. We have some way to go, as housing stock is what we inherit, and it takes many years to renew it. But I am confident that the Government are well on their way to meeting their targets in that direction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Tomlinson: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend not agree that, as she has rested heavily in her argument on the estimation of fuel poverty, it is a nonsense that everybody over the age of 60 receives the winter heating allowance, irrespective of need? Is there not a more fundamental case that needs at some time to be tackled: getting proper means-testing of all benefits, and benefits dealt with by a single mechanism rather than this complex multiplicity of mechanisms, which many people do not understand?
<P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, there is a range of views about the efficacy or the right balance between means-tested or income-related benefits on the one hand and universal benefits on the other. The Government, for example, have increased their expenditure on pensioners in real terms since 1997 by #9 billion, half of which has gone to the poorest one-third, as my noble friend would like. But 52 per cent of those in fuel poverty are pensioners. That is why it makes sense to make this a universal benefit to those over 60.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, disability living allowance at its various rates is intended as help from the taxpayer for those with extra costs resulting from their disability. Surely some of those extra costs are heating. Therefore, is there not a heating element in the calculation of DLA?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, DLA is meant to assist disabled people to meet the additional costs of their disability. In some cases, particularly for those with mobility problems, heating may be an issue; for others, it may be about diet; for others, it may be laundry. Around one-third of disabled people on disability benefits have mental health problems that may have no connection to heating needs. The noble Lord is right that it is a general benefit which disabled people and their carers can use as they see fit. But disabled people receiving those benefits are less likely to be in fuel poverty precisely because those benefits are adequate enough to meet their needs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to come back again. Instead of digressing on those byways and side-paths of other people who may or may not be worse off, perhaps my noble friend would deal with the central issue that I raised. More than 1 million severely disabled people cannot afford to heat their homes and water or to cook. How do the Government intend to deal with that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry, but I still challenge my noble friend's assertion. There are 1.3 million disabled people in receipt of attendance allowance. As they are more than 60 years old they receive the winter fuel payment. Of those who are in receipt of disablement benefits, whether income support, DLA or whatever, only a tiny proportion&#151;something like 7 per cent, as far as we know&#151;are suffering from some evidence of fuel poverty. It simply is not the case, as my noble friend said, that 1 million severely disabled people are suffering fuel poverty.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My Lords, we seek to support reform in Iran while maintaining a critical dialogue on areas of concern, such as Iran's approach to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, human rights, the fight on terrorism and the Middle East peace process. We are concerned about reports that the final candidate list for Iran's parliamentary elections on 20 February is likely to exclude a large number of candidates. Our concerns are widely shared in the European Union and elsewhere.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for that reply. I am sure that most noble Lords feel alarm at the blocking of reformist candidates. Does the Government agree that Iran, besides being in the early stages of its democratic development and being a theocratic state, also has a constitution of Byzantine complexity? If the Minister agrees, do we have any basis on which to influence the Iranians so that in future the Guardian Council will not have the power it currently exercises to block reformist candidates?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I agree that Iran is in the early stages of its democratic reform. I agree that the decision to bar some 2,300 out of 8,300 candidates who want to stand for the Majlis election has been the result of the Guardian Council. Ultimately, the issue must be resolved internally in Iran. Yes, we can bring influence to bear. I hope that our friends in Iran will have heard very clearly the message sent by the European Union foreign ministers when they expressed their concerns about the way in which this is being conducted. But I also hope that by exchanges such as these, the message will get home that Iran will not be able to meet the expectations of its people to become a properly functioning democracy while the Guardian Council continues to prohibit a wide range of perfectly decent candidates, but candidates who believe in reform.

<A NAME="40210-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Temple-Morris: </B>   My Lords, would my noble friend take further note of the fact that the recent behaviour of the Guardian Council, to which she has alluded, towards the elected Majlis in any democratic context whatever is absolutely and utterly appalling? Would she further acknowledge that the barring of no fewer than some 3,600 candidates out of a total of 8,000 from standing in the now imminent elections, leading to 126 resignations of sitting members of the Majlis who are unable to stand again, amounts to a gross abuse of Iran's Islamic constitution?
<P>

<a name="40210-03_para0"></a>As a member of the Government, does my noble friend accept that there must be a serious governmental balance struck between the dialogue to which she has referred, which many of us have advocated for many years&#151;be that dialogue constructive or be it critical&#151;and perceived support which, given at the wrong time, can be seriously counterproductive?

<P>

<A NAME="40210-03_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I agree with much of what my noble friend has said. I shall be <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>meeting the Iranian Ambassador later this week. I shall ensure that I give him a copy of the exchanges that have taken place in your Lordships' House. Perhaps I may make one point to my noble friend. As he said, the original list of candidates barred was some 3,600. That has been reviewed. Although it is not enormously improved, the number is now lowered to some 2,300. Furthermore, although there were a greater number of the current deputies barred, the number now is 70 out of the 290 deputies currently sitting.
<P>

<a name="40210-03_para1"></a>There has been a marginal improvement. I just say that for the record. But the fact is that that makes no difference to the fundamental point made by my noble friend Lord Temple-Morris, which is that this is not the way to improve Iran's democratic credentials.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, given that true democracies are very rare in the world&#151;the vast majority of countries are not true democracies by any calculation&#151;could the Minister tell us on what criteria the Government decide which emerging democracies they choose to support and influence as opposed to all the others?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, of course there are many different standards of what one regards as democratic. I am sure that there are people all over the world who will look even at your Lordships' House and raise various questions. As I have already pointed out to some of my interlocutors on this point, the fact is that in this instance there are 70 individuals who, as of today, are able to sit in the Majlis in Iran who will be excluded from the elections on 20 February. That is not going forward in democratic terms. Alas, it appears to be going backwards.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that a regime condemned yet again by the last General Assembly of the United Nations for practising torture, amputations and blindings is not even pretending to evolve towards democracy? Can my noble friend assure the House that, so far as concerns the United Kingdom, Iranians found in Iraq will not be returned to the clutches of the torturers and murderers from whom they are trying to escape?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, of course, we will have to look very carefully at any individuals who are claimed by countries that practise torture, amputations and various forms of capital punishment. I accept what my noble and learned friend has said. There is an enormous amount of ground to work on with the Iranians in relation to human rights. There is progress, albeit very slow. For example, we have been able to work on an announcement by the Supreme Administrative Court that the practice of stoning has been suspended.
<P>

<a name="40210-03_para2"></a>I recognise that that may seem a marginal point to some of your Lordships. We are calling for a moratorium on all the hideous forms of amputation that are practised as a means of discipline, as a means of a legal system. But there is a great deal of work to do in that respect. We certainly do not shirk from undertaking it.

<A NAME="40210-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that there are signs that the Iranian Government want to have closer links with the West and to play a more responsible global role? In particular, the young people of Iran seem to be strongly pro-West and many of them want to live in the United States. As this exchange has confirmed, there is not much democratic evolution going on in Iran at the moment, with those 2,000 candidates banned from the elections next week.
<P>

<a name="40210-03_para3"></a>Would those who have contact with Iran, including this Government, keep reminding the Iranians that if they want closer and better relations, free elections are better than building nuclear weapons? They would provide a much better basis for the close relations which are needed. In some ways, that is evidenced by the very warm reception that Prince Charles has had on his visit to Iran where he took our sincere condolences to the people of Iran for the horrific slaughter in the town of Bam.

<P>
<A NAME="40210-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   Yes, my Lords, of course. On that last point, I am sure that we all welcome the visit of His Royal Highness to Bam, which he undertook in his role as patron of the Red Cross. I am sure that he was able to bring comfort to that city in its dreadful plight. Of course the noble Lord is right. We want to see free elections. I would not wish your Lordships to take away an entirely gloomy picture of what is happening in our relationship with Iran.
<P>

<a name="40210-04_para0"></a>As I indicated in my initial response to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, we are supporting reform in Iran. We believe that we are working with the grain of the reformists in Iran. We should not forget that there are elected deputies and elected people in positions of power in Iran. As I think your Lordships have been able to discuss, the problem arises with the role of the Guardian Council. Of course we are engaged in very important discussions; for example, on the whole issue of weapons of mass destruction. We should not throw away what is good, what is working in the relationship, where we believe that we can work with reforming influences because there is still a very bad record on human rights and there also appears to be a rather less full approach to the elections on 20 February than we would wish.

<P>


<a name="column_1044"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1044</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the setting of fares is entirely a matter for individual airlines. However, as a matter of principle, the Government welcome the recent ruling that the cost of providing assistance should not be passed on to the disabled passenger. That principle is enshrined in the Department for Transport's voluntary code of practice for the UK air industry and in the European Airline Passenger Service Commitment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer. Is he aware that the wheelchair levy of 50p on every ticket that Ryanair is charging will raise #12 million per annum, which will far exceed the actual cost to Ryanair of providing wheelchairs&#151;about 2p per ticket? Leaving aside the question of whether there should be a charge for providing wheelchairs at all, does my noble friend agree that the levy is a disgraceful example of using disability as an excuse for blatant profiteering? Should not the levy be referred to the Office of Fair Trading? The Ryanair website states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The amount of the levy will be continuously reviewed upwards or downwards to ensure that Ryanair collects only what is required to cover the provision of assistance at Stansted".

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40210-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, Ryanair, of course, is not a British airline. Therefore, there is a limit to how much British law can influence and affect Ryanair. My noble friend has identified the key point, that originally the intention was to pass the cost on to disabled passengers. Following the court ruling, it has been suggested that the charge for each ticket should rise by 50p, when the actual cost of providing for disabled passengers may be only 2p per ticket.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </B>   My Lords, why is this not the responsibility of the airport operators? Surely it should be for the British Airports Authority to ensure that passengers can be safely taken to their points of departure. It should not be left as a squabble between the BAA and the airlines. If the BAA can afford to provide free parking for Members of Parliament, surely it can afford wheelchairs for the disabled.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has identified the fact that the legislation implemented by airports stops at the point at which the passenger embarks, is cared for on the aircraft and disembarks from it. The provisions of the draft Bill propose that the requirement should extend to the aviation industry and to the aircraft. Therefore, when my noble friend's committee has finished its pre-legislative scrutiny and we are able to consider the Bill, we shall consider extending the provisions to airlines.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester: </B>   My Lords, does not the court's decision in this deeply disturbing case reflect very high credit on the DRC and emphasise again the urgency of the need to enact the Government's new legislation on disability discrimination?

<P>
<A NAME="40210-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend. The court case was clear that the commission was right to raise the issue, and it obtained a judgment in its favour. That demonstrates the excellent work that the commission does on behalf of the disabled. As my noble friend rightly said, the next stage is to ensure that we introduce measures to advance the cause of the disabled.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister give an assurance that the Government will use their influence and power to ensure that this sort of objectionable profiteering does not carry on and that disabled people are never again used as an excuse for upping the price of tickets?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, as I indicated in my original Answer, Ryanair is not a British airline. But, of course, the European Commission is also active in this area and proposes to introduce regulations to deal with the situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   My Lords, if Ryanair is unwilling to change its policy, might it not qualify for the accolade "Cheapskate airline of the year"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-04_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that my role is to comment on the virtues or defects of particular airlines, but I think that in this case the slogan "no frills" is not a particularly advantageous advertisement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-04_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I begin by declaring an interest. Since World War II, I have been dependent on wheelchairs at airports. Can the Government make any suggestions as to how the levy is to be calculated?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-04_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the Government's intention is not to introduce a levy, but to introduce a law and consequential regulations that oblige airlines to treat disabled passengers in a totally non-discriminatory way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-04_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, with regard to the question of my noble friend Lord Forsyth, will the Minister give a clear answer? Do the Government believe that the airport operators, rather than the airlines, have a responsibility in this respect?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-04_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, under British law, the airport operators have a clear responsibility, which they fulfil, to care for disabled passengers in a non-discriminatory and helpful way. The problem is that the law does not extend to the boarding of aircraft, to passenger seats on aircraft or to disembarkation. Our proposed legislation, and that of the European Commission on behalf of all the European airlines, addresses that feature.

(c) consult the Lord Chancellor"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40210-04_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this group of amendments was tabled on Report but, due to the delayed start occasioned by a Statement and my particular desire to move on quickly to Clause 5, I did not move them. I now return to them because I believe that they are an extremely important part of the Bill and because I believe that Her Majesty's Government have again got it wrong. In principle, the amendments refer to the appointment of the Lord Chief Justice and Lords Justices of Appeal.
<P>

<a name="40210-04_para6"></a>There should not be only a single name put forward either jointly or by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. I suggest that they can and should indicate their preferences and, where these coincide, they should carry significant weight.
<P>

<a name="40210-04_para7"></a>According to the Bill, the Prime Minister's duty remains to make the appointment on merit, which I support entirely. He or she must be capable of being satisfied that the paramount requirement&#151;the merit principle&#151;is fulfilled. Any other interpretation would mean that the predominant consideration was political. Therefore the existing practice, at least as it was under my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay and probably under the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine, and it is hoped under the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, whereby the field was very carefully surveyed in close consultation with the most senior judiciary, needs to find continuing expression in Northern Ireland and to be a part of the procedure. It should be considered seriously whether not only the Lord Chief Justice should be consulted personally, but also that the views of the Judicial Appointments Commission as a whole should be known.
<P>

<a name="40210-04_para8"></a>It is also desirable that the Lord Chancellor should continue to be consulted. As I read the Bill, the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland will have either no or very little input, and the Judicial Appointments Commission absolutely no input. In that context, it may be that, in practice, the convoluted provisions for devising apparently ad hoc procedures for each such appointment set out in Clause 4(5) and (6) will take some or all of the above into account. But the Judicial Appointments Commission is certainly not permitted to recommend names. Both this and what is to happen generally need to be spelt out clearly on the face of the Bill, otherwise there is a real danger that such appointments will lack well informed and carefully considered advice, and degenerate into political horse-trading.
<P>

<a name="40210-04_para9"></a>The Government say that they set out to ensure the depoliticisation of judicial appointments in Northern Ireland. But what they have done is the opposite and <P>


<a name="column_1047"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1047</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in my opinion it was done in a cynical way. I believe that most of the Bill has emerged as the result of debate, discussions and negotiations with political parties. Much of what is in it, including these clauses, is at the behest of one or other of those political parties. In anyone's book, that is not depoliticisation; it is politicisation.
<P>

<a name="40210-04_para10"></a>We only have to compare this with what Her Majesty's Government think is right for England and Wales. I refer to some of the provisions. For appointments to the Court of Appeal, a senior appointments panel will be established by the Judicial Advisory Commission for England and Wales comprising the Lord Chief Justice, a head of division or other Court of Appeal judge chosen by the Lord Chief Justice, the chairman of the Judicial Appointments Commission or a deputy chosen by him&#151;a lay member, and a further lay member of the JAC chosen by the chairman. This panel will provide one name for the vacancy specified and a list of other candidates who might be suitable.
<P>

<a name="40210-04_para11"></a>The Secretary of State&#151;I am not being political in saying that; while the provision refers to the Lord Chancellor's Department, it will involve the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs&#151;can ask the panel once to reconsider, and he can reject a candidate once.
<P>

<a name="40210-04_para12"></a>For appointments to the head of division, including the Lord Chief Justice, the senior appointments panel will be made up of the most senior of the judges from England and Wales who are members of the Supreme Court from England or a deputy chosen by him; the Lord Chief Justice or, if appointing to the post of Lord Chief Justice, a head of division or other appropriate judge chosen by the senior judge as mentioned above; the chairman of the Judicial Appointments Commission or a deputy chosen by him&#151;a lay member; and a further lay member of the JAC chosen by the chairman.
<P>

<a name="40210-04_para13"></a>In conclusion, not only does the Judicial Appointments Commission for England and Wales have a hand in the consultation process, it can recommend the candidates. For Northern Ireland, however, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister consult the JAC only about procedure in making a single recommendation to the Prime Minister. I suggest that this is monstrously inconsistent and very political. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40210-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, made a powerful and, I suggest, overwhelming case for these amendments. While there is no problem with Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3, I wonder whether there might be a drafting error in Amendment No. 4, which is rather less important than the other three. Should not the word "and" appear after the word "recommendation"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, about this issue. It is clear that the noble Lord is seeking to <P>


<a name="column_1048"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1048</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>build in safeguards in relation to senior judicial appointments to minimise his concerns about the possible scope for political influence.
<P>

<a name="40210-05_para0"></a>Perhaps I may say at the outset that throughout our examination of the Bill we have sought to ensure that the independence of the judiciary is upheld. The noble Lord referred to what would be relevant in England and Wales. I should say to him that there are common principles relevant to all three jurisdictions of the United Kingdom&#151;Northern Ireland, Scotland, and England and Wales. These are the ideals of enduring judicial independence, transparency, accountability and high public confidence in the judiciary.
<P>

<a name="40210-05_para1"></a>However, the fact that there are three jurisdictions means that certain differences in approach will be taken at the operational level. In practice these differences are right, proper and necessary to reflect the differences between the jurisdictions. Moreover, one point that has been made abundantly clear in our discussions about the Bill is that there are particularities in Northern Ireland which we need to take into account. So I am sorry that the noble Lord is not convinced that the procedure on devolution for senior judicial appointments is sufficiently robust.
<P>

<a name="40210-05_para2"></a>Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 seek to provide for statutory consultation with the Lord Chancellor when making senior judicial appointments. The Prime Minister will make a recommendation to Her Majesty after considering the recommendation of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. The Lord Chief Justice will be consulted, as provided for in the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002. His views will be made known to the Prime Minister. Further, there is nothing to stop the Prime Minister or the First Minister and Deputy First Minister consulting the Lord Chancellor.
<P>

<a name="40210-05_para3"></a>However, I must remind noble Lords that we are discussing senior judicial appointments in a post-devolution criminal justice environment when the Lord Chief Justice will be head of the judiciary in Northern Ireland, not the Lord Chancellor. I would therefore propose that it is not necessary to provide for statutory consultation with the Lord Chancellor.
<P>

<a name="40210-05_para4"></a>Amendment No. 2 seeks to specify that when making senior judicial appointments, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister will supply a list of at least three names to the Prime Minister. The clause as it stands gives the Prime Minister flexibility over the number of names he might require from the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. Of course the Prime Minister might ask for three names, or he might ask for fewer than three. The Prime Minister can decide in each case. We believe that this flexibility is important and should be maintained.
<P>

<a name="40210-05_para5"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 4 would be that the Judicial Appointments Commission, as well as advising the First and Deputy First Ministers on the procedure to adopt when making senior judicial appointments, would also advise on the substance of the recommendations. Recommendation 85 of the Criminal Justice Review states:
<P>


<a name="column_1049"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1049</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-05_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40210-05_para7"></a>The review did not recommend that the commission should provide advice on the substance of recommendations to the Prime Minister. This would give the commission a role in individual appointments to senior judicial offices which was never intended. They are currently required to advise the First Minister and Deputy First Minister on a general process to be used for making recommendations about senior appointments.
<P>

<a name="40210-05_para8"></a>I said at the beginning that what we have put in place is robust. Of course we wish to maintain the independence of the judiciary. This is not about political influence or interference. The review was very clear with respect to the Judicial Appointments Commission's direct involvement in appointments. It should cease at the level of the High Court judge. I hope that in the light of this explanation the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Lord President. I hear what she says in relation to my Amendment No. 1 on devolution.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass </B>   moved Amendment No. 5:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Leave out Clause 5.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-06_para0"></a><P>

<a name="40210-06_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, both in Committee and on Report I indicated that my party and I are unhappy with the Bill, largely because we suspect that it will not work for the greater good of the people of Northern Ireland. It is a very political Bill. In his remarks earlier, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, intimated that he feels likewise.
<P>


<a name="column_1052"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1052</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para2"></a>One should consider the words of the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, at Report stage. He said about this part of the Bill:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government gave their commitment at Hillsborough in the Joint Declaration. It would be a sad day if the Government were to renege on a promise they made to the Northern Ireland parties".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-06_para3"></a>
The only matter I take issue with on that is that it was not a commitment given to "the" Northern Ireland parties; it was a commitment given, secretly and without agreement, to "a" Northern Ireland party.
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, continued:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It would be a sad day if the House were to say, 'Never mind what undertakings the Government made; we think differently'. The situation in Northern Ireland, with the start of the talks today on the review of the Good Friday agreement, is sensitive. It would be unhelpful if this House were to change the Bill in the way the amendment suggests".&#151;[Official Report, 3/2/04; col. 597.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-06_para5"></a>
We simply do not believe that secret and clandestine arrangements made outside the House&#151;by whoever&#151;override the interests of those of us who come here to legislate for the good of society as a whole. That is why Amendment No. 5 seeks to leave out Clause 5.
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para6"></a>The clause relates to the duty of the Director of Public Prosecutions to refer certain matters to the Police Ombudsman. I cannot look at the clause without wondering where the powers of the Police Ombudsman end. Is the Police Ombudsman to be all powerful? Is the Police Ombudsman's influence to override the influence of the command of the Police Service of Northern Ireland; the influence of the Policing Board; the influence of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary; and, in a way, the influence of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para7"></a>I acknowledge that I have received a letter from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney-General, in which he sought to reassure me on this point. However, I am not reassured in any way.
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para8"></a>New subsection (4A) in Clause 5(3) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Director shall refer to the Ombudsman any matter which . . . appears to the Director to indicate that a police officer . . . may have committed a criminal offence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-06_para9"></a>
If it is believed that a police officer has committed a criminal offence the matter will obviously be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who will make a considered judgment based on the evidence before him. If there is a good chance that he will achieve a conviction, he will take the matter to court. If there is a 50-50 chance, he may decide to take the matter to court. If there is a 40 per cent chance, he will make an assessment.
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para10"></a>But let us consider the case where the Director of Public Prosecutions looks at the information and evidence brought before him and decides that there is a 5, 10 or 15 per cent chance&#151;in other words, a case where he would not recommend prosecution through the courts. That should be the end of his responsibility. It is not for him then to ask questions that impinge on the responsibility of the police command, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and the other institutions to which I have referred. Never have the police been so policed as they are now. We should not <P>


<a name="column_1053"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1053</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regard the Police Service of Northern Ireland as a body that needs to be passed from one invigilating authority to another.
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para11"></a>Let us return to the case where the DPP has decided that the policeman will not be taken to court; that he will not give or require the opportunity, as the case may be, for the policeman to account for his behaviour before a jury of his peers. I have already acknowledged that the Attorney-General has written to me. Whatever he may say, is it not a form of double jeopardy?
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para12"></a>When the DPP says, "What has come before me does not appear to me to necessitate prosecution, but I shall relegate the judgment on this case to the police ombudsman", the policeman will not in fact be tried or examined by a jury of his peers. Yet, when that case is passed to the ombudsman, is there not&#151;because of its source, which is the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions&#151;to some extent an obligation on her that would not have been on her had the matter arrived on her desk through the system that she controls? Is there not a greater likelihood of more severity and greater pressure being brought to bear in respect of a policeman? The same situation occurs in terms of new subsection (4A)(a)(ii). That new subsection refers to the possibility that it may appear,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to the Director to indicate that a police officer . . . may, in the course of a criminal investigation, have behaved in a manner which would justify disciplinary proceedings".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-06_para13"></a><P>

<a name="40210-06_para14"></a>I have experienced a poorly prepared prosecution coming out of the DPP's office. If that happened, and there is an "inquest" into why a prosecution has failed, is there not likely to be a natural fall-back position, asking the police ombudsman to examine the evidence that the police provided in bringing the prosecution in the first place?
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para15"></a>Again, it is very much a matter of who minds the minder. Quite simply, I do not believe&#151;and many people would agree with me&#151;that the DPP's role and responsibility should be that of message boy or girl, as the case may be, for the police ombudsman. We have adequate supervision of policing at every level. To impose this particular clause on top of all that has gone before and all that currently exists is to create double jeopardy, however Government Ministers may try to explain it away. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I shall be brief. The Bill would be better without this clause. We have a new police force in Northern Ireland, the PSNI. It has new cultures developing and evolving. In Northern Ireland, we are desperately short of trust between all the organisations: political parties, religions, police forces and various other aspects and parts of the judicial and criminal services. They have links with the British Army. There are huge numbers of interlinks and interfacing organisations, all attempting to cope with extraordinarily difficult levels of crime and terrorism. I do not see what is only a provocative clause achieving anything very much; the Bill would be better off without it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-06_spmin0"></A><B> The Attorney-General  (Lord Goldsmith):</B>  My Lords, I too can be brief because we debated this clause at some length in Committee and on Report.
<P>


<a name="column_1054"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1054</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para16"></a>I shall respond first to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis. This amendment is not about the powers of the ombudsman; those are not at issue. It is about the Director of Public Prosecutions passing matters across, in certain circumstances, to the ombudsman. It does not touch on what powers the ombudsman has when he or she&#151;presently she&#151;receives that information. It is not about overriding the Director of Public Prosecutions. So far in these debates, I have made two points clear. First, that the director's independence, professionalism and integrity are beyond doubt and, secondly, that the decision on prosecution remains absolutely and completely that of the director, not of the ombudsman. It is only after the director has made a decision, one way or another, that the matter will go to the ombudsman, if it goes at all.
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para17"></a>I said that in my letter to the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, which he was generous enough to acknowledge today. I shall quote what I said to him, so that your Lordships are aware of it too. I wrote:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It may help if I make it absolutely clear that decisions as to prosecutions are, and will remain, the responsibility of the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland. The responsibility of the Police Ombudsman is to investigate allegations of criminality by police officers or of behaviour that may justify disciplinary proceedings".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-06_para18"></a>
That is the disciplinary side.
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para19"></a>That takes me to my second point. The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, was worried that the Director of Public Prosecutions, having made his proper decision about prosecution, might need to ask questions&#151;I noted his words as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"impinging on questions of the police command and so forth".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-06_para20"></a>
No, after the decision on prosecution is made and executed, it will not be for the director to do that. If it falls within this clause, it would be for him to pass the matter across to the police ombudsman and it would then be for the police ombudsman, if appropriate, to make further enquiries. It may well not be appropriate. That would be for the ombudsman to decide.
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para21"></a>The third point that he made is that, because an issue has been put before the ombudsman by the Director of Public Prosecutions, that would somehow give it greater gravity or require her to deal with it with greater severity. I do not see that at all. The ombudsman will be obliged to consider the material before her on the objective basis of that material and its strength, and not on the basis of the provenance of the material. That is particularly so because the director will be passing the information over as a result of a duty&#151;that is the very thing that this clause imposes&#151;not as a result of a judgment by him that the matter is one that deserves consideration by the ombudsman.
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para22"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, was concerned, on the previous occasion at least, about what he described as double jeopardy. Another matter dealt with in the letter that I wrote to him responded to a question that he sought to ask on the previous occasion. A police officer is not in a different position from that of many other people who belong to professional bodies. After trials of all sorts, people in professional bodies may find themselves referred to their professional bodies or to other disciplinary bodies for consideration. As a barrister, that <P>


<a name="column_1055"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1055</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is certainly something that would undoubtedly happen to me. I have experience of other professionals too, such as solicitors and doctors. Police officers are not in that regard in a unique position in any respect.
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para23"></a>Moreover, this issue is more likely to arise in circumstances where the officer is not the subject of the investigation but is the investigating officer or is involved in the course of investigating somebody else. If Mr A is on trial, but it appears that the police officer has misconducted himself, there is no question of double jeopardy so far as the officer is concerned. For those reasons, I respectfully suggest that the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, are not well founded.
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para24"></a>I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said about there being a shortage of trust in Northern Ireland. As Attorney-General for Northern Ireland, I understand what he means by that. However, I invite him and those on the Benches opposite carefully to consider this: is not one of the reasons for the lack of trust in some parts of the communities a belief, however ill founded, that wrongdoing on the part of particular people is covered up and not passed over? Having a clear obligation on the Director of Public Prosecutions that says, "If you come across this sort of conduct, you must pass it to the Police Ombudsman", gives many people in the community a sense of trust that there can be no question of that sort of material being seen by someone in the DPP's office and covered up simply because they prefer not to expose to daylight any misconduct.
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para25"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, that trust is important. This clause will increase trust within the community. I warmly urge him and those on the Benches opposite to consider that, in accordance with his objective of increasing trust, which I share, the right thing to do is to support this clause.
<P>

<a name="40210-06_time0"></a><H5>4 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General has outlined very clearly the technical aspects of the matter that I raised. However, he has not clarified at all&#151;it is impossible to clarify&#151;the fact that the DPP is concerned with criminality. Criminality is different from professional inadequacy or carelessness. The people who deal with those things are the ombudsman, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, the police officer's own senior command and the Policing Board. There is no such cross-fertilisation in the case of the solicitors, doctors and accountants that the Attorney-General mentions in his letter. Those professional bodies make a judgment that is separate and apart from the judgment of criminality made by the Director of Public Prosecutions. Hence, I have not had a satisfactory explanation of why, in this specific case, there should be that overlap between criminality and professional inadequacy, misjudgment or carelessness.
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para26"></a>If we adopt this clause, we give the Police Ombudsman a second opportunity to find evidence against a policeman which, in turn, may lead to a <P>


<a name="column_1056"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1056</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>prosecution, because if she finds something within the scope of her investigations that suggests criminality, she is bound to refer the matter back. The situation will be such that, having considered the case against the policeman, and decided that there is no case to answer, the case is passed to the ombudsman and then handed back. The DPP has to make the same judgment on a second occasion. That is absolute nonsense. If it is not double jeopardy, it is what I always believed double jeopardy to be.
<P>

<a name="40210-06_para27"></a>I am not satisfied that this clause is beneficial. I should like to seek the opinion of the House.

<A NAME="40210-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glentoran </B>   moved Amendment No. 6:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Leave out Clause 6.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-07_para0"></a><P>

<a name="40210-07_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I take issue with the Attorney-General and with Clause 6, which was Clause 7 on Report, and question whether it should not more properly be struck out of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40210-07_para2"></a>I remember saying on Report that I accepted the Attorney-General's arguments, but would take advice from my legal team. I am here because my legal team was not satisfied with the arguments put forward by the noble and learned Lord on Report.
<P>

<a name="40210-07_para3"></a>I shall not go through the issues at length as we have discussed them both in Committee and on Report. Unfortunately, on neither occasion did the Attorney-General and I agree. On Report I said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This is a new offence of influencing a prosecutor. It is neither necessary nor wise. The Government rightly realised that, for it to have legal certainty, an essential of any such criminal offence is that it must be done with the intention of perverting the course of justice. Any attempt to influence a prosecutor with such an intent is already a criminal offence at common law, and the proposed statutory offence adds nothing to it".&#151;[Official Report, 3/2/04; col. 607.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-07_para4"></a><P>

<a name="40210-07_para5"></a>I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Tordoff: </B>   My Lords, it is not my intention to intervene in the substance of the discussion, but I have a procedural point to make.
<P>

<a name="40210-07_para6"></a>It is strange that noble Lords are trying to remove a clause on Third Reading that stood part in Committee. I am sure that that is not what Third Reading is about. There may be occasions when that can happen, and this may be one of them. I do not know enough about the subject of the clause.
<P>

<a name="40210-07_para7"></a>We must be careful about how we proceed at Third Reading. I have been saying for a long time privately&#151;and possibly publicly&#151;that there are far too many amendments at Third Reading. Noble Lords will see that the Companion is quite strict about that. I am sure that it has been accepted by the Clerks in the general way in which the House deals with such matters. I simply want to raise a caution. Clauses that stand part in Committee should not really be struck out at Third Reading unless there is some very significant change between those two stages.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, has made a very important point. I doubt that this afternoon is the moment to attempt to respond to <P>


<a name="column_1059"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1059</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the significance of what he said, but I am sure that the fact that he said it&#151;and that he in particular said it&#151;needs to be considered further by those who consider the procedures of our House. If he will permit me, I shall make no further observation on it, other than that I have great sympathy with what he said.
<P>

<a name="40210-07_para8"></a>We have debated the issue at some length. It is always a regret for any lawyer to find that other lawyers disagree with him. I explained fully in Committee and on Report my reasons why I think it proper and wise to keep the clause in the Bill. I said then, for example, that bringing the offence would require the consent of the director himself. Perhaps I should have added that there are circumstances in which the deputy director can act in his stead, but I imagine that that would be only if the director himself were away.
<P>

<a name="40210-07_para9"></a>I do not think that I can add anything to what I have said before. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, dealt with the amendment very quickly and I adhere unrepentantly, I am afraid, to my views that the clause is good and proper and should be kept in the Bill. I hope that noble Lords will agree.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, before responding to the noble and learned Lord, I should like to say to the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, that I will certainly take note of what he said. If I have tabled an amendment that I should not have tabled, I apologise unreservedly to the House and to those concerned, and I shall seek advice from the Clerks in future with more diligence.
<P>

<a name="40210-07_para10"></a>I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, does not want us to get involved too heavily in speeches on whether the Bill do now pass. However, as it is a Northern Ireland Bill and there is always a lot of passion and argument on Northern Ireland Bills, I should like to thank those on the Government Front Bench who have so patiently dealt with all our criticisms. I also thank my noble and learned friends and noble friends who have supported us and, last but by no means least, the officials from the department, who have been very patient with me when I have badgered and bullied them in corridors, airport lounges and other places to get more information or to change something.
<P>

<a name="40210-07_para11"></a>I thank the noble and learned Lord for what he said, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40210-07_para12"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-08_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs   (Lord Filkin) </B>  moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 3, line 1, after "by" insert "an order made by"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-08_para4"></a><P>

<a name="40210-08_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, on Report, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, made a strong case for the power conferred on the Secretary of State in Clause 3(6) to be subject to a degree of formality. The power enables the Secretary of State to specify the further content of the application form. The noble Lord proposed that the power should be exercised only by order, but that such an order need not be subject to a parliamentary procedure. He brought into question the openness of the language of the clause as it stands.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para6"></a>As I signalled, I wanted to reflect on that, and I now propose an amendment to Clause 3(6) so that the content of the application form for gender recognition is now set by order. In that way, we will retain the flexibility which we believe is important, while introducing the formality and transparency of an order-making process. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I am obviously most grateful to the Minister for having thought about and accepted the principle behind my argument on Report. I therefore greatly welcome the two amendments in the group.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-08_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, we also welcome the amendments.

 "RELIGION
<br>
(1) A body which exists for the purposes of organised religion may, if subsection (2) is satisfied, prohibit or restrict the participation in its religious activities or ceremonies of persons whose gender has become the acquired gender under this Act.
<br>
(2) This subsection is satisfied if the prohibition is necessary to&#151;
<br>
(a) comply with the doctrines of the religion, or
<br>
(b) avoid offending the religious susceptibilities of a significant number of the religion's followers.
<br>
(3) "Religion" means any religion, religious belief or similar philosophical belief.
<br>
(4) This section does not affect&#151;
<br>
(a) section 19 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (c. 65) (ministers of religion etc.), or
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1061"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1061</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(b) Article 21 of the Sex Discrimination (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 (S.I. 1976/1042 (N.I. 15)) (corresponding provision for Northern Ireland)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40210-08_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, for those who have not followed the Gender Recognition Bill during the last five debates on it, I should explain that it allows a man to become a woman or a woman to become a man, even without gender reassignment surgery. It allows a new birth certificate to be issued in the new gender, and creates a criminal offence if the original birth sex is revealed by a person in an official capacity, such as a Church leader. It is a transsexual rights Bill.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para12"></a>My amendment addresses the fact that Churches and religious bodies will face litigation under the Bill. How can I be so sure? Because it has already started. Already the Bill is being used to argue that transsexuals have a legal right to teach in a Sunday school and take part in any form of Church ceremony, such as marriage and worship. Already it is being used to argue that transsexuals have a legal right to take holy communion, which contravenes the teachings of particular Churches now threatened with legal action. At least two Churches have already been threatened with legal action under the Bill, even before it reaches the statute book.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para13"></a>A number of other Churches have been threatened with litigation by transsexuals in recent years. There was even a court case where the pastor and the entire membership of a Baptist church in south Wales were sued because a man who had had a sex-change operation was told that he could not attend a ladies' prayer meeting. Under the current law, the church succeeded in having the case thrown out. There were legal costs even though it won, but the church was not compelled to give a male transsexual the right to attend a ladies' prayer meeting. This Bill changes the legal landscape, however. There is no guarantee that the church would win the case if it came up again. It would certainly be far more costly to defend.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para14"></a>I received a letter yesterday from the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, for which I am grateful, in which he admits that under the Bill Churches can be taken to court over their beliefs. He says that it is the Government's opinion that such litigation "probably" would not succeed on the grounds of sex discrimination. Such litigation puts Churches under huge pressure. Members of the Baptist church to which I referred earlier were advised by their lawyer that defending the action could cost them up to #100,000, all because they would not let a man come to a ladies' prayer meeting.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para15"></a>My amendment is very simple. It is directly based on and mirrors the Government's own amendment&#151;now Clause 19&#151;which gives broad exemptions for sports bodies. The Government are prepared to amend the Bill to protect "fair competition". Can we not do the same to protect, as I suggest in the amendment, the doctrines of religion? The new Clause 19 allows sports bodies to prohibit participation of a person with a gender recognition certificate. What reason could there be for not allowing the Church an equivalent right?
<P>


<a name="column_1062"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1062</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para16"></a>The amendment simply enshrines existing freedoms. The Government will no doubt say that those freedoms are not under threat. Ministers said the same thing to the sporting bodies, but then they changed their minds. In Grand Committee on 14 January, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We believe that maintaining competitive parity, or fair and safe competition, is fundamentally important, but we are not convinced that there is a problem".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-08_para17"></a>
Then he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Bill will not give transsexual people the general right to participate in sport in the acquired gender".&#151;[Official Report, 14/1/04; col. GC 121-122.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-08_para18"></a>
He changed his mind and we now have an amendment protecting sports bodies. It gives sports bodies reassurance and greater legal certainty. That is all my amendment seeks&#151;reassurance and greater legal certainty. If sporting competition is "fundamentally important" are not the beliefs of religious bodies equally fundamentally important?
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para19"></a>My amendment will deter hostile litigation against religious bodies which, as we all know, often survive on a shoestring. People do not put money into the collection plate to pay lawyers. All my amendment seeks to do is to allow people of faith to worship God and conduct their own religious activities according to their own faith. Their faith teaches them that one's sex is fixed at birth and cannot be changed. That perfectly reasonable belief is very common among religious people and, indeed, among the general public as evidenced by the hundreds of letters that have been written to support the thinking behind this amendment. There are thousands of people out there who are genuinely worried about this.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para20"></a>The question is, should you be sued in the secular courts merely because of your beliefs and the way you worship God?
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para21"></a>It is important to emphasise that my amendment does not affect the principle of the Bill in any way. It does not even address the fact that Church ministers face a potential criminal record and a fine of #5,000 if they tell another clergyman in their own Church that the woman in the congregation is really a man. All the amendment does is give reassurance and protection for some of the existing freedoms of religious bodies.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para22"></a>Churches are private bodies; they make their own rules of membership. Any private body can exclude people for all sorts of reasons. The problem is that the new legal situation under this Bill has the capacity to open up the affairs of a Church to the scrutiny of the secular courts in a way which would not apply to other private associations or groups.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para23"></a>It is clear from the wording of my amendment that if no offence is caused, then there is no issue. The amendment is permissive; it does not compel a Church to do anything. As a matter of fact most Churches will welcome a transsexual visiting their services to hear the Gospel. It is only where there is offence that they should be entitled to protection.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para24"></a>It is also clear that non-religious activities are not covered. Purely secular activities of a religious body do not come into it. The amendment is concerned only <P>


<a name="column_1063"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1063</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with religious activities or ceremonies, such as marriage, Communion, baptism or teaching in a Sunday school.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para25"></a>I believe that Churches have similarities with political parties. Like a political party, they would be nothing without freedom of association. As I understand it, the Labour Party insists that all its employees are card-carrying members of the Labour Party, and quite right too. Like a political party, the Churches maintain internal discipline. Those who reject the fundamental tenets of the organisation through words or deeds can be asked to leave. That is already the case, but that is now put in jeopardy by the Bill. Churches are private bodies but their internal affairs can be opened up to hostile litigation by the particular combination of legal rights which will result from the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para26"></a>A person who assumes a new sex has new human rights, thanks to the Goodwin case. Section 6 of the Human Rights Act means that you can argue that a Church is subject to these rights as a public authority in its exercise of some public functions. The transsexual also has sex discrimination rights in his or her new gender. Finally, transsexuals have rights under this Bill. But the Church, on the receiving end of litigation over marriage or membership, only has one set of rights&#151;human rights. That is three against one.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para27"></a>The Bill is a completely new departure in UK law. It declares that a man must be treated as a woman "for all purposes" in law. It is illegal to discriminate on the basis of sex in the provision of goods and services. This presents absolutely no problems for Churches at the moment, but it will after this Bill.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para28"></a>In the south Wales case, a husband and father of three used sex discrimination law to argue that he had the legal right to join the ladies' prayer meeting. What would be the outcome of that case now? One of the Churches currently being threatened under this Bill is being told it must provide Holy Communion to a transsexual. Again, sex discrimination law is cited in addition to human rights, but also mentioned in this letter from the solicitor is the fact that this Bill is being considered in Parliament and will become an Act, thereby reinforcing the point I made about three sets of rights. Surely these are matters that should be left to the Church and not to secular courts.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para29"></a>We all have&#151;at least some of us have&#151;disagreements with our Church. I dearly wish that I could have been married in Church but because I married a divorcee I was not allowed to do so. If I go to the Roman Catholic Church I do not take Communion; I take it in the Anglican Church because the Roman Catholic Church makes its own rules which I respect. The Government may claim that my amendment is unnecessary, but there can be no doubt that the law will develop. Laws have a habit of developing, as we well know. Churches will be threatened; this may cost them dearly in terms of time, stress and finance&#151;even if they win. My amendment seeks to enshrine the long-standing right of the Church to order its own religious activities and ceremonies.

<a name="40210-08_para30"></a>If a church, synagogue, mosque or temple does not want to conduct the marriage of a transsexual, it can refuse. If a Welsh chapel wants to insist that its ladies' prayer meeting is only for biological women, then it can do so without fear of litigation. Thirdly, a church can decide who can teach in a Sunday school or youth meetings without being sued. That is the effect of my amendment.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para31"></a>The Government believe that it is possible under this Bill for a transsexual to sue an Anglican minister over a refusal to conduct a marriage. That is why it has provided a conscience clause for Anglican clergy, but there is no conscience clause for other Churches or for the non-Christian faiths.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para32"></a>The Government now accept&#151;according to the letter sent from the Minister to me&#151;that other denominations can also be sued, but helpfully he suggests that such legal action could be resisted, using human rights arguments. In other words, they are left to their fate and the mercy of lawyers, not to mention the cost. I have also to point out that the Minister finds himself in conflict with the former Home Secretary Mr Jack Straw, who was unequivocal that Churches act as public authorities when they conduct a marriage. I refer to Hansard of 20 May 1998, col. 1017.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para33"></a>The Minister said that we can take a more optimistic view. Instead of leaving it to chance, surely it is our duty to give the Churches the reassurance they need on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para34"></a>When the European Convention on Human Rights was devised in 1952 it did not contain a section on transsexual marriage rights. The European Court confirmed that in 1998, but only four years later it reversed its position. In 2002, the Goodwin case said that transsexuals have a right to marry in their assumed gender. It would satisfy the Goodwin judgment if the Bill provided only civil marriages for transsexuals, but the Government have gone much further, in effect giving the right to religious marriages for transsexuals.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para35"></a>Some Churches may be content to take part in this and that is fine. But many&#151;and I would suggest most&#151;would not be content. Yet the ground is laid for litigation against them if they refuse. The UK courts may take a more interventionist view on these issues than the court at Strasbourg.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para36"></a>One government argument against protecting Churches is that there is no need to do so because the transsexuals would not want to force such issues. But that ignores the fact that there is hostility against religious groups, which is sometimes manifested in litigation.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para37"></a>The Government recently brought in new employment regulations to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Protections were provided for religious groups, yet even these limited protections are now being challenged in the courts. The Government are having to defend the rights of religious groups against hostile litigation. Surely, they must accept that this Bill creates scope for more of the same.

<A NAME="40210-08_spnew5"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, I hesitate to contest an amendment moved with such evident religious conviction, but I found the noble Baroness's speech confusing at a number of points. I am not clear whether the Church, which I serve, is in her mind a private or a public authority. I am clear that it is a public authority not simply because it is, by law, established but because, to quote an example she gave, the right to exclude a person from the Holy Communion is governed by canon law, which in this country is the law of the land. So it is not clear to me that at least the Church that is served and represented by people who sit on these Benches could ever claim to be a private authority with the rights of private authorities.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para40"></a>Secondly, it is not at all clear to me what is meant by "a Church". Does it mean a vicar in a local parish? Does it mean a bishop in a diocese? That confines my attentions only to the Church of England. What will count as "a Church" which has these rights?
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para41"></a>What is included in the expression "religious activities or ceremonies"? Let me offer a hypothetical situation. I decide that it would be good to celebrate the patronal festival of St James, the patronal festival of Hartlebury, with a pageant on the village green. There is present at this event, which includes the singing of hymns and the saying of prayers, someone who is known to be a transgender person and a group of people start a disturbance. As I happen to be a person who dislikes conflict&#151;and I ask noble Lords to believe that&#151;I conclude that it would be better to ask the transgender person to leave than to confront the people making the disturbance. It seems to me that when then challenged by the transgender person, I can say that the religious susceptibilities of the significant number of my religion's followers have been offended and it was on that basis that I acted, even though I myself would have acted purely out of timidity and not out of conviction.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para42"></a>Is that really the road down which we as a society wish to travel? Do we really wish to deny people the protection that we should be offering them from such behaviour and do we wish thereby, in fact and implicitly, to encourage such behaviour? I ask that those who are troubled by this matter recognise that there is a serious balancing consideration. We are talking about a relatively small group of people who have usually been on a personal journey of a nightmarish kind to the point at which they have decided to undertake the most radical life-change that any of us could imagine.

<a name="40210-08_para43"></a>I believe that we, as a Parliament, should be protecting such people from the kind of behaviour to which I have referred. We should also be protecting them from the arbitrary exercise of judgments by people who may or may not be qualified, except in the fact that they have a strong religious conviction, from taking the action that they take. I believe that the inclusion of the amendment introduces huge confusions as to what is a religion, what is a ceremony, what is a private body, what is a public body and what it is that we really want to protect people from.
<P>

<a name="40210-08_para44"></a>So far&#151;and some of us have questions even about this&#151;we have sought only to offer the limited protection of those people who would otherwise be in jeopardy of litigation in respect of the exercise of their public office at particular public moments. That, I think, introduces a wholesale opportunity to discriminate and expose people to extremely dangerous situations. I hope that the House will reject the noble Baroness's amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40210-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, it is a privilege to speak after the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester. Your Lordships may wonder what on earth a lawyer can add to what one has just heard from the Bishop, but I want to make a couple of further points explaining why I am strongly opposed to the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40210-09_para0"></a>I want first to clarify one matter. The only way in which the Gender Recognition Bill confers a legal entitlement on transsexuals not to be discriminated against is in the employment and related field. That is made quite clear in the Explanatory Notes, and in Schedule 6 one sees that the only parts of the Sex Discrimination Act which are modified in favour of transsexuals are the employment and related provisions. No one could bring a discrimination claim under the Bill against the Church or anyone else in the provision of services or facilities to the public. It is important to recognise that.
<P>

<a name="40210-09_para1"></a>It has been criticised by the Joint Select Committee on Human Rights, of which I am a member. We argued that the Bill, like the Sex Discrimination Act, should have covered not only employment but the provision of goods, services and facilities to the public. Had it done so, an amendment of this kind might, if carefully tailored and much narrower, have been appropriate. In terms of the claims of transsexuals to equal treatment without discrimination, as a matter of law it is entirely inappropriate and unnecessary. That is the first matter I want to deal with.
<P>

<a name="40210-09_para2"></a>The second matter is that in subsection (2) the amendment, like the equality regulations on sexual orientation and religious discrimination that were the subject of much controversy in your Lordships' House, allows a prohibition where it is necessary not only to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"comply with the doctrines of the religion",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-09_para3"></a>
but, and alternatively, to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"avoid offending the religious susceptibilities of a significant number of the religion's followers".

<a name="column_1067"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1067</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
That is a surrender to mob prejudice and group prejudice of all kinds, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester explained when we debated a similar exception in the employment field. I can understand an argument that makes it appropriate to comply with the doctrines of a religion in terms of the need for religious freedom. If there really is a religion that is so bigoted that it wishes to exclude or discriminate against someone who has had their gender reassigned, then perhaps there is an argument for deferring to that in striking a fair balance. But how can it be right to strike a balance by not complying with the doctrines of a religion but by the avoidance of offending the religious susceptibilities of "a significant number", whatever that means, "of the religion's followers", whatever that means? If your Lordships approve the amendment it would send a signal that your Lordships' House was in favour of that kind of mob rule, which I am certain is not the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, I feel in my heart that the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, is right to envisage the problems which may arise from the legislation, and that perhaps, with every respect to the right reverend Prelate, there is just a touch of complacency in some of his comments.
<P>

<a name="40210-09_para5"></a>It is a great pity that, neither in this debate or earlier debates, have we heard the voice of Islam in this House. My friends of that faith tell me that they have grave reservations about the legislation. It is also a great pity that so many of our proceedings were undertaken while the noble Lord, Lord Patel of Blackburn, was away on pilgrimage to Mecca. It would have been most welcome to have heard his views, speaking for his religion. That would either have persuaded me that my fears were wrong, or might have persuaded the House that my fears were well founded.
<P>

<a name="40210-09_para6"></a>When the Minister replies, I hope he will give an undertaking that if the fears expressed my noble friend Lady O'Cathain are proved to be true, despite the comments of the legal experts&#151;and we all know that in every case half of the lawyers are wrong&#151;if they are well founded and there are successful legal actions, the Government will come forward with amending legislation to protect the Church, even against itself.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clarke of Hampstead: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain. Even at this stage, I sincerely hope that my noble friend the Minister will accept it. In my limited ability, I cannot deal with the legal niceties of learned Lords or the intellectual capacity of a Bishop such as the right reverend Prelate. I can speak in the House only as a person who tries to understand matters in the simplest way. The feelings of religious groups on the subject are well known to every Member of the House. They know that from conversations on not just the Christian faith, as has just been mentioned, but on other faiths. Their views on the proposals in the Bill and the amendment are widely accepted and respected.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-09_para7"></a>For the life of me, a simple person, I cannot understand why my Government, the Government I support, are so determined to resist an amendment that clearly protects. The right reverend Prelate spoke about our duty to protect people. We also have a duty to protect religious groups and Churches. We have heard clear threats to Churches and their finances and we know of the misery that is often caused when people are dragged through the courts. The feelings of others should always be considered. Without the amendment the feelings of many people will be offended. If the noble Baroness, in the absence of the Government acting with common sense, has to test the opinion of the House, I shall willingly follow her into the Lobby. Even at such a late stage I hope that will not be necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-09_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, I was looking at the front pages of today's Times and Daily Telegraph and now I understand why our dear, much-loved and so woolly Church of England is in such a muddle over the amendment. It has, after all, decided that the Three Wise Men are now neutered&#151;have they been transgendered or not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-09_spnew4"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Winchester: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may respond briefly to the noble Earl. He needs to be wary of what he reads in particular newspapers that I shall not name, or any newspaper, on that kind of matter. But that is not why I am speaking.
<P>

<a name="40210-09_para8"></a>I shall approach the noble Baroness's amendment by expressing my warm appreciation for the courtesy, attention and patience of the Minister and his colleagues and of his officials&#151;the latter over many months and in many meetings long before the Bill reached your Lordships' House. Paragraph 3 of schedule 4 is, I hope, not only warmly welcome to us, but something of a first. I am grateful for his explicit assurances that such meetings can continue and that we can persevere at working not only with the Church of England but with representatives of other Churches and&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, notes&#151;to see whether acceptable ways forward can be found around the issues of disclosure and discrimination in particular.
<P>

<a name="40210-09_para9"></a>The Minister has received two sides of a letter from me that expresses both my appreciation and anticipation of such further work and our hope that we can start on it soon. That is because&#151;and it is appropriate to the amendment&#151;I noted and warmly welcomed the assurance by the noble Lord:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Clearly, in part, much of these discussions has concerned trying, if possible, to provide the proper rights to transsexual people that we clearly believe should be provided in a civilised society, and to do so in a way that does not, at the same time, infringe their right to freedom of religion and to freedom of religious expression".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-09_para10"></a>
He then accurately ended that paragraph by saying:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are debating on that cusp".&#151;[Official Report, 3/2/04; col. 644.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-09_para11"></a>
That brings me directly back to the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness. As she and other Members of the House who worked on the issue in the past weeks <P>


<a name="column_1069"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1069</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>know, I have much sympathy for where the noble Baroness and those people for whom she speaks are coming from. There are matters of real concern. For me, the fact that we have not achieved some safeguards for other Churches and faiths on the face of the Bill, specifically regarding the solemnisation of marriage, is a matter of real concern. I remain, but am not very, hopeful that that question will be approached in another place. Having said that, I hope that I am not immediately disappointing the noble Baroness, because she knows that for me the amendment is quite a few steps too far. The balance of the sort that is needed, and to which the Minister referred on 3 February, is not where I should want to see it. So, although I am with the noble Baroness to a significant extent, I cannot go with her to the extent of the amendment; but I hope that several of the issues that she had in mind may be approached in further discussion, which is necessary.
<P>

<a name="40210-09_para12"></a>While I am on my feet, I listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Lester, who cited the amendment and traced it back to its origins in existing legislation. In particular, he made an observation about the real difficulties that that legislation contains&#151;that it mentions avoiding offending the religious susceptibilities of a significant number of the religion's followers. But what is "a significant number"? The Church of England, other Churches and other faiths hope to continue to work closely with the Government to attempt on this and a range of other matters to determine what the provision may mean.
<P>

<a name="40210-09_para13"></a>Few Churches or faiths in this country or anywhere else are entirely monolithic. For me and others in the Church of England&#151;of course, we on this Bench do not always speak with one mind&#151;those words will prove important and we shall have to work out what they mean. It is in such areas, among others, that the careful work that I am delighted that the Minister has offered to continue will be especially welcome.

<A NAME="40210-09_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I hope that my noble friend will not feel disposed to accept the amendment. I oppose it because it seems rather intolerant. I speak as someone who is not a believer&#151;I happen to be vice-president of the British Humanist Association&#151;but I have always believed passionately in people's right to practice their beliefs and participate in religious ceremonies.
<P>

<a name="40210-09_para14"></a>We are discussing a relatively small group of people who have had pretty awful experiences and may themselves be rather damaged individuals. They are the very people who are most likely to need the consolations of their religious belief. To pass an amendment that would prohibit them from expressing that religion and attending religious ceremonies is simply unkind and would add to the difficulties that such people encounter.
<P>

<a name="40210-09_para15"></a>As noble Lords have already pointed out, new subsection (2)(b) provides for a kind of mob law to prevent those people from having the right to exercise their beliefs. I therefore hope that my noble friend will <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>not feel disposed to accept the amendment. It is intolerant. Its wording is unclear: what does participation in religious activities mean? That could mean an employee engaged in selling religious artefacts in a cathedral shop, for example. That wording is far too wide and, in any event, to prohibit people from attending a religious service that may mean an enormous amount to them would be quite unkind. I hope that the amendment is not accepted.

<A NAME="40210-10_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   My Lords, I have had more lobbying&#151;more letters&#151;on this issue than on either the Hunting Bill or the homosexuality clauses in other Bills. I thought that anti-discrimination legislation was to stop an individual imposing his views on others of a different nature. In general, for people of high moral principle, their religious belief is at the very core of their existence. They come together and congregate in churches. What worries me about the Bill is that it allows individuals aggressively to impose their view of the world and of their nature on such groups.
<P>

<a name="40210-10_para0"></a>Even if the amendment is imperfect, it is necessary to include it in the Bill at this stage. I understand the reservations of the right reverend Prelate and others, but it is better to include the amendment now and then tidy it up. It should come down to congregational rather than whole Church level, because some congregations may accept the approach and some may not. We should allow that diversity in the Churches. We need the amendment included now to start the defence, because the provision can be amended in another place. The Bill should defend churches from transsexuals who would discriminate against church congregations' beliefs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I shall be brief. I came to support the amendment but, having heard the speech of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester, although I support the principle behind the amendment, I cannot support it. The principle behind it is the entitlement to have a derogation from the provisions of the Bill of generic application to all purposes recognised by law in favour of religion. That principle I adhere to. But, as the right reverend Prelate pointed out, the balance has gone wrong&#151;especially in paragraph (b).
<P>

<a name="40210-10_para1"></a>In our predominately Christian, multi-ethnic, multi-religious society, which is tolerant of all faiths&#151;atheists, agnostics, Dissenters, or what have you&#151;one ought to defer, if one can, to the authority of the established Church as an estate of the realm, which was confirmed as long ago as towards the end of the first millennium by exchange of oaths on the coronation of King Edgar.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </B>   My Lords, I shall just say one or two things following from the observations of the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill. He pointed out plainly that words similar to the amendment are already in the legislation of this country&#151;no doubt subordinate legislation; but legislation nevertheless. He describes that as an illustration of mob rule, but it is mob rule, if he likes to <P>


<a name="column_1071"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1071</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>call it that, that is recognised by our legislative authorities. Therefore, what he calls mob rule depends on his view that someone who objected to a transsexual taking part in a religious ceremony would necessarily be bigoted. We all understand that one difficulty about religious freedom is that what is freedom for one may appear to be bigoted to another.
<P>

<a name="40210-10_para2"></a>It is important that this Bill already recognises in paragraph 3 of Schedule 4 the right of a clergyman not to solemnise the marriage of someone whom he reasonably believes has an acquired gender under this Act. That recognises plainly, in an important area, the religious view or attitude of a clergyman. The amendment proposed by my noble friend does not prohibit anyone from taking part in a religious service; it empowers a religious body, if that is required by the doctrines of that body, to make such a provision. It does not oblige any religious body to do so, it provides only for religious freedom.
<P>

<a name="40210-10_para3"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester said that he would go a certain distance with this amendment, but not the whole way. The problem will be that if this amendment is rejected at this stage, it is highly likely that what he wants to happen will be somewhat difficult. I am interested to hear what the Minister will say about that and about the extent to which he is able to give undertakings about it. My understanding of the matter is that the Minister believes that religious freedom may require a religious body to have some sort of protection, but he believes&#151;as his letter to my noble friend seems to suggest&#151;that the secular courts will give that protection in a suitable case.
<P>

<a name="40210-10_para4"></a>This amendment does something that requires serious consideration. If the wording needs to be improved, there is ample scope for that to be done in another place, but the principle of the amendment might well be recognised here. I support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, is right. We have not had a chance to hear the views of Muslims on this Bill. Apart from the last speech, we have not had a chance to hear much of the views of non-conformist Christians, either. Moreover, with all deference to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester, I suggest that his views do not necessarily reflect the views of all Anglicans.
<P>

<a name="40210-10_para5"></a>When the Minister winds up, can he say whether&#151;in the unfortunate event of this amendment being rejected&#151;a woman who becomes a man will be legally entitled to demand to be trained for the Roman Catholic priesthood, and if they pass all the necessary tests and exams, will they be legally entitled to be ordained as a Roman Catholic priest?

<P>
<A NAME="40210-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, those who have followed this Bill from Second Reading through its stages will be aware that, quite properly, we are not coming to these issues for the first time. They have been at the centre of our proper processes of exploration and testing from Second Reading through consideration in Committee and on Report. I say to my noble friend Lord Clarke <P>

Clearly, in what we stand for as a society, irrespective of what the Human Rights Act 1998 says, we are trying to look at two issues at the same time: a belief in the importance of freedom of worship and a very strong belief in the importance of giving legal recognition to an oppressed and ignored minority that is at the centre of this Bill. We have been working and probing with the Churches, both before this Bill came into this House and throughout its passage, the tension between those two areas and how we strike a balance.
<P>

<a name="40210-10_para7"></a>As has been signalled, these issues are not simple; they are not easy. The Churches themselves do not speak with one voice on these matters. Is there any expectation or reason why they necessarily should? I was grateful for the way in which the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester spoke on Report, in putting what seemed to be an important balance on to some of these issues. For some of us, that chimed with what we had expected to hear from faith communities, as well as hearing the sensitive issues about concerns on some of the sharper areas.
<P>

<a name="40210-10_para8"></a>Let me also mark that we have, through the process of reflection, discussion and consultation with faith communities&#151;that process has been both a duty and a privilege&#151;we have sought to listen and to move where we thought it was appropriate. We put into the Bill at First Reading an explicit exemption around marriage for ministers of the Church of England and the Church in Wales. For good reason&#151;when they perform a marriage ceremony, ministers of the Church of England and the Church in Wales are effecting a civil function as well as a religious one. The burdens on them are therefore explicitly strong. Without that exemption they would have been caught. We made that provision explicit so that clergymen were exempt in conscience, if they wished to be so, from any challenge to them if they did not wish to carry out a marriage.
<P>

<a name="40210-10_para9"></a>Since the Bill was introduced, we have gone further and amended the provision to protect further those ministers otherwise obliged to solemnise marriages, extending the conscience clause to a situation where a clergyman reasonably believes that one of the parties to the marriage has been recognised in the acquired gender. We have listened to the arguments put to us and were open to the point that there might be circumstances where a clergyman had reasonable grounds for belief that the information had not been disclosed, and that they were protected in those circumstances if they said, "No, I am sorry, I do not wish to solemnise a marriage for you". In this case, we are talking about Anglican clergy. Therefore, we have been listening. I have been glad to meet the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, and others, along with my officials to explore the issues.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-10_para10"></a>The issues turn on two sets of arguments: moral and legal. I shall be cautious about what I say about the moral arguments, because perhaps government Ministers should confine themselves to the law on such issues. The question of whether religious organisations ought to exclude transsexual people from participation in religious activities is certainly at bottom a moral argument. However, I say from the government Front Bench that one hopes as a society, given the importance that we place on tolerance, that in most situations religious organisations would not wish to discriminate against transsexuals but would recognise the humanity in them and welcome them as part of their faith community. I shall say no more on that.
<P>

<a name="40210-10_para11"></a>It is therefore open to a religious community to decide whether it wishes&#151;I was surprised to hear it&#151;to say that it will refuse to administer Holy Communion to a human being in those circumstances. At heart, however, that is not a matter for me, but for them. It is a matter for me only in my private life, when I have opportunities elsewhere to argue those points.
<P>

<a name="40210-10_para12"></a>On the legal arguments, I shall address first the solemnisation of marriage. The issue at heart is that no minister of religion other than an Anglican clergyman&#151;a Muslim or Baptist minister, for example&#151;is obliged by law to solemnise a marriage. Nothing in the Bill changes that; they are at perfect liberty to continue to refuse to solemnise a marriage of anyone whom they know or believe to be a transsexual. There is no catch to them as regards the freedom of action that they already have. I know from our many discussions that the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, understands that point. Without boring the House by discussing the public function issue in detail, the reason is that, apart from in the Church of England or the Church of Wales, when solemnising a marriage, a cleric would not be considered to be exercising a public function. They are not public authorities in that context; therefore, they are not subject to the obligations of the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="40210-10_para13"></a>The second area of debate is access to facilities. The short answer, on which the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, was clear and crisp, is that the Bill does nothing to change discrimination legislation. It has been a source of criticism from some Benches that it does nothing to change the law. It is a matter of fact that it does nothing to change the law; therefore, discriminatory action that was legal before the enactment of the Bill is still legal afterwards. The current situation whereby a Church might be able to be taken to court by an aggrieved person because it has or has not done something will not change after the Bill has been enacted. I cannot believe that the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, said that in some ways the Churches can never be taken to court as a result of any of their actions. That would be either to reinstate the Church courts or to create a theocracy. That cannot be the argumentation.
<P>

<a name="40210-10_para14"></a>The central point is that the Bill does nothing to change discrimination law. We have explained on several occasions why that is. Essentially, it is about a narrow focus giving legal recognition to a very small <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>group of people after they have gone through a proper process of testing to recognise their change of gender. We have indicated further that the European Union has signalled, under the terms of its draft sex discrimination directive, that it is looking at the issue of sex discrimination across Europe. For good reason, we have said that issues about where discrimination should or should not be allowed to take place should be examined as part of that process, to avoid taking two bites of the cherry. We should be having this debate in the future, not now, as we are not changing the law in this respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. Of course, the noble Lord correctly says that we are not changing the law on sex discrimination. But what he omits to say is that in the past there has never been any dispute as to the sex of persons. We now have a situation where there will be a group of persons who will claim a sex which a number of other people will say is not their sex. That is where the new problem arises without having changed the law on discrimination between male and female.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, for his intervention. I also mark the resolute way in which he has argued his corner throughout the Bill. The short answer is that the Bill does nothing to change the law about discrimination against people as transsexuals. We are talking about discrimination against them as transsexuals rather than discrimination against them on account of their sex. If the noble Lord is patient with me, I shall seek&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. The Minister has said several times that this does not change the law on sex discrimination. But that is not quite right, is it? It changes it in the employment field. The point is that the amendment does not touch employment. It does that by embracing the employment provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act for transsexuals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, at earlier stages, I signalled that employment was different and that it was a specific area. I acknowledge the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, in that respect. In fact, if I had only waited: the present protection exists only in the realm of employment and vocational training. The moral of that is that it is always better to use one's speaking notes than to speak off the cuff.
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para0"></a>It does not extend to participation in religious activities. In effect, it means that the freedom for religious organisations to discriminate against transsexuals sought by this amendment already exists. Many will say that it should not, but that is not what we are debating. In fact, the ability to discriminate is there in law already.
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para1"></a>The Bill ensures that, as a consequence of recognition, a person is protected under sex discrimination law in the acquired gender. However, religious organisations, as in the many examples given, will not be discriminating against a person who has <P>


<a name="column_1075"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1075</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>changed gender on grounds of his or her sex, but on the grounds that he or she is a transsexual person. We do not believe&#151;we are strong in our view that sex discrimination law will restrict the freedom of religious organisations in this matter.
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para2"></a>The noble Baroness suggested that differential treatment of transsexual people might be considered to be sex discrimination. This is on the basis that, for example, a female-to-male transsexual person with a gender recognition certificate would be allowed to use the ladies' toilet facilities, but a male-to-female transsexual person would not. I find it difficult to see that a church would wish the female-to-male transsexual person to use the ladies' toilet, but that is the noble Baroness's assumption. Even if that were the scenario, we do not think that the courts would accept that that was discrimination on the grounds of sex. The courts have demonstrated that they are not prepared to stretch provisions about sex discrimination in order to prohibit action, which is in fact discrimination on a ground other than sex. That would be the case here. What is described is clearly discrimination on the basis of the individual having changed gender.
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para3"></a>Before I move on to the specifics of other issues that were raised, perhaps I may respond explicitly to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Clarke of Hampstead, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester. Previously, I have given undertakings that as part of the Government's process of looking at the application of the shaping of EU legislation and its application into domestic law, we will continue with our close discussions. I repeat that.
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para4"></a>We would be happy to talk with the Churches about the implementation of the legislation when it is passed. The Churches will understand that, as I have signalled previously, that is not to sign a blank cheque, but it is within the broad policy framework that we have signalled. I think that is understood, so I am pleased to give that reassurance.
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para5"></a>I was asked about the sport exemption, which does not exclude transsexual people as a class. It refers only to those people who have a competitive advantage or where there would be a threat to the safety of others. Religious organisations, unlike sporting bodies in this context, are not public bodies and, hence, the Human Rights Act does not apply to them in this way. I could say more, but perhaps we have said it at previous stages.
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para6"></a>In short, nothing in the Bill&#151;with the exception of which the noble Lord, Lord Lester, has reminded me&#151;changes the law on discrimination. It is possible that future law may address those issues, and we shall be pleased to work with the Churches and the faith communities to explore them. We have been pleased to make some significant movement on the Bill in order to address the areas in which we feel there is a just case for the Churches to be listened to. But at the heart of the Bill is the concept of giving legal recognition to a very small number of people who for much of their lives have felt a fundamental discontinuity in their lives. After a proper process of testing, we believe that <P>


<a name="column_1076"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1076</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it is right that the state should give them that legal recognition. I therefore ask the House to reject the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-11_spnew4"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Winchester: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, will he respond to the question from the Cross Benches about the position of a postulant for the Roman Catholic priesthood?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for not having done so previously. If I recollect correctly, the noble Lord, Lord Monson, asked the question. The position is that in the circumstances to which the noble Lord referred, the Roman Catholic Church would be totally at liberty to refuse ordination and would not be open to an action.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-11_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lords who have spoken on the Bill, particularly those who have supported me, and I thank the Minister for his reply.
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para7"></a>I reiterate that my amendment in no way changes the principle of the Bill. It certainly does not attempt to be intolerant. I fear that those who suggest that it will lead to mob rule have not understood where I am coming from. Perhaps I have not made it clear enough. However, I was rather surprised by some of the reaction. I shall not deal with all the points that have been raised, but I should reply to some that were made by noble Lords who object to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para8"></a>First, I believe that the scenario suggested by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester about the patronal festival of St James is unlikely to be covered by this amendment. I feel that the right reverend Prelate should not distract from the purpose of the amendment, which is to provide reassurance and greater legal certainty for the Church. We should concern ourselves with the rights of all religions, both Christian denominations and others, and should protect their freedom to decide what they do in their own churches.
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para9"></a>I turn to the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Lester. His points could be covered by my statement that the Bill is all about balancing rights. I believe that this amendment is necessary to balance the rights of Churches against those of transsexuals. That is not to say that I have anything against transsexuals. I am extremely supportive of the compassionate feeling for them. It is always difficult to be the odd one out. I have known about being the odd one out, though not to such an extent. We can all feel isolated in certain circumstances. Transsexuals can feel isolated, and it is right that we should give them every support. However, it is right that those people who have strong beliefs should also be given support.
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para10"></a>The Bill provides some protection for religious people who believe that your true sex is the sex that you were born with. On issue, a male transsexual is always a man and a female transsexual is always a woman. But the Minister's point that in terms of marriage any church minister or Muslim minister can be protected is not covered by the Bill&#151;only ministers of the Church of England and the Church of Wales are covered.
<P>


<a name="column_1077"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1077</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para11"></a>The Government did not deny that church ministers could be sued if they refused to conduct such marriages, and that is why they seek the inclusion of a conscience clause. I want to strike a balance here. If provision is made for ministers of the Churches of England and Wales, why not for Roman Catholics, Baptists, for other non-conformist Christian denominations, for those of the Jewish and Muslim faiths and all others? The Government now admit that other religious groups could be sued, a point I made earlier. I take the view that other Churches and non-Christian faiths need the protections given to the Churches of England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para12"></a>A recent Law Lords ruling found that a church marriage performs a governmental function. When people get married in church, the Church is acting in place of the state and is therefore open to challenge under human rights legislation. What we are considering today is no academic debate. Instead of a legal argument in your Lordships' House, under the Bill there will be costly legal arguments in the courts. A vote for my amendment is a vote to defend our existing religious freedoms from hostile and expensive litigation.
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para13"></a>Before the Bill was even printed, several Churches had been threatened. I referred to one court case when moving my amendment. A man sued a Church citing sex discrimination legislation. I ask: is access to a ladies' prayer meeting to be defined as "goods and services" under the terms of the sex discrimination Acts? Let us not forget that some of the people who will receive, as they want, gender recognition certificates, rendering their original birth certificates null and void except in the case of the police and criminal prosecution bodies&#151;they have the right to use the original documents&#151;need not have had gender reassignment surgery. It is rather feeble to say that if a male transsexual becomes a woman, he may use the ladies' lavatory and not cause distress. I put it at its simplest.
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para14"></a>The Bill is being used as a means to threaten legal action against Churches. The fundamental question is: are Churches to be protected? The Minister has said no. The Government are prepared to protect sporting bodies, but not Churches. I welcome the Minister's reiteration that there will be ongoing discussion and debate about the Bill, but the Bill will leave this House tonight. What influence will we have? We are not actually "Top of the Pops" for the people down the corridor.
<P>

<a name="40210-11_para15"></a>This Bill enables a battery of legal rights to be deployed against a Church. A secular court will be able to adjudicate on the most precious belief; that of religious belief. The Government say that the Bill is necessary to protect the rights of 5,000 transsexual people. I say again that we all understand their difficulties and we want to see them treated with the utmost compassion. But what about compassion for the millions of people who do not want their most precious religious beliefs trampled upon by the courts?
<P>

<P>

<a name="40210-11_para16"></a>To those who say that they speak for society by supporting the Bill as originally published, I say, look at the postbags of many Members of your Lordships' House. They show the real concern felt among the general public about the issue of religious liberty. To those who approve of the Bill, I say that my amendment does not affect the principle here, it merely gives to Churches the same freedoms which the Government have already given to sporting bodies. I urge noble Lords to vote to protect religious freedoms and I wish to test the opinion of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Marlesford </B>   moved Amendment No. 4.
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Leave out Clause 22.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-12_para1"></a><P>

<a name="40210-12_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am relieved that my amendment is less intellectually complicated and certainly less philosophically challenging than the discussions that we have had. Therefore, I hope that I can speak reasonably briefly to it. The amendment seeks to remove Clause 22 from the Bill. To do so would have no effect on the general purpose of the Bill, which is to give official recognition to those who have changed gender. Indeed, I, like other noble Lords, have great sympathy for those who suffer from the medical condition known as gender dysphoria.
<P>

<a name="40210-12_para3"></a>Clause 22 makes it a criminal offence for certain categories of people to reveal that a person has changed gender. I believe that Parliament should be wary of creating additional criminal offences; there are quite enough already. Each additional offence, before it is passed, should be subjected to certain, rather obvious, tests. First, is it necessary? Secondly, would it achieve the purpose stated? Thirdly, is it enforceable? Fourthly, do the law enforcement agencies have sufficient resources to enforce it?
<P>

<a name="40210-12_para4"></a>I do not believe that Clause 22 is necessary. Those people who come across information on gender change in their official capacities, whether, for example, they be medical people or civil servants, are already bound by ethical conventions, professional rules and laws of confidentiality. No doctor or nurse gossips about his or her patients. Civil servants are bound by the Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1989. Last <P>


<a name="column_1081"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1081</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>week, when we had a brief discussion on this amendment, which I did not then move, the Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Respect for a person's private life means that we must alleviate some of the dangers of humiliation, embarrassment and harassment . . . being reminded of the original gender, being confronted by it regularly, having others knowing that you suffer from the medical condition and knowing that they might be talking about it is [not] conducive to feeling secure".&#151;[Official Report, 3/2/04; col. 665.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-12_para5"></a>
That is absolutely true. Indeed, it applies to many medical conditions, especially sexual or psychological conditions.
<P>

<a name="40210-12_para6"></a>Clause 22 does not deal with that. The Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, very kindly wrote to me yesterday to explain:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Clause 22 only applies when information is acquired in 'an official capacity'. No doubt this does mean that gossip and rumour about a person's gender history can continue and is not unlawful when it is conducted by people who have acquired the information in a private capacity . . . The state should not, for the most part, seek to interfere in the content of conversations that take place between friends and neighbours, in coffee shops and living rooms. Any such prohibition would also be almost impossible to police and it would be very difficult to gather enough evidence for the purposes of a trial".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-12_para7"></a>
Quite so. The clause does not cover malicious gossip, but it does cover a wide range of people, other than civil servants, who might have totally legitimate reasons for needing to know. It covers anyone involved as an employer, or prospective employer, in the slightly quaint words, anybody involved in "the conduct of business".
<P>

<a name="40210-12_para8"></a>If we were talking about employment law on the grounds of gender, as we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and from other noble Lords, we already have legislation to protect from discrimination. In his letter the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, tells me that this clause is required by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="40210-12_para9"></a>Article 8 merely states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-12_para10"></a>
and then goes on to list exemptions from that right. If we were to legislate to enact the very general provisions of Article 8, almost every Bill would need a Clause 22. Clause 22 does not provide privacy protection where it could be needed, but offers it where it is already provided for. In cases in which anyone might wish to enforce the provision, it would difficult to prove the case, and would use considerable resources that are scarce and needed for the protection of people from real crimes. Such resources would probably be used for little purpose. 
<P>

<a name="40210-12_para11"></a>With the best intentions, the Government have got themselves into several muddles over this Bill. Indeed, I suspect that they wish that they had tackled the need, which I accept, for official recognition of gender change by a much simpler administrative action. By removing Clause 22, the Bill would fulfil its intention and be a much better one. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40210-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, it may be helpful if I draw to the attention of the House the fact that the Joint Select Committee on Human Rights <P>


<a name="column_1082"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1082</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>dealt with this matter in our fourth report, when we considered a complaint by the Evangelical Alliance. Those who lead the sort of sad lives that involve reading such documents might be interested to know about the issue. Paragraph 4.38 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Evangelical Alliance argued that the provisions protecting the privacy of those who have acquired a new gender would violate the right of others under ECHR Article 10"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-13_para0"></a>
the free speech guarantee&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to receive truthful information about a person's gender".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-13_para1"></a>
We unanimously&#151;all-party and beyond party&#151;concluded that that argument was unpersuasive.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para2"></a>We first dealt with why Article 10 was not really triggered. We then came to the view that free speech rights had to be balanced against the Article 10 rights of the transsexual person and decided that any court would probably conclude that the clause is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a proportionate response to a pressing social need . . . for the purpose of protecting the right of the transsexual person to respect for his or her private life under that paragraph, as determined in judgments of the European Court of Human Rights".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-13_para3"></a><P>

<a name="40210-13_para4"></a>I listened very carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, and respectfully say that I do not agree with him. This type of provision is particularly necessary in this Bill because we are concerned with respect for the private lives of this small category of vulnerable persons against the possibility of information being transmitted by persons in an official capacity or by employers in an unnecessary or disproportionate way. Clause 22 carefully balances the need to respect personal privacy against other rights and interests, because Clause 22(4) sets out a variety of circumstances in which it would not be an offence to disclose protected information relating to the individual.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para5"></a>I have carefully considered&#151;as has the Joint Select Committee on Human Rights&#151;the way in which the clause is drafted. We believe that the Bill as a whole is designed to promote rather than invade fundamental rights and freedoms. We conclude that the clause strikes a fair balance and is necessary in order to comply with Article 8 of the convention.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, I rise briefly to support my noble friend Lord Marlesford. When the matter was discussed at an earlier stage, fears were aroused that reporters from the tabloid press would go fishing around trying to discover from registrars of births and deaths whether they knew of anyone who fell into the category of transgender persons who had been issued with new birth certificates falsely purporting that they had been born male when they were born female, or vice versa.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para6"></a>The Government have decided that they must ensure as best they can that no registrar or any other person in possession of such information in an official capacity should leak it. I do not know how many noble Lords know very much about the tabloid press. I confess that I have a nodding acquaintance with it&#151;a closer one than the Secretary of State for Defence does, as recent events show. Most of the information that the tabloid press has is picked up in the pub from people who have picked it up somewhere else along the way.
<P>


<a name="column_1083"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1083</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para7"></a>Who will know and be legally empowered to pass on such information? They will be the workmates, friends or the family of such a person. That is the very area where the reporter or stringer from a tabloid paper picks up his information. Above all, Clause 22 will be ineffective in protecting the person. All it will do is punish an official, such as a registrar of births and deaths, for revealing the fact that somebody was born a girl although the birth certificate says that the person was born a boy.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para8"></a>That is it. It is a very heavy sledgehammer to attempt to crack a nut, particularly when the people most likely to discuss such matters and to talk about them to the press are not covered by the clause. The noble Lord is right that the clause is objectionable and needs to be thrown out.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Selsdon: </B>   My Lords, I am a little worried because of the international requirements regarding birth certificates. For example, in the Middle East where I have been many times, one often has to produce one's birth certificate and that of one's parents. If someone changes his birth certificate, it has to be changed all the way back through the line.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para9"></a>I do not want to make a speech like that of the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, on such issues, but it is complicated to know who you are these days. Around the continent of Europe there are only two names. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, would be known as "Falconer, Charlie". His birth certificate would also be required&#151;but he was probably not a Lord at that time&#151;because a passport is not necessarily proof of identity. I have found that because the first part of my name is sometimes given as, "The right", I am known as "Monsieur Right The". The last bit of my title is "of Croydon", so I am called, "Croydon Of"&#151;Of being a Norwegian Christian name.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para10"></a>We therefore need to think right the way through the history of the birth certificate. That applies inevitably to some hereditary Peers whose father at the time of their birth were not called "Lord this or that" because their grandfathers were alive. Once the chain is broken by a change in a birth certificate it could be deemed to be extremely fraudulent in certain countries.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para11"></a>I believe that such a clause should not be necessary because common decency should prevail. It is only when people follow indecent thoughts that decency does not prevail. I am therefore inclined to support my noble friend Lord Marlesford as the provision seems extraordinarily complicated. I wonder whether the Government have thought through the question of proof of identity and the requirement for the birth certificates of two or three generations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, this is the first and only time that I shall speak in this debate. I do so simply to say that I believe that the Bill is entirely unnecessary, and has proved to be divisive. I wish that, in considering the interests of minorities, we might also <P>


<a name="column_1084"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1084</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consider the interests of majorities. Perhaps we ought to have a conglomerate Bill to protect the interests of majorities.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para12"></a>I was surprised when I received a Written Answer to a Question asking the Government to provide information on how many new criminal offences had been instituted and passed by Parliament since 1997, because that information was not kept centrally. In fact, we are going along willy-nilly, making more and more offences and increasing the penalties for offences, but the Government&#151;and probably the previous government as well&#151;simply do not know how many offences there are for people to commit and what offences have had their penalties increased. I find that impossible to believe, but it is unfortunately the truth.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para13"></a>I am concerned about the Bill and the unjoined-up government that brings forward such Bills. I am against the Bill; I have been against the Bill since it had its First Reading. However, I have kept relatively quiet about it because, if I objected to every Bill, I would be up 24 hours a day examining them and making speeches about them, either in Grand Committee or here. I shall concentrate my attention on the amendment, which I shall support for the reasons put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, and others.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para14"></a>The only point that I want to make about the clause is about its subsection (5), which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may by order make provision prescribing circumstances in which the disclosure of protected information is not to constitute an offence under this section".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-13_para15"></a>
That sounds very reasonable&#151;except that everything else that the Government have not thought to put in subsection (5) will be an offence. I would like an explanation from the Minister about what that subsection means. A court that looked at it and the list of offences that are excluded would be bound to conclude that every other possible offence was included. After what I have said, I hope that he will be able to help me on that small matter.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_time0"></a><H5>6 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, those who have contributed to debates on the Bill in its earlier stages will be well aware why the clause matters. In itself, it goes to the heart of why the Bill matters, as it essentially deals with the importance of ensuring&#151;albeit belatedly in the United Kingdom's case&#151;that the gender change of people who have had or have gender dysphoria and have been in that condition for a period of time should, after a proper process of testing, be recognised by the state. We are one of only two members of the European Union that do not do that now, and it is about time that we rectified that.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para16"></a>The clause is an important part of the Bill because the Bill is essentially about trying to allow people who meet its tests to live their lives in peace, quiet and decency in future. There is a limit to what the state can do in that respect, as I signalled in the letter to the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford. However, what we can do, we should do, which is why the clause is in the Bill. <P>


<a name="column_1085"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1085</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Let me set out why it is necessary and why, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester, so clearly said, it is also proportionate to meeting our human rights obligations.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para17"></a>The clause is intended to ensure that the disclosure of personal information without the consent of the person in question must be restricted; if not, we would fail the person's right to respect for private life under Article 8. As the Bill is clearly structured, it signals that all human rights legislation has to strike a balance between one set of rights for one individual with rights and freedoms for others. Therefore the right and freedom in this respect are governed and limited by the prohibitions on disclosure in a number of important respects. The privacy protection does not hamper the detection or investigation of crime; it does not prevent the Criminal Records Bureau from carrying out its functions. The prohibition will not, therefore, assist a transsexual person who is also committed to a life of crime from being identified or detected. Similarly, disclosure is permitted where it is for the purpose of proceedings before a court or tribunal. It is also permitted where it is made in accordance with or by virtue of a statutory provision. Clause 22 will therefore not prevent members of the Civil Service or other public bodies from carrying out their statutory functions.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para18"></a>Clause 22 makes quite clear that disclosure may be made with the consent of the person to whom the information relates. This means that a person may be asked as to his or her gender history and, with his or her agreement, the information may be passed on to others who may need it.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para19"></a>Clause 22 also has another important limit. Not only does it enumerate a list of exceptions that allow disclosure where it is justified in public policy, it also extends only to information that is acquired in an official capacity. Clause 22 does not, therefore, cause harm to the liberty of individuals acting in a private capacity. It does not intrude into the private sphere. It would not be proper for the state to start poking into the content of conversations, as I indicated in the letter that I wrote to the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para20"></a>On the one hand, there is the right of transsexual people to respect for their private lives, their interest in personal security and some level of control over what is sensitive personal information. On the other hand, by including specific exemptions and by staying out of the private sphere, the rights and freedoms of others are protected. Clause 22 and its subordinate limits have been carefully balanced to meet both our obligations under the Human Rights Act and our obligations in terms of decency and the rights of others.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para21"></a>Why does it matter? I can do little better than to draw the House's attention to a tragic article in the Guardian on 12 May. With the leave of the House, I shall refer to it briefly. It is about prejudice against a transsexual who committed suicide as a result of 10 years of prejudice against her. I do not claim that the clause will stop gossip, malice, evil or ordinary human beings from behaving in thoughtless ways that do <P>


<a name="column_1086"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1086</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>damage, but we have an obligation as a state to seek to ensure that public officials or people acting in a public role are not part of that process. In that small and limited way we should so act.
<P>

<a name="40210-13_para22"></a>I will not weary the House, but it is a tragic example of a person who experienced 10 years of harassment, vilification, physical assault and abuse on her house, which eventually drove her to commit suicide. In our small way&#151; this is what the clause does&#151;we have an obligation to act. Therefore I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, will respect why we believe that this is an important measure and that, therefore, we do not support his amendment.

<A NAME="40210-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his comments. I felt, frankly, that he very largely made my case, because he emphasised again the areas that the clause does not cover and that will not be helped by it. He referred to a tragic case which would almost certainly&#151;although I do not know further details&#151;come into that category.
<P>

<a name="40210-14_para0"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, would like to have every Bill with a Clause 22. There can be few examples that he would not be able to give where almost every clause of the Human Rights Act ought to apply if it does not already. Frankly, I was not convinced by the Minister.
<P>

<a name="40210-14_para1"></a>Parliament has been increasingly criticised for its failure to put the executive right. In fact, that is one of the arguments increasingly put forward for the growing power of the media. I believe that in this small example we have the opportunity of correcting a nonsense and removing what I see as an ineffective and profoundly illiberal clause. I therefore invite noble Lords from all parts of the House to join me in the Lobby in removing it.

<P>

<a name="40210-14_para5"></a>Moved, That the Bill do now pass.&#151;(Lord Filkin).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, I shall be brief. First, I express my thanks, especially to the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, and his colleagues on the Front Bench. The Bill is highly contentious and quite emotive, and I greatly appreciated the courtesy and good humour with which it was debated in the Chamber; and, occasionally, the even greater humour with which it was debated just outside the door, I must confess.
<P>

<a name="40210-14_para6"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will not think that I am misquoting him, for I cite from memory rather than Hansard, when I say that at the end of Second Reading, he declined to argue with me because he saw my objections to the Bill as being objections of principle and therefore incapable of being moved. That is rather a pity; we should sometimes try to change people's minds over objections in principle. In many ways, we should try harder at that. The noble Lord rarely dealt with the arguments for the numerous amendments that I moved. It was not a discourse of the deaf: we heard and understood each other; but, all too often, we did not really engage in debate about the issues.
<P>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column 1089</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-14_para7"></a>On secular grounds, I objected to a law that requires a public servant to certify as true that which is not true. That is not that a person may have changed sex. Whether that is possible is a matter of debate, but it is not open to debate that if a child is certified at birth as female and subsequently gives birth, the odds are heavily that she was born a girl. A subsequent sex change may or may not be real, but it cannot change the fact of her birth. The Bill purports that that fact can be changed and requires a public servant to certify that it has happened, when clearly it has not. The Bill is unchanged not only from Second Reading but from First Reading in that respect.
<P>

<a name="40210-14_para8"></a>On grounds of common sense, I objected to the fact that the Bill would allow the marriage of two persons, each bearing the chromosomes, genitalia and gonads of the same sex, provided only that one of them believed&#151;and persuaded a panel of experts to believe&#151;that he or she had changed sex. My amendment on that matter was rejected.
<P>

<a name="40210-14_para9"></a>On religious&#151;or, perhaps I should say, Church&#151;grounds, I found myself greatly in agreement with my noble friend Lady O'Cathain on a number of amendments that she moved, all of which were rejected. I find it disturbing that sport seems in Ministers' minds to need more protection than religion. It seems to me that it is bishops rather than footballers who are an endangered species these days.
<P>

<a name="40210-14_para10"></a>Lastly, I say again how sorry I am that we have not heard the voice of Islam in our debates. I think that, with the sole exception of sport, the Bill is now as bad a Bill as it was when it was introduced to the House. I therefore object to it and will ask the House to reject it.

<P>
<A NAME="40210-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I shall be very brief. At Second Reading, I did not say that I would not engage with the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit&#151;I and others, especially my noble friends Lord Winston and Lord Turnberg, engaged with him brilliantly on the central issue of the difference between sex and gender. Essentially, I was saying that there is a limit to how much time I will spend&#151;his time or that of the House. I was not optimistic that a man of his firmness of opinion was likely to be swayed by my puny argumentation. We have done justice to his issues, particularly at Report around that central issue.
<P>

<a name="40210-15_para0"></a>The central thrust of the case of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, was that one's chromosomes are the beginning and the end of the story. The Bill does not seek to rewrite history. It does not seek to say that what was recorded at birth is not a historical fact. That is a historical fact; it is kept and it is recorded. The Bill recognises that in very limited circumstances, for a very limited number of people&#151;after a proper process of testing, through medical opinion, advice and process test&#151;it is right for the state to give recognition of a change of gender. The Bill does no more than that, but it is right that it does that.
<P>

<a name="40210-15_para1"></a>We have spoken a number of times about sport. For the reasons that I gave not five minutes ago, we have been persuaded that there was a need to strengthen the protection on sport. That is all that we sought to do, and I am glad that we have done it.
<P>

<P>

<a name="40210-15_para2"></a>We have just had a debate on religion. There is no point in me repeating that debate at this point. I took some small comfort that, on an issue that was so central to the Church, of those Members sitting on the Bishops' Benches who were present in the Chamber, three of them voted with the Government on the amendment. The calumnies that have sometimes been put about that we have been riding roughshod over the sensitivities of organised religion are untrue.
<P>

<a name="40210-15_para3"></a>I will say no more, because it is for the House to decide this issue, rather than my persuasion. I commend the Bill to the House.

<A NAME="40210-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I apologise to the Committee for intervening at a late stage in the Committee's deliberations, but I have a serious reservation about Section 36 and Schedule 8 of the Electricity Act 1989, which I shall explain.

<P>
<A NAME="40210-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   Before I was interrupted, I was about to say that the amendment moved by the noble Baroness rightly referred to Sections 36 and 37 of the Electricity Act 1989. I support what the noble Baroness said, but I would like to go a little further. That Bill was passed when I sat on the Opposition Front Benches. I opposed and still oppose this particular section.
<P>

<a name="40210-16_para1"></a>I shall be brief. Section 36, accompanied by Schedule 8, of the Electricity Act allows the Secretary of State to overrule almost every planning decision, when an installation with an installed capacity of 50 megawatts is presented to him or her. I do not need to go on about mid-Wales and wind farms, but we had a case where the local council, which is entitled under Schedule 8 to require a public inquiry, voted&#151;for all sorts of reasons that I will not go into now, but which are quite obvious if one knows Ceredigion&#151;not to demand a public inquiry on an enormous installation in the Cambrian hills. The Minister of Energy, as he was then, overrode any objections from the National Assembly for Wales, which has no powers to require a public inquiry, and simply passed the matter.
<P>

<a name="40210-16_para2"></a>If Clause 90 in the present Bill sets out to regulate the conditions under which offshore installations should be regulated, I do not see why&#151;failing repeal, which I would like, of Section 36 of the Electricity Act and Schedule 8&#151;that should not become part of this Bill for onshore installations as well as offshore installations.

<P>
<A NAME="40210-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, has, in a sense, taken my subject. I also have a real concern about Sections 36 and 37 of the Electricity Act 1989, but for a slightly different reason. I came to it almost by accident because I happened to read the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill at precisely the same time. If one reads Clause 150 of the Bill that we are considering and&#151;I believe&#151;Clause 44 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill, which is being dealt with on the Floor of the House, one finds that the wording of the two clauses in the two Bills is almost identical. I thought, "Hang on a minute, what's going on here?". What is going on is that the electricity industry apparently has its own planning system.
<P>

<a name="40210-16_para3"></a>It seems to me that the real issue behind this is very serious, although I understand more or less how it came about. A lot of history is involved, and I wanted <P>


<a name="column_GC485"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC485</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to deal with the matter and go into the background when we debated the Question whether Clause 150 shall stand part of the Bill. However, the real issue&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has been forewarned&#151;is whether it is appropriate for a government department that is, in a sense, a promoting department for a planning application to be judge and jury in its own case. I have gone back as far as the Town and Country Planning Act 1962, and I have not got to the bottom of it yet. It appears that the system dates back to when there were public utilities, and it was deemed appropriate for the relevant Secretary of State to grant permission to his own department. So far as I can make out, that is more or less the background to the issue.
<P>

<a name="40210-16_para4"></a>For heaven's sake, we are now in the 21st century; we are not in the middle of the 20th century. In any other sector of life, this type of conflict of interest would require, at the least, a huge and very strong Chinese wall to be built&#151;so huge and so strong that no one could get through it, under it or over it. Apparently, we do not have that, and there is still a duality of planning systems. I would rather deal with the matter when we debate the Question whether Clause 150 shall stand part of the Bill. However, it is relevant to this amendment, which touches on those clauses. I believe that a very serious&#151;almost constitutional&#151;dilemma lies behind the issue, and it is one that we need to consider.
<P>

<a name="40210-16_para5"></a>Apart from that, I believe that the noble Baroness is correct and she should be supported for the way in which she has raised the detail of the issue. However, somewhere and somehow, we need to get away from the system, if we can, and separate what I would call the generality of planning judgments in the planning system from the generality of the electricity industry, which is now privatised and should be in the same position as other industries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   Would the noble Lord agree with separating planning decisions from the executive?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Yes, precisely. I could not have put it better.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-16_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My noble friend says that he would rather deal with the matter under Clause 150. He is talking about an extremely important issue, but that clause does not apply to Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I might have known that the Scots would have an advantage somewhere.

I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, for providing the background to the matter. He has been involved in this area far longer than I have.
<P>

<a name="40210-16_para6"></a>If the Minister is inclined to reply in the same vein as he did last week&#151;that is, by saying that the issue will be dealt with by regulations somewhat later in the year&#151;I sense that the Committee will be very <P>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC486</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unhappy, because we are raising fairly fundamental issues. Of course, I shall wait to hear the Minister's reply, but I sense that the Committee will be keen to see this measure in the Bill. Will the Government reconsider the process in the light of the comments about the DTI being judge and jury of the applications rather than simply expecting us to be happy with regulations? Noble Lords on these Benches and the noble Baroness, Lady Byford&#151;we have encountered it with several Bills&#151;are not happy with that way of dealing with matters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-16_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  Somewhat wider issues have been raised in the debate, but the amendments as such would require the Secretary of State to make regulations to amend the Act; they do not spell out in any detail how those regulations should be drafted. As for whether they should apply onshore as well as offshore, Clause 80 is relevant only offshore and makes no changes to Schedule 8 that would affect any onshore applications.
<P>

<a name="40210-16_para7"></a>The issue that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, raised&#151;it was reflected in other comments&#151;concerned the powers of the Secretary of State in relation to planning for electricity generating stations. Clearly, there has to be a different balance here than there is between the planning system and central government in relation to housing development or commercial development, as we have a national energy policy that has to observe all kinds of national criteria. We believe, broadly speaking, that the current balance is correct.
<P>

<a name="40210-16_para8"></a>I shall address the terms of the amendment, which is what I tried to do the other night. The department is already proposing to bring forward within a few months separate proposals to amend the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985. That Act indirectly incorporates parts of the Electricity Act that we are talking about. The proposed amendments to regulations will meet our obligations under the environmental impact assessment directive. Hitherto, we have not met those obligations through statute or secondary legislation; they have been met by a combination of administrative practice and reliance on similar regulations under other legislation. It is important that we tidy that up.
<P>

<a name="40210-16_para9"></a>The drafting of the regulations is well advanced. Not only do they make provision for changes that embrace those set out in the amendments&#151;as distinct from what anyone has said in the debate&#151;but they apply them to the generality of projects to which the directive applies, rather than restricting them to energy-related applications. The food and environment legislation has a wider remit than just electricity supply.
<P>

<a name="40210-16_para10"></a>The changes to Clause 90 proposed by the noble Baroness would duplicate in a piece of partial legislation dealing with energy something that we are addressing more comprehensively under the forthcoming proposed changes to FEPA.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-16_para11"></a>Amendment No. 109D would also introduce changes to FEPA. It would extend the current provision whereby an applicant can make representations about the decision taken by the licensing authority to refuse to grant a licence or about any terms and conditions which may be attached to a licence granted. The right to make such representations is restricted solely to the applicant. The amendment would extend the provisions such that when the licensing authority takes action to constitute a committee to consider representations from an applicant, it shall serve notice on all regulators and other specified public bodies exercising functions in the area and invite them to make similar representations to the committee. That would give a much wider range of potential engagement.
<P>

<a name="40210-16_para12"></a>Under the proposed regulations to which I referred in relation to the first of the amendments, consideration is already being given to how the representations procedure might be revised to make it more broad-based and inclusive. Therefore, we consider that that is the context in which any change in the pattern of representations should be addressed&#151;in the regulations to FEPA, rather than in an amendment to a specific clause of this Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="40210-17_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I wonder whether I could add my concerns. The noble Baroness was right in saying that she would have my support. The Minister said that the drafting was well advanced&#151;if I have got his words exactly&#151;and that it would generally apply to other remits as well, which I believe that we would accept. However, if it is generally well advanced, why can it not be put into the Bill now? It would not mean that it would not go in generality into the slot that the Government had in mind. What precludes the Government from introducing it into the Bill at this stage?
<P>

<a name="40210-17_para0"></a>In that way, I support the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, and hope that the Government will at least give a second thought to the matter. Unless the Minister's words were not quite correct, that is something that they have considered. I urge the noble Baroness to consider what the Minister has said and perhaps press the matter more forcefully at a later stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for acknowledging that there is at least a problem. The problem that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and I set out is that one cannot have the executive being judge and jury. If the Government, who on most occasions I support, wish to devolve government to Wales and to local authorities, the planning process must take priority. All that the Government should then do is say that they have an agenda and that in the course of the planning applications that agenda will be considered&#151;but it will not be considered at the expense of destroying half the landscape of mid-Wales, nor at the expense of destroying a number of birds in the Irish Sea.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-17_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank the noble Lords who have spoken. We were led to table the two amendments by the fact that we do not have a marine Act. The amendment is necessary because of the range of legislation applying to the marine environment. There are many Acts, as listed, that the Bill will have to take into account, but no spatial planning framework against which those Acts can be measured. Our lives in this Committee would be so much simpler if there were such a marine Act. In its absence, and without an amendment such as Amendment No. 109C, it is difficult to see how the applications will work&#151;notwithstanding the Minister's comment that regulations will be introduced, which gives me fairly cold comfort, because we cannot see them before us now.
<P>

<a name="40210-17_para2"></a>The other debate that we considered is very interesting, and I look forward to returning to it.

It will require that the Secretary of State has regard to environmental matters when considering applications made. Most, if not all, offshore renewable installations, both inside and <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>outside the territorial waters, will require consent not only under Section 36 or 37 of the Electricity Act 1989, but under Section 34 of the Coast Protection Act. However, the Coast Protection Act may not pay&#151;I believe it does not, unless the Minister tells me differently&#151;sufficient regard to environmental issues. Where is it more important for applications to be subject to that kind of consideration than in our marine environment?
<P>

<a name="40210-17_para7"></a>Amendment No. 109F would require the development of rules determining how applications under the Coast Protection Act 1949 that relate to offshore renewable energy installations should be made and considered. It is surprising that we have a Bill before us allowing offshore installations, but no idea of how applications should be made and considered. Therefore, the amendment would bring in a clear definition of the types of matters that should be considered during the course of an application. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   On Wednesday of last week, we had an interesting discussion on the issue of bringing ashore energy and the point at which one had to consider whether, where and how the planning system becomes relevant. The amendment introduces another aspect of that problem.
<P>

<a name="40210-17_para8"></a>The electricity industry will always have the option of trying to bring ashore electricity if there is already a major power station on the coast. That will unquestionably simplify the situation, especially when one considers Sizewell or Dungeness. One can think of a number of places where it would be relatively straightforward to bring major power lines ashore. Of course, the planning regulations will still apply at the low-tide mark, as we learnt from the Minister last week, so one would have to go through the system. The issue of wider environmental problems certainly needs to be considered, particularly any question&#151;it is difficult to believe that there would be any question&#151;of possible interference with navigation rights and so on.
<P>

<a name="40210-17_para9"></a>That all illustrates how wonderfully complex is the system through which we are trying&#151;constructively, I hope&#151;to work our way. We all want the new system to work and to work well in everyone's interests. We have to fit it into an existing legislative framework that is immensely complex. We have to get the balance right. Although I would like to see far less legislation and regulation, if we do not get the matter right we shall be blamed by the public. We need to consider the noble Baroness's amendment with care.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   Perhaps I can pick up the point that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, just made. Plainly, we are dealing with matters of some complexity. I suppose my instinct on such occasions is to see whether it is at all possible to inject a degree of simplicity&#151;not simple-mindedness.

<A NAME="40210-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I shall risk believing that my appeal for greater simplicity had been made before we adjourned for the Division. The point I wanted to make by way of introduction is that the more duplication we have between a number of interfacing Bills, the less likely it is to be intelligible to anybody. That is quite likely to be a problem that Members of the Committee share.
<P>

<a name="40210-17_para11"></a>None the less, I shall deal with the issues quite properly raised in the amendments. Amendment No. 109E would put certain set procedures into Section 34 of the Coast Protection Act, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, said. It has none of those provisions at present. Subsection (2A) seeks a statutory instrument to spell out how applicants should submit their applications and what documents they would have to provide, the process for considering the application and who will be statutorily consulted, and how appeals against refusal to consent or perhaps even against approval for consent can be made. Subsection (2B) proposes that a statutory instrument under subsection (2A) shall be subject to the negative resolution procedure in the House.
<P>

<a name="40210-17_para12"></a>From reading these amendments and the original clauses, I am fairly clear that there is no need to set out this procedure under the Coast Protection Act, as doing so would, in this case, serve only to duplicate the procedures that already exist in Schedule 8 of the Electricity Act 1989.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-17_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank the Minister very much for giving way. Perhaps I could explain more clearly why I think that this is necessary so that if he thinks it relevant, he can include it in his reply.
<P>

<a name="40210-17_para13"></a>It is not simply that under the Coast Protection Act the Secretary of State does not have to take account of the environment. Section 34(3) of the Act defines when the Secretary of State may refuse an application&#151;when it will cause or is likely to cause obstruction or danger to navigation. In other words, he cannot refuse it just because it will be damaging to the environment. That is probably the most important point. If it came to it, I wonder whether the licence applicant could challenge any decision of the Secretary of State to refuse an application on environmental grounds under the original Act, because it defines so exactly the only grounds he has for refusal.

<A NAME="40210-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I intend to cover that ground in the course of my reply. If noble Lords feel I have not done so, no doubt they will raise the matter again.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para0"></a>I was making the point that the procedures already in Schedule 8 of the Electricity Act 1989 need not be duplicated. They are a strong set of procedures which we are confident will do a great deal of the work that is suggested in the amendment, notwithstanding the desire I have just heard to repeal or at least to modify Schedule 8 of the Electricity Act. However, I speak on the basis that the schedule is in existence, that it has <P>


<a name="column_GC491"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC491</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provisions, and that those provisions need to be considered when we decide on the adequacy of the legislation we have. I wonder whether I could explain the argument a little more fully and respond to some of the points that have been made when I reach Amendment No. 109F.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para1"></a>The proposed changes would add considerable confusion rather than greater simplicity to the Coast Protection Act consents process. It would result in two different routes for developments that required consent under the Electricity Act and those that did not. That would be difficult to administer in practice and would obscure the Secretary of State's clear role in considering Coast Protection Act applications. There would be plain confusion between the two routes.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para2"></a>Amendment No. 109F seeks to impose a duty on the Secretary of State for Transport to have regard to the conservation of the marine environment when considering applications for consent under Section 34 of the Coast Protection Act 1949 that are also applications for consent under Sections 36 or 37 of the Electricity Act. I hope to reassure the Committee that the proposed amendment is not necessary. It adds no further provision to those already in existence under the requirements of the Electricity Act and would only duplicate the existing procedures.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para3"></a>Developers of offshore renewable energy projects are required to apply for consent under Section 36 of the Electricity Act, as well as requiring consent under Section 34 of the Coast Protection Act. The purpose of the Coast Protection Act consent is to ensure that proper consideration is given to the potential impact on navigational safety. The Electricity Act consent is subject to a requirement that an application for development consent for an offshore renewable energy installation must be accompanied by a comprehensive environmental impact assessment, which is set out in the Electricity Works (Environmental Impact Assessment) (England and Wales) Regulations 2000. I repeat the point&#151;I hope the Committee does not feel that I am labouring it&#151;that there must be a comprehensive environmental impact assessment at that stage and under that procedure.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para4"></a>Once a renewable energy zone has been designated, the regulations will be extended to apply to consents for development within it. The environmental impact assessment must consider the project in its entirety. It must do precisely that which we have been asked that it should do. The regulations make it clear that the environmental impact assessment must be comprehensive in its coverage and would routinely include all the aspects identified in subsections 3B(a), (b) and (c) of the proposed amendment.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para5"></a>While the requirement of the environmental impact assessment arises from the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry's responsibility, consideration of the environmental statement is shared by all departments with an interest, including the Department of Transport, in relation to the impact on navigational safety, and Defra, in relation to the impact on the marine environment. Statutory consultation procedures ensure that advice from all appropriate <P>


<a name="column_GC492"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC492</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bodies is taken into account in the Secretary of State's determination of an Electricity Act consent application. I do not think that the proposed amendment would add anything to the process, which we believe is fully comprehensive. The existing procedures provide for a certain degree of administrative streamlining in the consultation process, and, as I said at the beginning, they avoid duplication, which the amendment would create by having consultees asked the same question twice by two separate departments.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para6"></a>I should stress that the most crucial point in the consent process is not who "owns" the consultation process, but that all the right people are consulted during the process and that their views are considered fully by the right people. That is exactly how the process works. Consultation responses are assessed by the department with appropriate policy responsibility, so that the Department of Transport considers the issues relating to navigational safety, Defra provides advice on the potential impact on the marine environment. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Secretary of State for Transport do not consider applications and the advice from consultees in isolation from one another, but together.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para7"></a>All relevant factors are taken into account in reaching a decision. It would not, for example, be possible for a wind farm developer to have an Electricity Act consent and not a Coast Protection Act consent. If there were overriding reasons why one of the consents could not be granted, the development would not be able to proceed. On that basis, I hope that I can persuade noble Lords that the amendments are not necessary. This may be one of those occasions when avoiding further duplication will be of great merit to those who will have to find their way through the issue in reality and practice.

<A NAME="40210-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   On a technical point, the Section 36 route deals only with the need for permission to generate above a permitted capacity&#151;that is, 50 megawatts. Let us suppose that some devious-minded person comes along with a series of 40-megawatt capacity generating fields and separates them suitably. Who will have to give permission for that, because it is outwith Section 36?

<A NAME="40210-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I am happy to be able to answer that point instantly. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, bowled me a googly there, but happily it was wide. Offshore wind farms are one megawatt by statutory instrument.

<P>

<a name="40210-18_para8"></a>I can still see some difficulties arising from all the parallel processes that the Minister described. I can well understand his point that the processes should not <P>

I intend to read carefully what the Minister said and, if I return to the issue, it will be with the idea of making it clear how such a parallel process can come together. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40210-18_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </B>   moved Amendment No. 109H:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 76, line 1, at beginning insert "Subject to subsections (3) to (11),"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-18_para16"></a><P>

<a name="40210-18_para17"></a>The noble Baroness said: This may appear to be a rather fearsome group of amendments. I have grouped them together because they all deal with particular aspects of the decommissioning programme. I thought that it might be for the convenience of the Committee if we discussed all aspects of the decommissioning programme, which takes us into Chapter 2 of the Energy Bill, at the same time. Therefore, I shall briefly run through the purpose of the amendments, and I hope that we shall then be able to debate the generality of the decommissioning programme.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para18"></a>The amendments would give the Secretary of State a duty to serve a notice on offshore renewable energy installation applicants to produce a decommissioning programme, as specified in the notice. The requirement to produce a decommissioning programme applies only to installations in the marine environment. Of course, in Part 1 of the Bill we spent a long time discussing nuclear decommissioning. We can appreciate how important it is to think in detail about decommissioning before agreeing to something. Therefore, I feel strongly about this part of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para19"></a>The amendments would require applicants to consult relevant competent authorities and others where specified, such as English Nature, the Countryside Council for Wales and Scottish Natural Heritage, before submitting the programme to the Secretary of State for approval. In addition, applicants would need to include within their programme details of how it would be financed. Looking back to Part 1 of the Bill, I appreciate that decommissioning offshore wind installations is not likely to be as expensive as nuclear, but it is an important consideration.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para20"></a>It is important that a duty on applicants to have a decommissioning programme exists, to avoid the possibility of redundant offshore installations or parts thereof being left in the marine environment when they have reached the end of their operating life. I believe <P>


<a name="column_GC494"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC494</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the view of the DTI is that there is already a decommissioning programme for such installations which is working well&#151;that may be the case&#151;but that is not set down in statute. These amendments would put that on the face of the Bill and ensure that duties are applied consistently into the future&#151;for example, for the life of the installations. The current lack of a provision in the Bill requiring decommissioning of installations is contrary to Article 60 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which I shall not read out as I am sure noble Lords are aware of it.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para21"></a>To ensure that the requirement for a decommissioning scheme is not seen as a deterrent to those applying to develop offshore renewables, the Secretary of State would serve a notice only when consent had been given for a scheme to proceed or when it was clear that a scheme was very likely to proceed.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para22"></a>I understand that the current wording in the Energy Bill which states that the Secretary of State "may"&#151;rather than "shall"&#151;issue a notice to require production of a decommissioning programme, is phrased to reflect that, in some cases, it might be the responsibility of the Welsh Assembly to issue such a notice. However, that is far from explicit in the Bill. I look forward to the Minister clarifying that particular point. Imposing a duty on the Secretary of State as envisaged in the amendment does not appear to cut across any responsibilities of the Welsh Assembly. Further clarification from the Minister would be helpful.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para23"></a>Amendment No. 110B would allow the Secretary of State to choose whether to require the submission of a new decommissioning programme if he rejects an earlier such programme. One programme may be deemed not to be satisfactory, and he may need to require a new one. It would be a nonsense if he were to turn down an existing programme but have no powers to require the commission of a new programme.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para24"></a>Amendment No. 110C would impose a duty on the Secretary of State to publish decommissioning programmes after approval. That is an important point&#151;given transparency&#151;so that everyone is clear what is happening. A number of people may be affected by decommissioning programmes. I believe it is extremely important that the Bill requires any approved programme to be made available for public inspection. If there have been substantial changes to the original submitted programme, any revised programme should equally be publicised and available for public inspection. I do not believe that the Bill as drafted covers that point.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para25"></a>Amendment No. 110D would impose a duty on the Secretary of State to publish details of a decommissioning programme that he has developed. That is fairly self-explanatory. Amendment No. 110E would impose a duty on the Secretary of State to consult relevant bodies when developing his own decommissioning programme. At present Clause 93 of the Bill requires the Secretary of State to consult Scottish Ministers where an installation is within Scottish waters before making a decision concerning <P>


<a name="column_GC495"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC495</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the decommissioning programme. However, as far as I can see, there are no other requirements in the Bill concerning a wider consultation of relevant competent authorities&#151;for example, English Nature, the Government's adviser on the marine environment, or the Countryside Council for Wales. I believe that these amendments will address that shortcoming.
<P>

<a name="40210-18_para26"></a>Finally, Amendments Nos. 110F and 110G would impose a duty on the Secretary of State to consult relevant interests concerning proposals to amend a decommissioning programme. That is a small point, but it could be substantially amended and would not be subject to consultation with the relevant bodies whose advice should reasonably be sought. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I wonder whether I could invite the Minister, in replying to the amendments, to explain the background to this a little more. Early in my career in the House, we carried out an examination of the problems of decommissioning the oil rigs. It is a matter of fact and misfortune that at that time, the decommissioning of oil rigs and the undersea pipelines was not adequately taken into account at the time of their installation. It is good that decommissioning is being considered at the point of installation in the Bill, because it is very important.
<P>

<a name="40210-19_para0"></a>If I understand the construction of these wind turbines in the sea bed correctly, it seems that the bases are likely to have a much longer life than the pylons and generators on top. I may be incorrect about that, but I would be delighted if I were. I would be delighted to know that once a base was installed, it might see through three or four generations on the top before it had to be taken out of the sea bed. They are, fortunately, fairly simple structures; if they can be knocked into the sea bed, it would be nice to feel that they could be extracted. Can the Minister advise us whether that is so? I rather assume that it is, which will leave a clean sea bed. But if there is any question of their having to be cut off, leaving a residue, that could be most unfortunate. However, some might think that if the sea bed was left rough and fishermen could not get at it again, that would be a positive advantage.
<P>

<a name="40210-19_para1"></a>These are peripheral issues. The other factor I remember regarding the oil industry investigation was that originally the oil rigs were thought to have a particular life, as were the oil pipelines. There was particular concern that whatever happened to the oil rigs, the oil pipelines should be left in situ because developments in oil extraction techniques would mean that the pipelines could subsequently be used again if it were possible to extract more oil from the fields. Oil extraction is not a 100 per cent process&#151;it has its built-in inefficiency, if I can put it like that. I do not know whether the same consideration would apply in this case. Clearly, we could continue building new wind farms on the sites of old wind farms for a very long time. It is probably not so much a question of decommissioning as of ensuring that the original specification and the quality of the installation is sufficiently robust to have a much longer life span than the presumed life span of the original installation.
<P>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC496</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-19_para2"></a>These are significant considerations, and I would be most grateful if the Minister could give us the Government's thinking on the background.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, for recognising the importance of this aspect of the framework for consents&#151;decommissioning is an important dimension of it. Very important international obligations are involved as well&#151;the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea requires that any installation which is abandoned or disused should be removed to ensure the safety of navigation. Such a removal is to have due regard to fishing as well as the protection of the marine environment. So there are a lot of complicated requirements under the convention which, admittedly, only applies in our case to installations in the renewable energy zone. Of course, we would want to ensure that all sites, wherever they were located, were subject to similar standards in relation to decommissioning.
<P>

<a name="40210-19_para3"></a>The UN Convention itself is not prescriptive about how a contracting state is obliged to carry out its obligations. We believe that the Bill gives us a scheme which is efficient, which provides the controls necessary to ensure that installations are decommissioned, and sets appropriate standards including environmental standards and protection for the various elements to which I have referred. It also builds in an appropriate level of consultation. I believe that the way in which we have approached the issue is sufficient. We do not want a process that is unnecessarily slow, cumbersome and inflexible. There are aspects of the noble Baroness's amendments that would have that effect or would lead us significantly in that direction.
<P>

<a name="40210-19_para4"></a>On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, as to whether we are dealing with decommissioning of the installation at the top or underneath, and whether we could add more powerful machines at some later stage, we probably could do so in most circumstances. However, a new Section 36 consent would be required in those circumstances, so the issue of decommissioning or adding arises at all points when changing the nature of the installation.
<P>

<a name="40210-19_para5"></a>As for the process, which is what the amendments deal with, Amendment No. 109J would take away the discretionary nature of the power of the Secretary of State to issue a notice requiring a person to submit a decommissioning plan. Instead, the Secretary of State would be obliged so to do in all cases. The discretion provided by the Bill is not an attempt on our part to slide out from under our obligation under international law but to give the Secretary of State a degree of flexibility. We expect that all installations will be decommissioned using the statutory scheme. However, there may be rare circumstances when it may be more appropriate to use other routes to achieve the same end. For example, renewable energy installations that have already received development consent are subject to separate decommissioning requirements, and it is not our intention to undo those <P>


<a name="column_GC497"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC497</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>arrangements. There may be other circumstances in future in which we would not want the power to be too rigid.
<P>

<a name="40210-19_para6"></a>The next group of amendments deals with the issue of consultation. We agree that consultation is important, but it is also important to ensure that the process does not become too bogged down. The Secretary of State will need to consult under the regulations made under Clause 98. Those regulations will set important standards, particularly in respect of environmental matters. The Secretary of State has a duty at Clause 98(5) to consult. She can also require the person who has the duty to submit a decommissioning programme to consult whoever she directs him to consult. Our intention is certainly that there should be such consultation, and our statutory advisers would be obvious candidates for inclusion in the list. However, we need a measure of flexibility, so that when it is not necessary to consult the developer is not forced to go through an unnecessary exercise.
<P>

<a name="40210-19_para7"></a>I note that the noble Baroness's amendment seeks to install its own flexibility by requiring consultation with the "competent authority" only,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"so far as reasonably practicable".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-19_para8"></a>
That seems to build in a possible loophole. The amendment would mean that the Secretary of State would have to designate those whom the developer should consult. I do not believe that it is necessary for the Secretary of State to consult when a programme is modified; the modification can in some circumstances be a very minor one. It is also important to bear in mind that the Secretary of State has a duty to review the decommissioning programme, under the terms of the clauses.
<P>

<a name="40210-19_para9"></a>Clause 95 also deals with situations in which a project is sold on and the provisions are designed to ensure there is a smooth transition. I am not sure what separate form of consultation is needed in these circumstances. I do not believe that it is necessary to impose an obligation on the Secretary of State to consult when she herself has prepared the programme, in accordance with the standards already laid down in the regulations, which include the consultation. Of course, there is nothing to stop the Secretary of State engaging in wider consultation but I do not believe that it would be necessary to do so for something on which there has been consultation in the course of drawing up the regulations.
<P>

<a name="40210-19_para10"></a>In relation to these clauses, the noble Baroness raised the issue of the Welsh Assembly. The Welsh Assembly is not given powers under this part of the Bill to issue a notice requiring the submission of a decommissioning programme. The Welsh Assembly already has devolved powers under the Transport and Works Act which can be used to give consent for offshore wind farms. Part of that consent could be to include decommissioning arrangements as a condition of such consent. That is a matter for the Welsh Assembly and its existing powers. We would not use this clause to override them.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-19_para11"></a>Amendment No. 110ZF places a specific obligation on the developer to provide certain information in support of his decommissioning programme, whereas the existing text states that the Secretary of State may require such information. Again, it is a discretionary power which may not be needed if that information is already held.
<P>

<a name="40210-19_para12"></a>Amendment No. 110B tries to complicate the position as regards the provision of new or revised decommissioning programmes. It overlooks the provisions that are already in Clause 94 where the Secretary of State decides to prepare her own decommissioning programme.
<P>

<a name="40210-19_para13"></a>On publication of programmes, Amendments Nos. 110C and 110D would require the Secretary of State to publish approved decommissioning programmes. I believe that that degree of requirement is unnecessary. Our intention is that the developers themselves should put approved decommissioning programmes on their websites for public inspection. I do not envisage a problem in that respect.
<P>

<a name="40210-19_para14"></a>Amendment No. 110ZE deals with environmental pollution and requires that there should be no environmental pollution when offshore installations are decommissioned. A more reasonable approach is to ensure that environmental pollution is reduced to the minimum. Clause 98(2) provides for regulations that will address the issue of environmental pollution relating to standards of decommissioning and safety. I believe that these amendments over-complicate the situation by removing discretion from the process. The process itself is fairly robust. I would advise the noble Baroness not to pursue the amendments.

<A NAME="40210-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I assure the Minister that I have absolutely no wish to make the process slow, cumbersome or over-complicated. I shall read carefully what he has said about the details of my amendments concerning publishing information, consultation, and so on. Despite his explanation, the more difficult area for me to understand is why there should be such a degree of discretion about the very basic principle that the Secretary of State may require an applicant to submit a decommissioning programme. I do not feel that the Bill has the right emphasis. The word "may" is very wishy-washy. Given what the Minister has said about the need for discretion, I would have felt more comfortable with the words "shall" or "unless a set of circumstances". As it stands, the Bill comes down heavily on the side of discretion and very little on the side of obligation. I expect to return to this matter on Report. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40210-20_para0"></a><P>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC499</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>regard to the existence and terms of any other decommissioning programme in respect of a relevant object, with a view to minimising additional costs or obligations of decommissioning."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40210-20_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: With this amendment, we are talking about the requirement to prepare decommissioning programmes. Clause 92 gives the Secretary of State a discretionary power to impose an obligation on various persons to submit a costed decommissioning programme for renewable energy installations and their associated electric lines. The power is exercisable in territorial waters, the seabed of which is owned by the Crown Estate, and in the renewable energy zones to be created on the United Kingdom continental shelf.
<P>

<a name="40210-20_para2"></a>The decommissioning programme may require security arrangements, financial or otherwise, that the person subject to the decommissioning obligation must put in place to ensure that funds are available to carry out the decommissioning programme. A non-exhaustive list of things that will constitute security for that purpose is given at Clause 101(2). I shall give the Committee a couple of examples. The clause mentions,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a charge over a bank account or any other asset"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-20_para3"></a>
or,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a performance bond or guarantee".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-20_para4"></a><P>

<a name="40210-20_para5"></a>The power can be exercised when the renewable energy installation or related electric line is at the proposal stage&#151;provided that at least one of the relevant statutory consents has been granted or has been applied for and is likely to be granted&#151;and, subsequently, when the installation or the line is actually being used. The drafting applies, therefore, to future installations and to those that have already begun under round one. However, round one installations are already subject to decommissioning programmes imposed either under leases granted by the Crown Estate or under consents granted under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989. The Department of Trade and Industry has apparently indicated at industry seminars that it would not apply Clause 92 to round one projects.
<P>

<a name="40210-20_para6"></a>The amendment would ensure that there should be an integrated approach to decommissioning obligations. It would also give greater assurance to proposers of installations in further rounds that future decommissioning obligations that may be imposed under, for example, leases of parts of the territorial waters will not be duplicated by the requirements of the clause. Failure to give that assurance may act as a disincentive to proposers to invest. In turn, that will hinder the Government's attempts to meet their renewable energy targets.
<P>

<a name="40210-20_para7"></a>As failure to comply with the requirements of a decommissioning programme will be a criminal offence, it is suggested that the amendment contributes to Better Regulation Task Force principles in ensuring the clarity that everyone wants about the scope of the prohibition. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I probably ought to start by declaring a past interest. I was a member of the Better Regulation Task Force for some time. One of the tasks that we set ourselves was to try to make sure that, in complex areas, everyone at least knew at the beginning <P>


<a name="column_GC500"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC500</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of any enterprise in which they were liable to make an investment what the full weight of the obligations on them might be. We cannot always avoid complex regulations, and decommissioning may be an area in which, as several noble Lords said, there will be complex requirements to be met. It is best that everybody knows what they are from the start.
<P>

<a name="40210-20_para8"></a>The Secretary of State will need to be mindful of the decommissioning standards which are generally applied in drawing up the regulations. Clause 98 sets out what they are. These are standards for installations decommissioned under this scheme. They are rigorous, for all the reasons of safety and the environment which have been explored in earlier debates in Committee. There is absolutely no doubt that costs will be an important factor in setting those standards. It is not because there is a desire to goldplate the standards simply for their own sake; it is because in due course under this legislation, should it be passed, the Committee and the Secretary of State will have to bear it in mind that the United Kingdom has international obligations with respect to decommissioning which are precise and onerous.
<P>

<a name="40210-20_para9"></a>The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea requires us to ensure that installations are removed so that they do not present a hazard to navigation, for example. Members of the Committee have asked whether that involves those parts of them that stick out of the water or the structures in which they are embedded in the sea bed. In all cases, where they are decommissioned, they must not be allowed to continue to present a hazard to navigation.
<P>

<a name="40210-20_para10"></a>We have to be certain that the decommissioning programmes that are approved by the Secretary of State meet all the objectives set out in international law. Other decommissioning programmes might not have the same objectives; they might have lesser objectives and therefore fall foul of that law.
<P>

<a name="40210-20_para11"></a>In direct response to the point of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, the Government will not use the Bill procedure to apply to projects which have an existing Section 36 consent under the round one arrangements. All these projects already have a decommissioning programme, so we do not feel that it is necessary to set this out in the legislation. It is already there and does not need to be reproduced here.
<P>

<a name="40210-20_para12"></a>I hope that this persuades Members of the Committee that the amendment is not necessary. I respectfully ask that it should be withdrawn. The critical point is that the international obligations obviously must be expressed in ways which mean that anybody responsible for decommissioning works to the same set of standards, and that those standards are thoroughly observed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-20_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I wonder if the Minister would clarify something for me. He said that there are existing restrictions. Are the new arrangements exactly the same for new-build or is there a difference? Are the regulations that apply now the ones that have been superimposed on to this Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   If I am wrong about this, I shall ensure that I write to the noble Baroness, but my <P>


<a name="column_GC501"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC501</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>understanding is that the projects that were approved under round one had thorough decommissioning schemes. They were not statutory schemes; in fact, because of the early nature of round one, they were probably more comprehensive, because people wanted to make sure that no mistakes were made. Here we are trying to set out what those schemes ought to be for the long term and the future. I have no doubt that a good deal will be learnt from round one in that process, but my advice is that the statutory scheme will be more comprehensive, based on learning from the round one schemes. I realise that I probably inverted that explanation in my earlier sentence&#151;I hope that Members of the Committee will forgive me. The statutory scheme will be more comprehensive, based on the lessons that are learnt from round one, which were a very preliminary start to the process. I apologise for any confusion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-20_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   It is very interesting because this again deals with decommissioning programmes. I know that on debates on earlier amendments moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, there was a suggestion that there were already enough Acts and that she did not want any duplication. Now the Minister is saying that the Government do not want to goldplate any other decommissioning programmes because under international provisions, the decommissioning programmes that have taken place may not meet the standards required to meet international obligations. That may very well be so; I would not argue with that issue. However, my amendment says,

If the terms of "any other decommissioning programme" did not go far enough, of course it would be necessary to have separate provisions to meet these obligations. However, if they did, I see no reason at all why anyone should have to go through this whole procedure again. Having said that, I shall obviously read very carefully what the Minister has said, but I believe, if I may say so, that he has not had regard to the fact that I did not table a prescriptive amendment. I sought to avoid a process which in some cases might not be necessary. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40210-20_para19"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a probing amendment designed to find out in general terms what is the meaning of the phrase "such security". On page 84 of the Bill "security" is defined in terms of kinds of money; for example, deposits, bonds and so on. What the Bill does not do is to provide any clue as to how much money is involved. Will it be X per cent of the value of the completed installation? Will it be a proportion of the estimated decommissioning cost and, if so, will that proportion be predefined in guidelines or statute?
<P>

<a name="40210-20_para20"></a>If the security takes the form of a money deposit, will it go straight to the Consolidated Fund? Under what conditions will a security be redeemed? Will the value of a security be the same for everyone in relation to a given decommissioning size, or will certain companies or organisations pay less than others? If that is to be the case, will the Minister indicate how any difference will be calculated? I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40210-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   Amendment No. 110A, which would remove the Secretary of State's power to impose obligations on developers to provide the necessary security to cover the cost of decommissioning an offshore installation, could not work in practice.
<P>

<a name="40210-21_para0"></a>This power is an essential part of the decommissioning scheme. It is necessary to ensure that assets will be in place to meet the costs of decommissioning the installation at the end of its life. That means meeting the full costs&#151;the costs that are actually required to meet the decommissioning of the installation. It is to little purpose to impose an obligation on someone to decommission an installation only to find when the time comes to implement the programme that no funds are available. We need to ensure from the beginning that the costs of decommissioning and the decommissioning programme are fully covered. So the security arrangements will be designed to achieve that objective, no more and no less, case by case. "Security" is a customary definition of securities and not just money; it can be a variety of things. As Members of the Committee look down the list in Clause 101 they will find that&#151;for example&#151;letters of comfort, if sent by credible people and thought to be creditable, will equally be securities in this case, as one would expect them to be in other business circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40210-21_para1"></a>The Government have an obligation under the UN International Convention of the Law of the Sea to ensure that the installations are decommissioned so that they do not present a hazard to navigation; and, of course, protection of the environment is also a powerful reason for requiring installations to be removed. Both reasons are very important. We are not&#151;as I am sure no one is in this Grand Committee&#151;half-hearted about the arrangements that must be put in place to meet the obligations.
<P>

<a name="40210-21_para2"></a>A further factor is that we must ensure that the costs do not fall on the taxpayer by the Government having to pick up the bill when the developer fails to meet his obligations. That would give rise without question, and quite understandably, to the most profound objections.
<P>

<P>

<a name="40210-21_para3"></a>Noble Lords will see from the types of security listed in Clause 101 that we envisage a range of instruments, which are dependent on circumstances&#151;as I said earlier&#151;case by case. A key factor here will be the financial standing of the person who has the obligation to decommission the installation. We are not trying to be prescriptive; indeed, the list, as the noble Baroness said, is not exhaustive. Each case will be looked at on its merits.
<P>

<a name="40210-21_para4"></a>I hope that persuades the noble Baroness that this amendment is not necessary and might in fact turn out to be&#151;I use the word cautiously&#151;short-sighted when considering all the different kinds of circumstances that would occur. Accordingly, I ask her to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-21_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for his response to my probing amendment. It was certainly not intended to be short-sighted in any way, but we need to somehow get answers to questions that run through our minds when we are looking through the Bills. Certainly I had no doubt that the amendment would actually fully cover the costs that would be incurred; so that was not a problem.
<P>

<a name="40210-21_para5"></a>However, the Minister did not answer my questions. Does the security take the form of the money deposited? If it does, will that go into the consolidated fund? Where does it go? I have looked down the list quite carefully. There is a,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"charge over a bank account".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-21_para6"></a>
Is that money then left with the person involved? There is "a deposit of money", but it does not say to where it is going. Presumably,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a performance bond or guarantee",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-21_para7"></a>
would go into the department concerned. I am not sure where,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a letter of credit; and . . . a letter of comfort",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-21_para8"></a>
go. I was seeking to find the detail on what happens and where the money goes. It may be that the matter is already set down in other legislation and I can be pointed in that direction. I thank the Minister for his words, with which I have no quarrel. However, his response did not clarify where these various securities go. The noble Lord said that the issue is flexible and that it would be taken case by case, which I can understand. That makes good sense. But even on a case-by-case scenario is it a proportion of the total cost, or how are these things decided upon? Having read very carefully through the provision I am none the wiser. I assure the Minister that my intention is not to denude the strength of the need for this provision, but to seek clarification. I do not know whether he would like to respond before I decide what to do with the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Perhaps I may intervene because the matter is very important. If the Government were&#151;and I am sure they are not&#151;to demand the deposit of moneys upfront at the start of the construction period to pay for the decommissioning, we would be dealing with a, frankly, preposterous and unbusinesslike situation. I am sure the Government do not have that in mind.

<P>

<a name="40210-21_para9"></a>I want an assurance from the Government that there is a recognition&#151;and obviously such recognition must apply equally to the firm installing a wind farm&#151;at a point presumably 25 or 30 years in the future, that there is an absolute liability that will have to be met.
<P>

<a name="40210-21_para10"></a>It seems that what is required is an annual charge against the revenue stream, building what I would call a decommissioning fund&#151;I nearly said a "sinking" fund, but that might be an unfortunate phrase&#151;over the time. What the Government really require is a legally binding document showing that this kind of an arrangement is in place.
<P>

<a name="40210-21_para11"></a>I infer that&#151;although it is not easy to read this definitely into Clause 101, the interpretation clause&#151;providing the Government have that sort of arrangement in mind, and assuming that one is dealing with reputable people, of course there should be no problem. But it seems that it would be very complicated if an invitation were being made to someone installing a wind farm to put the decommissioning money upfront on day one. That would be a preposterous situation. I am sure that it is the last thought in the Government's mind, but I would welcome an assurance that that is so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   It would certainly not be the Government's intention to impose such financial strictures at the beginning of an enterprise to make it impossible to conduct the undertaking. Plainly, that would be to no purpose.
<P>

<a name="40210-21_para12"></a>In Clause 101(2)&#151;the non-inclusive list&#151;as a number of noble Lords have commented, there are a variety of different methods. Of course each one is capable of answering in a slightly different way the questions of the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. I do not think it is anyone's intention to rule out mechanisms such as charges against revenue streams being an appropriate way of achieving that over a period of time. I shall take further advice on that, and if I am wrong, I shall say so.
<P>

<a name="40210-21_para13"></a>Charges held against accounts, access to bonds or guarantees, letters of credit and letters of comfort can be lodged with the appropriate authority in government and held, as they would be in any business where those were the guarantees of performance or future financial undertaking. Moneys can&#151;and most likely will&#151;be held in trust-fund form for the period in which they are required.
<P>

<a name="40210-21_para14"></a>So in each instance, case by case and depending on the kind of security involved, there is an appropriate destination for each of the forms of security provided.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-21_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith for his good contribution. On my notes, although not on the notes that I have, I had written "upfront" and "unspecified amounts". My noble friend was quite right to raise the issue about "upfront"; but the Minister says that that is not so. On the other hand, one has to bear in mind that the costs will still need to be covered should anything happen to go wrong. I am glad to have on the record that the moneys are not upfront.

<a name="40210-21_para15"></a>I am intrigued that the money might go into a trust fund. Why would it go into a trust fund? I am getting more and more intrigued by this humble amendment. Why would it not go into a consolidated fund? What is so special about a trust fund?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-21_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I was trying to make the point, not that no money might be required upfront, but that the total and final bill that might be presented 25 or 30 years hence could scarcely be lodged at the beginning in all probability. The argument for placing the money in a trust fund would be that it would then be held absolutely and securely and for the purpose for which it was originally intended, and not used for any other aim. That should give everyone a degree of confidence about the intention rather than believing that it might disappear in some other way.
<P>

<a name="40210-21_para16"></a>As the Committee can see, the precise arrangements are not defined in the Bill. I imagine that there might be others. That arrangement is one which I am advised would give a good deal of confidence.

<A NAME="40210-21_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I accept totally what the Minister said&#151;that everything will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The whole idea of the security is that it simply includes those aspects that have been mentioned; there may be many other ways that are not specified here. However, although there is nothing wrong with a trust fund, I find it rather strange that nothing has been put down with regard to the question of the deposit of money, which my noble friend asked about.
<P>

<a name="40210-21_para17"></a>Much earlier&#151;so many Committee sittings ago that I cannot remember where it came&#151;there was quite a discussion about whether money all had to go into a consolidated fund or whether for specific purposes it could go into a segregated fund. The Government resisted all those amendments, saying that it needed to go into a consolidated fund. Nothing has been said on that at all&#151;apart from a line from a note that came from the officials, perhaps. The Minister suggests that the money is in a sense going into a segregated fund, because it is going into a trust fund for that purpose. I find it strange that that has just come to light, as that is different from anything that we have heard before on the subject.

When he does that, perhaps he could answer my query on the range of money. He has said that the total cost will not be upfront but that a proportion of it may be. If that could be clarified before Report stage, I would be grateful. It may seem a small detail, but those who are going into the business need to know where they stand.

<P>
<A NAME="40210-22_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 111:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 81, line 19, leave out "due" and insert "reasonable"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-22_para12"></a><P>

<a name="40210-22_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: Clause 97 provides for a situation in which someone or, more likely, some company, involved in a decommissioning programme fails to carry out his or its responsibilities, particularly pursuant to the requirements of the Secretary of State. Under the provisions of the clause, this failure constitutes an offence punishable by law. Of course, we have no quarrel with that. Subsection (4) rightly provides a defence, which is described as the exercise of "due diligence". We also have no quarrel with the provision of such a defence but, in my view, the words "due diligence" are a misuse of the phrase.
<P>

<a name="40210-22_para14"></a>"Due diligence" is a term of art employed in the world of accountancy, and sometimes in legal affairs, in relation to the duty of the seller of shares in a company to make full disclosure of all relevant facts and is coupled with the responsibility of the buyer adequately to investigate the information provided. I have never seen that phrase used outside that particular context. We certainly do not want to use a phrase that may have a very narrow specialised meaning. I believe that the correct phrase is "reasonable diligence". For some reason, in the six years or so that I have proposed amendments from these Benches using the word "reasonable", there has been some sort of Pavlovian reaction against the word.
<P>

<a name="40210-22_para15"></a>The subsection proposed by the Government rightly negates the suggestion of an absolute offence under the clause. Clearly, the Government intend that any defence should be that the person concerned has acted reasonably. It puts the onus of proof on the defendant. The terms of the defence and the burden of what the defendant must prove must be clear and unequivocal&#151;namely, that he has acted reasonably in the particular circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40210-22_para16"></a>With due respect to the draftsmen, I have no idea why they have chosen to use what I consider to be an inappropriate term of art from a different context, instead of using the plain, ordinary word understood by everyone&#151;"reasonable". I do not know whether the Government are suggesting that there is a difference between "due diligence" and "reasonable diligence", but, if there is, I would be interested to hear <P>


<a name="column_GC507"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC507</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Minister's explanation, even though it may entail a different amendment to define the unusual use of the phrase in the circumstances. In the mean time, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Amendment No. 111A is grouped with Amendment No. 111. The reason for the amendment is to try to get from the Government some idea of the length of delay that there might be before proceedings are taken against a person. As far as I can see in the Bill, it is open-ended; it could be six months, a year or two years. Over the years, it has been a matter of concern in the National Health Service, for example, that there is sometimes up to two or three years' delay in the investigation of doctors. That is unfair not just to the hospital concerned but to the individual involved, who is limbo for all that time. I chose three calendar months not for a specific reason but to ask the Government to state their intention in the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-22_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   Before the Minister replies, I must apologise to my noble friend. I cannot pretend that it is because my glasses are not any good: they are brand new. I missed out the first two lines of the sentence in which I was going to say that I would speak to Amendment No. 111 and my noble friend would speak to the other amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We appreciate the double act anyway.
<P>

<a name="40210-22_para17"></a>I do not agree with the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon. "Due diligence" is not simply an accountancy term; it appears in a significant number of legal and legislative contexts. It is well understood and has an implication of proportionality, as well as reasonableness. By any definition, "reasonable diligence" is less strong than "due diligence". It is a serious matter for a person to fail to take remedial action in such circumstances, and the phrase "due diligence" is appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40210-22_para18"></a>Amendment No. 111A would require the Government to instigate court proceedings against an offender who failed to carry out remedial programmes within "three calendar months" of the period of the original requirement for remedial action having elapsed. I understand the noble Baroness's concern, but I think that three months is somewhat tight. In many circumstances, it will be a complicated matter. We want justice to be done and be seen to be done as swiftly as possible, but we need a bit of flexibility. Three months would be a little bit tight for anyone preparing a legal case, let alone the Government. That is not to say that I am tempting the noble Baroness to suggest an alternative. Three months would not be acceptable to the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-22_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I did not expect the Minister to agree, and the amendment has provoked the reaction that I thought it would. I mean that in a complimentary way.
<P>

<a name="40210-22_para19"></a>Nowhere in the Bill is there any guidance on how long a period would elapse. That may be deliberate or there may be bits of the Bill that I have missed, but I did not find any. That is why I tabled the amendment. <P>


<a name="column_GC508"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC508</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The amendment was designed to say to the Government that the period must be three months; I wanted to find out whether there would be guidance on what will be considered a reasonable time to allow to elapse before such action is taken.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-22_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Tombs: </B>   In relation to Clause 111, perhaps I may ask the Minister whether he envisages due diligence being unreasonable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   No. I said that due diligence carries the connotation of proportionality as well as reasonableness, and it is therefore stronger than "reasonable". It subsumes reasonableness. With regard to the point raised by the noble Baroness, I should say that it is very rare in statute to lay down a timescale on proceedings. Therefore, I am not really encouraging her to go down that road.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-22_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for bringing a little lightness to the subject of the amendment, which one could not pretend to be the heaviest one that we are moving. I shall read very carefully what he said. However, I have to tell him that, interestingly, it was two lawyers who told me that they felt that "due diligence" was improper in this context. Having said that, I shall obviously reconsider the matter carefully and go back to my legal representatives. But, at this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40210-22_para26"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 111B would simply provide a more precise definition of the word "participate", which appears in Clause 99(2)(g) of the Bill. It reads:

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to share or take part in".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-22_para28"></a>
In my opinion, that is a very loose definition for a word that could involve the person in question in the very serious consequences of Section 99. The consequences would require positive actions by anyone caught by the section, with possible criminal sanctions and penalties in default.

<a name="40210-22_para35"></a>Your Lordships will have noticed that my first proposed new subsection paraphrases the Northern Ireland order. It simply adapts it to correspond with the main text of the clause. The second new subsection follows the order word for word. The Northern Ireland order is carefully worded so as to avoid catching what I might call "innocent bystanders". I have absolutely no doubt that the Government have no intention of doing anything such as that in the present Bill. This is not a question of my pedantically preferring my wording to that of the Government. Sometimes I do, but that is not the reason in this case. It is a matter of my preferring the better wording of one parliamentary draftsman over that of another. I mean no disrespect whatever to the very nice ladies and gentlemen sitting behind the Ministers. I hope that, in the interests of consistency, the Government will accept the amendment. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40210-22_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, is absolutely right that there is no intention of catching innocent bystanders. I hope that in general it is not intended to catch bankers, either, who may or may not be innocent bystanders.
<P>

<a name="40210-22_para36"></a>All the examples in Clause 99(2) show that the person responsible will have a serious executive role in respect of the activities. I do not think that any of those descriptions could really apply to someone in a subordinate role. In most cases, it seems clear to me that they apply to someone whose role is one of responsibility in relation to the activities.
<P>

<a name="40210-22_para37"></a>I can understand that there may be a preference for the drafting technique of different pieces of legislation, but I hope that I can persuade the noble Baroness that the drafting here is reasonable in the circumstances to meet the objectives and that it is fit for purpose.
<P>

<a name="40210-22_para38"></a>It is vital that the scheme we have included in the Bill for the decommissioning of renewable energy installations and electric lines works properly. <P>


<a name="column_GC510"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC510</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Members of the Committee will recall that last week we discussed the important issues of protecting the environment and making sure that renewable energy installations are not a hazard to navigation. We must make sure that installations which have come to the end of their productive life are not left to corrode, causing a potential threat to passing ships by falling over and possibly polluting the sea.
<P>

<a name="40210-22_para39"></a>A key feature of the decommissioning scheme in the Bill is the ability of the Secretary of State to identify correctly the person or persons who should be given a duty to prepare a decommissioning programme under Clause 92. The issue of a notice by the Secretary of State requiring the submission of a decommissioning programme triggers the whole decommissioning programme&#151;that is the point from which it starts. The duty placed on persons who become responsible for the renewable energy installation to inform the Secretary of State is necessary so that she always, at any moment, has the information that is necessary for her to decide who should receive the notice. For those reasons, she must obviously be in a position to know to whom to send the initial notice and subsequent notices over the life of the project.
<P>

<a name="40210-22_para40"></a>Given that these projects can have a very long life and that it may be 25 years or possibly more before the actual decommissioning takes place, it is very important to know at every stage who is responsible for each of the things listed in Clause 99. The project may be sold on; there may be changes in the ownership arrangements and assets over the time. The Secretary of State must be kept informed of all such changes so that she can decide whether she needs to issue a new notice requiring a decommissioning scheme and programme to be submitted. Otherwise, there is really no control over the process and the Secretary of State would have lost that control. This is the purpose of Clause 99(2), particularly paragraphs (f) and (g).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I resume my speech. This is almost beginning to take on the character of a soap opera. I feel that there should be dramatic music when I get to the really exciting bits and we shall resume the story later.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para1"></a>I repeat that it is critical that the Secretary of State knows who is responsible and whether any changes have taken place in the enterprise. That was the burden of the point that I made before the Division was called. Furthermore, the Secretary of State will want to review whether the arrangements for providing security to ensure that the decommissioning programme is carried out continue to be adequate across the entire lifetime of the project. Information about the ownership of the assets to be decommissioned is of key importance.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para2"></a>Clause 99(2)(f) seeks to identify the persons who are directly responsible for the construction, extension, operation, use or decommissioning of the installation. <P>


<a name="column_GC511"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC511</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clause 99(2)(g) is drawn a bit wider by referring to persons who begin to participate in these activities. What we have in mind here is situations, for example, where there is a special company which is set up solely to build or operate the installation with few assets other than the installation itself. That company will in turn be owned by one or more other companies. The Secretary of State needs to know who these companies are and keep track of all the ownership arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para3"></a>That is just one example and there may be many other kinds of ownership arrangements over the lifetime of a project of this kind. New kinds of ownership models may develop over time. It is very difficult for us to be more specific on the face of the Bill as it would be impossible to capture all the possibilities although experience shows that new things emerge. If we failed to cover all of them there is a risk that there would be a loophole in the scheme which someone who is determined to evade their decommissioning responsibilities could exploit. In these circumstances the tax payer might have to pick up the decommissioning bill.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para4"></a>We have made it clear at Clause 99(8) that, "participation in activities" does not include participation on behalf of another person or participation by acting in pursuance of an agreement to provide services to a person carrying on those activities. As I said at the beginning of my reply, if they are responsible for a matter that is covered by the legislation, a banker or an employee might be caught. However, under Clause 99(8)(b) bankers would not be caught if they were acting in pursuance of an agreement to provide banking services. They will plainly not be the hapless victims that it was feared might be the case. Employees acting on behalf of the employer are also excluded by Clause 99(8)(a) so they could not become hapless victims in the sense that we were discussing earlier.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para5"></a>The amendment would restrict very considerably the categories of persons falling under Clause 99(2)(g) to those who,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"co-ordinates, and directs, the activity; or . . . makes a relevant object available for use".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-23_para6"></a>
In fact, we take the view that those persons will be more likely to fall under Clause 99(2)(f), which is why we cannot accept the amendment. We need to make the scheme watertight so that we can all rest assured that decommissioning will take place in a proper way. That is in all our interests.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para7"></a>As with other aspects of the Bill, the decommissioning clauses provide only the bare legislative framework. It will be necessary to provide guidance notes on how the whole scheme will work in practice, and we shall certainly provide guidance on what we mean by "begins to participate" in certain activities, so that there can be no ambiguity about that. In that light, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   The Minister had a good shot at that explanation, given that it was interrupted by the Division. That is a matter for the Government, who like having Grand Committees at the same time <P>


<a name="column_GC512"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC512</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as the passage of Bills in the Chamber, so such interruptions will happen more and more often. I cannot help saying that; when the Minister knows me better, he might know that I very often say things like that.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para8"></a>When I was interrupted, I forgot the flow of what I wanted to say, but when I was listening carefully to the Minister I realised why I did not accept his explanation, able as it was. We totally accept that the Secretary of State must have notice of all the things mentioned in the clause; there is no question about that. She has her job to do, and she certainly has to do it. However, subsection (1) says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A person who becomes responsible for a relevant object must notify the Secretary of State that he has become so responsible".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-23_para9"></a>
Therefore, the word "responsible" is important. Then there are several explanations of what it might be that the person is responsible for.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para10"></a>The Minister quoted paragraph (f), which is not part of the amendment but says,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"he begins in such waters to construct, to extend, to operate or use or to decommission the object".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-23_para11"></a>
I would have no objections to any of that, because clearly he does those things and that is the end of the matter. However, paragraph (g) goes on to say,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"he begins to participate in any of the following activities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-23_para12"></a>
The activities are quite important, consisting of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the construction, extension, operation or use or decommissioning of the object".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-23_para13"></a><P>

<a name="40210-23_para14"></a>I come back to where I started, which is the normal use of the word participate, meaning, "to share or to take part in". That is all; it does not mean to be in control of, whereas the amendment that we have tabled, copying the Northern Ireland order, makes it clear that a person participating in the transmission, for example, co-ordinates and directs the flow of it and gets involved in it. That is far more important than someone who is simply sharing in an activity.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para15"></a>I have heard the Minister's comments, and I shall read them carefully, but at this stage I do not really and truthfully accept his argument. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40210-23_para21"></a>The noble Baroness said: In the absence of my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding, I shall speak to this group of amendments.
<P>


<a name="column_GC513"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC513</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para22"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 112, at present there are two separate buy-out funds under the renewables obligation&#151;one for England and Wales and one for Scotland. Suppliers, when complying with their renewables obligations, can choose to redeem ROCs in different proportions between England and Wales and Scotland. Therefore, Scottish ROCs can have a different value from England and Wales ROCs. This is not helpful. By the way, I hate using acronyms, but I think everyone knows that ROC stands for the renewables obligation certificate.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para23"></a>When an obligation is introduced in Northern Ireland, there will be three separate buy-out funds and therefore even more scope for unhelpful variance of ROC values. Each of the three relevant Governments would have to amend their existing renewables obligation orders to address this issue. It would be preferable if the Energy Bill were to create a single Great Britain fund and ultimately, when Northern Ireland introduces a renewables obligation, a single United Kingdom fund.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para24"></a>The Energy Bill's regulatory impact assessment already states that the intended effect of the Bill is to create a single obligation system throughout the United Kingdom. Paragraph 3.28 makes that quite clear. The ideal solution would be a single UK obligation, as this would reduce both the current administrative burden and market distortions. However, this may not be possible, perhaps for political reasons. The Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland has already exercised its autonomy in choosing to sell the Northern Ireland obligation at 6.3 per cent by 2010, rather than the 10.4 per cent target employed by Great Britain. This differential will further exaggerate the distortions in the value of individual buy-out funds.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para25"></a>This amendment, which requires that the buy-out funds from all three obligations are pooled prior to recycle, thereby addresses the disparities in the recycle value of ROCs. This should help improve the functioning of the ROC market. This process would be undertaken by Ofgem, or possibly an independent market operator, as the administrator of all three funds.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para26"></a>I mentioned earlier that I was having a bit of difficulty with my eyes. I clearly am, because I did not say when I started my remarks on Amendment No. 112 that I wanted to speak also to Amendments Nos. 122, 123 and 144. The subject is the securitisation of the renewables obligation funds. I apologise for not saying that at the beginning.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para27"></a>With the leave of the Committee, I would like now to speak to Amendment No. 144, although that is slightly out of order in the group. If a supplier defaults and is unable to fulfil his obligation, a shortfall in the buy-out fund arises. Compliant suppliers receive less from the recycling of the buy-out fund than they would otherwise have anticipated&#151;indeed, less than they may very well have relied upon receiving, thus putting themselves in some financial difficulty or, at the least, financial inconvenience.
<P>


<a name="column_GC514"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC514</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para28"></a>The effect of TXU and Maverick Energy's combined non-payment of #23.6 million to the buy-out fund has been a reduction in the level of recycled payments of around #4 per renewables obligation certificate. This is the type of material problem that the amendments seek to address.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para29"></a>This loss falls entirely on the compliant suppliers who are supporting the renewables obligation. Those who bought out their obligation by paying the buy-out are not affected. The risk of default by those due to pay discourages suppliers from purchasing ROCs. This, in turn, undermines the whole principle of the renewables obligation scheme. If suppliers favour buying out of their obligation over submitting ROCs as a compliance strategy, demand for the ROCs will be weak. The short-term impact on price and demand will have a long-term impact on the rate of new renewable development, something in which everyone is interested. As a result, consumers will end up paying the same amount for the renewable obligation but for a smaller amount of renewables generation. That is the problem. It could&#151;perhaps "will" is a more accurate word&#151;undermine the economic efficiency of the obligation. The solution proposed in Amendment No. 144 is to give the authority power to take security in various forms. That, as I mentioned previously, could perhaps be given the shorthand description of "securitisation".
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para30"></a>However, it is right for me to point out that at least one other alternative suggestion has been floated by interested parties. This could loosely be called "mutualisation". It is a kind of group insurance, perhaps along the lines of the International Air Transport Association or British travel agents protecting their customers from a bankruptcy by a travel agent. Presumably it would be funded by a levy on suppliers. So far as I can tell from my post bag&#151;I have received many different briefings and views on this&#151;it is the solution preferred, in particular, by many smaller generators. However, those who object to that method point out that it entails the good paying for the defaults of the bad, that it is wrong to expect compliant companies to pay for the default of others, and that paying into what would amount to a mutual insurance fund will inevitably result in an increased expense ultimately to the consumer.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para31"></a>The amendment that I have proposed, which is far more on the securitisation line, is the solution to the problem suggested by the Renewable Power Association. It has told me that it believes the Government are not adverse to that way forward. However, I thought it right to put everything on the table. The association and I both concede that it is but one solution to the problem of default. If the Government have a different, viable and effective solution, we shall be glad to hear from the Minister what it is, preferably at this stage if possible. Doing nothing about this is not an option.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para32"></a>Amendment No. 122 in this group is a consequential amendment to Section 32C of the 1989 Act necessitated by the previous amendment. The value of a renewables obligation certificate to a supplier when presented to the authority in satisfaction of its <P>


<a name="column_GC515"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC515</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>renewables obligation comprises two elements: first, the buy-out payment that it would have to pay but for the presentation of the ROC; and, secondly, a share of the moneys paid by suppliers not presenting ROCs&#151;that is, the buy-out fund&#151;which are recycled to those who do present.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para33"></a>Thus, if a supplier defaults in making its buy-out payment, other suppliers who present ROCs to discharge their renewables obligation can suffer a loss. The intention of Amendment No. 122 is to enable provisions to be put in place to protect the value of ROCs from the failure of a supplier to make a buy-out payment. The proposed amendment contemplates at least two possibilities, which will need to be studied in much greater detail in due course since neither is without cost.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para34"></a>The first approach contemplates that suppliers could be required to provide security to ensure that all or part of their obligation is met. The second, alternative, approach envisages that in, it is hoped, the rare event of supplier default, the remaining suppliers would pay additional amounts as necessary to ensure that, over an appropriate period, the value of the buy-out fund remained whole. So there one has it: securitisation on the one hand or, on the other, mutualisation as an alternative.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para35"></a>If suppliers were required to provide security, the value of the ROC would be more secure. However, the measure should not distort competition. That may be the case if certain suppliers are able to present security in the form of a credit rating while others must provide a cash deposit. The costs of this additional layer of insurance, which ultimately would fall to customers, whether or not an event of default occurs, is also a legitimate area of concern. The payment of additional amounts by all suppliers in the event of default is likely to be achievable only if spread over an appropriate period. Unlike the case where security is demanded from suppliers, the cost to customers in this approach is incurred only when an event of default actually occurs. Although neither method provides a perfect security, enabling them at this stage leaves open the option, together with other options, of making the value of renewables obligation certificates more secure.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para36"></a>I now come to Amendment No. 123. The renewables obligation is a tradable market mechanism to increase the amount of electricity generation coming from renewable energy sources. If it is to work properly, an effective market for renewable obligation certificates (ROCs) is essential.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para37"></a>Ofgem administers the renewables obligations and operates the market for ROCs. How it does so is laid out in the renewables order. The fact that the details of the operation of the market are set out in legislation limits Ofgem's flexibility to manage the obligation efficiently. There are many aspects of the ROC market that can be optimised. As it is a relatively new concept, there are, no doubt, many wrinkles that need to be ironed out. At present, any changes have to be made through secondary legislation with mandatory prior consultation. To date, the DTI has run two <P>


<a name="column_GC516"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC516</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consultations relating to provisions of the renewables obligation; and it will shortly have to conduct a further one to implement the recently announced increase in the quota to 15.4 per cent by 2015.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para38"></a>In my submission, the present procedures are far too inflexible to enable a speedy improvement to detailed administrative procedures involved in running the ROC market. Indeed, Ofgem has more than enough to do to administer the market alongside its other heavy legislative duties.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para39"></a>It is possible that it might be better to delegate the operation of the ROC market to what the amendment calls, "suitably qualified persons" or to an organisation. Ideally, that would be a body which included representatives of the industry. Such revocable delegation would not affect the legislative basis for the obligation, the eligibility of the technologies or the price of the buy-out. At present, the obligation does not cater for the situation where a supply company defaults.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para40"></a>My Amendment No. 144, to which I spoke first, is intended to deal with that in part. However, it is quite likely that other things will need to be done to minimise the risks of supplier default, thus undermining the obligation, as I have already said. The fact is that the size of the obligation and the sums of money may grow in time. It might be thought advisable to shorten the compliance period as one way of reducing the risk and removing the temptation for a cash-strapped supplier from using the money for some other purpose. We are all familiar with the small employers who use the PAYE that they collect to pay their trade creditors' more urgently and more vigorously demanded debts. The essential thing is that the RO and the ROC system should be governed efficiently and effectively.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para41"></a>Amendment No. 123 is not entirely prescriptive. While it stresses that the authority is to perform its obligations efficiently&#151;which noble Lords might say goes without saying&#151;it adds the alternative of delegation. It does so only as a discretionary option and does not seek to interfere with Ofgem's primary management obligation.
<P>

<a name="40210-23_para42"></a>I have taken rather a long time to describe that whole group of amendments because it is a complicated matter and I thought it was not right just to talk about "securitisation" without letting the Committee know that there are others who think there is an alternative. In responding, I very much hope that the Government will be able to tell us what it is. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40210-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Lest anyone should think that the Division was engineered by me to collect my thoughts and that I have that kind of influence in the Chamber, I should say that it has made my situation chaotic as I have forgotten one or two of the key questions that the noble Baroness asked. However, she will prompt me as we go along and I shall do my very best to respond to the debate.
<P>

<a name="40210-24_para1"></a>I was saying how much I appreciated the constructive way in which she had approached what we all recognise is a difficult issue. I want to assure her that we have considered some of the constructive proposals and that we shall continue to do so. I hope that the noble Baroness will forgive me for replying to the amendments in numerical order rather than the order in which they were spoken to.
<P>

<a name="40210-24_para2"></a>At present, there are buy-out funds for England and Wales on the one hand and Scotland on the other. It is suggested that a system of separate funds offers the potential for abuse&#151;in particular, that opportunities would be gained for certain suppliers&#151;and that that would be prevented by creating the single Great Britain-wide buy-out fund which the noble Baroness advocated. We have no evidence that any abuse in that respect has occurred thus far. The Government are certainly willing to consider such a move. We consulted on that when we held our technical review of the renewables obligation order last year. However, we do not yet have sufficient information on which to base a decision on whether to merge the separate funds.
<P>

<a name="40210-24_para3"></a>I listened carefully to what the noble Baroness said and I understand the points that she made regarding merging the funds. We do not have a closed mind on the issue; in fact, we have a very open mind on whether that is a desirable way forward. However, it is too early and we do not have the requisite information that convinces us that this is the way forward. After all, the obligation has been in force for less than two years and we need more time to see how it is working. It would be premature to reach a final policy decision at this stage. We are certain that taking a decision now under the Bill would be the equivalent of setting a policy in concrete when we are by no means convinced that that is the certain route down which we should go.

<a name="40210-24_para4"></a>Although we have not used them so far, we already have powers to operate the two existing funds as though they were one.

<FONT SIZE=3>legislation. In future, it should be possible for the three potential funds to operate as though they were one, if decisions to that effect are taken. I recognise the force of the noble Baroness's advocacy, but, with the Bill, we have in place a framework within which that decision can be taken, if it proves to be the advisable choice to make.
<P>

<a name="40210-24_para5"></a>We are also enacting legislation under the Bill to allow mutual recognition of Northern Ireland renewables obligation certificates and Great Britain renewables obligation certificates. That paves the way for a Northern Ireland obligation to be put in place at a later date, modelled on the Renewables Obligation Order 2002 for England and Wales and the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) Order 2002. We plan to table government amendments on Report that will comprise additional clauses to complete the mutual recognition of the two sets of renewables certificates. The intended result is that although ROCs will be issued separately in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and although suppliers will be obligated under three separate orders&#151;for Scotland, England and Wales and Northern Ireland, depending on where they supply electricity&#151;any supplier will be able to buy and use any ROC under any of the obligations.
<P>

<a name="40210-24_para6"></a>The Government and the devolved administrations are taking a consistent approach to renewables development in the UK and the achievement of the renewables targets set in the energy White Paper. I hope that my comments on the proposed amendments give confidence that we will revisit the issue of a UK-wide buy-out fund when, as I have already explained, we are better placed to make a decision.
<P>

<a name="40210-24_para7"></a>That almost concludes my remarks on Amendment No. 112. I shall have to come back to the Committee on the others.

<A NAME="40210-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I had just completed the remarks I wanted to address to Amendment No. 112 and I had indicated that in certain crucial areas the Government had an open mind on certain propositions in the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40210-24_para9"></a>On Amendments Nos. 122, 123 and 144, while the Government supports the aim of safeguarding the renewables fund against default, there are a number of problems that need to be overcome before we can accept amendments to the Bill to address the issue. I recognise the concern expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, in moving the amendment on the current issue. Companies can and do fail and as the renewables obligation is a market-driven mechanism, there is a limit to the extent to which the Government should intervene. When the problem of the shortfall occurred in the autumn, the Government made it clear that they had no plans to make good the shortfall as that would undermine the concept of a free market in renewables obligation certificates. I note that, although the amendments are constructive&#151;they were moved in a constructive manner&#151;none of them addresses the current shortfall, which is the cause of considerable concern and anxiety.
<P>


<a name="column_GC519"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC519</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-24_para10"></a>We are working with the industry to consider ways of minimising the impact of a future shortfall. The Government are already committed to taking action to address the issue of late payments and are bringing forward changes to the renewables obligation order to effect that change. I should also emphasise the Government's commitment to the renewables obligation as the most effective mechanism for delivering our renewable energy targets at an acceptable cost to the consumer. We have demonstrated that commitment by the announcement last December to increase the level of the obligation for the years between 2010&#150;11 and 2015&#150;16.
<P>

<a name="40210-24_para11"></a>A number of options for addressing the shortfall have been put forward in our discussions with the industry, and we had the advantage of some of those being voiced today when the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, moved the amendment. Most of the options are contained in the framework of the three amendments that we are discussing.
<P>

<a name="40210-24_para12"></a>While securing the buy-out fund, as suggested by Amendment No. 122, would no doubt provide some additional confidence in the market, it would do so at a high price. To require suppliers to put in place such security measures could have a harmful effect on competition by discouraging new entrants through the requirement to provide additional upfront funds. That burden would bear particularly heavily on smaller suppliers. The noble Baroness emphasised her concern about small suppliers. We also need to consider the costs to consumers. Noble Lords will be aware that those are very real problems with no obvious solutions within the timescale of the Bill. While we are therefore unable to accept these amendments, we recognise the spirit in which they have been moved. We are continuing discussions with the industry, given the seriousness of the problem, and the importance of a properly functioning renewables market.
<P>

<a name="40210-24_para13"></a>Amendment No. 123 envisages the widening of Ofgem's powers into areas that we do not believe fall naturally to it as a regulator. My most negative response is to Amendment No. 123, which seems to produce a series of functions for a regulator that are difficult to encompass.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Tombs: </B>   Perhaps I may challenge the Minister on what appears to be an uncharacteristic inconsistency. Does he agree that the renewables obligation itself constitutes an intervention in the free market?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Certainly, in one sense it creates a special market. If I live long enough I probably could not think of a free market in economic affairs anywhere in the world. I hear what the noble Lord says; he has made an obvious point: there is an aspect of the renewables that is managed. I was seeking to emphasise something rather different from suggesting that the regulator should take up functions that would give the capacity for a whole range of very significant interventions in the market that would not normally fit in with the concept of regulation.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-24_para14"></a>I move on to a slightly more constructive and positive point. While the Government support the aim of Amendment No. 144 which seeks to safeguard against supplier default, the amendment does not, of itself, provide any mechanisms that would reduce the likelihood of suppliers defaulting. As I have said already, the renewables obligation is a market-based mechanism, and in competitive markets, there are inevitably risks of failure. This provision could be seen as placing a duty on the Secretary of State to safeguard against supplier default, which is not consistent with our market-based approach&#151;I believe I take the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, with me on that.
<P>

<a name="40210-24_para15"></a>Nonetheless, the Government take the issue of supplier default very seriously and we are working at present with the industry to develop means of reducing the likelihood of supplier default and mitigating its impact. Again, I give the undertaking to the Committee that if we make progress in sufficient time we shall bring forward government amendments to address that issue in the Bill. However, it will be recognised that the progress of the Bill is taking place against a background of a particular difficulty, occasioned last autumn. We have to address how we tackle that. In fact, the amendments are drawn from that experience, to see how we can rectify the situation for the future. I am asking for recognition by the Committee that, if we make sufficient progress before we get to later stages of the Bill, we shall introduce government amendments to incorporate an agreed solution to the issues that we are discussing with the industry.

<A NAME="40210-24_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   The Minister has made a slightly provocative statement, suggesting that if we do not make sufficient progress, he will not introduce the amendments. I am sure that is not his intention; if the amendments are justified in their own right, I hope that he will introduce them.

<P>
<A NAME="40210-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I was suggesting that the amendments themselves do not necessarily produce the solution to the position that we need to arrive at and which we shall obtain through discussions and agreement with the industry. I am not in a position to say what we would do as a fallback position, beyond the amendments. I am saying that we shall strive to reach an agreement that enables us to table amendments at an appropriate stage of the Bill. Of course, noble Lords will see the development of the position during the course of the Bill and will no doubt retable various solutions to the difficulties if they feel moved to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am most grateful for the explanation, but from the way in which his statement was worded, it seemed that the future of the amendments depended on the progress of the Committee, rather than the progress of negotiations outside. He has made the matter plain and there is no need to say any more.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I am a little surprised that there should be any qualifications about Amendment No. 144, as all it <P>


<a name="column_GC521"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC521</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>does is enable the Secretary of State to work up solutions. I am sure that if a specific solution had been mentioned in the amendment, the Government would have found many reasons why they could not be applied, because the matters are complex and difficult. It would help if we were satisfied that the Secretary of State will address the problem; that is all that the amendment says.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   As I suggested in my initial remarks on the amendment, we are entirely in sympathy with the thinking behind it and we are already conscious of the necessity for action against the proposition. That is the action that we are carrying out at the present time. Because of the negotiations that are taking place and because we are still at Committee stage when there are opportunities to address the issue further, we are simply asking for a recognition that later we may be in a position to be categorical about our solutions to the situation and to provide exactly the right amendments to the Bill that will encapsulate the proposed solutions to the problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-25_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I thank the Minister for what was overall a sympathetic hearing to my remarks. I am not sure whether he was just trying to be charming&#151;although he is always charming, as my noble friend has just said. He addressed my remarks kindly, but the bottom line is that the Government are as confused about how to find an absolute solution as we were in promoting a solution. I made it clear that we believed that securitisation was probably the better route, but on the other hand the problem is not easily solved. There can be difficulties with both options.
<P>

<a name="40210-25_para0"></a>I was interested in what the Minister said in discussing Amendment No. 122, when he said that it might interfere with the free market. I drew a deep breath and thought, "That is absolutely wonderful, the Government have come now to agree with the free market". However, the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, in his extraordinarily perceptive question, altered my point of view. The Minister then said that of course there was not a free market anyway, so we did not arrive at a situation that answered Amendment No. 122.
<P>

<a name="40210-25_para1"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, for his support for Amendment No. 144. Perhaps the Minister could point out the words in the amendment that bother him. We are saying "as soon as practical", so the Government can choose the time after the passing of the Bill to make regulations to establish a scheme. The Minister says that of course he cannot accept the amendments yet, although he has sympathy with them&#151;that was the nice part. Then my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith used words that I had already written down: "If we make sufficient progress we shall find some solutions". I was very glad that that was clarified.
<P>

<a name="40210-25_para2"></a>However, the Minister said that it will take time to come to the solutions; therefore, it will be better if the passage of the Bill takes a long time so that the Minister has longer to find the solutions. The quicker <P>


<a name="column_GC522"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC522</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we are the worse matters will be. We are taking this serious amendment in a light-hearted fashion because we do not have an absolute solution and the Government certainly do not have one either. We understand that the Government will bring forward amendments shortly. Whichever way one looks at the matter, the bottom line is that, if there is a threat that people may not be able to pay the money and those who pay will somehow be obliged to meet the shortfall, there is a disincentive to people to become involved in the system. As long ago as December or November, the Government said that they certainly would not make up the shortfall, so there is a problem. With respect, the Government have to find the solution to the problem, however difficult it is.
<P>

<a name="40210-25_para3"></a>In a moment I shall withdraw the amendment, but first I would like to hear the Minister's response to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. What is wrong with Amendment No. 144? Which part of it does the Minister believe makes it impossible for him to accept? The amendment simply enables the Government, in due course&#151;as soon as they are able&#151;to make regulations to deal with the matter. The Minister has said that at some stage they will do something about it, but there is no timescale in Amendment No. 144 so I believe that the Minister could have been more direct.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I apologise if I was less than direct. Part of the problem is that I have had a scattered approach to this group of amendments due to Divisions which have disturbed the coherence of my responses. Our anxiety about the proposed amendment is that potentially it would leave the Secretary of State liable for any failure. Accepting the amendment into the Bill&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-25_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I was referring to Amendment No. 144.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-25_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The amendment seeks to deal with the problems of default by suppliers. If agreement with the industry has not been achieved within the framework of the Bill and, therefore, we are not able to put forward amendments that are clear and satisfactory, we have to guard against producing legislation that would make the Government responsible for failure. That would be the implication of the issue of supplier default.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-25_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I thank the Minister for giving way. I am afraid that, in my humble view, it does not do that. I accept that it is a humble view but, as I said earlier, two lawyers are advising me separately. Let us consider the issue. The amendment states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State shall as soon as practical".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-25_para4"></a>
It will be for the Government to decide when it is practical. So far as concerns the Government, it may never be practical and therefore the amendment is not prescriptive in any way. It simply states that as soon as the Government are in a position to do something after the passing of the Act, they will make regulations to establish a scheme.
<P>


<a name="column_GC523"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC523</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-25_para5"></a>The Minister said that the Government are to come forward with a solution at some stage. Therefore, the amendment simply seeks to ensure that one day, when possible and when the Government have considered the matter and taken soundings from everyone, they will, as they said they would in Committee, come forward with a solution. The amendment even goes on to state that supervision of the scheme can be delegated and so on. The word "may" appears in the second part of the amendment and the first part is constrained by the words "as soon as practical". If it simply stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State shall after the passing of this Act",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-25_para6"></a>
I should accept everything that the Minister is saying. But the amendment deliberately does not say that. Under those circumstances, I consider it appropriate that we understand what is wrong in answer to the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-25_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I am no lawyer and therefore I hesitate to dispute the implications of the amendment. I believe that I can only convey to the noble Baroness and to the noble Lord who also spoke to the amendment that, despite the conditional words within it&#151;I recognise how gently the amendment has been tabled and how constructive it is&#151;we fear that its effect would be to place a duty on the Secretary of State which would then render him liable in these circumstances. That is our position.
<P>

<a name="40210-25_para7"></a>I have listened very carefully to what has been said today, and we shall examine the situation further. I am making this contribution against the background of strenuous efforts on our part to reach agreement with the industry and to solve the problems in order that the Bill can be implemented in time. That work is taking place with the greatest urgency and I make these comments against that background. That is our anxiety about the amendment and that is why, at this stage, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw it.

It may be easier if I deal with that while I am on my feet.
<P>

<a name="40210-26_para1"></a>The renewables obligation obliges licensed electricity generators in England and Wales to supply a specified portion of their electricity from renewables. Suppliers who cannot meet the percentage that they should must purchase renewables obligation certificates to make up their shortfall.
<P>

<a name="40210-26_para2"></a>While most CHP plant is intended to supply a particular industrial operation or site, if there is spare capacity the owner can become a licensed electricity supplier and sell it to the network. I would have thought that that should be encouraged, if only as a means of saving on the use of fossil fuels and reducing harmful emissions.
<P>

<a name="40210-26_para3"></a>The supplier will be subject to the renewables obligation and will have to buy ROCs to make up for any shortfall in his use of renewables. That is ridiculous. If, instead of putting his surplus current into the grid, he allows it to go to waste, perhaps by floodlighting his premises, leaving machines running all night and investing in an ornamental fountain, he would have to pay nothing. The rule places CHP generators in the same category as other generators, such as combined cycle gas turbines and coal-fired generating plant, which are not only less efficient than CHP, but emit far more CO2 per unit of electricity generated.
<P>

<a name="40210-26_para4"></a>The exemption of CHP from the renewables obligation is entirely justified by its energy efficiency. It will give a welcome boost to the technology now being developed. It is estimated that with the present liability to the renewables obligation it will cost the CHP sector about #100 million to support other renewable technologies by 2010, and that is hardly an incentive to get into the field. If potential CHP generators decide it is not worth their trouble to supply power to the grid, a whole slice of the Government's plans for reducing emissions, meeting our Kyoto obligations and supplementing our fuel supplies will simply be lost.
<P>

<a name="40210-26_para5"></a>Exempting CHP would be of immense benefit, for example, to the agriculture industry. As long ago as 2000, the Rural Commission urged the recognition of the benefit of agricultural CHP facilities. On the other side of the coin, the present situation has resulted in the loss of essential skills. I have been informed, for example, that a specialist turbine manufacturer in Newton Abbot has lost 25 per cent of its workforce due to a reduction in the demand for CHP. The short <P>


<a name="column_GC525"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC525</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>explanation of my amendment is that it would amend the Electricity Act 1989 so as to exempt CHP generating plants from the renewables obligation.
<P>

<a name="40210-26_para6"></a>The wording of Amendment No. 113ZA virtually speaks for itself. It follows logically from the argument in favour of Amendment No. 113. The plain fact is that the Government have no discernible policy on CHP, except for paying lip-service to the concept. However, it is not sufficient to be vaguely in favour of it, especially when, as I pointed out with regard to the previous amendment, far from encouraging the industry and the technology, owners of CHP plants are taxed and penalised in exactly the same way as the worst smoke producer in the country. The Government indicated that they were formulating a separate policy for this important source of supply and important way of reducing harmful emissions. However, it seems a long time in coming, and I do not understand why the policy could not have come in time for the White Paper and the publication of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40210-26_para7"></a>The amendment is a probing amendment and is intended to extract a proper timetable from the Government. I remind the Committee, particularly the Minister, that CHP is one of the most cost-effective ways of reducing the United Kingdom's carbon emissions. Those are not my words; they are those of the Government's climate change strategy and the Performance and Innovation Unit's review of energy policy in 2002. As recently as last June, the DTI calculated that every 1,000 megawatts of electricity from CHP saved between 0.7 million and 0.9 million tonnes of carbon. CHP enhances security of supply, which is a vital consideration, bearing in mind that electricity demand is calculated to grow by up to 19 per cent by 2020, on the one hand, and gas to contribute up to 75 per cent of generating fuel, on the other. By that time, we will be talking about imported gas.
<P>

<a name="40210-26_para8"></a>CHP helps to tackle fuel poverty, as using CHP with community heating can cut consumers' bills by up to 20 per cent. Bearing in mind the Government's fuel poverty target&#151;apparently already at risk&#151;I believe that it is an important factor. None other than the Prime Minister emphasised all the points that I have just made.
<P>

<a name="40210-26_para9"></a>The Government's response to the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee's report on the climate change programme in August 2000 paid similar lip service to CHP. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Utilities Bill provides a power to the Government to secure additional use of CHP through obligations on energy supply or distribution utilities to encourage or support CHP development, equivalent to the provisions for the promotion of energy generation by renewables".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-26_para10"></a>
But what has happened to that high sounding ambition?
<P>

<a name="40210-26_para11"></a>At Second Reading I referred to recent widespread losses across the CHP sector since the introduction of NETA. The failure to exempt CHP from the climate change levy and new regulatory costs being imposed on the sector by the extension of the renewables obligation are all contributing to CHP's problems.
<P>


<a name="column_GC526"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC526</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-26_para12"></a>More pious expressions of support from the Government are found in a letter from the Minister of State for the Environment to the CHP Association on 20 March 2000 which said in relation to the Utilities Bill:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I can confirm that the new powers for ministers to create obligations in relation to the promotion of energy efficiency could be used to create an obligation in relation to CHP".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40210-26_para13"></a>
Despite those powers which were carried into the Utilities Act, in which Sections 58 and 79 gave the Government power to set an obligation in relation to a specific technology, including CHP, the Government have not taken advantage of this. On the contrary, as I have just said, their policies seem to militate against CHP. Why is that? The theory is that there is infighting between Defra&#151;which has the responsibility for the Government's CHP target&#151;and the DTI which regularly tells the representatives of the CHP industry that the CHP target is "nothing to do with them". This is even though the DTI has its hands on the levers that need to be pulled to set the UK on the path to the Government's CHP target&#151;a target which will bring over #3 billion of investment into the CHP market and at the same time improve the competitiveness of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="40210-26_para14"></a>When I began my speech on Second Reading I questioned why what was essentially a DTI Bill was being conducted through your Lordships' House by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at Defra. However, there is definitely one advantage in this arrangement. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, with one stroke of his ministerial pen, will be able to set CHP back on the rails again. This amendment would put an end to dithering and would give the Government a firm instruction within a very short time limit to formulate, promulgate and instigate a much delayed CHP policy.
<P>

<a name="40210-26_para15"></a>The amendment would give the Government six months from the passing of the Bill to draw up their long awaited strategy and should concentrate the Government's mind, especially if they can begin working on it this very day rather than wasting further time waiting for the Bill to complete its passage through Parliament. The proposed new subsections (2) to (4) in the new clause require the Government to implement the new policy as soon as it is formulated rather than consigning it to some pigeon hole or other. Anticipating a possible problem with the parliamentary timetable, the amendment would authorise the use of secondary legislation rather than having to wait for a full legislative slot to become available. The very minimum that I expect from the Minister today is a firm date by which the Government's policy on CHP will be announced, and details of how, and how soon they expect to put it into effect.
<P>

<a name="40210-26_para16"></a>With the leave of the Committee and while I am on my feet I should like to mention Amendment No. 113ZAA which is an amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, to my Amendment No. 113ZA. I was very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, for supporting my amendment. I am interested that the noble Baroness, <P>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC527</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, has put down an amendment which may comprise a means of riding two horses at the same time.
<P>

<a name="40210-26_para17"></a>The amendment would require the policy to be formulated by the Secretary of State to distinguish between domestic and commercial users. I believe that on the face of it, this does not detract from my basic proposal. I do not really have a problem with it; the only thing is that the Government might say that it was too prescriptive, but I know not. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I support strongly the emphatic way in which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, has spoken to Amendments Nos. 113 and 113ZA. My noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer will be dealing with Amendment No. 113ZAA, in her name.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para0"></a>The Government's attitude towards CHP is becoming increasingly anomalous, as the noble Baroness pointed out. On the one hand, we have the strongest possible verbal support. All government publications on energy policy strongly support the concept of CHP for the reasons that the noble Baroness gave. On the other hand, the policy to support those warm statements is increasingly lacking. CHP is now going through a very difficult period, and has been for some time.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para1"></a>The report issued by the Government on CHP policy last year was extremely disappointing. It simply enumerated the measures which the Government had been taking without in any way indicating what further measures might be taken. Let us hope that the next report which the Government produce will show what should be done additionally to bring about the benefits which they freely admit would flow from CHP.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para2"></a>Meanwhile, Amendment No. 113 would correct a long-standing anomaly&#151;that CHP-exported electricity is penalised under the renewables obligation arrangements. It seems extremely odd that the Government have effectively required one low-carbon technology&#151;CHP&#151;to cross-subsidise another low-carbon technology&#151;namely, at present, wind. This just does not add up, and I should have thought that Amendment No. 113, as one step towards supporting CHP, was a highly desirable proposal for the Government to accept.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-27_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   First, I strongly support Amendments Nos. 113 and 113ZA. The only reason I have not put my name to Amendment No. 113 is because there are four names to it.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para3"></a>Amendment No. 113ZA is really a probing amendment for the Government. It is in no way intended as a criticism of the first amendment in the group. My noble friend Lord Ezra has much greater expertise than I in matters relating to CHP and the frustrations arising from the Government's attitude to it.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para4"></a>My amendment is tabled simply to discover whether the Government have understood the importance of the two different sectors&#151;the domestic user and the industrial and commercial user. Accepting <P>


<a name="column_GC528"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC528</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Amendments Nos. 113 and 113ZA would hit a large number of their targets for the domestic user in addressing fuel poverty, as well as providing affordable warmth and cheaper electricity, as Tony Blair himself said when talking about CHP. In addition, the industrial and commercial users would reduce emissions and use less fossil fuel. My amendment is simply to indicate the two very different sets of targets that the Government claim to have for two very different sectors, and both of them can be met by the amendments.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_time0"></a><H5>7.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I readily accept that CHP can make a significant contribution towards energy management and reducing carbons because of its recycling of heat, and that the objectives for CHP under our energy policy are ambitious. At present, we are not on a trajectory to meet them, so one could argue that CHP requires additional support to meet even the 2010 target of 10 gigawatts of CHP in operation.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para5"></a>The amendments, and the first one in particular, suggest a degree of support for CHP that would have knock-on effects for the rest of the energy industry. It tries to take three different approaches. First, it seeks to remove CHP from the base of those subject to the renewables obligation. Secondly, it seeks to define CHP as a renewable energy source for the purposes of the renewables obligation. Thirdly, it would redefine "fossil fuel" so as to exclude CHP.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para6"></a>There are serious problems with all of those proposals, although some are more substantial than others. The fact that we need to give further thought to the support and promotion of CHP is accepted by the Government. Indeed, as the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said, we shall need to introduce a further CHP strategy very shortly. Moreover, in terms of the interaction between CHP and the ROC provisions, as we said in the energy White Paper we shall undertake a review of the obligation in 2005&#150;06. I can give the commitment now to the Committee that part of that review will be to consider how CHP is handled in the context of the renewables obligation.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para7"></a>However, we need to be careful. The renewables obligation is intended to deliver a very substantial part of the energy policy in terms of the renewables figures. If we undermine that, there is no point in boosting CHP slightly. That is almost the obverse of the argument that the noble Baroness was using. We need to ensure that the renewables target is met and not undermined by anything we do for CHP, which should not be considered in isolation. If we removed CHP from the base on which the obligation is based, we would automatically reduce the size of the renewables market, which would threaten the delivery of the renewables target.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para8"></a>We need to maintain investor confidence in the renewables sector, as we need to remotivate investor confidence in CHP. However, proposed changes that would undermine investor confidence in renewables are not a sensible way in which to do that. Indeed, the CHP sector would not receive a huge boost were we to do that.
<P>


<a name="column_GC529"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC529</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para9"></a>Redefining CHP as renewable and including it under the renewables objective would have a far more major effect in relation to the renewables target. Existing CHP schemes generate far more electricity than the current level of the obligation. The output from the CHP target, if we meet the 10 gigawatts, will exceed the renewables obligation for 2010. It must be borne in mind that CHP is in most circumstances based on fossil fuel. There are exceptions; there is some CHP that is based on biomass, but in general it is based on fossil fuel. Its contribution in terms of our international obligations under the renewables directive is not allowable under that indicative target.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para10"></a>There is another alternative, I suppose, in that one could increase the size of the renewables obligation to take account of CHP so redefined. But that in itself would place a greater burden on the delivery of all the various strategies. Only in the circumstances in which CHP was using a renewable source could it be defined as a renewable fuel. None of that obviates the need for us to look at CHP and to see what more we can do for CHP, but I do not think that the amendments as they stand would achieve that. At least they would not achieve it without serious detriment to our other main target on renewables.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para11"></a>Amendments Nos. 113ZA and 113ZAA are unnecessary, in the sense that they do not do anything more than the Government are already doing. We have published the strategies on combined heat and power. We now intend to publish the final version after the Easter Recess to coincide with the publication of the first year review of the energy White Paper. That strategy will help to provide the foundation for a more secure future development for CHP.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para12"></a>There are a number of measures which the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said are not sufficient. Nevertheless, there are a number of measures already in place, the full effect of which need to be taken into account. The amendments to require greater reporting than we already do on CHP I think are unnecessary. The content of those amendments are already contained in the commitments the Government have given, are in the energy White Paper and will be reflected not only in the CHP report of the final strategy we intend to issue after Easter but also in the other documentation we intend to produce at that time. Specifying one particular area of that by legislation is not particularly appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para13"></a>So, while recognising the essential problem and that noble Lords are attempting to find solutions to it, I do not think that the Government could accept what is contained in Amendment No. 113. Certainly, the attempt to approach it on three different bases, all of which have some implications for the renewables target, is not sensible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-27_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   The Minister in his response to my noble friend's amendment has highlighted the problems that we face with the Bill. The honest truth is that the Government have no strategy at all. That is why we are labouring under such difficulties. From our debates yesterday on the climate change, the <P>


<a name="column_GC530"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC530</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government clearly have no strategy on nuclear. They obviously have a confused strategy on CHP. We have a certain amount of wind strategy; we are not even considering other forms of renewables within the Bill. I know that we shall not reach the amendment tonight on either biofuels or biodiesel. Biomass and wave power are not mentioned.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para14"></a>I have to say to the Minister that I am not surprised that some of these amendments moved by noble friend have been moved in such detail and with such great difficulty. It is difficult when one is actually fighting to try and get some form of sense into the Bill and all we are told is, "We are going to think about it. There is a final version coming after Easter. More documentation will be laid". I know it is late and I am not getting at the Minister. That makes it difficult for us all. It is difficult for him, but I can assure him that it is that much more difficult for this side of the Committee. So while some of his words are encouraging, I really feel I should put on record the fact that if the Government had a strategy it would make my life much easier.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40210-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I have to say to the noble Baroness that, with the best will in the world, the Government have a strategy for energy, which was set out in the White Paper. She may not agree with all aspects. She clearly does not agree with how we treated nuclear energy, but there is a very clear strategy. There are certain measures in that strategy which set out to deliver the objectives. We may need to come forward with other measures, both immediately and longer term. We recognise that. That is part of making sure that the strategy is delivered.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para15"></a>However, a piece of legislation is not a strategy. We have a clear strategy. We have measures, as I say, to deliver it. We may need to deliver parts or all of it. But I do not think that the Government can be accused of not having a strategy. This compares somewhat starkly with the fact that we did not really have an energy strategy for the previous 20 years. Effectively, the only policy then was to get energy as cheaply as possible through various competitive measures, some of which worked. But we did not have any clear idea of where we wanted the balance of energy to work out, or how we faced up to the environmental challenges which a free-for-all in energy was bound to produce.
<P>

<a name="40210-27_para16"></a>I feel slightly over-sensitive perhaps about accusations over strategy. I also think that the noble Baroness should be a little sensitive in that previous governments never produced any strategy whatever. While there may be parts of our strategy we still need to develop, and perhaps we can discuss those, they are at the outline of the strategy. The objectives of that strategy are fairly clear. I am sorry to make such philosophical and political points at this stage of the evening, but I doubt that we shall reach another amendment, and therefore I thought that I would place that on the record.

<a name="column_GC531"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC531</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for a long time, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. I expect that the Minister wanted to get something off his chest.
<P>

<a name="40210-28_para0"></a>I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, that I totally understand what she said. I did not have any problems with it, other than the fact that the Government are always saying that these things are too prescriptive, and I thought that that would give them an excuse to say no to the proposal altogether. I understand what the noble Baroness said about being on the Front Bench with the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and I agree totally with what she said. There is the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, and last week we heard from my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding. Sometimes, those of us who come to energy as part of a much bigger brief feel that it is nice to have experts around us. Although we do the very best that we can without the benefit of officials sitting behind us and we try to put forward everything in the best way that we can, the fact is that these are complicated matters. We are aware of that and are trying to do the best that we can.
<P>

<a name="40210-28_para1"></a>I shall not enter an argument with the Minister about whether the Government have a strategy or whether we had a strategy. It is too late in the evening for that. I shall say only that many people felt that the <P>


<a name="column_GC532"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column GC532</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>energy White Paper was deficient not only because the Minister said to my noble friend Baroness Byford, "Well, it's because you didn't say you wanted us to say something about nuclear energy; we never mentioned nuclear. Whether we did or did not want that or would or would not want it, it is for the Government to decide what they want in an energy White Paper, and that is how we are content to leave it". However, many people believed that what was in the energy White Paper would not produce sufficient energy to ensure that we had sufficient light and warmth and so on. CHP is one way in which we were trying to bridge the gap. I believe that that is important. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40210-28_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </B>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Agriculture in Northern Ireland has made the following Statement:
<P>

<a name="40210-28_para4"></a>The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for Northern Ireland launched a major consultation exercise in September 2003 covering the choice of the main implementation options arising out of the CAP reform agreement reached in Luxembourg on 26 June 2003. The consultation ended on 16 January 2004 and after having considered stakeholder responses and the relative merits of the available choices, I have decided to deploy the following options in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40210-28_para5"></a>Full decoupling of direct producer support will be implemented across the beef, sheep and arable sectors.
<P>

<a name="40210-28_para6"></a>Full decoupling of direct producer support will be introduced in the diary sector from 2005.
<P>

<a name="40210-28_para7"></a>The model of decoupling used will be a static vertical hybrid based partly on eligible land held in 2005 and partly on past patterns of individual producer subsidy claims.
<P>

<a name="40210-28_para8"></a>National envelopes will not be deployed at this point.
<P>

<a name="40210-28_para9"></a>Decisions on the use of the additional rural development regulation options are deferred and will be considered as part of a separate consultation exercise on future modulation policy scheduled to commence in March 2004.

<P>

<a name="40210-28_para10"></a>I have today made available copies of a consultation document on charging for services by fire and rescue authorities in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="40210-28_para11"></a>Authorities already have a power under the Fire Services Act 1947 to charge for services other than fighting fires. The White Paper <i>Our Fire and Rescue Service</i> gave a commitment to continue to provide such a power and to consult on any proposals to extend the charging regime.

<a name="40210-28_para13"></a>The consultation document contains details of the services for which authorities in England and Wales currently levy a charge and these form the basis of our proposals. Comments are welcome on any part of our proposals. In particular, we welcome responses on the direction of travel in respect of the provision by authorities of detailed advice or consultancy.

<P>

<a name="40210-28_para15"></a>The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has today published a draft Community Radio Order, associated Keeling Schedule and Explanatory Memorandum for public consultation. Copies of these documents are available in the House Libraries, or from the department's website. The department welcomes comments and the consultation period will last until 20 April 2004.
<P>

<a name="40210-28_para16"></a>This order proposes to introduce a new tier of very local, not-for-profit (or not profit-distributing) radio. Community radio should be different from, and complementary to, existing independent local radio. Community radio offers potential benefits in terms of social inclusion, local educational, training and experience, wider access for communities to broadcasting opportunities.

<P>

<a name="40210-28_para18"></a>Today, I tabled an amendment to the Employment Relations Bill concerning the provision of a new funding scheme. The amendment inserts a new section into the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 which would create a power for the Secretary of State to make funds available to independent trade unions and federations of trade unions to modernise their operations.
<P>


<a name="column_WS47"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column WS47</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40210-28_para19"></a>I envisage that the size of the fund would be in the region of &#163;5 million to &#163;10 million in total, with expenditure spread over several years, probably beginning in 2005&#150;06. The funding scheme would be used to support innovative projects in such areas as:
training union representatives (for example in the area of business and people management) in order to help to promote the development of high performance workplaces;
reviewing internal union structures and organisation and to support more efficient management systems within unions;
enabling unions to broaden their dialogue with members by greater use of the Internet and other new technologies and to develop innovative and user-friendly voting mechanisms; and
making union systems more accessible to young people and other underrepresented groups within unions.
<P>

<a name="40210-28_para20"></a>The case for establishing a fund is compelling. Unions, just like businesses, need targeted support to speed their adaptation to changing labour market trends and to new ways of working. Unions have done <P>


<a name="column_WS48"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2004 : Column WS48</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>much to modernise themselves and several, often supported by the TUC, have made significant progress in that direction. However, as a number of representations from unions have confirmed, without assistance the pace of change will be slow. By encouraging unions to adapt more quickly, we will ensure that they play their full and considerable part in building productive relations at work. That will benefit union members, other workers, their employers and the economy more generally.
<P>

<a name="40210-28_para21"></a>The fund will not therefore be used to support the day-to-day work of unions, and it will not impact directly on collective bargaining. It will not be used to support projects which could be funded from other government programmes.
<P>

<a name="40210-28_para22"></a>Subject to parliamentary approval of this new provision, the Government will publish for full public consultation the draft rules and procedures of the fund after Royal Assent. It is likely that these rules and procedures will draw on the example of the Partnership at Work Fund, involving an independent advisory board who will make recommendations to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State on the acceptability of union bids for fund money.

<A NAME="40210w01_spmin4"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs   (Lord Filkin): </B>  If the Government's proposed legislation on same-sex civil partnerships is enacted, couples who have ended their marriage to allow one partner to gain legal recognition in the acquired gender will be able to register a civil partnership and hence regain a legal status for their relationship.
<P>

<a name="40210w01_para7"></a>The Government are sensitive to the difficult financial and practical choices that may be faced by married transsexual people who wish to end their marriage and enter a civil partnership. We are determined to make the transition process between the end of a marriage and start of a civil partnership as quick and orderly as possible. Indeed, we believe it will be possible to dissolve a marriage and begin a civil partnership on the same day.
<P>

<a name="40210w01_para8"></a>Should there be a gap, as is likely, between the implementation date of the Gender Recognition Bill and future legislation on civil partnership, then transsexual people will be able to decide whether to delay an application for a full gender recognition certificate until it is possible to move from a marriage to a civil partnership. To assist applicants under the fast-track process, it will now operate for two years from implementation enabling applications to be delayed until arrangements are in place for civil partnerships.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

The Gender Recognition Bill will enable transsexual people who have gained legal recognition in their acquired gender to marry someone of the opposite legal gender. Such marriages will not be same-sex marriages.
<P>

<a name="40210w02_para0"></a>Before gaining legal recognition in their acquired gender, transsexual people will be required to provide the Gender Recognition Panel with evidence supporting a diagnosis of the medical condition, gender dysphoria. They must also convince the panel that they are living fully and permanently in their acquired gender.
