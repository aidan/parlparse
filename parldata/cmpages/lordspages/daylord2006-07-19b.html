The committee issued a memorandum in June 2006 to monitor Russian execution of the judgments, following the Russian action plan of March 2006 detailing the steps it intended to take towards implementation. Her Majesty&#146;s Government have also raised the matter through the EU-Russia human rights consultations: in September 2005 during the UK presidency; and most recently in March, in consultations in Vienna. We will continue to press Russia to implement fully the court&#146;s judgments.</p>

Does he agree that the intransigence of the Russian authorities and the refusal to take effective remedial action call into fundamental question the grave undertakings that Russia gave at the time of its admission to the Council of Europe about how it intended to become a full council member not only in letter but in spirit? Does he not also agree that that intransigence plays directly into the hands of extremists, because it undermines all those who might be won into a meaningful political process to overcome the continuing crisis in Chechnya by suggesting that everything else is ineffective and that the only thing to do if you really feel strongly is to go and join the militants?</p>

I agree that there has been far too little progress&#151;indeed, a distinct lack of progress&#151;on the part of Russia in implementing the European Court of Human Rights judgments. That is worrying and is likely to be taken by some as an encouragement to acts of violence. I would hope that, on all such occasions when people feel encouraged by violence rather than by appropriate use of political process, they will reflect on that and turn to political process rather than tothe gun.</p>

As we know, there is now fighting in Dagestan and west of the north Caucasus, in one or two other places that I am not even sure that I can pronounce. Meanwhile, the Russians are taking an entirely contradictory attitude towards separatism in Abkhazia and South Ossetia from the one that they take north of the Caucasus. Can we not attempt to put this into a regional context that includes the problems of the south Caucasus as well as of the north?</p>

However, I accept the basic premise that there is a risk of the conflict spilling out further. That is one of the reasons why there is a consistent effort by the Government to get the Russians to meet their obligations in the places where there are specific judgments against them that require them to meet those obligations and to ensure that nothing is done that causes the spread of violence.</p>

How can you enforce implementation of an order of this court, the jurisdiction of which the states concerned have declined to accept?</p>

We must try to ensure by persistent argument that the Russians meet those obligations fully. There is no state in Europe, coming into the EU or in any other part of the European architecture, that can sign up to such arrangements and then stand aside from them.</p>

In those circumstances, it is particularly important that this country should continue to give the example, as it always has in the past, of meticulously following and giving effect to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.</p>

Does he agree that Russia is now emerging as a mature nation anxious to reassume its great power status, or its co-operative status, and that we need its help and co-operation in resolving great issues such as those in Iran and the Middle East? The more we can talk to Russia in a mature way about the human rights failings and bring it to understand the danger that it runs of damaging its reputation and effectiveness and the virtue of obeying the rulings of the Council of Europe, the better progress we will make in solving many other problems as well.</p>

The dialogue between us and the Russians is vital across almost the entire range of international issues. That is why the consultations that have taken place in the EU-Russia human rights arena have been particularly important. We must continue those consultations. The Russians will understand that, as we accept that they have become a very significant force in the world again, they also have the obligations that go with being a very significant nation.</p>

I have had detailed discussions with the Israeli authorities, who have been very co-operative, for which I am grateful. Further information is being provided to me from Israel, including evidence gathered in the Israeli investigations. I shall needto consider that carefully before reaching any conclusions. At the same time, the Israeli Attorney-General is reviewing the cases in the light of the concerns I raised with him.</p>

The coroner asked him to require the Israeli authorities to hold proper investigations and for him to consider taking proceedings in the UK. Given the history of the cases, in particular the fact that the suspected killer of James Miller is not only still in the IDF but has been promoted in it, how confident is he that successful investigations can take place there? If he is receiving all the assistance that he needs from the Israeli authorities, which it seems is better than the coroner did, what is his timetable for deciding whether proceedings might be taken in the United Kingdom?</p>

How long it will take to reach a conclusion will depend on how long it takes to receive the information and to digest it. For example, the Israeli authorities are making special application to the Israeli military court in the Hurndall case to release to me information that would normally be kept closed and not be available to the families. Of course, it is difficult to reinvestigate something after this length of time, which is why it is important for me to consider as closely as I can the material that was gathered by the Israeli authorities at the time. I will keep the House informed of where I get to.</p>

I am very grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General for all that he has said, but is it not now plain that it is very unlikely that there will be any prosecution in Israel of those involved in the death of James Miller and equally unlikely that there will be a new inquiry to makeup for the deficiencies of the military police investigation? In those circumstances and in the light of the verdict in the coroner&#146;s court, does he agree that a prosecution in England seems at present the only way in which any justice will be done for James Miller&#146;s family?</p>

I must reserve judgment until I have been able to examine, with assistance, all the material available. The Israeli authorities have been co-operative. As he will know, I have very great sympathy for the families of both men. I will continue to consider my responsibilities, and I am committed to carrying those out completely.</p>

Will the noble and learned Lord confirm that that is an extraditable offence, with extraterritorial jurisdiction that the courts of this country have full power to deal with? Does he agree that the verdicts of the British juries, who heard all the evidence at that stage, are a firm foundation to issue a warrant already in this country regardless of any further investigations in Israel and for a request to be made by the Home Office for extradition to this country?</p>

The coroner&#146;s jury did not in fact hear all the evidence&#151;that is part of the criticism of what took place&#151;because it did not have available the information and evidence that had been gathered in Israel. The coroner was concerned that, as he saw it, he had not received co-operation. I hope that that will be remedied in the case of what I am looking at. We are not at the stage where it would be right to look for warrants. It is important to continue the investigation; that is what I am determined to do to reach a proper conclusion. Certainly, in theory, there are offences that would be extraditable.</p>

We have, however, no plans to issue specific guidance to courts recommending delay to the start of a custodial sentence in cases where an offender may need to make childcare arrangements.</p>

Does she agree that more than 17,000 children per year are put at risk by the imprisonment of their mother, albeit sometimes only for short periods? Will the Government study the best practice of European courts, including even Russian courts, on the matter? Finally, will they seek to maximise the discretion of our courts and, whenever possible, avoid the imprisonment of mothers with young children?</p>

We are also looking at what we can do further to ensure that the contact and connection between parent and child is maintained in an appropriate way to assist the children and to enable the offenders to serve their time more efficiently and effectively, because such situations are incredibly distressing, particularly for mothers who are separated from their children.</p>

I absolutely understand the anxiety expressed, but I say to the House that the issues are often encompassed in proceedings before sentence, when there is an opportunity for a court to adjourn a hearing to get reports and so on before determining the most appropriate sentence. The Criminal Justice Act now allows us comprehensive and tough community sentences, which are often more appropriate for those who are not dangerous.</p>

It is government policy, after all, that all but the most prolific and serious offenders should be dealt with in the community and not by custodial sentence. Those community-based penalties are essential if women and their families are not to suffer the extremely damaging effect of a mother&#146;s incarceration. What concrete plans are there to expand that provision and to convey that to the sentencers so that they have confidence in them and will use them more extensively?</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_3"></a>What steps they propose to take to ensure that retired racing greyhounds are dealt with humanely.</p>

<a name="06071971000063"></a><b><a name="60719-0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="06071971000604"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Rooker):</b> My Lords, the Animal Welfare Bill, currently before your Lordships&#146; House, will introduce an offence of failing to provide for the welfare needs of an animal. That will apply to owners and keepers of all animals, including racing and retired greyhounds. In addition, we are considering making specific regulationsunder the Bill in relation to the welfare of racing greyhounds.</p>

<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="06071971000064"></a><b><a name="60719-0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="06071971000605"></a>Viscount Falkland:</b> My Lords, the House will be encouraged by the Minister&#146;s comments, but I fancy that the public outside may need a little more persuasion, particularly in view of the fact that this week there was some emotive and rather misleading publicity about putting down dogs&#151;that is why I asked my Question. Is not the reality that there are about 3,000 fine racing greyhounds in existence at any one time that are bred exclusively for racing and for the enjoyment of their owners and the public? They have a very short racing life and little expectation of an existence after it. At the moment, the public perceive, probably accurately, that, at the lower levels of the sport of greyhound racing, dogs are not put down humanely but are often abandoned in appalling circumstances. Will the legislation be complete and thorough enough to catch those who operate in less well regulated areas than the major greyhound racing organisations?</p>

<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="06071971000065"></a><b><a name="60719-0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="06071971000606"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, the answer to the final part of the noble Viscount&#146;s question is in the hands of the House. We have completed Committee, and Report is due in the overspill. Those issues were raised at Second Reading and in Grand Committee, and the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, like others, raised the point. There will be plenty of opportunity to raisethe issue.</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="06071971000066"></a>The noble Viscount said that there had been an erroneous press report, but I do not know whether it was erroneous. An investigation is going on. Wehave asked the National Greyhound Racing Clubto investigate. Other appropriate investigating authorities are looking at the issue, because it involves waste disposal, planning permission, animal welfare, the landfill directive and the income tax authorities. Plenty of regulatory authorities are able to look at those allegations.</p>

<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="06071971000067"></a><b><a name="60719-0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="06071971000607"></a>Lord Lipsey:</b> My Lords, I declare an interest as chairman of the British Greyhound Racing Board. Is my noble friend aware, despite what he has just said, that this abhorrent practice is not definitely illegalat the moment but is contrary to the rules of the National Greyhound Racing Club which, I am confident, will deal with the utmost severity with any licensed trainer who is proven to have been involved? Is the Minister further aware of greyhound racing's strong support for action under the Animal Welfare Bill regulations that would make the sanctions available to the NGRC, so far as the official industry is concerned, also available to be used against trainers at tracks not run by the NGRC?</p>

<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="06071971000068"></a><b><a name="60719-0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="06071971000608"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, my noble friend is perfectly right: there are about 50 tracks, 32 of which are governed by the National Greyhound Racing Club, and there are about 18 independent tracks. Of course, one of the issues is to ensure that all animals, whether they are racing at the regulated tracks or the independent tracks or are retired, are properly looked after and that their welfare is considered.</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="06071971000069"></a>This is an emotive situation, and we need to get the facts of the case. I understand that the National Greyhound Racing Club releases about 11,000 greyhounds a year into racing and that there are about 30,000 active dogs. The Retired Greyhound Trust has rehoused 35,000 dogs since 1974. It is clear when one looks at the sums&#151;I do not know the exact number of dogs involved&#151;that many dogs go missing.</p>

This problem has been going on for a very long time. Can we fully expect the Animal Welfare Bill to return quickly in the overspill? I am disappointed that it is to be left to the overspill.</p>

It is in the hands of the House. The Bill will have its Report and Third Reading. We shall have plenty of opportunity to debate amendments to the Bill and to raise issues related to this point, and maybe we shall have a few more facts relating to this case&#151;at the moment they are only allegations. As I said, plenty of regulatory authorities are able to look into the allegations.</p>

Does he agree that the problem does not solely affect spent greyhounds and that other sports animals may be treated in a not dissimilar way to what has been reported in the <I>Daily Mail</I>? One hopes that the Animal Welfare Bill will consider them as well as what has been in the news.</p>

Racehorses are sporting animals, andif they are slaughtered it is in a regulated slaughterhouse. There are rules for that, and the pet food industry probably receives the proceeds. I understand that about 1,000 greyhounds weigh about 20 tonnes, and greyhounds going to landfill that may or may not be regulated is slightly different. I hope that by Report we shall have many more facts about the situation.</p>

Throughout the stages of that Bill, however, he has said that it is regulatory and that the detail is for the Government to bring in through regulation. Is that how he intends to deal with the greyhound issue?</p>

We have agreed to bring in some of the regulations earlier if necessary, in 2009 rather than 2010. I am not saying there is an instant solution. It may be that anything that has happened is quite legal. We must have the allegations looked into and not jump to judgment.</p>

That would have led to better overall welfare for all greyhounds in the end.</p>

A working party is looking at this. There are two sets of tracks. We want to ensure that the welfare of animals should not be differentiated according to whether they are at regulated or independent tracks. We need vets and welfare personnel to look at that. Also, we were in Grand Committee, so we did not have any votes.</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="06071971000087"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I made the argument for this amendment on Report. I undertook to read <I>Hansard</I> after the Minister&#146;s response, because I was not totally clear in my own mind that he was not right. Having done so, and looking at Section 30 of the 1998 Act,</p>
<ul><a name="06071971000270"></a>&#147;Exclusion of Ministers from office&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="06071971000246"></a>and reading it pretty carefully, I do not believe that the section goes far enough. That is especially true as at an earlier stage I did not move the amendment to alter the pledge of office and chose to follow through with this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="06071971000088"></a><b><a name="60719-0002.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="06071971000621"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, I understand the concerns over this matter and indeed, as we have said before, we have a good deal sympathy with what the noble Lord seeks to achieve through the amendment. But, as I have also said before, this is not the way to achieve it.</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="06071971000089"></a>The amendment would allow for the removal of a Northern Ireland Minister who was no longer committed to upholding the rule of law. The underlying aim&#151;that support for the rule of law be embedded into the political life of Northern Ireland&#151;cannot, of course, be faulted. That much we are all agreed on and that is what the Government have consistently said. We ultimately want all parties, including Sinn Fein, to unite in support of the policing arrangements in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="06071971000090"></a>The amendment does not help us to achievethis aim. It is unnecessary and adds no value to the requirements already in place. Moreover, the Secretary of State has already made his position on this matter very clear and has repeatedly said that he will not set any further preconditions for anyone entering devolved government. That is the end of the matter. There will be no more preconditions. There are no excuses for devolved government not to be up and running, and we will not erect any more hurdles.</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="06071971000091"></a>The arguments against this amendment have been well rehearsed as the Bill has passed through this House. Noble Lords are aware of the requirements of the pledge of office under the 1998 Act. I have outlined many times the protections afforded by the pledge, which all Ministers must affirm before taking up their posts. It requires a commitment to non-violence and to exclusively peaceful and democratic means. As I said on Report, safeguards exist for where Ministers and parties fail to observe the pledge of office. The pledge is not simply words on paper; safeguards exist in case it is broken.</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="06071971000092"></a>In addition, on Report, I set out the statutoryduty to uphold the continued independence of the judiciary that all Northern Ireland Ministers are subject to under Section 4 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. The judiciary are the guardians of what we know as the rule of law. Therefore, the duty in the 2005 Act is the right and fitting way to ensure that the rule of law is upheld and is embedded into Northern Ireland&#146;s political life, rather than a further unnecessary amendment to the Bill. The amendment is not needed: the protection already exists in the pledge and in the 2005 Act.</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="06071971000093"></a>As I have said, we do not question the principle of what the noble Lord seeks to achieve; nobody does. However, for the reasons I have set out, we are firmly of the opinion that further safeguards are unnecessary. However, we recognise the strength of feeling and depth of concern on this matter, and I reiterate that we stand ready to take forward in legislation any changes to the pledge of office that the parties can agree on in the context of a package on other constitutional issues. I therefore hope that the noble Lord will not press his amendment.</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="06071971000094"></a>With the leave of the House, because this is the last opportunity I will have to speak on the Bill as it passes through the House, I have a short point to add. We all agree on the significance of the Bill. It recognises and builds on the ongoing transformation of Northern Ireland. It looks to the future and recognises the possibilities that lie ahead. I have set out why I do not believe that the amendment inserting the process for amending Orders in Council that was accepted on Report is helpful. However, the ministerial team and I recognise the strength of feeling in both Houses about the inadequacy of the present arrangements for dealing with the bulk of Northern Ireland legislation. They are very unsatisfactory. I am therefore prepared to give the House the following undertaking: between now and 24 November, our focus is fixed on getting devolution up and running, which is plan A, and we do not want to be diverted from that. However, if that does not prove possible, for whatever reason, the Government will quickly introduce measures to make direct rule more accountable, including provisions that will enable Orders in Council to be amended in the light of views expressed by Members of both Houses in a way that reflects the spirit of the amendment passed by this House on Report. There will be an opportunity, agreed through the usual channels, for an amendability stage in the parliamentary consideration of Northern Ireland Orders in Council. We will also ensure that we legislate for Northern Ireland by a Bill&#151;primary legislation&#151;wherever appropriate.</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="06071971000095"></a>On Irish donations to political parties, I regret that the amendment was pushed to a vote and the clause was removed on Report. I have written in detail to noble Lords about this matter. The effect is to bar entirely donations from Irish citizens and other bodies to political parties in Northern Ireland from November next year. This change clearly goes against the spirit of the Good Friday agreement and would have serious repercussions for the parties and the political process in Northern Ireland. That is why the Government will seek to overturn that amendment in another place.</p>

This is huge step forward and something that for 30 years we in the Ulster Unionist Party has been pressing for. It will take one of the more unacceptable edges off direct rule and help to make it more democratic. I hope that it will put an end to the scandalous situation that obtained in this House last week when legislation was forced through against the wishes not just of the Northern Ireland Members but of the people of Northern Ireland without the opportunity of discussing it in detail and focusing on aspects that could have been changed. There could have been legislation last week that would have been acceptable to people and which would have achieved most of the Minister&#146;s aims had there been the opportunity to deal with it in the way which I now hope will happen after November of this year. So I welcome that.</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="06071971000099"></a>However, I must also say that I do not welcome what the Minister said about the other change that was made on donations. I disagree entirely with his comment about the amendment being contrary to the Belfast agreement. That is not how I read the Belfast agreement and I claim to have a little expertise on the matter.</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="06071971000100"></a>I make one other point on the substance of the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. I understand the principle behind it. He is entirely right that persons who do not support policing should not be in office. Whatever the arguments may have been a number of years ago, we now have settled arrangements for policing, which are broadly endorsed, and there can be no excuse for any party not endorsing and supporting policing as things stand. The Government are making a huge mistake in their approach to republicans by continuing to try to induce them with further concessions on devolution of policing, which is wholly premature.</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="06071971000101"></a>However, it might help the House on the substance of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, to put in a little of the background. The amendment is to the provisions of the Northern Ireland Act for exclusion of Ministers from office. The mechanism in the Act is defective. We recognised that it was defective on 10 April 1998 because the mechanism depended on cross-community support, and we knew as a political reality that cross-community support would not exist then or in the future. Consequently, on the afternoon of that day we went to the Prime Minister and raised the matter. He communicated with us before the agreement was made&#151;that is crucial in terms of the interpretation of the agreement&#151;that if it turned out that the provisions of the Act on exclusion of Ministers were ineffective, he would support changes to the agreement. It was on the basis of that undertaking that I and my colleagues endorsed the agreement.</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="06071971000102"></a>I am happy to say that the Prime Minister kept his promise. He kept it by ensuring that the Northern Ireland Act 2000 was enacted, which noble Lords will realise gives the British Government unilateral power to suspend the Assembly, which has been exercised&#151;and was exercised most recently in 2002 after an ultimatum given by my party to the Prime Minister following the discovery of the extent of the criminality that the republicans had been engaged in. I hope that that safeguard, which in our view was crucial to the making of the agreement, is sustained and will achieve the objectives that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, has put forward. I hope that when the Minister said that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, was unnecessary he had that Act in mind and that procedure which has been used and should be available in the future if it turns out that republicans return to criminality.</p>

I thank the Minister for placing on record the Government's intention to address how we legislate for Northern Ireland in Westminster. It has been a long time coming. My noble friend Lord Smith of Clifton has been leading the charge, so to speak, on that point for a long time. We have certainly raised concerns on the matter for at least two years and we are very grateful that the Government have now fully taken those concerns on board and are prepared to act. We appreciate that the Government are firmly committed to the 24 November deadline and understand that we must concentrate first on restoring the Assembly.</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="06071971000104"></a>However, if devolved power is not restored to Stormont by that date&#151;of course, we sincerely hope that politicians in Northern Ireland will be able to find a way through the current impasse&#151;how quickly will the Government move to put the new arrangements in place?</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="06071971000105"></a>We on these Benches also very much welcome the intention to legislate for Northern Ireland by primary legislation, where appropriate. Can the Minister clarify precisely what that means? Are we likely to see more Bills such as this, where a number of unrelated measures are scrutinised at once, or will it mean that Northern Ireland measures will be included in legislation for England and Wales that is proceeding through Parliament?</p>

<a name="60719-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="06071971000106"></a>Given our debates on anonymous registration, it would be much better if provisions for Northern Ireland were included in that way. However, we appreciate that that would require discussion between various government departments. Can the Minister assure the House that there will be better co-operation and co-ordination between the various Northern Ireland departments and departments in Whitehall?</p>

It has considerable significance, which is not only recognised in our Parliament here in Westminster but will be very important to the people in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="60719-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="06071971000108"></a>I repeat what I warned about a few months ago: when the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Prime Minister of the Republic of Ireland met in Armagh city, they implied that there was a plan B, should devolution not proceed by the deadline of24 November this year, and that that plan B would be further involvement of the Republic of Ireland in the internal affairs of Northern Ireland. I warned that that was having a dangerous impact on the loyalist community in Northern Ireland and that alarm bells were ringing across the Province. The day after the meeting in Armagh, the UDA and UVF&#151;two illegal organisations which had said that they were going to decommission&#151;announced that their plans for decommissioning had been abandoned. That was a real warning of the impact of the Armagh meeting on the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="60719-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="06071971000109"></a>Today's statement by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, is therefore not only good for the procedure of legislation relating to Northern Ireland under the direct rule system but, it should improve political attitudes on the ground in Northern Ireland. As an Ulster Unionist, I recognise the courage of the noble Lord in coming forward today to clarify what will be the procedures should there be no devolution by 24 November.</p>

<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="06071971000110"></a><b><a name="60719-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="06071971000627"></a>Lord Tebbit:</b> My Lords, very briefly, first, I thank the Minister for his courtesy in writing to a number of us last week about the misunderstandings that went back and forth over donations to political parties. His explanation is clear. There may still be some small ways in which the provision could be misused, but they are not significant; so I am grateful to him.</p>

<a name="60719-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="06071971000111"></a>I should also say&#151;I will say it this way to save the time of the House&#151;that I very much agreed with everything that the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, said. So I do not have to say it again. Finally, can the Minister confirm in as many words&#151;he has come pretty close&#151;that if it became clear that any Minister was not committed to upholding the rule of law in Northern Ireland, that Minister would promptly be excluded from office? If he can say those words, it will make a great deal of difference to how we might look at the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Glentoran.</p>

<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="06071971000112"></a><b><a name="60719-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="06071971000628"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, I am sorry to have dumped this on the House. I had no other opportunity to do so, as there is only one amendment. The rules of this place&#151;there are no rules of this place&#151;make it easier to do these things, because we do not have Third Reading speeches. We are going to come back to this, because the other place will consider the amendments to the Bill and there will be an opportunity on Tuesday for us to deal with that. The answer to the final question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, is yes. I appreciate what he said about the letter, which I hope clarified the position. It certainly cleared it up for me.</p>

<a name="60719-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="06071971000113"></a>I am also grateful for the broad welcome given by the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, to the short statement that I was able to give. Let us make it absolutely clear that we do not want direct rule; we want the Assembly back. In the event that we continue with direct rule, the entire legislative framework and the laws governing Northern Ireland will be made here at Westminster, and there will be more scrutiny than there has been in the past 30 years. That is quite clear from the statement. No one need be in any doubt whatever about that in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="60719-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="06071971000114"></a>The noble Baroness made a point about speed. Usually when Ministers want to hedge things, they say, &#147;We will do this in due course&#148; or &#147;We will do this shortly&#148;. I actually said&#151;I have it in bold in front of me, and I said word for word,</p>
<ul><a name="06071971000271"></a>&#147;the Government will quickly introduce measures to make direct rule more accountable&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06071971000247"></a>Quickly does mean quickly after 24 November. I do not know the date of the Queen&#146;s Speech at the moment&#151;there is a bit of flexibility at that point in the year because of the date of the State Opening of Parliament&#151;but it will happen quite quickly afterwards.</p>

<a name="60719-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="06071971000115"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, for his welcome and for the background that he gave but, to avoid any doubt, the Bill does not devolve policing. It enables policing to be devolved, but it was made abundantly clear before the noble Lord entered the House that it will be some way down the road before the trigger&#151;if I can use that term&#151;would be pulled to devolve. However, the Government were obliged to put on the statute book the legislative framework for the possible planned devolution of policing, which is what the Bill does. It does not devolve policing. That was made quite clear.</p>

<a name="06071971000116"></a><b><a name="60719-0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="06071971000629"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> My Lords, my comments were as much directed against certain foolish parts of the Secretary of State&#146;s speech on Sunday.</p>

<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="06071971000117"></a><b><a name="60719-0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="06071971000630"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, my right honourable friend does not make foolish speeches. He made an excellent speech on Sunday. It was quite a long one, and he said one or two things about the consequences if plan B comes into being; in other words, direct rule will continue. We have made it quite clear that we would not mind the shop, as now. The process of reform will continue, and in some ways it will speed up. The fact that the Bill will achieve Royal Assent does not mean that policing will be devolved. That is what I need to put on the record. It will be years before the circumstances will be right, but the point is that the legal mechanism is in place. In fact it has already been put there and this Bill clarifies certain points from other legislation.</p>

<a name="60719-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="06071971000118"></a>For 30-odd years we have dealt with unsatisfactory legislation for Northern Ireland. Having got an Assembly up and running&#151;and hoping that it would be back by now&#151;we have tried in the past 12 months or so to find a mechanism. But we have reached the point where we have said what we have said today, and that goes further than anything else over the past 30-odd years. It is a major upheaval. Let me put it this way: the usual channels will want to make sure that this is for Northern Ireland only. It is secondary legislation quite distinctly for Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="60719-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="06071971000119"></a>I want to make a final point. The other day someone mentioned the budget. In this House we do not debate in great detail the Budget for Great Britain; so I donot expect that we will be debating in detail the budget for Northern Ireland. There are rules on finance that we have to abide by, and I think that that is quite legitimate. But the general spirit of everything else shows that this is a major and substantial change to the democratic scrutiny of legislation under which the people of Northern Ireland live. I am grateful for noble Lords&#146; response to the statement. I hope that when the Commons have looked at the amendmentsin your Lordships&#146; House, and perhaps sent us a message back, we can reach an amicable solution so that the Bill can receive Royal Assent.</p>

<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="06071971000120"></a><b><a name="60719-0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="06071971000631"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, for that response and for the whole way in which he has handled the Bill for the Government. I refer in particular to a little incident that happened yesterday. Early in the afternoon I had a meeting with him in his office. Later in the afternoon, he was in my office and we reached a mutual agreement that we had it right at this end and the other end had cocked it up&#151;if I can use that language in this place. The result has finally come out of the machine and the statement he has read out is agreed by all of us. I think that it is a very good compromise.</p>

<a name="60719-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="06071971000121"></a>I have also read the Secretary of State&#146;s speech, which probably should not have been mentioned this afternoon. It took me about 20 minutes to read&#151;it is a very long speech. I am not sure that it was totally brilliant for the location in which it was made or for the audience to whom it was made. I thought he took a number of risks, but we shall find out how that has worked as it makes its way through.</p>

<a name="60719-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="06071971000122"></a>Having said that, I am afraid that I have to return to my amendment. On this occasion I think that the Government and the Minister are wrong and that it is necessary to strengthen this part of either the pledge or the reasons for removing Ministers from power. The point is critical&#151;crucial&#151;to the debate now taking place between the parties and there should be no fudging: it has to be absolutely crystal clear. I am sure that I am not being presumptive in saying that I know that the Minister agrees as strongly as I do that it is either right or wrong. You are either on-side with the police and the national judicial processes or you are not. Several times during the course of this debate the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has put it more succinctly than I can. Speaking not just for myself but also for my party, we would like something stronger in the Bill. I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

&#147;Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement about our plans for transforming the Home Office. I have today placed in the Library a copy of a reform action plan which gives full details of the changes we intend to make. All political change should start with values and objectives. &#147;The Home Office exists to protect the key elements of civilised society in this country&#151;to reduce fear and increase security, from global terrorism to local cohesion in our streets and communities; from justice and fairness through to the protection of opportunities to live life in security. But the context in which we seek to apply these values is changing faster than ever before, and changing fundamentally, creating new and different challenges for the future.&#147;In the past 15 years we have seen seismic geopolitical changes, from the global to the local. Globally, the old Cold War had frozen the world into relative immobility. States were static and frozen, ethnic tensions and religious extremism repressed, borders inviolable and peoples largely static. &#147;The end of the Cold War brought a torrent of new problems and, above all, the challenge of international mobility on a hitherto unimaginable scale. We have seen unprecedented levels of migration, with the movement of more than 200 million people in 2005, the development of international terrorism and the growth of global and organised crime. &#147;From global to local, relative immobility has given way to social and geographic mobility, where the old group allegiances, extended family relationships and inherited patterns of voting and religious observance have broken down and, with them, the old forms of community cohesion. &#147;Moreover, unlike most other government departments in this changing context, many of the people with whom the Home Office is tryingto deal&#151;prisoners, criminals and illegal immigrants&#151;see it as their primary objective not to co-operate with government and to resist our authority and evade our control.&#147;In the face of these challenges, the Home Office has been in a process of change and reform for some years. The department also has a more streamlined focus as a result of some of our responsibilities being transferred to other departments. &#147;I therefore pay credit to my predecessors in this Government and to the civil servants who worked for them in facing these challenges. They took a system that was designed before the Cold War and improved it in three important ways: additional resources, improvements in technology, and legislative and practical solutions.&#147;These improvements have led to notable successes in key areas: crime is down significantly; your chance of being a victim of crime is at its lowest level since 1981; we have record numbers of police and an additional 6,300 community support officers on the streets; asylum applications are now dealt with in two months as opposed to 22 months. The passport service, which was failing just a few years ago, now regularly tops customer service polls, beating leading private sector organisations.&#147;But the underlying systems and practices for dealing with these issues have not changed sufficiently. Many of the fundamental underlying systems in the Home Office were designed for a pre-Cold War era and, in the face of the huge challenges outlined earlier, we have now reached the limit of what can be achieved without a fundamental overhaul. &#147;The Home Office capability review, published today, strongly reinforces those views. We have seen some of these inadequacies surface recently, in co-ordination, administration and accounts. In co-ordination, the House knows all too well, for instance, how the release of foreign prisoners challenged systems across the Home Office and criminal justice system, and found them wanting.&#147;In administration, the House will know, for example, that the National Audit Office last year suggested that 283,000 unsuccessful asylum applicants might still be here, excluding dependants and those who claimed asylum before 1994 and after 2004, reflecting the difficulties that successive Governments have had in removing failed asylum seekers. This is reflected in IND&#146;s caseload of around 400,000 to 450,000 electronic and paper records, which, as the House will also be aware, are riddled with duplication and include cases where the individual has since died, or left the country, or are now EU citizens.&#147;In accounts, the House will also be aware that the Home Office&#146;s resource accounts for 2004-05 were disclaimed by the National Audit Office. We have sought to remedy these individual instances.I have today set out in a Written Ministerial Statement our plans to improve the way in which we deal with foreign national prisoners. We will tackle the caseload in IND with the aim of clearing it, not in 25 years, as has been speculated, but in five or less. And we will put our books in order. But, as today&#146;s capability review shows, we need to go much further in general and fundamental reform.&#147;For all these reasons, I am today setting out plans for an ambitious set of reforms across the department. In particular, we will sharpen the Home Office&#146;s focus on its core purpose of protecting the public through the six key priorities set out in today&#146;s plan. We will establish a new top team with a reshaped Home Office Board and 15 immediate changes at director level, which is over a quarter of all directors. We will reshape radically the structure of the Home Office with a major shift in responsibility and resource to the front line. We will fulfil our commitment to reduce the total size of the Home Office strategic and operational headquarters by 30 per cent by 2008. But we can also now make a commitment to a further reduction of 10 per cent by 2010.&#147;The cumulative effect of these changes will be to reduce the size of the headquarters of the Home Office and its agencies from 9,200 in 2004 to 6,500 in 2008, and to 5,900 by 2010. These changes will mark the biggest shift from the centre to the front line in the Home Office&#146;s history. We will save &#163;115 million per year by 2010 in headquarters costs which we will invest in improving front-line services.&#147;We will establish the Immigration and Nationality Directorate as an executive agency of the Home Office with a shadow agency in placeby April 2007, with strong accountability arrangements. We will establish clear performance frameworks for the operational services of the Home Office&#151;the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, the National Offender Management Service, and the Identity and Passport Service&#151;and hold the heads of those services accountable for performance.&#147;We will focus the National Offender Management Service headquarters on the job of commissioning high-quality services for managing offenders and driving up the performance of the probation and prison services. As a result,the National Offender Management Service headquarters will get progressively smaller, reducing by half by 2010.&#147;We will develop a renewed contract between Ministers and officials, clarifying respective roles and expectations in policy, operational delivery and management. We will seek to reduce further the bureaucratic burden on the police and other partners in tackling crime by implementing simpler performance arrangements for policing, crime and drugs. We are also launching today a radical reform programme with seven strands of change designed to transform the culture, skills, systems, processes and data of the Home Office.&#147;We have today set out a clear action plan to deliver this reform and more. By September, we will develop a full implementation programme. An external audit of progress will be conducted in December and annually thereafter. In the next few days we will supplement today&#146;s plan with two further sets of proposals for rebalancing the criminal justice system and reforming our Immigration and Nationality Directorate. &#147;We are determined to deliver a confidently led and well managed Home Office which delivers high quality services that protect the public and better meets their expectations. I thank my Ministers and senior officials for all the work already put into the development of our new plans. &#147;We do not start from year zero, and we will not end up with perfection. But this is the start of a long-term programme for transforming the Home Office. All involved&#151;Ministers, directors and staff&#151;know the extent of the challenge, and that this will not be accomplished overnight. But we are committed to early progress, to demonstrate our seriousness to the public and to our stakeholders and staff. The fundamental change we are seeking will require determination and endurance. This is the unglamorous hard work of delivering good government. That is now the task ahead&#148;.

<a name="06071971000131"></a><b><a name="60719-0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="06071971000634"></a>Viscount Bridgeman:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement made in another place by the Home Secretary.</p>

<a name="60719-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="06071971000132"></a>The past 12 weeks have witnessed a series of catastrophes at the Home Office, with daily disclosures of massive failures of policy&#151;from the release of foreign prisoners to murderers on probation, from sex-for-visa scandals to dangerous prisoners being put in open prisons, from hundreds of thousands of failed asylum seekers to massive numbers of illegal immigrants. This has been a spectacular serial failure of government. Each and every failure has serious implications for ordinary decent British citizens. At the very least, the Government waste hard-earned taxpayers&#146; money and put excessive pressure on housing and public services; at worst, they threaten public safety and national security.</p>

<a name="60719-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="06071971000133"></a>We need to understand why that has happened. The wrong analysis of the problem will lead to the wrong conclusion. The Home Secretary puts it down to the end of the Cold War, and with it the rise in asylum seekers and other threats. However, that does not explain why Britain has had the second highest number of asylum applicants in the world in the past five years, a Britain that is further away from the failed states than any other European country except for Ireland, which is an island and is therefore harder to get to, and has borders that are easier to control.</p>

<a name="60719-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="06071971000134"></a>The reason for the problem is clear. The new Labour Government repealed Conservative laws allowing us to send people straight back to safe countries. Labour terminated Conservative welfare arrangements designed to deter economic migrants, and failed to negotiate a continuation of our right to return asylum seekers to France. They later tried to reinstate some of these, but it was too late. In the next five years we had over a quarter of a million failed asylum seekers enter Britain&#151;failed asylum seekers, not legitimate ones&#151;with almost 90,000 in one year alone. That is why the immigration and nationality department was overwhelmed; that, and a political decision not to strengthen our borders.</p>

<a name="60719-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="06071971000135"></a>Of course there have been failures of management, but there have been much bigger failures of political leadership. The same is true elsewhere in the Home Office. The <I>d&#233;b&#226;cle</I> over foreign prisoners and early-release schemes that are not working safely and properly come from the same cause, which was a political decision not to build enough prisons&#151;although I pay tribute to the Minister for acknowledging that.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60719-0004.htm"/>


<a name="60719-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="06071971000136"></a>The Government&#146;s own review showed that they needed 100,000 prison places by 2010, but even after the 8,000 new places the Home Secretary announced today, they will have fewer than 90,000 places by 2012. Again, there have been failures of management, but in a system put under intolerable pressure by failures of political leadership. Since 1997 there have been more than 1,300 new regulations, many hundreds of initiatives and more than 50 major Home Office Bills. That is more than all the criminal justice Bills in the previous century. Some of those Bills were not fit for purpose. That is not just our opinion but clearly the Government&#146;s too. We should take, for instance, the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act: 110 of its provisions never came into force; 17 were repealed before they came into force; and 39 more were repealed after they came into force. This was not the only Act in this state&#151;massive amounts of work for no use whatever.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="06071971000137"></a>This is not a department which is impossible to run. Indeed, it has given up responsibility for no fewer than 24 policy areas since 1997. But, under the burdens of a target-driven, bureaucratic, top-heavy approach pursued by this Government, its central staffing has doubled, though I note the Minister&#146;s remarks about reducing staff. It is perhaps revealing that its press officers have trebled.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="06071971000138"></a>I finish on a positive note. Some of the Home Secretary&#146;s proposals announced today have merit. The agency proposals for the IND may improve some aspects of its management, but may make communications and co-operation with other parts of the Home Office more difficult. It will certainlynot absolve Ministers of responsibility for its effectiveness. We all hope that the measures announced today will succeed, but even if they do they are unlikely to resolve problems of the size the Secretary of State&#146;s department now faces.</p>

I trust that the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, had a pleasant visit to the United States and that she has some better news to offer at some stage.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="06071971000140"></a>It is too early to comment in detail since the plans were put in the Library only this morning. Suffice to say that this great office of state is in turmoil. We do not need convincing that the Government have lost their way in the 10 years since they came to power. I do not dispute the context in which the values and objectives have been set out. Of course, the Home Office exists to protect the key elements of our civilised society, but do we genuinely believe that it has been effective? We have failed to reduce the fear factor, and despite increased activity by the police and security services, the threat of global terrorism and the fear it generates are still there. We still cannot put a hand on our hearts and say that we have cohesion in our streets and communities. It is bizarre to blame the end of the Cold War for the Home Office&#146;s woes, when it ended 15 years ago and this Government have been in power for 10 years.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="06071971000141"></a>One has sympathy with the problems the Home Office has to deal with, comprising prisoners, criminals and illegal immigrants. The Government have for months ignored warnings about the prison overcrowding crisis. A last-minute panic measure to conjure up extra prison capacity does nothing to address the long-term nature of our prison crisis. Unless the Government are serious about breaking the cycle of reoffending, in which prisons act increasingly as a revolving door for repeat offenders, our overburdened prison system will remain under severe strain.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="06071971000142"></a>Why is it that the Government fail to acknowledge that at the root of the problem with criminals is their hyperactive attitude to legislation and half-baked media initiatives, with more than 50 law and order Bills and more than 1,000 new criminal offences, as rightly pointed out by the noble Viscount? It is a shocking indictment of the Government that despite five major immigration and asylum Acts there are more illegal immigrants unaccounted for now than 10 years ago.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="06071971000143"></a>There is a need for a clear and consistent policy approach, which is lacking. We spend weeks debating police mergers and then find that they have been placed on the back-burner. No Home Office, however structured, could deal with the Government&#146;s volleys of initiatives. Too many high-profile targets can jeopardise the Government&#146;s capacity to do anything else, because they focus all their energies on the one thing; hence tipping the balance of asylum seekers has led to the meltdown in all other areas of the management of illegal immigration.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="06071971000144"></a>The Statement says that the Home Office has benefited from the increasing streamlining of functions by the transfer of some policy areas to other departments. So why will it not commit to a separate department of justice and a department of the interior, to enable a more coherent approach to those separate issues? It is extraordinary for the Home Office to claim that it can deport 450,000 failed asylum seekers in less than five years when it is currently deporting only 15,000 a year. We welcome the proposal for a more independent IND, but that must not absolve Ministers of responsibility. They should consider separating asylum, which is quasi-judicial, in accordance with international obligations, from immigration.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="06071971000145"></a>In the present time of increased global tensions, we all want the Home Office to succeed in providing security for our nation. The recent revelation has shaken our confidence in the Home Office&#146;s ability to deliver it. Ten years in power is a long time to discover and discuss our errors. Let us hope that this new initiative works and that it is a department fit for purpose.</p>

It would be my pleasure to outline why I fundamentally disagree with the assessment that has been made of the way in which the past 10 years have been managed. The noble Viscount says that this is a Government in turmoil, as does the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. The noble Viscount says that there has been a consummate failure in policy. That would be a fundamental misunderstanding of the difficulties with which the Government have been faced, the challenges that we have met and overcome, and the success that this Government have been able to deliver for the people of this country.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="06071971000147"></a>I will straight away address some of the factors that have been alluded to. A heavy reliance has been put on issues in relation to asylum and immigration. It is right to remember the facts. Applications are down by 76 per cent compared to October 2002, which was its peak. In 2005, the intake was 24 per cent lower than in 2004; that was 25,720 compared to 33,960. Applications rose by 45 per cent between 1993 and 1997, which was a significant change. Asylum applications were down from more than 8,000 a month at the peak in October 2002 to just over 2,000 in the first quarter of 2006. Some 73 per cent of new substantive claims are decided within two months rather than the 22 months, including the old cases it took on in 1997 when we came to power.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="06071971000148"></a>The ratio of removals to failed applicants each year is going up. In 1996, the number of removals was equivalent to only 20 per cent of predicted unfounded claims. That proportion was around 50 per cent in 2004, and in 2005 it increased further to around two-thirds of unsuccessful claims. We removed more principal applicants in 2005 alone&#151;that is 13,670&#151;compared to the last four full years of the Tory Government; that is 12,020 in 1993 to 1996. Removals of principal asylum applicants increased by 184 per cent between 1996 and 2005, but the intake increased by just 13 per cent. We have increased removals and principal asylum applications by 91 per cent between 1997 and 2005. That is not failure; that is a lot of hard, dedicated work significantly to improve matters. </p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="06071971000149"></a>But a reality does have to be faced, because the Government had to decide whether to improve the system so that, in looking forward, we could have a better grip&#151;a system that was faster, clearer and more effective. One of the large problems with which we have been faced is not being able to deal with these applications quickly enough. The 22-month delay that we inherited meant that many people had put down roots and had made commitments that were difficult to disrupt. We have moved on.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="06071971000150"></a>So now is the time to look at the backlog. When one looks at the 450,000, it is right to bear in mind that in many of those cases we are not talking about individual people or individual issues, we are talking about applications. Some of the people involved will have died; some of them will have achieved their rights by a different means, because they have become European citizens; and some of them will have made multiple applications. So now is the time for us to look at this matter.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="06071971000151"></a>There has been major change in the criminal justice system&#151;the creation of the National Criminal Justice Board, local criminal justice boards, crime and disorder reduction partnerships and local strategic partnerships, all of which have benefited of the people of our country, together with the significant increase in police numbers and community support officers. Your Lordships may recall that many in this House derided those proposals initially, believing that they would have little or no effect. Yet we know that they have been among the most innovative and important changes that we have introduced. There was also legislation regarding anti-social behaviour&#151;and I could go on.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="06071971000152"></a>I must say as gently as I can to noble Lords opposite that I hear what they say about this Government&#146;s record, but I do not agree with them for the reasons that I have set out. However, it is clear that change is needed, because we are now faced with the need to bring about systemic change that will be better able to meet the new challenges with which we are now faced. Therefore, I very much welcome the comments in support of the changes that the Government now seek to make.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="06071971000154"></a>As I have indicated, I hope that we will be in a position, with the leave of the House, to discuss in greater detail the other supplementary documents that we hope to produce soon. This is an important and significant change and I welcome the welcome given to it.</p>

Much of what she said was fairly general regarding the problems of the immigration and nationality department, but will she confirm that not everything done by the immigration and nationality department should be condemned? For example, extremely valuable work is going on to facilitate the entry into this country of students wanting to enter further, higher and other forms of education. The immigration and nationality department&#146;s work in the Joint Education Taskforce, on which I have the privilege to serve, is extremely welcome and of enormous benefit, both in the short term and the long term, to the interests of this country, and is being done extremely well under the chairmanship of Alan Bucknall in the Home Office.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="06071971000156"></a>Will my noble friend confirm that the new system planned to be introduced relatively shortly for managed migration in the education system will not be detrimentally affected, because it is warmly welcomed by nearly all the participants in the Joint Education Taskforce and will not only bring great benefit, but is very much a high-level government priority, as shown in the Prime Minister&#146;s initiative for the attraction of overseas students? However, it does depend on the introduction of the new managed migration system.</p>

I hope that in the statistics I provided I indicated that I do not agree with the impression given by noble Lords opposite that this system was wholly unfit and, therefore, to be derided.

Cannot one moral be drawn from that? The efficient implementation of policy is important and good systems are important but even more important is political leadership, with the staff knowing clearly what the department is supposed to be doing and where it is going. We will not get very far unless the Government stop blaming staff and recognise, albeit belatedly, that the cause of the Home Office&#146;s problems over the years has been a massive failure of political leadership.</p>

My right honourable friend the Home Secretary says that even the best staff, if they were working within a system that is fundamentally flawed and if they did so for 24 hours a day, could not deliver that which they could deliver if they had a smooth, effective and efficient system. That is what we are seeking to change. We inherited a system that was moribund and we tried to work within it, and we got limited but good results. Having got the best results out of it, it is now time to change. Noble Lords opposite may not wish to remember this but I hope that they will recall that staff levels were dramatically cut under the previous Government and morale was adversely affected thereby. That is a matter of history that one should perhaps reflect on when we contextualise where we are now.</p>

I did that because I could no longer bear the incompetence of the whole business. I was giving cases my most careful and anxious scrutiny day after day knowing full well that the whole system that that was built on was flawed.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="06071971000163"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, gave a list of faults under this Government. I attribute quite a lot of the problems to the Tory Party&#146;s removal of work permits in 1992, which led to an increase in the number of asylum cases. Before that, asylum claimants used to be the intelligentsia from other countries but after that we got the people who came over mainly from the Asian subcontinent to work here for two or three years, to build their brick house in Pakistan, Bangladesh or India, and then to go back; then someone else would come over. A whole industry built up with agents taking thousands of pounds from families in order to get one person into this country to work. The agents used to say, &#147;You will have to go through the system but at the end don&#146;t worry&#151;you will not be removed; you will stay&#148;. Those people would have gone back in the past but they now stay.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="06071971000164"></a>Does the Minister agree that it is necessary to pay much more attention to people at entry points in airports? I know that in some cases&#151;Heathrow Airport, for example&#151;the immigration and customs posts are not manned in the early hours of the morning. Don&#146;t kid me&#151;the agents know this and that is when they bring people in. We do not know who goes out. I think it was this Government who stopped counting the people who leave. We need to know who comes in and who goes out. We also need much more co-operation between the Home Office and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. The Department for Constitutional Affairs is now cutting back on immigration judges and wondering why the cases are piling up, causing another backlog. Perhaps the noble Baroness could pay attention to those factors.</p>

The noble Countess will know that a huge part of the work that we have done in recent years has dealt with managed migration, giving people legitimate, honest, decent routes through which to come to this country, allowing them to come here in an honourable and transparent way so that those who come here to work diligently will have a better opportunity and will not fall prey to those who take advantage of their need to earn money to help their families back home. We have already seen some movement in that regard which is very beneficial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="06071971000167"></a>I hope the noble Countess knows that embarkation controls are now being considered. New electronic systems have given us a much better way of doing that. The situation with the embarkation controls that started to be removed in 1994 has now been addressed and we are starting to reverse that. We shall be better able to meet that challenge. I can assure her that I will work very hard indeed with the Department for Constitutional Affairs so that we shall have a better response to dealing with tribunal matters. We are considering how to speed up that process, make it more transparent and ensure that the information that goes to tribunals is better prepared than it has been hitherto.</p>

A number of prisoners escaped and we found it extremely difficult to deal with that because we had to deal with an agency. Therefore, I fail to understand how Ministers passing the buck to a new agency will enable them to provide the necessary leadership. If the Home Office has been doing such a brilliant job, as the Minister indicated, why did the Secretary of State describe it as not fit for purpose within hours of arriving in the department? How can he possibly embark on a wholesale reorganisation of the department after being there for only two months? I realise that he thinks he is very bright, very brilliant and very tough, but most of us ordinary mortals take at least three months to read into the brief of a department, far less decide on a wholesale change. Is this not yet another eye-catching initiative to get the Government out of the trouble that they have created? What is needed in the Home Office is the recognition that Ministers have put burden upon burden on good civil servants and that the organisation has cracked under the failure and incompetence of their leadership.</p>

I take issue with the noble Lord in that regard. It is very important for us to remember the context in which my right honourable friend the Home Secretary used the phrase &#147;not fit for purpose&#148;. Although others have used that appendage in relation to the whole of the Home Office, as I am sure the noble Lord knows well, my right honourable friend was referring to foreign national prisoners and the system that was in place within the IND to deal with that small part. When one engages in political rhetoric, I appreciate that accuracy sometimes falls by the way.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="06071971000170"></a>The whole import of my right honourable friend's work, together with the work of the Home Office team and the officials, was to look with a fresh eye at what could now be done to get more for the front line, to respond to the needs that have been identified by the people of the country, to work on the empirical data that we now have regarding what works, and to make changes to enable us to make the quantum leap that we believe it is necessary to make on behalf of the people in our country. We are building on good, solid practice. When noble Lords look at the changes we are minded to make, it will confirm, improve&#151;we hope&#151;and go further, consolidating the work we have done and building on the five-year strategy which I am sure that everyone in this House has had the delight of reading and fully absorbing.</p>

They started arriving in large numbers. It was hard to argue that they were refugees. Both political parties have yet to get this right, although my feeling is that the present Government have been getting it right in the last few years, but there is further to go. I welcome the separation of the immigration and nationality department. As the noble Countess, Lady Mar, said, it has been failing for a long time.</p>

<a name="60719-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="06071971000172"></a>I have one further request for my noble friend, on something where the Opposition are on rather safer ground than some of their other criticisms. Certainly, in the past, I could not get people deported who had sometimes committed murder; I got that in the press in the early 1990s. It is not new. We must address the fact that we have been making too much legislation in this area, and a period of consolidation would be a good idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="06071971000174"></a>I should have answered another issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, about the new agency. In case there is a misunderstanding, I say that there will be no passing the buck to it. Political direction, strategy and strategic control will remain within the Home Office and with Ministers. The agency will deal with the operational issues which the Passport Office and others have demonstrated can be ably delivered through that sort of framework. When we have the second document, on how that transition is to take place, we will doubtless be able to debate the minutiae of those arrangements more keenly.</p>

I am glad that the Minister has drawn attention to the successes of the IND in recent years, which have tended to be overlooked because of recent developments and troubles. I invite her to be cautious in moving the IND to agency status, and not to hurry it. When it is in a steady state and its operational objectives are clearly stated, understood and approved by Parliament, that would be a good time to put it on an agency basis. It would be wise to defer that change until that more steady state can be achieved.</p>

He speaks with great power from his experience on both the challenge and the success that can come from such change. I assure him that, in looking at both the advantages and disadvantages inherent in other changes to agency operations, we will look carefully to ensure that good examples are followed and poorer examples of practice avoided. I remind him that the Statement proposes that a shadow agency be started up in 2007, which will help us to recast and frame the final agency with a greater degree of acuity than we could perhaps do now.</p>

His statement was reasonably plain. I had some contact with the Home Office as part of my responsibilities in a related department for a number of years, and I had considerable respect for those who served as civil servants in it. I felt rather sad&#151;I may have been completely wrong&#151;that they should be described as working in an office that was not fit for purpose.</p>

In speaking to Amendment No. 1, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 10. This group of amendments will make a real difference to sufferers from mesothelioma and their families who have been or would have been affected by the recent House of Lords&#146; judgment in the case of Barker v Corus, and conjoined cases.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="06071971000191"></a>As noble Lords who have been following these issues will know, the case of Fairchild fundamentally changed some of the principles of liability, but did not resolve whether liability should be joint and several. It was important to clarify that. The practical effects that became apparent as a result of the House of Lords&#146; judgment have made this legislation necessary.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="06071971000192"></a>In practice, the claimant would have to trace all relevant defendants so far as possible before liability could be apportioned and full compensation paid, or alternatively to issue multiple claims to recover damages on a piecemeal basis. That would cause delays in resolving claims and increase difficulties for claimants when, as I am sure noble Lords will appreciate, they and their families are already suffering considerable pain and stress.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="06071971000193"></a>The Government have therefore acted quickly to address these problems. I am, as always, grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, who in discussing these issues met my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor. I am very grateful to the team of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, who have been extremely helpful in discussing these issues with us over the past few weeks and to the ABI, APIL and the TUC for their helpful and constructive input into these amendments.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="06071971000194"></a>By providing for joint and several liability, Amendment No. 1 will enable the claimant to recover full compensation from any responsible person. It will also apply to claims made by the claimant&#146;s estate or dependants where he has not made or resolved a claim prior to his death.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="06071971000195"></a>The provision will apply regardless of where the exposure has taken place. I am aware of views that this may extend the principle contained in Fairchild. That is not the case. Although the case of Fairchild related to a workplace exposure, the principle contained in the House of Lords&#146; judgment was not restricted to these cases. To restrict this provision to workplace exposure would mean that some claimants affected by the Barker judgment would be left in exactly the same difficulties that they are now suffering, and that different claimants would be treated in different ways purely because of where the exposure occurred. I hope noble Lords will agree that that cannot be right.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="06071971000196"></a>It also ensures that where a claimant has worked for a single employer who is now insolvent, but where only part of the period of exposure is covered by insurance, the claimant will be able to recover compensation from that insurer on the same basis as they could before the Barker case.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="06071971000197"></a>Subsection (3) makes clear that this provision does not affect the existing law on contributory negligence. Where a claimant is responsible for part of the negligent exposure, it is right that that should be reflected in the level of compensation that he is awarded when liability is determined. But the provision will apply where, for example, a self-employed person has been negligently exposed by another while working as a contractor. Subsection (3) also makes clear that a person who has paid full compensation can then seek a contribution to the damages awarded from other responsible persons under the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978. We think it is right to make it as easy as possible for defendants and insurers to recover contributions. Subsection (4) will ensure that defendants and insurers are able to recover contributions in as straightforward a way as possible.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="06071971000198"></a>It is also important that the lawyers acting for claimants ensure that defendants are provided with a full employment and exposure history. We are looking at whether amendments to secondary legislation will help to achieve this.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="06071971000199"></a>Subsections (7) to (11) confer a power on Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury to make regulations about the provision of compensation to a responsible person or an insurer of a responsible person in specified circumstances. These provisions are essential in helping to avoid delay in paying compensation and will allow the current practice to continue of employers or insurers making parallel payments with the financial services compensation scheme. As well as speeding up the claims process, that will also produce a fair outcome for insurers.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="06071971000200"></a>The subsections confer a power for Her Majesty's Treasury to make provisions that would facilitate the speeding up of payment of claims to mesothelioma victims. Those provisions would then enable responsible persons to claim money back from the financial services compensation scheme when another responsible person and their insurer are both insolvent and therefore unable to pay their share of compensation payments. The power includes the ability to deal with situations arising prior to the establishment of the financial services compensation scheme that were settled under the Policyholders Protection Act 1975.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="06071971000201"></a>The provisions would come into effect only once the Treasury has laid the necessary regulations and the FSA has made the relevant rules. However, the power provides that rules could permit the liable party to claim contributions in respect of claims dealt with from the date of Royal Assent.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="06071971000202"></a>The Treasury will make regulations to be laid as soon as practicable in the autumn, once Parliament reconvenes. The FSA is considering what changes may be needed to the financial services compensation scheme to facilitate swifter settlement of mesothelioma claims in accordance with the aims of the amendments to the Bill. The FSA proposes to take forward any changes as a matter of priority.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="06071971000203"></a>It is of the utmost importance that all claimants affected by the Barker judgment are able to secure full compensation, including the parties to that case and the cases conjoined with it, and any whose caseshave subsequently been settled or determined onthe apportionment basis proposed by Barker. Amendment No. 7 provides for that.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="06071971000204"></a>This is an exceptional step, but we believe that it is justified in the exceptional circumstances that apply here. It would be unacceptable to provide assistance to future claimants but to leave a small group of claimants whose claims are unresolved or have been concluded on the basis of Barker to suffer the real disadvantages arising from that judgment. I believe that that does not raise difficulties in relation to compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights, for a number of reasons.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="06071971000205"></a>During debates in another place, Mr Simon Hughes said that it was his understanding that those whom the retrospective change will adversely affect have all, effectively, signed up to it. That appears to be the result of a misunderstanding. I make it absolutely clear that the Government have not approached the parties to individual cases regarding the provision. We have involved the key stakeholders in developing the new clause to ensure that it works.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="06071971000206"></a>First, the degree of retrospection is strictly limited and will apply only to a very short period and very few cases. We understand that, following the Barker judgment, the great majority of cases that were under way have been stayed, either pending clarification of the appropriate method of apportionment or in the light of the Government&#146;s announced intention to introduce the amendments. So very few cases may need to be reopened.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="06071971000207"></a>In addition, those cases&#151;and any that are currently unconcluded&#151;will have been commenced prior to Barker, so the expectation of both claimants and defendants will have been that joint and several liability would apply. We are therefore not interfering with the settled expectations of the parties to any of those proceedings.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="06071971000208"></a>The Scottish Parliament recently passed a legislative consent Motion to enable the provisions to apply directly to Scotland. Colleagues in Northern Ireland have also signalled their wish for the provisions to apply there. Amendment No. 8 therefore ensures that these provisions will apply across the United Kingdom. Finally, to ensure that claimants receive the benefit of the provisions as soon as possible, Amendment No. 6 provides for them to come into effect, together with the provisions in Part 1, on Royal Assent, and Amendment No. 10 makes the necessary consequential changes to the Title.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="06071971000209"></a>I must make it clear that the amendments are just part of what the Government are doing. Together with colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions, we are working with the Association of British Insurers, the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers and the Trades Union Congress urgently to identify ways of speeding up the settlement of these claims. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has already announced that he will be issuing a Written Statement in another place and in your Lordships' House about that work before the Recess. I can tell the House that it will be issued tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="06071971000210"></a>Moved, That the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 1.&#151;(<I>Baroness Ashton of Upholland.</I>)</p>

<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="06071971000211"></a><b><a name="60719-0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="06071971000661"></a>Lord Hunt of Wirral</b> moved, as an amendment to Commons Amendment No.1, Amendment No. 1A:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="06071971000212"></a>1A: Line 19, after &#147;disease&#148; insert &#147;for all or any part of the period of exposure&#148;</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="06071971000213"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I declare my interests as set out in the register, in particular as a solicitor and partner in Beachcroft LLP and as president of the All-Party Group on Occupational Safety and Health. All of us in that group are only too well aware of the dreadful mortal implications of mesothelioma. Our priority must be to improve the lot of people who are suffering from one of the most appalling conditions known to medical science. Each year, some 1,800 people are diagnosed with mesothelioma and, as matters stand, that is purely and simply a death sentence. Typically, a sufferer has at most 18 months to live and, within that short span, can expect a catastrophic decline in their quality of life. The number of sufferers is set to rise. The best estimate is that it will peak around 2020 and possibly slightly later.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="06071971000214"></a>No one can be satisfied with the manner in which the compensation system for mesothelioma cases currently operates. In a minority of instances, liability is quickly established and a payment is made by a present or former employer or their insurer. However, in many hundreds of cases each year, there is no solvent former employer or insurer, or liability simply cannot be established, so many hundreds of sufferers receive no compensation at all. That is intolerable. What is ideally required is a comprehensive, clear and sustainable system that delivers some form of compensation or benefit quickly after diagnosis and without unnecessary recourse to the courts. This is surely a question of justice and human decency.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="06071971000215"></a>However, we on these Benches in no way seek to oppose the Government&#146;s efforts to regularise the position on mesothelioma claims, even if the provisions deal with only one aspect of the subject. I congratulate the Minister and her team on their hard work on the new clause, and on doing their best to consult stakeholders widely, despite the very tight timescale and what must have been more or less intolerable pressure from elsewhere in Government. However, we should not delude ourselves; the Government&#146;s new clauses may be a necessary part of an overall settlement, but they will not, and cannot, deliver the reforms that are needed. This is no more or less than a first step, but it will also have some consequences, which is causing serious concern.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="06071971000216"></a>One might quietly reflect for a moment, after this aspect of the matter is resolved for now, that the courts were directed to this point by the Government. It is also unfortunate that, having played a leading role in initiating the appeal process that led to the decision of this House in an appellate capacity, the Government have now sought to reverse the judgment in the three test cases, as the Minister has just acknowledged, without consulting some of those who are most affected. Many parliamentarians seemed to be under the impression that the insurers and employers involved in mesothelioma cases had willingly signed up to the Government&#146;s new policy when they had not. I very much welcome the way in which the Minister has put the record straight.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="06071971000217"></a>Speed is of the essence, but this lack of full consultation and consensus is about more than just courtesy; it is about ensuring that the system works. It is vital that the new clause should operate for the benefit of all those involved in cases relating to this extremely unpleasant disease. Of course, claimants must be able to recover full damages to which they are entitled quickly and without undue complication. It is only fair, however, that those who pay such claims should have the opportunity to resolve sometimes difficult and complicated apportionment issues between themselves as economically and speedily as possible. I therefore particularly welcome the way in which the proposals prefer a simple &#147;time on risk&#148; approach between defendants, avoiding the need for extensive inquiries into and expert evidence on the effects of different types of asbestos and varying degrees of exposure. Such inquiries would be equally unwelcome for claimants, who would often have to be the main, perhaps the only, source of information, and it must be right that this sort of intrusion and unnecessary wasting of time should be avoided wherever possible.</p>

<a name="60719-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="06071971000218"></a>I also welcome the approach of the Minister to the difficulties caused by the current rules of the financial services compensation scheme. Although it has not been possible to settle those matters finally within the Bill itself, we recognise the amount of work that has already been done by the department, the Treasury and the FSA in getting this far. I welcome the Minister&#146;s commitment to resolving these matters and I hope that she will be able to reassure me that her department will work closely with the Civil Procedure Rule Committee on this.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60719-0006.htm"/>


<a name="60719-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="06071971000219"></a>However, I should like to highlight a couple of points that in my view remain to be resolved. First, it is essential to the operation of this clause as between defendants that the claimant should provide as full an employment history as possible at a very early stage. The occupational disease protocol already flags the need for this. Moreover, it is generally recognised and acknowledged that insurers and other defendant interests have approached the drafting of this important amendment in a positive and constructive fashion. In fairness to them, their acceptance of the amendment must be on the basis that those representing claimants also abide by the spirit of compromise and provide the necessary information without difficulty. Secondly, while subsection (4) goes a long way to applying a presumption in favour of &#147;time on risk&#148; as the appropriate method of apportionment, this will need to be underpinned by procedural rules to make it workable.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="06071971000220"></a>We should also reflect on the broader significance of this amendment. Not only have the Government acted to reverse what they believe to be the injustice of the decision of this House in its appellate capacity on Barker v Corus, but they have also been encouraged by the engagement of stakeholders to widen the scope of the clause so that it sets the scene for simplifying claims for mesothelioma in general. I know that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and his department continue to work with the Minister and with claimant defendant and insurer interests on ways of speeding up and simplifying the process, and we look forward to the Statement which the Minister has told us will be made tomorrow.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="06071971000221"></a>Much progress has been made, but like all too many injury claims, those for mesothelioma are too complex and transactional costs are too high. For satisfactory progress to continue, everyone involved must be prepared to compromise and even to act against their own short-term interests from time to time for the greater good. I would also urge the Minister to look at one remaining gap which I consider has not yet been closed, and hence Amendment No. 1A. Under Barker and current case law, a claimant whose single former employer is now insolvent and who can trace only part of that employer&#146;s insurance cover runs a substantial risk of seeing his damages reduced. While subsection (2) covers other gaps created by the Barker decision, it arguably does not address this particular area. If the Minister is confident that the courts will deal with this in the time-honoured fashion, it would be helpful if she were able to confirm that today.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="06071971000222"></a>I do, however, have very great concerns about retrospective application, and I believe that those concerns are shared by many others in the House. Since the judgment of this House, I understand that most mesothelioma cases have been deferred and relatively few have settled as courts have awaited the Government&#146;s response to the judgment. Nonetheless, I cannot recall ever a previous situation in which Parliament has been asked to enact legislation that would go so far as to overturn existing decisions of the courts in individual cases or reopen agreements reached between legally represented parties. Only yesterday there was a debate on this very point on the Government of Wales Bill in another place. If it is the will of the Crown in Parliament to impose retrospection, of course it has the power to do so. Yet all the foundations of our civil society, our legal and constitutional life, the Human Rights Act, centuries of accumulated statute and common law, basic principles of fairness and the very concept of the rule of law itself all resonate with grave doubts about any such move.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="06071971000223"></a>As my colleague Dominic Grieve said in another place only last night:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="06071971000269"></a>&#147;It is not common practice for the House to pass measures that can apply retrospectively. Retrospective powers enable the Government to interfere with private rights in a way that is contrary to the principles of the rule of law in this country&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 18/7/06; col. 219.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06071971000248"></a>We must be cautious, ensuring that any such provision is tightly defined, will not be the subject of unjustified or unnecessary attempts to widen its scope and does not set a precedent.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="06071971000224"></a>I was reassured by the words of Bridget Prentice in another place on Monday when she described the application of retrospection in this instance as,</p>
<ul><a name="06071971000272"></a>&#147;an exceptional step ... given the exceptional circumstances&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 17/7/06; col. 47.]</ul>
<p><a name="06071971000249"></a>The Minister has used similar language. I want it to be unique&#151;a one-off. I hope she will be able to confirm that it will be.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="06071971000225"></a>Turning to further points of detail, I fear the current amendment to Clause 15 is not clear enough to prevent those who have settled their claims in full, without a discount for Barker, from believing that here is an opportunity to reopen those claims and seek more damages. The modest amendments I propose&#151;Amendments Nos. 7A, 7B and 7C&#151;would make the position absolutely clear. If the Minister is not prepared to accept those amendments, I invite her to make it abundantly clear in a Statement to this House, and perhaps also in writing, that these provisions will be available only in those cases where it is clear that the claimant has been directly and negatively affected by the decision in Barker v Corus. Bearing in mind that we are dealing with an amendment to a Bill designed to curb the excesses of claims management companies, it would be ironic and intolerable if this clause were to have the unintended effect of rekindling the kind of speculative claims that we have seen all too often in other areas in the past.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="06071971000226"></a>In closing, I have to say&#151;in sorrow, not anger&#151;that these past few days have not seen the parliamentary process in its best light. A judicial decision of the House&#146;s Appellate Committee was made in May; an amendment to overturn it first appeared on the Order Paper last Friday; it was then debated and adopted in another place on Monday; just two days later, here we are debating it in the expectation that it will receive Royal Assent in a matter of days. I fully accept the urgency of this matter&#151;this disease will not indulge us in our deliberations and every day more people are struck down&#151;but it might have been better for the Government to have spent the summer preparing a comprehensive Bill to overhaul the system in a holistic, coherent fashion rather than unbalancing the Bill in this way.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="06071971000227"></a>I believe that we all have a responsibility to ensure that the somewhat tarnished reputation of our political life is rehabilitated and restored. Until this point, I have had nothing but praise for the manner in which the noble Baroness and her ministerial and departmental colleagues had conducted themselves; they consulted widely and consistently demonstrated courtesy, patience and a willingness both to listen and to be swayed by argument. In recent days and weeks, I fear, they have been somewhat swept away on a tide of party-political considerations and pressures from elsewhere within Government and from the Back Benches in another place. There has been a great deal of emotion&#151;I understand that. I only wish I could be certain that these amendments would enhance the chances of a full and fair settlement but, hand on heart, I cannot say that I am. We are legislating in haste. Let us hope that we do not repent at leisure. I beg to move.</p>

He delivered the lead speech in your Lordships' House in the decision in Barker v Corus and if he chose to intervene in the debate, I would be interested to hear what he had to say. He shakes his head.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="06071971000229"></a>It would be incorrect to say that the decision in Barker v Corus was wrong. In a sense, no decision of the Appellate Committee of your Lordships' House can be wrong; its members declare the law, and the law, as declared by them, is the law. I have read the decision in Barker v Corus&#151;I understand and agree with the logical process by which it was arrived at, by a majority of, I think, four to one&#151;but, nevertheless, it does not follow that because a decision is correct it should be followed unquestioningly. It is the role of the members of the Appellate Committee to declare what the law is, not what it ought to be. I agree that the decision in Barker v Corus would undoubtedly cause severe hardship to a number of people with what seem to me to be legitimate claims to compensation. Therefore, we on these Benches very much welcome the amendments. They would mean that people who get this dreadful disease will receive full compensation, except to the extent to which their own contributory negligence is a possible cause.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="06071971000230"></a>When I first saw what was proposed, I was seriously worried by the retrospective effect of the legislation. I was entirely happy that the Bill should apply to cases where the cause of action had not yet arisen, but I was doubtful about its application to cases still in progress or where the cause of action had arisen but action had not yet been commenced.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="06071971000231"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, about retrospective legislation. The problem is that a retrospective overruling by Parliament of the decisions of the courts is, in principle, a breach of the rule of law. That is particularly so where the case is a decision on rights between private individuals or companies. Observing the rule of law in this way is of special importance in a country where respect for the rule of law has persuaded many foreign businesses to use our courts to settle their legal disputes, to our great financial advantage.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="06071971000232"></a>I have, however, been persuaded that retrospectivity is acceptable here by the wholly exceptional circumstances of this case. First, there is the unusual nature of the disease; it is caused not by an accumulation of exposure, such as silicosis, which is contracted by miners, or lung cancer, which is caused by smoking, but may be caused by the inhalation of even a single fibre of asbestos. Secondly, another exceptional circumstance is that since the Fairchild decision, it appears that most employers and insurers have acted on the assumption that liability would be joint and several, and not several alone. Thirdly, and perhaps most important, I rely on the fact that those most seriously affected by the decision in Barker v Corus are willing to accept this as a special case. I say &#147;accept&#148;&#151;they do not welcome it but are prepared to accept it. Like us, they object to retrospective legislation in principle and do not wish this case to be treated as a precedent. I also note that Corus was not consulted and has objected to the retrospective element in this legislation. We therefore support the amendments, but I would welcome recognition by the noble Baroness&#151;she expressed it at least in part in opening the debate&#151;that this is an entirely exceptional case and not to be taken as a precedent for the future retrospective overruling of court decisions.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="06071971000233"></a>There are some points of more detail. In the House of Commons, my honourable friend David Howarth raised a question of whether it could be argued that the drafting of the Bill left a possibility that damages could not be awarded at all in some cases. In the House of Commons, the Minister said that she would see whether the provision could be improved. Nothing has been done on this, which is presumably on the basis of legal advice. Was advice given that an amendment was not necessary, as suggested byMr Howarth? In case there is any remaining uncertainty, will the Minister assure us that claimants are not excluded from compensation on the grounds in any circumstances that they are guilty of contributory negligence?</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="06071971000234"></a>It seems, regrettably, that there is no possible way of providing compensation where all the claimants, employers and their insurers are either insolvent or have gone into solvent liquidation and have been wound up. In such cases, there is no defendant against whom proceedings can be brought. Will the Minister confirm that nothing in this Bill succeeds in giving compensation where there is no available defendant against whom proceedings can be commenced?</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="06071971000235"></a>It appears that compensation can be paid out of the financial services compensation scheme only if it is the insurer who is unable to pay. Does that mean that a defendant cannot claim against the scheme if another liable employer with the same victim has ceased to exist and was uninsured? What will happen if, as was the case with Barker, the victim was employed long ago and it cannot be ascertained whether the employer was insured? Is there any possibility in such a case of Corus being entitled to claim compensation from the scheme?</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="06071971000236"></a>I am concerned by the costs incurred on both sides in the Barker v Corus appeal to your Lordships' House. No order has yet been made and it is not clear who will be ordered to pay them. However, the decision of the Appellate Committee has been rendered largely irrelevant by this Bill and costs incurred by both sides have been to a very considerable extent wasted. Since the purpose of the Bill is specifically to overrule the decision in Barkerv Corus, would it not be appropriate for the Government to make a contribution towards the costs of either side, which have been rendered irrelevant by the Government&#146;s action? There seems to be a moral obligation to do so.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="06071971000237"></a>Subject to those points, I have no other comments on the amendments in this group. I welcome the hope and expectation that they will very shortly become law.</p>

I assure the House that the Barker decision caused a great deal of concern in the area in which I live. I agreed with most of what the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, said but, on retrospection, would he have a look at the Employment Act 1982, which his Government introduced, and see that there was a certain amount of retrospection then?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="06071971000239"></a>I worked in the shipbuilding industry from the time I left school at 14 until I became a Member of Parliament in 1979. During that time, the longest period of employment that I had was the five years that I served as an apprentice. In the shipbuilding industry, you were lucky if you had one employer for a month. People used to be taken on for weeks or days. So, when they get this terrible disease of asbestosis, to ask them to remember every employer that they had is impossible. I could not remember every employer that I had during my time in the shipbuilding industry.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="06071971000240"></a>As for the safety conditions that they worked in, there might be 100 men working in the hold and someone spraying asbestos, and the only safety provision was that the person spraying the asbestos would have a little Martindale mask, which was a bit of cotton wool with a bit of foil over it and an elastic band around the back of the head. Those were the conditions that these men worked under. I appreciate the legal jargon and I appreciate that we have got to get things right, but I welcome the Government&#146;s amendment and I congratulate my noble friend and my honourable friend Bridget Prentice in the other place.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="06071971000241"></a>The decision was made quickly because of the problems of these families of shipbuilding workers. Those families do not have a great deal of money and do not have pensions. From the 35 years that I spent in the shipbuilding industry I did not have a brass farthing in pension. Pensions were introduced only after the shipyards were nationalised. These are the sort of people that we are talking about. I know that legal jargon says this and that, but these are human beings who went through life in terrible conditions and whose families have no money&#151;so when the Barker decision was made, it caused a great deal of concern. Immediately after the Barker decision, I got a petition from people in the shipbuilding area where I live signed by 200 members of the families of people suffering from asbestos-related diseases. It is a terrible disease. In fact, if I go for an X-ray tomorrow I may have to declare an interest, bearing in mind the conditions in which I worked in the shipbuilding industry. But these men cannot afford to wait, nor can their families. I say to my noble friend that we should get this on the statute book as quickly as possible and ease some of the problems and worries that these people have.</p>

<a name="06071971000242"></a><b><a name="60719-0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="06071971000664"></a>Lord Mackay of Clashfern:</b> My Lords, the underlying decision in this case by the Appellate Committee is one of great interest to me, because it resulted from digging deep into a coal board case which I had lost a considerable time ago. It is a decision remarkable for the clarity of its foundations. The more recent decision, which this set of proposals is intended to deal with, is more limited in its scope. I believe that retrospection is something that normally we would not tolerate, but it has happened from time to time. Perhaps one of the most astonishing cases in which it happened was with the Burmah litigation of some years ago, on which I happened to be instructed on behalf of the Government, who having lost before the Appellate Committee initiated legislation to overturn the decision. This retrospection appears to me entirely justified. Subject to the details mentioned by noble Lords, what has been proposed is eminently justified.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="06071971000243"></a>It may be reasonably clear that, when an employer has become bankrupt or disappeared, if there was an insurance policy and the insurer was still available for a suit, the rights against insurers legislation would appear to give a remedy to a family under these provisions in the same way as if the employer itself was still available and solvent.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="06071971000244"></a>I strongly sympathise with the sentiments expressed by the noble Lord who immediately preceded me. I had many cases relating to the shipbuilding industry when I was rather younger than I am today, and the conditions under which it operated were very difficult. I hope that legal jargon would in no way deprive those who worked in it of their undoubted rights.</p>

As my noble friend Lord Dixon was speaking, I was aware that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, had described this issue as attracting emotion. I think that the noble Lord will agree with me that the strength of feeling displayed by my noble friend is precisely the reason why&#151;and I think that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, was alluding to this&#151;it is so important that we have brought forward the measure in this way. </p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="06071986000004"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is right in saying that the Appellate Committee made the right decision. We looked at the practical consequences of that decision, and decided that they warranted us to think how we might deal with what were clearly going to be intolerable conditions for people suffering from this terrible disease. It is right, too, that the DTI joined in with the case. It wanted clarification of whether liability should be joint and several. The consequences of the case were entirely appropriate for us to bring forward this amendment to the Bill.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="06071986000005"></a>It is important, and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, put it very well, that those who suffer from this disease are able to get the compensation they need as quickly as possible. I stress again that this amendment is but part of the work that will continue to be done by my department and by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="06071986000006"></a>Retrospectivity is something we thought about extremely carefully, for all the reasons indicated by those who have spoken. This is exceptional. It is not about setting a precedent. However, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, indicated, from time to time&#151;but only very occasionally&#151;there may be circumstances where that is appropriate. The noble and learned Lord referred to another situation where that was the case.</p>

<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="06071986000007"></a><b><a name="60719-0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="06071986000097"></a>Lord Goodhart:</b> My Lords, I am sorry to intervene, but there is a widely held view that the Government&#146;s action in the Burmah case was entirely unacceptable. It was different from the facts of this case, where there is a very different situation.</p>

<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="06071986000008"></a><b><a name="60719-0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="06071986000098"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> My Lords, I was not suggesting that they were the same. I was simply trying to indicate that from time to time in Parliament one looks at this issue. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked whether I would describe this as unique, and I am reluctant to do so, because I do not know what may happen in the future. I accept, however, that the particular circumstances make this case exceptional. I do not think that any noble Lord disagrees with me on that. I was not trying to make the two things fit together, and I apologise if that was the impressionI gave.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="06071986000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said that until we got to this point, he thought that I was behaving extraordinarily well as a Minister on this legislation. I am always sad when I disappoint. We have talked to the noble Lord&#146;s team quite frequently over the past few weeks and shared as much as we possibly could. But the noble Lord is right: when dealing with something at great speed because it is important, we may not do as much as we could&#151;and I clearly did not. If I failed to discuss this as fully with the noble Lord as I might have, I apologise unreservedly.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="06071986000010"></a>I hope, though, that what has ultimately come before your Lordships&#146; House will be acceptable. When discussing this with stakeholders, we have tried to deal with those who can help us ensure that it works in practice. Noble Lords may disagree and think that we should have consulted more widely. We think that we consulted as appropriate, to ensure that we had something that would work. I hope that noble Lords will be happy with what we have done.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="06071986000011"></a>I shall deal with the specifics of the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. I understand the point that the noble Lord is making in Amendment No. 1A. This is not a new issue. It was dealt with by the courts before Barker, as the noble Lord will know far better than I, in the case of Phillips v Syndicate 992. The court took the position that the liability for insurers was joint and several. Nothing in this legislation affects that decision or would make the courts decide it differently in the future. The difficulty with the amendment is that&#151;we have discussed this with our own legal team&#151;it appears to go further than the rest of the provision in beginning to codify the common law in this area, which is not needed and which I do not think the noble Lord wants. The noble Lord will be aware that it could lead to difficulties in the future if we tried to do that. We believe that we have addressed the point. We have looked very carefully at the noble Lord&#146;s amendments, as he would expect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="06071986000012"></a>Amendment No. 7A seeks clarity that the element of retrospective effect in the amendments is limited to settlements that were made on the basis of the Barker case. We agree with the sentiment behind the amendment because it is right that the retrospective effect is strictly limited. However, we do not believe that the amendment is necessary to achieve that end and we are not sure that it would achieve the desired outcome in any event. I am very happy to write to the noble Lord to that effect and put a copy of the letter in the Library.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="06071986000013"></a>It is clear that new subsection (5) of Clause 15 is about claims that are affected by new Clause 3, as a result of the drafting of new subsections (3) and (4). The retrospective element is achieved by the combination of new subsection (3), which says that new Clause 3 has always had effect, and new subsection (4), which limits the effect to settlements and determinations on or after 3 May 2006.</p>

<a name="60719-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="06071986000014"></a>New subsection (5) follows that drafting, and indicates in paragraph (c) that an application for a court to vary a settlement will be limited to considering the effects that new Clause 3 has on the settlement. So if a case is not affected by the new clause, the court will not vary the settlement, and it will be open to the court to penalise the applicant in costs.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="06071986000015"></a>Amendments Nos. 7B and 7C, standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, address similar objectives to the first amendment. They attempt to make it clear that the jurisdiction of the court is limited to cases where there has been a settlement or determination based on those considerations. As already indicated, it is clear that any application to the court under these provisions must be about the interaction of new Clause 3 with the original settlement or determination. Moreover, since the application would be retrospective in nature, the court would be likely to construe its power narrowly. But a court considering such a matter must necessarily be seized of the whole case to consider those matters effectively. We are concerned that these amendments might impinge on that ability. They appear to suggest that a court could not consider the settlement or determination as a whole.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="06071986000016"></a>The noble Lord was concerned that the Civil Procedure Rule Committee should be involved. We are not sure that detailed rules on this would be necessary as the clause already establishes a clear presumption, but we intend to ask the committee to consider the need for rules on the provision by claimants to defendants of a full employment and exposure history to facilitate the recovery of contributions. I am happy to confirm that.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="06071986000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, also asked about the transactional costs of pursuing claims being too high. I could not agree more that there is a need to improve the system for dealing with these claims to ensure that compensation is paid more quickly and in a less costly way. We will be taking forward work to address these issues and I would be delighted to keep the noble Lord in touch with that. I look forward very much to discussing that with him.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="06071986000018"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, partly answered the question of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, about compensation when a defendant is not available. As the noble and learned Lord said, the financial services compensation scheme applies where insurers exist&#151;that is its purpose. To try to expand it beyond that would be to take away its purpose. But I am aware of the issues, and I shall come back to the noble Lord because he rightly raises concerns about those who cannot find the relevant person in those circumstances. We will look at that in the work that is continued. The noble Lord wished to deal with a point raised by his honourable friend Mr Howarth, whom I know quite well from the Select Committee, concerning the element in the Barker case that recognised that any non-tortious exposure to asbestos suffered by the claimant did not mean that defendants who negligently exposed could escape liability. He suggested that the clause as drafted did not make that clear.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="06071986000019"></a>We have looked at the point, and I will write toMr Howarth to confirm that. We do not consider this a problem in the drafting of the clause, becausethe relevant conditions for liability are that the responsible person has negligently exposed the victim and is liable in tort. Nowhere is it said that that liability must be determined only in accordance with cases determined before 3 May 2006. The liability mentioned in new subsection (1)(d) is the liability as the courts would determine it now. So I do not think that anything is needed to retain that part of Barker. Of course, it is always up to the courts to decide matters of common law differently, but there is no reason in this case to expect them to do so. We are therefore satisfied that we have dealt with that point as well as we can.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="06071986000020"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, asked whether the Government would pay costs. I cannot make any commitment today, but I will look into the issue and write to the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="06071986000021"></a>I hope that I have answered as well as I can all the questions that have been raised by noble Lords. I am grateful for the contributions which have been made, especially that of my noble friend Lord Dixon. I hope that the noble Lord will not press his amendments but will accept the government amendments.</p>

She said that consideration was being given to how to deal with the problem of cases where there is a claimant but no possible defendant. Is there any possibility of dealing with it without further primary legislation? It is difficult to see how that could be done.</p>

<p><a name="st_103"></a>

I very much welcome the comments made by the Minister, and I will reflect on them. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, for raising a number of important points and seeking clarification on a range of issues. I also thank my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern for pointing out some important historical context.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="06071986000025"></a>The outstanding contribution was that of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon, who expressed all the emotion that I feel about these cases. I have the honour to be the president of the All-Party Group, and I have therefore heard about some tragic cases. I share with him not only a concern about those who are fortunate enough to have a cause of action and a defendant to sue, but a much more worrying concern about the hundreds of people who are dying every year but have no claim at all. They include people who served in the conditions that the noble Lord has outlined.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="06071986000026"></a>That is why I really hope the Minister will be able to encourage her ministerial colleagues to adopt a more comprehensive solution&#151;a solution which will involve the Government. As I understand it, the Government are involved as a defendant in over half the cases we are talking about, and every year brings the death of more of those involved in the cases. Although I do not know the exact statistics, the Government have not only an interest in these cases but are under a very strong obligation to find some sort of scheme to ensure that those diagnosed with this terrible disease immediately receive some form of benefit or compensation. I commend the work carried out&#151;indeed, instigated&#151;by a number of leading insurers and by the Association of British Insurersin trying to find a way through. However, the Government must lead in finding the way through. I hope that the Minister and her ministerial colleagues will come forward with some form of comprehensive scheme that covers the wide range of people diagnosed with this appalling disease.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="06071986000027"></a>I am therefore saying to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon, that I hope his outpouring of emotion&#151;understandable by everyone who heard it&#151;will result in some consideration for all those who do not have a cause of action which they can utilise to find some benefit in the last few years of their lives, and also in some reassurance that, once they have gone, their families will be protected in some way. I hope that we will concentrate on that over the coming months.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="06071986000028"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Dixon&#151;with whom I had the privilege of working closely in the other place, given that we were Deputy Chief Whips of our respective parties. For those who do not understand the position of Deputy Chief Whip, I should say that we ensure that the wheels go round and are properly oiled.

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="06071986000036"></a>The other place supported government amendments that explicitly provide the statutory power for the Secretary of State to bring claims management services provided in relation to industrial injuries disablement benefits within the regulatory net. Amendment No. 2 provides for this, and Amendment No. 3 provides for the order to be made by affirmative resolution.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="06071986000037"></a>Citizens Advice and his honour Judge Michael Harris, president of the Social Security and Child Support Appeals Tribunal, have raised specific concerns about claims management activities in claims for industrial injuries disablement benefitsand some other welfare benefits. Commercial intermediaries here typically charge a flat fee for this service or take a percentage of the benefit payment if the claim is successful.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="06071986000038"></a>Our legal advisers considered further the definition in Clause 3, and despite its breadth, there is sufficient doubt whether claims management services in those types of claims would be covered to justify bringing forward these amendments. The amendment is precisely targeted on industrial injuries disablement benefits, which are benefits of a compensatory nature. It does not extend to welfare benefits more generally, which would be beyond the scope of the Bill.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="06071986000039"></a>The Government accepted an amendment tabled in the other place by Mr Simon Hughes that changes the order-making power in Clause 5 to affirmative. Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 will require the initial exemption order and any subsequent restriction or removal of exemption to be debated in your Lordships&#146; House and another place. We hope to capture almost everyone in the first order. But we are working with an unusually broad definition here, so a small number of organisations may well emerge that fall within the definition but which it is not appropriate to regulate.

<a name="06071986000041"></a><b><a name="60719-0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="06071986000103"></a>Lord Hunt of Wirral:</b> My Lords, I welcome this group of amendments, which give us an opportunity to reflect for a moment on where, apart from the debate we have just had, we are with the rest of the Bill. The Bill started out as a short and comparatively straightforward piece of legislation but has had an unusually complicated passage through this House and another place. However, I am pleased that Clause 1 has survived more or less intact. Part of me still wishes to give the clause only two cheers rather than all three, but it is generally to the good and its drafting has been somewhat improved. I welcome that.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="06071986000042"></a>As the originator of Clause 2, it is natural that I should allow myself to revel at least momentarily in its survival. It is highly consonant with the original intention of the Bill. I hope that it will serve to correct distorted perceptions, restore a modicum of much-needed civility to society, and, above all, give a strong impetus to the process of rehabilitation.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="06071986000043"></a>However, the second half of the Bill, to which the Minister referred, dealing with claims farmers, has always received a warm welcome on all sides of this House, and rightly so. Much of the important work in that area continues as the regulations and the trade union code of practice are scrutinised, and I hope to play my part in that process. I understand from the Minister that this might be a good opportunity for her to update the House on progress made towards getting the new regulatory system up and running. I therefore look forward to hearing from her about the latest steps.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="06071986000044"></a>I have always given this Bill a broad welcome and, despite the various changes made to it, I still do. I hope that it will serve to restore some civility, decency and&#151;yes&#151;some justice to this country of ours.</p>

The fact that there are very few Commons amendments, other than those relating to mesothelioma, indicates that the Minister and her team of civil servants did a very successful job in greatly improving the Bill earlier when it was in your Lordships&#146; House. I congratulate her on that.</p>

<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="06071986000046"></a><b><a name="60719-0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="06071986000105"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> My Lords, I am very grateful for those comments. I shall take a moment to inform noble Lords about what we have been doing; the question of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, gives me an opportunity to do so. Noble Lords who participated in the passage of this Bill were keen to see us get on with it and I made commitments about timing.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="06071986000047"></a>We will come back to Parliament in the autumn to debate secondary legislation that will underpin the new regime. We have made good progress and have recently launched a formal consultation on the draft secondary legislation and conduct rules, which will include regional consultation workshops with claims intermediaries in Newcastle, Manchester and London. These set out in detail matters such as the authorisation criteria, the complaints handling requirements, indemnity insurance and situations in which it would be appropriate to cancel or suspend authorisation. In the next few weeks we are going to launch the remaining consultations on the exemption order, authorisation fee levels and the application form.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="06071986000048"></a>I informed noble Lords at Report that we expect the regulation to be integrated into the regulatory structure to be provided for by the Legal Services Bill. I also set out an interim solution for dealing with regulation. An announcement was made in the other place that in the interim the Secretary of State, my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor, will regulate, supported by existing officials, together with appropriate senior expertise, skills and experience that are brought in from outside the Civil Service.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="06071986000049"></a>I have referred before to the likelihood of a senior individual being recruited to help guide the successful implementation of the new regime. I am pleased to confirm today that, subject to finalising terms, Mark Boleat will be taking on this important role formally from the beginning of September.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="06071986000050"></a>A key part of the proposed mechanism will be an external monitoring and compliance unit, whichwill help to process applications for authorisation, maintain a register of authorised persons, monitor compliance with the rules, monitor advertising and marketing activity, identify persons who are evading authorisation and advise the DCA on disciplinary matters and formal regulatory decisions. This will be supplied under contract by a single trading standards team operating across England and Wales, making full use of the networks already in place. The DCA retains full authority and responsibility for regulation but working with the right trading standards operation should help to ensure the early delivery of benefits to consumers.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="06071986000051"></a>I have already visited Birmingham and the City of London trading standards units to learn more of the work they currently do. We have just concluded an expression of interest exercise and will be inviting shortlisted departments to prepare detailed proposals. I expect the unit to be operational by October.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="06071986000052"></a>We are also establishing a non-statutory regulatory consultancy group made up of representatives of the financial services and insurance industries, the legal profession, consumer groups and the claims management sector. It will help ensure that we continue to engage fully with all those who have an expert interest in making a positive difference in the claims sector. The group&#146;s first meeting will be next week.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="06071986000053"></a>The timetable for regulation we are working tois as follows. The regulatory mechanisms will be established in October 2006; applications will be invited from November 2006; the deadline for applications is February 2007; the tribunal is to be established in February 2007; and offences and remaining provisions will go live in April 2007.</p>

<a name="60719-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="06071986000054"></a>In earlier debates I stressed the speed with which we have brought forward measures to regulate the claims management sector. I hope that noble Lords are reassured by that brief but, I hope, detailed r&#233;sum&#233; of the amount of work that has been going on since the Bill left your Lordships&#146; House; it will continue through the summer months. I hope that I have given some comfort to those who are concerned that we need to be seen to get on with it.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="06071986000078"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment deals with a significant aspect of Part 1 of the Bill&#151;the protection of the principal economic regulators. As I hope I made abundantly clear at Second Reading, the principal economic regulators have very significant powers over the essentials of our daily life and the operation of the economy. They deal with water, energy, communications and transport. These are networks and supplies that must be maintained and operated on sound and sustainable economic and public interest criteria. It is for that reason and the overwhelming need for private investment to be maintained and encouraged in these essential industries that Parliament has made the principal economic regulators independent of political control, with clear, objective, statutory duties that do not wave in the political wind. It is also why Parliament has given them jurisdiction to establish the demands on the systems that they regulate to determine the condition, capacity and capability of the networks in question and then to set prices that customers must pay. Those two things&#151;independence and jurisdiction&#151;are essential if we are to ensure that private investors will have sufficient confidence in the regulatory system to provide the working and investment capital that these industries will always need on fair and affordable terms.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="06071986000079"></a>As I said on Second Reading, this is no idle or academic point. I referred at some length to the Government&#146;s behaviour towards the Rail Regulator over the winding up of Railtrack. The Rail Regulator at the time has since explained that it was the rigour and timescales of the legislative process that protected his jurisdiction and independence and caused the Government to back off, with their unconstitutional threat of legislation.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="06071984000001"></a>The Government admitted that they could not have got the neutralising Bill through in time; they might not have got it through at all. That is why the present chairman of the Office of Rail Regulation has written to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster protesting at the scope of Part 1 of the Bill. He has warned of the very same real hazards of which the former rail regulator warned: the jeopardy to private investor confidence which is created by a power of a Minister to interfere with the independence or jurisdiction of the principal economic regulators.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="06071984000002"></a>The Minister may say tonight, &#147;Of course, the principal economic regulators must be independent. The Government have always accepted that it is important and we would never touch them&#148;. He may say that but as the Committee knows that has not been the reality of hard experience as I have shown now and at Second Reading. Even if we accept that the Government are committed to the independence of the principal economic regulators, we must protect them from any possibility of the Bill being used against them.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="06071984000003"></a>I have taken the wording for this amendment from the Government&#146;s own drafting in Part 2. There the Government have seen fit to exclude the economic regulators from the principles of good regulation. Why they should do so is perhaps strange. I hope we shall debate this more fully when we come to that part. There does not seem to be much harm in getting the regulators adhering to the principles in Clause 23(2), but I am open to any explanation from the Minister as to why they are so exempt. My colleagues in another place pursued this point and did not receive a satisfactory answer. Leaving Part 2 to one side for the time being, I ask: why are the economic regulators not exempt from Part 1? I can think only that the Government deliberately want to keep the economic regulators within their grasp and we on these Benches believe that that is quite wrong. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="06071984000004"></a><b><a name="60719-0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="06071984000138"></a>Lord Norton of Louth:</b> I wish to speak to Amendment No. 47B in the same group. When I chaired the Constitution Committee of your Lordships&#146; House, the committee looked at the role of the independent regulators appointed by statute. In particular, we looked at the relationship between accountability and independence. Regulators have to be independent to do their jobs and that requires Ministers giving up some freedoms to protect the decision making of regulators. At the same time, regulators have a duty to explain, to be exposed to scrutiny and to be subject to the full rigours of the possibility of legal challenge. They have to fulfil their statutory duties.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="06071984000005"></a>The independence of regulators, as my noble friend has already said, is crucial. It is important that independence is seen to exist. Perhaps I may quote from paragraph 121 of the committee&#146;s report:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="06071984000117"></a>&#147;Our evidence suggests once again the broad range of support that underpins a regulatory framework that separates ministerial roles and responsibilities from those of independent regulators, and that this fact should be well communicated on a regular basis by Government. Water UK, for example, told us that &#145;For Ministers and regulators frequently to reassert the independence of the regulator on economic decisions is helpful; and, after all, we had a survey of investors recently and 96 per cent of them said that they regarded the independence of the regulator as being very important, so just a frequent reassertion of it would be helpful&#146;&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="60719-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="06071984000006"></a>It was also clear from our evidence that, on the whole, Ministers welcomed and supported that independence. They saw that the independence of regulators is a vital ingredient in maintaining consistency, for ensuring that regulatory decisions are taken by competent authorities&#151;which, as we noted, accords well with current and prospective developments in the European Union&#151;and for promoting confidence about regulation among those investing in regulated industries, as well as customers on whose behalf it is carried out. It is also extremely important for promoting confidence among those bodies that are regulated.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="06071984000007"></a>In evidence to the committee, the Department of Trade and Industry said that,</p>
<ul><a name="06071984000125"></a>&#147;the independence of economic regulators from Government&#151;insulating decisions from short term political factors&#151;is a fundamental contributor to regulatory certainty and prerequisite for continuing to attract private finance to regulated sectors&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06071984000107"></a>The independence of economic regulators is thus recognised as crucial and as the report stressed, it is not at the expense of accountability. On the whole, we found that Ministers recognised and welcomed that independence.</p>
<a name="time_19"></a>
<a name="60719-0008.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="06071984000133"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="06071984000008"></a>That brings me to the provisions of the Bill. The amendment moved by my noble friend Lady Wilcox seeks to protect the functions of the economic regulators. My amendment is designed to probe the Government about what they intend to do to protect the independence as well as the jurisdiction of the economic regulators. As my noble friend has said, some of the economic regulators have concerns that the provisions of the Bill could be used to amend the statutes creating them and the framework within which they operate. Orders could be used to constrain their jurisdiction or to limit their independence. As my noble friend Lady Wilcox said, and as she argued at Second Reading, it is not a hypothetical possibility. She mentioned the clash between the Transport Secretary and the Rail Regulator in 2001 which showed that in exceptional circumstances a Minister may try to limit the independence of a regulator.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="06071984000009"></a>Thus, there is a need to protect the independenceof the economic regulators and&#151;picking up onmy earlier point about reassertion of that independence&#151;to be seen to be doing so. There needs to be a change to the Bill to reassure investors as well as the regulated bodies that that independence will be protected and that it will not be subject to the possibility, at any time, of a Minister deciding to use the order-making power to get round the decision of a regulator.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="06071984000010"></a>My amendment is designed to cover independence as well as jurisdiction in order to prevent a Minister transferring the functions of a regulator to another agent. The regulatory powers have to stay in the hands of the independent regulator. Like my noble friend Lady Wilcox, I have no doubt that the Minister will reiterate the Government&#146;s commitment to the independence of the economic regulators and say that there is no intention to use powers in the Bill to affect their independence. The problem, as has been variously reiterated in our debates, is that the Minister's words cannot bind a future Government. The need for an amendment is especially crucial in this case to demonstrate that the Bill cannot be used for that purpose. This Bill brings into being the sword of Damocles. It needs to be removed.</p>

The economic regulators clearly fulfil a very important role in our society today, especially the five economic regulators that are identified in the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, to which the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, has added a sixth. They also have great power. If they are to do their job properly it seems to me that they must be free of all government interference. They must not be lent on to reach any particular decision in any particular case. Their independence must be plain for all to see. I suspect that is agreed on all sides of the Committee.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="06071984000012"></a>When we were considering the Constitutional Reform Act, we wrote into Clause 1 that all Ministers must uphold the independence of the judiciary. Those were the very words that we put into Clause 1. Obviously, regulators are not judges in the ordinary sense, but they fulfil a quasi-judicial role. For that reason they must not only be independent, which I am sure they are, but they must also be seen to be independent, to use that well worn clich&#233;. That is why, of the two amendments before the Committee, I prefer that of the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, because the clause heading in his amendment refers specifically to &#147;Independence of economic regulators&#148;. I would go rather further than the noble Lord and I would spell out in clearer language in the body of the clause itself what it is we want. We should say in simple terms that an order under Part 1 of the Bill shall neither restrict the jurisdiction nor undermine the independence of the economic regulators. That is quite simple and short. It would do the job and I would leave it at that.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="06071984000013"></a>The amendment of the noble Baroness does not go far enough, because it does not refer in any way to the independence of the regulators. That of the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, is better, and does at least refer to independence, but I would sooner see it in the body of the clause rather than in the clause heading.</p>

The amendment is in his name and that of my noble friend Lord Berkeley, who is unfortunately not able to be in his place today.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="06071984000015"></a>Several of the agencies listed in the amendments were created when former publicly owned industries were privatised. Because an element of monopoly was created, a regulator was needed to control monopoly abuse with a measure of price control. That was the case with gas, electricity, the railways and water. Of course, I entirely agree with what each of the three speakers so far has emphasised. The word &#147;independence&#148; is absolutely vital: independence from the industry and ministerial control, except the minimum necessary to establish one&#146;s financial needs to the Treasury each year; but otherwise independent of the Government.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="06071984000016"></a>It may be that, at some stage during the lifetime of one of these agencies, competition in the industry develops to such an extent that regulation is either no longer needed&#151;that might sound rather extreme&#151;or, at any rate, need not be so stringent. Therefore, the regulations imposed by or upon the agency may need to be changed. Both of the amendments are somewhat extreme, in that no detail of any kind could be altered except by statute when a regulatory reform order would surely be quite useful in dealing with the detail. The speeches of the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, were not attacking detail but were concerned with independence and interfering with the principles and basic functions of the agencies.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="06071984000017"></a>Ofcom is referred to. Some of us were here during the lengthy debates on the Communications Bill, which became the 2003 Act. It involved a massive merger of a number of separate agencies dealing with television and radio, the Broadcasting Standards Commission and so on. It is a huge piece of legislation and regulation. The legislation imposed rules on Ofcom. Of course, as the years have gone by, Ofcom itself has imposed regulation on those subject to its jurisdiction. It occurs to me that after two or three years, let alone 10 years or so, there may also be a need to deal with the detail of regulation in a way which does not necessarily have to involve full-scale primary legislation.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="06071984000018"></a>Indeed, either Ofcom or the other regulators mentioned in these amendments may be desired by the agency itself in order to perform its tasks better. To seek an order under the Act would surely be sensible. We have not yet debated the various preconditions, safeguards, consultation and so on. I will not go into that, because we will be debating it at length in due course. I ask those of your Lordships who are inclined to favour a detailed amendment like either of the amendments before us to bear in mind that there are lots of safeguards with regard to any order made under the Bill.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="06071984000019"></a>I favour Amendment No. 47B because it is more cautious and gentle than that of the noble Baroness. I could not help notice, having previously had a connection with the Office of Fair Trading, that it has been added in, whereas it was not in the original one. It reminds me of a point on which I can support the noble Lord. Not long ago, the Hampton report proposed that quite a fundamental part of the Office of Fair Trading&#146;s work&#151;consumer affairs and protection&#151;should be hived off and handed, together with local authority trading standards matters, to a new agency called the consumer and trading standards agency.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="06071984000020"></a>That idea was shot down by the Treasury, much to the relief of those presently in charge of the Office of Fair Trading, who have been able to retain their consumer affairs jurisdiction. I support what the noble Lord, Lord Norton, was saying on this matter. If something substantial was proposed in terms of the remit given by statute to any of these agencies, then it ought to be attempted not by way of a regulatory reform order but by something else.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="06071984000021"></a>I hope that the Minister will say a word or two about another part of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Norton, dealing with freedom and independence from having the &#147;wishes&#148; of the Minister imposed on a regulator. Do the Government feel that that has any effect on something quite common in legislation, that agencies should be subject to a ministerial direction&#151;the technical term&#151;in certain circumstances? The noble Lord is probably trying to get at ministerial directions which inhibit the independence of these agencies. I feel a measure of support for him on that.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="06071984000023"></a>What is popularly known as Ofgem is rightly referred to here as the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets. When electricity prices went down to the point where a number of generators were going bust&#151;including, of course, British Energy&#151;I raised with the then chairman of Ofgem, Callum&#151;laterSir Callum&#151;McCarthy whether he was paying enough attention to an amendment in the Utilities Act 2000, which I proposed in this House and was carried with a majority of two, to impose on that body an obligation to have regard to the long-term stability of the industry. I asked him how he could justify what he was doing, forcing the prices down to the point where firms were going bust and not paying attention to what was in that Act. I have quoted his answer in the House before, and he has never denied it. It was at a semi-public occasion at the Institute of Economic Affairs. He said, &#147;I recognised that Ministers did not want that clause, and I have therefore not paid too much attention to it&#148;. I regarded that as a shocking thing for a regulator to say. But it illustrates the point of my noble friends and the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, that there is always a temptation, either on the part of Ministers to let it be known what their wishes are, or on the part of regulators who try to divine what the Minister&#146;s wishes might be. I yield to no one in my determination that regulators should be wholly independent of both influences.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="06071984000024"></a>The relevance of the Bill is that Ministers should not be able to influence the regulator by the order-making procedure under the Bill. In case the Minister is going to argue that this fear is unreal because nobody would do that, I quote the example of Sir Callum McCarthy. Of course, the Government opposed the clause. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, argued fiercely against it, but he lost the argument in the House, and it is in the Act. It is very important that we should take whatever steps we can in this Bill to strengthen and reinforce the independence of regulators.</p>

<p><a name="06071984000108"></a>I remember that, during the passage of the Financial Services and Markets Bill, the posts of chairman and chief executive officer were combined in one person. A small order may need to be placed by a Minister to separate the two roles. That would not be an attackon the independence of the regulator, but the amendment might prevent even such a simple thing. Unlike the noble Lords opposite, I believe that the Bill will do only very small things; it is designed to make the passing of simple orders easier, because it is currently difficult. This amendment would make the passing of a simple transfer order impossible. There would be no regulatory reform ever.</p>

On the first day in Committee, we got an admission from the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, that the Bill is to do with primary legislation only and has nothing to do with secondary legislation. I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Desai, is talking about matters arising out of secondary legislation that primary legislation already gives the Minister power to change. It has to be emphasised that we are talking about amending primary legislation only.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="06071984000027"></a>My view is that we should be extremely careful, because Ministers can never be trusted. Even my noble friend Lord Jenkin, who was an excellent Minister, should not have been trusted on principle. That is what Parliament is for: not to trust Ministers. When the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, replies, I am sure that he will say that this amendment is not necessary because the Government will not use the power. If it is not necessary and he is not going use it, he can accept the amendment. We do not trust him. Well, let us assume for the sake of argument that we make an exception and trust him of all the Ministers who have ever served the Crown. None the less, we do not trust anybody else. He cannot give that commitment. Either the power is necessary and will be used&#151;in which case, the Minister should tell us when&#151;or it is not necessary and the Government do not want to use it, and therefore they should not have it.</p>

These days, investors have no confidence in Ministers. Noble Lords will recall that 40 per cent of essential services&#151;public utilities&#151;are German owned and25 per cent French owned. International investors, who may not understand the complexities of British political and economic life, rely on stability and the independence of the regulators.</p>

<a name="60719-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="06071984000029"></a>I return to the bizarre and disgraceful incident of Railtrack. Investors had confidence in it until the Government decided that they would step in. Overnight, the rating of the United Kingdom in the international bond market went from AAA to zilch. That was because the bond market, which is critical to long-term investment in public utilities, wants stability. As noble Lords will recall, the bond market plays an important role in financing most acquisitions or investment in public utilities. We are talking of 25-year money at fixed rates placed with institutions&#151;pension funds and others. Such institutions are not thinking of a five-year change of Government; they are thinking about long-term, secure investment. To some extent, they are institutions acting on behalf of institutions, and they require stability and the knowledge that the regulator not only is independent but is perceived to be independent. Thus, if we do not pass an amendment such as this&#151;and I do not wish to go into the technicalities of one or the other&#151;and if the response of the Minister in this debate is not trustworthy and confidence-giving, there will be a little rattling in the bond market. We are not necessarily talking about equity investors; we are talking about the long-term market, which is very sensitive to security and stability.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="06071984000032"></a>I must say at the outset that I am unable to accept either of the amendments, for reasons that I hope will convince all noble Lords. I am a bit surprised that the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, moved Amendment No. 47A, because it appears to be in conflict with her party&#146;s policy intentions in another place. During the Standing Committee debate on 9 March, the Conservative opposition spokesperson on the Bill in the other place, the member for North East Hertfordshire, Mr Oliver Heald, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="06071984000119"></a>&#147;It would be wrong to let off the &#145;Ofs&#146;&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06071984000109"></a>which he had previously described as,</p>
<ul><a name="06071984000126"></a>&#147;Ofgas, Ofwat and the rest of them&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06071984000110"></a>He went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="06071984000120"></a>&#147;We need to have a system where the main regulators in this country set the standard, trailblazing for good principles of the sort set out in clause 19&#151;transparency, accountability, proportionate behaviour, consistency&#151;and targeting their actions. They should not be the ones who lag behind&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06071984000111"></a>Clause 19 is now Clause 23. I recognise that the opposition Front Bench in another place raised this during a clause stand part debate on Part 2, but I think that the policy intentions of the Opposition in another place are clear. I repeat that Mr Heald said that the &#147;Ofs&#148;,</p>
<ul><a name="06071984000127"></a>&#147;should not be the ones who lag behind&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Standing Committee A, 9/3/06; col. 271.].</ul>
<p><a name="06071984000033"></a>The Government wholeheartedly agree that the economic regulators should not be the ones who lag behind in the context of the better regulation agenda. </p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="06071984000034"></a>It is true that the economic regulators are excluded from the provisions in Part 2. Noble Lords may findit useful if I restate the specific reasons forthis exclusion. Part 2 implements certain recommendations in Philip Hampton&#146;s report <I>Reducing administrative burdens: effective inspection and enforcement.</I> That report made recommendations for reducing administrative burdens by promoting more efficient approaches to regulatory inspection and enforcement without compromising regulatory standards and outcomes. Economic regulators were excluded from the scope of the Hampton report because they had been the subject of a series of recent studies and because they concentrate on economic solutions to market failures rather than inspection and enforcement by regulators, which is the main focus of Part 2. The provisions in Clause 1 and, for that matter, in Clause 2 are wider in purpose and do not relate only to inspection and enforcement.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="06071984000035"></a>The Government believe that businesses must have the right to raise concerns if economic regulators are carrying out their functions in ways that are, for instance, overly bureaucratic, or if they are not exercising their functions in line with the five principles of good regulation. If there are sound reasons for suggesting any modifications of their statutory functions for the purposes of removing or reducing burdens, or for modifying the way in which those functions are carried out, it should be possible to address these by order as it would be possible for any other regulator.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="06071984000036"></a>Regulators, including the economic regulators, operate within not a stagnant but an ever-evolving and diverse environment. They need to be flexible and responsive to the challenges presented by the markets in which they operate. They must not be,</p>
<ul><a name="06071984000128"></a>&#147;the ones who lag behind&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06071984000112"></a>In fact, they must be the ones who are ahead of the game. In some cases this might require a modification of one or more of their regulatory functions. If noble Lords would care to go to the websites of some of the regulators and look at what is in their corporate plans and at the range of changing circumstances that the regulators recognise they face in the coming years, they will, I hope, understand the thrust of that point. </p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="06071984000037"></a>This amendment would take away from economic regulators a legislative vehicle that would enable such a valuable modification, even if it were required and requested by the regulator. Indeed, a recent article in the <I>Observer</I> said that, by definition, a regulatory body is bureaucratic, so the question is whether it could be less so. In principle, it should be possible, where appropriate, for Government and Parliament, in consultation with the regulators, to agree any sensible modification of their functions in the same way as they could for any other regulator. That is what Clause 1 would permit.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="06071984000038"></a>It is worth noting that, although this amendment is said to apply to Clause 2 as well as to Clause 1, it would not be possible under Clause 2 to modifyor abolish a regulatory function. Indeed, the Government have tabled Amendment No. 38 to make that even clearer. Clause 2 can be used to modify the way in which a regulator&#146;s functions are exercised, but the functions themselves would have to stay intact and could not be abolished. That being the case, I will concentrate on the effect of this amendment on what provision can be made under Clause 1.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="06071984000039"></a>The Government simply do not accept that not excluding the economic regulators from Part 1 will lead to market uncertainty. Including them in Part 1 will not lead to any heightened sense of insecurity for the market. Clause 1 provides an order-making power for the purpose of removing or reducing burdens. This power will be used only where appropriate, after full consultation and where proposals meet the relevant preconditions&#151;for example, that orders are proportionate to the policy objectives behind them and fairly balance the public interest against the interests of any person adversely affected by them.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="06071984000040"></a>To paraphrase the Member for North East Hertfordshire during the Standing Committee debate on 9 March, to exclude the economic regulators from Part 1 of the Bill would be potentially to &#147;let off&#148; the big boys&#151;the big regulators that have been set up by statute. Often they are the ones that people are most worried about. Would the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, be happy that, even if a specific and worthwhile proposal for reform of a regulatory function had been identified, the regulator could just go on acting in an excessive way and the powers that we are debating today could not be taken advantage of?</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="06071984000041"></a>I stress that the Government have no current intention of abolishing or even merging any of the economic regulators. The Government believe that those regulators are successful in carrying out their functions. Let us think specifically about a hypothetical order that would modify or abolish the functions of an economic regulator. If there was any doubt about whether such an order might undermine market security, or, in the language of the Bill, that it might create new obstacles to productivity, including innovation and competition, or impose new obstacles to the efficient working of the regulator in carrying out its functions, it would be unlikely that that order was for the purpose of removing or reducing burdens such as obstacles to productivity or efficiency.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="06071984000042"></a>Further, the preconditions in Clause 4 mean that, if a proposal to modify or abolish some of the functions of an economic regulator would be likely to remove necessary protections or fail to satisfy one of the other preconditions, surely the Minister would reasonably consider that the preconditions were not met and therefore that the order could not be made.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="06071984000043"></a>However, let us assume that this hypothetical and unreasonable Minister seeks to consult on his proposal. He would be under a statutory obligation to consult those affected by the proposal. He must therefore consult the body whose functions he is seeking to abolish or modify. The economic regulator would surely respond with evidence of where market security was at risk, and other consultees would be likely to agree. In these circumstances, the Government&#146;s undertakings not to pursue highly controversial proposals by order and not to undermine the independence of regulators would come into play, and the Minister would reconsider the wisdom of pursuing his proposal by order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="06071984000044"></a>For argument&#146;s sake, however, let us assume that the Minister persists and lays the order contrary to overwhelming evidence that suggests that the order should progress no further. The explanatory document that the Minister must lay alongside the order must give details of any consultation and any representations received. It must further give an assessment of what burdens would be removed or reduced and why he considers that the preconditions, including necessary protection, are satisfied. The role of the parliamentary committees, based on this and other evidence, is to judge whether they agree with the Minister&#146;s opinion. Members of the Committee will agree that, in the circumstances that I have described, the committees would be likely to find the order to be an inappropriate use of the power. If the committees did not agree that it removed or reduced burdens, they would question whether it was within the <I>vires</I> of the power. In such a case, they could of course exercise their statutory veto to block the order.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="06071984000045"></a>There is a further undertaking that the Government will not push an order through in the face of opposition from the relevant parliamentary committee. So the order would then fall unless overturned by a resolution of the House. Let us assume, though&#151;</p>

The point that he made earlier was that this amendment would prevent an order being put through even where the regulator wanted it. Surely that difficulty could be met easily enough by inserting the words &#147;without the consent of the regulator&#148; in the proposed amendment.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="06071984000048"></a>Let us assume that the order has been made. In this circumstance, if the fears about market security prove justified, those whose economic interests were adversely affected would be able to seek a judicial review of the order, and it would be within a court&#146;s powers, if it deemed the Minister&#146;s opinion irrational, to strike the order down.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="06071984000049"></a>So while an order could amend or abolish the functions of an economic regulator, this would clearly be possible only where the evidence, including economic arguments and cost benefit analysis, clearly demonstrated that the removal or modification of those functions was for the purpose of removing or reducing burdens, where the important preconditions in Clause 4 were satisfied and where the order did not breach the Government&#146;s undertaking to preserve the independence of regulators.</p>

<a name="06071984000050"></a><b><a name="60719-0009.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="06071984000149"></a>Lord Norton of Louth:</b> What would the effect on confidence be while all this was going on?</p>

<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="06071984000051"></a><b><a name="60719-0009.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="06071984000150"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> The situation would be the same as it is under the 2001 Act. I will come on to the independence of regulators and the role of Parliament. I do not think that the way in which the 2001 Act has operated has given rise to any difficulties in this regard.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="06071984000052"></a>In reality, any proposals that relate to economic regulators are likely to be more straightforward. I am thinking, for example, of the consultation already under way for an RRO under the 2001 Act powers&#151;from which, of course, there is no exclusion for the economic regulators&#151;to change the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. That Act sets out the functions and duties of the Financial Services Authority, which, as Members of the Committee will know, operates within a highly sensitive market. The proposed RRO would provide for better-targeted FSA regulation that is more risk based, and includes proposals to remove unnecessary or disproportionate consultation burdens placed by the FSA on industry. Surely that is exactly what we should be trying to achieve by such a measure. The order will also enable the FSA to deregulate more freely by issuing waivers and modifications to rules in a wider range of circumstances.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="06071984000053"></a>In this context it is worth mentioning that the safeguards described above have worked well under the 2001 Act. I understand that the mere existence of the order-making power in that Act, from which the economic regulators are not excluded, has not led to any uncertainty within the markets in which those regulators operate&#151;nor should it. This Bill contains stringent safeguards and is more focused on the delivery of better outcomes than was the 2001 Act, so it should provide an increased level of certainty for the listed economic regulators.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="06071984000054"></a>The amendment is an unnecessary restriction which would mean that the listed regulators themselves&#151;including the Office of Fair Trading, which is listed in Amendment No. 47B but not Amendment No. 47A&#151;would not be able to propose by order amendments to their functions even where that might be beneficial to enable more efficient delivery of their objectives.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="06071984000055"></a>To look at one of the differences between Amendment No. 47A and Amendment No. 47B, Amendment No. 47A deals with orders that we cannot &#147;abolish or modify&#148;. Modifying them by adding to them would not be permitted under the amendment. Whatever else one thinks of that amendment, it is difficult to see why any regulator would want that provision in the statute. Amendment No. 47B bears close relation to Amendment No. 47A but is more specific, in that it deals with not only changes to the functions of the economic regulators but the independence from Ministers of directors and members of the regulators and how such directors and members can be removed from office. Subsection (3) in Amendment No. 47B concerns a removal from office of the director and other members of a regulator. The Committee will be aware that the chairman and members of those regulators are, in accordance with the statute setting them up, all appointed by the Secretary of State. In some cases, the statute specifies that the terms of appointment shall be determined by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="06071984000056"></a>The Committee may also be aware that the Secretary of State already has the statutory right to remove a chairman or other member on grounds such as misconduct or incompetence. I am therefore unclear what additional protections the amendment is intended to achieve. If it is about the Government misusing the powers in the Bill&#151;for example, if they seek to remove a hypothetical director-general of an economic regulator as swiftly as possible&#151;making an order under the Bill is not the way to do that, as the Committee will know. There are stringent safeguards in place and rigorous scrutiny for all orders that a Minister proposes.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="06071984000057"></a>The point has been made that orders must havethe consent of the economic regulators. They would be consulted and their views expressed in the Explanatory Memorandum. The Bill is about regulators operating efficiently, but also about the regulated not being subject to unnecessary burdens. We need the flexibility to consider all views and Parliament would then determine where the balance lies. The regulator&#146;s view will not necessarily be the only or predominant one. That seems to me to be absolutely right.</p>

<a name="60719-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="06071984000058"></a>On the issue of primary and secondary legislation raised by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, just to be clear, orders can be used to amend or repeal primary and secondary legislation. Our point is that a Minister is unlikely to use an order under the Bill only to amend secondary legislation, as departments already have power to amend or repeal such legislation. On the issue of the wishes of Ministers, I should like to understand how noble Lords can explain how imposing an obligation to comply with the wishes of the Crown could remove or reduce burdens under the clause or to promote the five regulatory principles under Clause 2. I do not see how that can happen. On independence from the wishes of the Minister, there are stringent safeguards in place to prevent an abuse of ministerial power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="06071984000059"></a>Given the potential better regulation benefits for the economic regulators, the stringent safeguards in Part 1, and the fact that the 2001 Act has not led to an environment of uncertainty in the markets in which these regulators operate, I urge the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="06071984000078"></a>The noble Lord said: This group of amendments contains a number of alternatives, all with the same objective: to ring-fence certain matters&#151;broadly speaking, those of constitutional importance&#151;so that they cannot be altered by order under this part. The Government have accepted that that procedure should not be used to introduce controversial changes to laws. I hope that they would also accept that it should not be used to introduce significant changes to the constitution because, where constitutional change is proposed, it should be debated in full, even if there appears to be a broad consensus. We therefore want to exclude the use of the procedure under the Bill to make constitutional changes, because the test of what is or is not a constitutional matter is very difficult to define in a statute. An important defence against the use of this procedure to effect constitutional changes will be the powers of Select Committees to recommend that a draft order should not be proceeded with. We will consider amendments later to strengthen that power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="06071984000079"></a>I believe it is possible and desirable to give some guidance in the statute on what are constitutional matters. Amendment No. 51 starts by specifically ruling out provisions that have an adverse effect on the rule of law or on the independence of the judiciary. Everyone in the Committee must agree that these are central pillars of the constitution. This procedure should therefore plainly not be used if that provision would have an adverse effect on the rule of law or the independence of the judiciary, even very slightly.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60719-0010.htm"/>


<a name="60719-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="06071984000080"></a>I shall move on to the wider aspects of the constitution. The amendments in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Maclennan of Rogart offer three different ways of identifying whether an order gives rise to issues of constitutional importance. The first is Amendment No. 51, which would simply make it one of the necessary conditions in Clause 4 that the provision is not of constitutional importance. It would then be a matter for the courts on judicial review to decide whether that condition was satisfied or that the order was <I>ultra vires</I> because it was of constitutional importance. That is the simplest of the possible alternatives. I recognise that it is perhaps too simple. It is not easy to identify which matters are of constitutional importance. Some are obvious, but many are in the penumbra. It would be a very difficult decision for the judge to take, and it arguably brings the judiciary into possible conflicts with Parliament that are best avoided if possible.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="06071984000081"></a>The second alternative is provided by Amendment No. 62, which shifts the decision on what is a matter of constitutional importance from a judge to the Speakers of each House. The Speakers will, to a considerable extent, know a great deal about the constitution because they are engaged in it day by day. I assume that they could and would take advice from leading experts on the constitution before taking a decision. A conclusion reached by the Speaker of either House that the order was of constitutional importance would then block further progress. That also has the advantage of getting rid of possible conflict with the judiciary. There might be some uncertainty in the early stages about how the Speakers would apply the test of constitutional importance, but a body of precedent would be built up over time.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="06071984000082"></a>The third possible course is Amendment No. 63, which is based on a proposal discussed at paragraph 56 of the 11th report of the Select Committee on the Constitution in this Session. That report set out a list of matters of constitutional importance that should not be changed by order under the Bill. I have adopted that list and slightly redrafted it. It starts with the powers of, and succession to, the Crown, which is obviously of the highest constitutional importance. I shall not read the rest of the paragraphs. All these matters are sufficiently important to justify inclusion in the list. There may be others&#151;indeed, I would welcome suggestions of any proposed additions.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="06071984000083"></a>Amendment No. 64, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, would operate on the same principle underlying Amendment No. 63. It is more concise, which is an advantage, than AmendmentNo. 63, which is less complete, which is a disadvantage.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="06071984000084"></a>The remaining amendments&#151;Amendments Nos. 75 and 75A, which are not in my name and that of my noble friend&#151;use a different system for the same purpose. I shall deal with them briefly now. That purpose is to provide a list of statutes that cannot be altered by the order, rather than a list of issues. It is much better than nothing, but it suffers from the defects pointed out in paragraph 55 of the Select Committee&#146;s report, to which I have already referred. It means, among other problems, that the list would have to be updated every time a new statute of possible constitutional importance was introduced, which might lead to unnecessary arguments about whether the statute should be listed. In many cases&#151;this is an important distinction&#151;statutes contain provisions of constitutional importance alongside provisions that are plainly not of constitutional importance. I have in mind the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, perhaps particularly because I was engaged on it for many months. The Act contains central provisions on the appointment of the judiciary by a judicial appointments commission and on the composition and functions of the Supreme Court, which are plainly of five-star constitutional importance. But there are other provisions in the Bill, such as those relating to the role of the judicial ombudsman, which are much less important and may not be of constitutional importance.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="06071984000085"></a>I hope there will be a debate on the various alternatives, and I would certainly listen to that debate with interest before I decided which of these various suggested alternatives I might bring back on Report. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="06071984000086"></a><b><a name="60719-0010.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="06071984000164"></a>Lord Norton of Louth:</b> My Amendment No. 64 is included in the group, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has already said. My proposed new clause is my contribution to the attempt to ensure that the Bill is as narrowly drawn as possible and cannot be used to infringe on the basic arrangements of our constitution. Ministers have reiterated that that is not the Bill&#146;s intention but, as we keep pointingout, ministerial assurances cannot bind future Governments.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="06071984000087"></a>The attempt to put the basic tenets of the constitution beyond the reach of the Bill may be done by reference to specific measures of constitutional law, generically through reference to the basic framework of our constitution, or through both. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive, which is an important point to stress. In his response to the Constitution Committee and to what my noble friend Lord Kingsland said on Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, argues in his letter of 27 June that the Bill is designed to achieve better regulation and that the amendments made in the other place put it beyond doubt that the Bill could not be used for any other purpose. He argues, therefore, that it could not be used, as he puts it, &#147;for inappropriate constitutional change&#148;. The problem with this argument is that he assumes that better regulation and constitutional change are mutually exclusive. That they are not may even be inferred from his use of language when he refers to &#147;inappropriate&#148; constitutional change, which implies that appropriate constitutional change may be permissible.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="06071984000088"></a>The Minister&#146;s contention that constitutional change is already beyond the provisions of the Bill is not sustainable. If the Bill is to be confined to reducing regulatory burdens that are not contentious, it needs to be as tightly drawn as possible, with the provisions of the constitution put clearly beyond its reach. As I have said, this may be done using a specific or a generic approach, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;I am sorry; I mean the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, who is in danger of being confused with rather a lot of other noble Lords or former noble Lords&#151;has said.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="06071984000089"></a>The Constitution Committee offered a list of measures that might be excluded. As it recognised, that may not be an entirely straightforward exercise. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, picked up on this in his letter in arguing against such an approach. However, his arguments are not persuasive. He draws on the Constitution Committee in saying that there may be difficulties in identifying which Acts are constitutional and which are not, and that there may be provisions in Acts of constitutional importance that are not in essence constitutional. My response would be to note that one can have a list of measures clearly recognised as constitutional, as demonstrated by the Constitution Committee in paragraph 53 of its report and as embodied in Amendment No. 75A, and that any gaps in coverage may be dealt with by utilising the generic approach. As I have said, the two are complementary. Doubtless there will be provisions of the Acts adumbrated in Amendment No. 75A that are not of constitutional importance, but one has only to look at the statutes listed to realise that relatively few of them are likely to contain provisions that need to be amended for the purpose of better regulation. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, indicated some that may, but I see no reason why the Acts listed should not in their totality be excluded from the provisions of this measure.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="06071984000090"></a>As the noble Lord has already indicated, my new clause is not dissimilar in aim to Amendment No. 62, but seeks to achieve it through a somewhat different route. Under Amendment No. 62 it would be for the Speaker of either House to determine whether a proposed order covered a matter of constitutional importance; under my amendment the courts would have to make such a determination by reference to a broad definition of the constitution. As is the case for Amendment No. 62, my amendment could be agreed in addition to rather than instead of Amendment No. 63. It draws on and modifies some existing definitions of a constitution and seeks to provide an overarching one. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, indicated, it could be argued that it does so at the expense of precision. That does not matter unduly because if the Bill is designed to remove burdens that are not overly contentious in the furtherance of better regulation, no orders are ever likely to come close to being challenged for infringing the terms of the proposed new clause, so I argue that the Government have nothing to lose by accepting the amendment. Incorporating this provision will ensure that the measure cannot be abused by future Governments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="06071984000091"></a>What we are discussing is absolutely crucial in terms of ensuring that the Bill is ring-fenced and capable of achieving only the purpose for which the Government say it is intended. If the Minister argues that my amendment or those advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, are deficient in their drafting, the onus will rest on him to come back with an amendment that meets the very real concerns that have been expressed, not only inside but outside Parliament. We cannot allow this measure to go through with what is in effect still largely a blank cheque approach for future Governments.</p>

<a name="06071984000092"></a><b><a name="60719-0010.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="06071984000165"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> Amendment No. 75, in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour, adopts the list approach&#151;my noble friend once again sends her apologies that she cannot be with us. This point was addressed in the report of the Select Committee on the Constitution, and I base my arguments on paragraph 23:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="06071984000123"></a>&#147;Constitutional safeguards cannot depend on ministerial assurances...The rule of law and the principle of constitutional government require the security of procedures and limitations which are set out expressly on the face of any enactment which empowers Ministers to change the statute book by order...The legitimate desire of any government to deliver change should not be allowed to undermine the need for careful consultation and scrutiny of proposals that may have the effect of altering basic constitutional machinery&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06071984000113"></a>That committee and the Regulatory Reform Committee considered the suggestion that there should be a list of exempted statutes. It is interesting to note Clause 9, entitled &#147;Excepted enactments&#148;, which is very short and well worth reading:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="06071984000124"></a>&#147;An order under this Part may not make provision amending or repealing any provision of&#151;</p>
</ul><ul><a name="06071984000129"></a>(a) this Part, or</ul><ul><a name="06071984000130"></a>(b) the Human Rights Act 1998&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06071984000114"></a>Why pick out the Human Rights Act as one which should not be susceptible to amendment by order? One could argue that a number of very important constitutional Acts should equally have the protection of express exception from Clause 1. My noble friend and I have listed some of them in Amendment No. 75.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="06071984000093"></a>My noble friend Lord Kingsland has set out a much longer list. Certainly we could discuss which enactments should be regarded as so fundamental to the constitution of this country that they should not be able to be amended by order. That brings me to this question: why does the Bill single out the Human Rights Act 1998? If it is right to exempt it, surely it is logical to look at other issues of significance to the constitution of this country, the rights and duties of its citizens and the rights of Parliament, and exempt them as well. The list in our amendment includes enactments such as the European Communities Act 1972, the Scotland Act 1998 and the Northern Ireland Act 1998, and my noble friend Lady Carnegy specifically asked me to mention its last two proposed exemptions:</p>
<ul><a name="06071984000131"></a>&#147;the continued existence of the High Court of Justiciary as a criminal court of first instance and of appeal ... the continued existence of the Court of Session as a civil court of first instance and of appeal&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06071984000115"></a>The Law Society of Scotland has placed particular emphasis on ensuring that those bodies cannot be affected by the order-making power in Clause 1, which is why our amendment is drafted in this way.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="06071984000094"></a>My noble friend Lord Kingsland has set out a much longer list, and I shall be interested to hear about it. This debate gives us an opportunity to consider whether something should be done&#151;the Government have already conceded that by specifying the Human Rights Act&#151;and whether by a list or by a generic turn of phrase to include all these provisions, as my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth suggests. It is beyond peradventure that somewhere in this Bill we need a very clear exception so that the order-making power cannot be used to amend fundamental constitutional statutes. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, in his letter, placed great weight on the report which suggested that this would create a sort of blunderbuss approach and asked what would happen if a new Act needed to be added. We need to address that point, but I do not regard it as a conclusive argument against putting a list in the Bill. Amendments Nos. 75 and 75A are both good ways of approaching this.</p>

I do not suppose he would say that it is perfect or comprehensive, and if there were any doubt it would depend on judicial interpretation. However, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has made a powerful point in referring to Clause 9. If the Bill mentions the Human Rights Act 1998, why can it not mention other constitutional legislation which, it could be argued, is equally important?</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="06071984000096"></a>An attempt has been made to list types of constitutional laws, in Amendment No. 63 in particular. I do not like that because I expect that any of us, when looking at each item carefully, could be critical. I would be particularly critical of proposed subsection (2)(h) in Amendment No. 63, which refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="06071984000132"></a>&#147;the statutory powers of local authorities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06071984000116"></a>Local authorities deal with a huge body of legislation which covers everything from sewage to highways to transport to goodness knows what. Such legislation could hardly be regarded as of constitutional importance or be anywhere near as important as the other matters listed in the amendment such as the powers of the Houses of Parliament, the duration of Parliament and so on. The trouble with a list is that if it is not comprehensive you will miss something out; and if, as I suggest, the list includes inappropriate matters such as the statutory powers of local authorities, one has objections. I think the approach of the noble Lord, Lord Norton, is much better.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="06071984000097"></a>I fear that the Government may take help from Clause 4, which relates to preconditions. The clause contains various phrases which are no doubt important, but it is terribly vague on their meaning. It may be said that orders cannot be made under this Bill which would prevent someone continuing to exercise any right or freedom which that person might reasonably expect to continue to exercise&#151;such as, I suppose, the right to jury trial in many instances&#151;and Clause 4(2)(d) provides that orders cannot be made which would remove any necessary protection. That is incredibly vague.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="06071984000098"></a>I hope the Minister will have something more positive to say about the amendments&#146; legitimate objective of ring-fencing matters relating to the constitution. This has been done in Clause 9 for the Human Rights Act; it can surely be done for other matters. Rather than a list, I would prefer the broad phrases suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth.</p>

<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="06071984000099"></a><b><a name="60719-0010.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="06071984000167"></a>Lord Henley:</b> I suspect that all noble Lords who have spoken so far&#151;I do not know whether this will necessarily apply to the Minister&#151;have been singing, dare I say it, from the same hymn sheet but using different words. We have got the tune right and somehow before Report we have to get the words right.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="06071984000100"></a>Different approaches have been suggested but perhaps I may start with the methods proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. Generally we support one of his three approaches set out in his Amendments Nos. 52, 62 and 63, although we think there are problems with some of them. For example, Amendment No. 62 proposes a mechanism whereby in this House the Lord Speaker would adjudicate on whether a provision is of constitutional importance. I do not want to reignite debate about the role of the Lord Speaker, but that would widen the role ofthe Lord Speaker considerably, possibly to an unacceptable degree. Any extension of the Lord Speaker&#146;s role should be considered carefully. It should not be a part of any other Bill; the whole House should consider the matter at an appropriate stage, as and when it arises. It should not be slipped into a Bill such as this.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="06071984000101"></a>In addition to the three approaches of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, an alternative generic approach has been proposed by my noble friend Lord Norton, and a list method has been put forward by my noble friends Lord Jenkin of Roding and Lady Carnegy. A further variant on the list version is contained in Amendment No. 75A, in the name of my noble friend Lord Kingsland. The list suggested in my noble friend&#146;s amendment is based on the Select Committee&#146;s report and mirrors the list of enactments contained in paragraph 3; that is why it is longer than the one suggested by my noble friend Lord Jenkin. Perhaps the two lists could be merged, particularly to include the last two enactments in AmendmentNo. 75, put forward at the insistence of my noble friend Lady Carnegy.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="06071984000102"></a>Most of the Committee seems to agree that there should be such a safeguard. We look forward very much to hearing from the Minister but I have a sneaking feeling that the important thing is for us to put our heads together before Report to reach an agreed approach. Whether we come forward with a list system or a generic system, we could put it to the Government on Report. In the mean time, I would like to hear what the Minister has to say.</p>

<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="06071984000103"></a><b><a name="60719-0010.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="06071984000168"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> This has been an interesting debate on an issue which, I recognise, has caused some concern in the past: the imagined potential of this Bill to interfere with the constitution. I thought we had got beyond that point but clearly it is a concern, and I shall deal with the proposed remedies, which differ considerably. There are three from the Liberal Democrats, in one bundle of amendments; two different ones from Conservative Front Benches and Back Benches; and another. It is a difficult but interesting attempt by noble Lords to come up with the same tune, which I think is the expression used by the noble Lord, Lord Henley.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="06071984000104"></a>Listening to the contributions, I thought we were talking about a rather different Bill because I do not recognise it as other noble Lords describe it. While I can understand the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, being suspicious of all ministerial pronunciations, in the end we have to trust the Government to mean what they say about the intention of their legislation. It is certainly not our intention&#151;it never has been&#151;to make inappropriate constitutional changes by using the order-making power in Clause 1.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="06071984000105"></a>This Bill is, in many respects, very different from the Bill as it was when it was brought before another place because we have reflected long and hard on the constitutional concerns raised. We have taken those concerns very carefully into account and amended the Bill in such a way, I would argue, as to ensure that if ever there was a suspicion that this or future Governments could use this Bill in a controversial way to amend elements of the constitution, we have put that suspicion beyond peradventure.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="06071984000106"></a>Clause 1(3) defines the burdens that can be removed or reduced by the order-making power. It is very difficult to see how constitutional change could be squeezed into that definition. In any event, robust preconditions inserted through Clause 4 must be satisfied before an order can be made. Notably, these preconditions include: that the provision made by the order strikes a fair balance between the public interest and the interests of any person adversely affected by it; that it does not remove necessary protections; and that it does not prevent any person continuing to exercise any right or freedom which that person might reasonably expect to continue to exercise. These preconditions could fairly be used to prevent the kind of constitutional mischief for which noble Lords imagine a Government might want to use the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="06071990000001"></a>Furthermore, Clauses 17, 18 and 19 provide that parliamentary committees can veto orders. The Government have already tabled amendments that remove the criteria on which the veto can be exercised. This is a powerful check, giving the whip hand to Parliament should it disagree with the Government on the appropriateness of an order. It therefore seems that there is a risk that these amendments cry wolf. Can the order-making power in Clause 1 be used for constitutional change beyond the declared purpose of better regulation? I have expressed the view that it cannot. We are fortified in our view by the reports of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and the Constitution Committee of your Lordships&#146; House. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee said that the Clause 1 power is not inappropriate. The Government consider the amendments in this group to be unnecessary, and there are very great difficulties in framing amendments of this kind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="06071990000002"></a>At Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, reflected on this conundrum. His Amendments Nos. 51, 52, 62 and 63 do not list a set of constitutional enactments&#151;if such a class of legislation could be said to exist&#151;which he acknowledged would be difficult, if not impossible, to define.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="06071990000003"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, raised this issue at Second Reading in relation to listing constitutional or protected enactments. I have set out the Government&#146;s view on this in a letter which has been extensively circulated. The noble Lord&#146;s Amendment No. 75A lists those Acts identified by the Constitution Committee. This list drew on a similar list drawn up by the Joint Committee on the Civil Contingencies Bill. However, the committee also identified a number of other Acts passed since the passage of that Bill&#151;the Constitutional Reform Act, the Identity Cards Act, the Equality Act and the Racial and Religious Hatred Act&#151;which the noble Lord&#146;s amendment does not include.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="06071990000004"></a>What of changes to local government? I have heard noble Lords in this House argue that a new piece of local government legislation that relates to finance or the structure of local government in a sense treads on constitutional territory. What of the creation of the Greater London Authority? Was that a constitutional act? Definitions and inclusions on lists are very difficult: defining such a list is like asking how long is a piece of string. Where would it begin and end? This list shows that difficulty.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="06071990000005"></a>If we were to include the Equality Act and the Racial and Religious Hatred Act, then why not the Sex Discrimination Act, the Race Relations Act,the Disability Discrimination Act, the Equal Pay Act or the minimum wage legislation? Where is the boundary between an Act with constitutional implications and an Act that relates to the fundamental building blocks of our constitution? What of the many other Bills on which the Constitution Committee has reported? What ofthe Armed Forces Bill, the Police and Justice Bill, the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill, the Prevention of Terrorism Bill and the Inquiries Bill, on which the committee reported in the current and previous Session of Parliament? Is the constitution solely contained in Acts of Parliament? That is a concept we need to focus on. What about concepts such as parliamentary sovereignty?</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="06071990000006"></a>Furthermore, as the noble Lord acknowledged, it would be foolish to put some Acts off limits when it may be necessary to make minor and sensible changes to them for the purposes of better regulation&#151;what I might call an appropriate constitutional change. The noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, did not seemto think that there might be any appropriate constitutional changes. There may be issues of minor importance which are not highly controversial and not ruled out by Clause 4 that it would be perfectly acceptable to change in this way.</p>

<a name="60719-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="06071990000007"></a>How would such a list be kept up to date? For instance, the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, includes the Government of Wales Act 1998. But as Members of the Committee are aware, Parliament is considering a Bill that would supersede the 1998 Act in shaping Welsh devolution.</p>

If a Bill is going through Parliament and it becomes apparent that if enacted it would be appropriate to add it to the list of Acts that are excluded from being amended by order under this legislation, it would be a very simple matter to have an additional clause in the Bill, adding it to the list. I do not see that this is an obstacle. We could do that each time one came up. Most would not but some would.</p>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="06071990000011"></a>The Government&#146;s view is to concur exactly with the Constitution Committee&#146;s view expressed at paragraph 55. It said that,</p>
<ul><a name="06071990000331"></a>&#147;there are a number of practical difficulties with this approach of simply listing Acts of Parliament&#148;.</ul>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="06071990000014"></a>I have set out the committee&#146;s important point along with our view. Presumably because of these difficulties, the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Maclennan, have tabled amendments setting out other ways of affording protection against the Clause 1 power being abused to make major constitutional changes. Amendment No. 62 does this by providing a hurdle over which Ministers and the Speakers of either House must jump: the Speakers of either House can certify that an order is of constitutional importance which has the effect of vetoing the order. </p>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="06071990000015"></a>Amendment No. 62 would effectively introduce a new precondition providing that orders cannot be used for measures of constitutional importance. However, the existing preconditions have already filtered out the possibility that an order could be used for a matter of constitutional importance. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, explained very clearly, the amendment provides that the Speaker of either House could determine that a matter was of &#147;constitutional importance&#148; on application from a Member of that House. If the relevant Speaker determined that an order was of constitutional importance, he would issue a certificate to that effect and the order would be halted in its tracks. The intention of the clause is that the Speaker&#146;s decision would not be justiciable since it would be protected by an ouster clause.</p>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="06071990000016"></a>We argue that this does not work. There is no comparison with the role of the Speaker of the Commons in certifying that a Bill is a Money Bill&#151;a demonstrable fact. Nor is it comparable to the role of the Speaker in relation to the Parliament Act, where the Speaker&#146;s role relates solely to ensuring that certain procedures had been followed. The amendment risks drawing the Speakers of either House into a highly subjective, highly political debate. I suggest that this is undesirable, not least in your Lordships' House where noble Lords have given no indication that they would support a Speaker having a substantive role of this sort. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, made that point very effectively. Given recent debates, I suggest that the proposition that the Lord Speaker makes this judgment in your Lordships' House would attract a good deal of controversy from the Benches opposite.</p>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="06071990000017"></a>It is interesting that Amendment No. 62 puts the matter of judgment in the hands of the Speakers rather than the parliamentarians. AmendmentNo. 63, also tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Maclennan, provides a new clause that would prohibit an order made under Clause 1 making any alteration to a range of matters that might be described as constitutional.</p>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="06071990000018"></a>The list provided in Amendment No. 63 is certainly an improvement on a broader list of constitutional subjects, which would lead to some very difficult issues around judging &#147;purpose&#148;. But it does not avoid the difficulties of defining what is or is not constitutional change, and in seeking to define a constitutional change or issue, it creates new problems of definition.</p>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="06071990000019"></a>That also applies to Amendment No. 75 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding. This is a mixture of a few individual statutes and certain subjects. It therefore falls foul of the difficulties identified by the Constitution Committee in listing individual statutes and constitutional areas. On the former, for instance, it does not include the legislation governing devolution for Wales but it does for Scotland.</p>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="06071990000020"></a>Amendment No. 75A, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, provides, yet again, a different list. It includes the Government of Wales Act 1998 but the very fact that the list is so different from the lists in Amendments Nos. 75 and 63 illustrates the difficulty of deciding what would be an appropriate list. Again, that point was made by the Constitution Committee.</p>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="06071990000021"></a>Amendment No. 64 of the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, takes a less expansive view of what is &#147;constitutional&#148; and therefore might require special protection. It sees &#147;constitutional&#148; more in terms of the relationship between the main branches of the state. We might therefore see the proposed new clause as protecting the constitutional relationship under the Bill of Rights from change by the order-making power in the Bill. However, the problem remains that such a list is partial. In addition, the Constitution Committee recognised the difficulties with devising a schedule of exempted areas. It states that a schedule would be &#147;something of a blunderbuss approach&#148;. That is an adequate description. The committee notes that not all provisions in Acts with constitutional implications affect our constitutional arrangements and concludes that,</p>
<ul><a name="06071990000332"></a>&#147;it might be thought wrong to exclude such provisions from the general operation of the bill&#148;.</ul>
<a name="60719-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="06071990000022"></a>Amendment No. 51 would introduce a new precondition so that the order-making power could not be used adversely to affect the rule of law or the independence of the judiciary. As the Bill stands, I cannot see how any order could do such things. As a matter of course, Ministers have to act under the rule of law. By definition, Ministers cannot do anything for which they have no legal authority. It is therefore hard to see how Ministers could promote an order that adversely affected something they were bound to follow.</p>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="06071990000023"></a>It is also hard to see how it would be possible adversely to affect the independence of the judiciary. Under Clause 4, a Minister cannot make an order which he considers removes a necessary protection. It is therefore difficult to envisage how a Minister could conclude that an order which adversely affectedthe independence of the judiciary satisfied that precondition. Furthermore, it is hard to see how Parliament would agree to such an amendment, and it is difficult to see how such an order would survive judicial consideration of <I>vires</I>, given that secondary legislation is subject to judicial scrutiny.</p>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="06071990000024"></a>The Government are satisfied that such fundamental changes could not be made by order under the Bill. The Clause 1 and Clause 2 powers are circumscribed: they can be used only to make sensible reforms removing or reducing burdens or promoting regulatory principles. This is guaranteed both by the preconditions and by the power of Parliament to veto an order. Since the order-making power in Clause 1 cannot be used for constitutional change, these amendments are otiose. There is no need to make any protection against orders being used for that end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="06071990000025"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Jenkin and Lord Borrie, and others made reference to the exemption of the Human Rights Act and Part 1 of the Bill from reform by order. It is true that the Government amended the Bill in the Commons to put amendments to the Human Rights Act off limits. This is not, though, because this is a constitutional statute which differs from other statutes, but because secondary legislation must be compliant with the Act. Therefore, it would be an illogical absurdity were the order-making power to be used to amend the Human Rights Act and so remove the safeguards provided by that Act. Similarly, it would be strange if orders could be used to remove the limits on the order-making powers contained in Part 1. For those reasons and others that have been adduced, I cannot accept the amendments. However, I accept that they were moved not only in good spirit but for very good reasons. I hope that I have answered the various points relating to noble Lords&#146; quite understandable concerns to protect our constitution.</p>

I have to say that I am unable to agree that the orders of constitutional importance are necessarily and automatically filtered out by the conditions in Clause 4 as they now stand. It is a significant issue and it will need to be taken further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="06071990000027"></a>The problem, as has been demonstrated by this debate, is that there is no single method of dealing with this problem which is ideal. All create some problems of their own. But there has been a clear demonstration of the view that some amendment is necessary, and that is reinforced by the clear statement in the report of the Constitution Committee that the existing protection was inadequate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="06071990000057"></a>The noble Lord said: This is really a probing amendment. Clause 6(1) says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="06071990000290"></a>&#147;An order under this Part may not make provision to impose or increase taxation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06071990000270"></a>That leaves it open to reduce or remove taxation. It is obvious that to impose a new tax or make an increase would require primary legislation, but given that taxation is one of the most important powers of Government, I wonder why it should not be also required to exclude all changes to taxation from the operation of this Bill. Can the Minister give an example of a possible reduction in taxation or elimination of a tax that would justify the use of an order rather than through a Finance Bill or something similar?</p>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="06071990000058"></a>I wonder, too, what the meaning of &#147;taxation&#148; is. There is no definition in the Bill, and I wonder what it includes. For example, does it include national insurance contributions, which are technically not regarded as a tax? Does it include customs duties, since there is a question whether duties are a form of taxation or, although also acting to raise money, something different from taxation? What is the definition of taxation here? I beg to move.</p>

Although I would normally tend to favour any mechanism that was designed for the reduction of tax I agree with him that it would be appropriate that, just as the Bill prevents any increases in tax, it should not allow for any decreases through this mechanism, and that the appropriate mechanism would be a Finance Bill. In what I think was his first outing as the new Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Cabinet Office, Mr Pat McFadden seemed to indicate that that was what should happen. I should be very grateful for confirmation of that from the Minister.</p>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="06071990000060"></a>When Pat McFadden responded in the House of Commons, he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="06071990000291"></a>&#147;It is not possible to use the powers to create a new tax, but it will be possible to reduce a tax if it meets the procedures and safeguards. In practice, however, tax reform would be dealt with in either a Finance Bill or a tax law rewrite project&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 15/5/06; col. 720.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06071990000271"></a>If that is the case, why does it not say that in the Bill? That would seem a more appropriate way in which to deal with these matters.</p>

<a name="06071990000061"></a><b><a name="60719-0011.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="06071990000360"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I hope that I can help on the points that have been raised. I understand the thrust of the amendment, which is probing. At the moment, the clause prevents an order from imposing or increasing taxation. It is not the intention that orders should be used to remove taxes or lower tax rates. Under the amendment, orders could not remove or alter taxation.</p>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="06071990000062"></a>I note this amendment and assure noble Lords that the Government agree that orders under Part 1 should not be able to remove taxes or lower tax rates, which is why we are keen to have this discussion today. We will consider carefully options for making it explicit in the Bill that orders cannot remove taxes or reduce tax rates. However, it is important to get the detail right. In particular, it is important that we do not inadvertently rule out being able to deliver a merger of regulators which would reduce or remove burdens on the regulated by reducing the multiple inspections of regulated firms, for example. If we are transferring regulatory functions from one regulator to another, it will often be necessary also to make provision relating to the transfer of assets and liabilities. It will also often be necessary to make associated provision relating to the tax treatment of those transfers&#151;and only those transfers. Noble Lords may wish to refer to the example of Schedule 10 to the Railways Act 2005.</p>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="06071990000063"></a>As I say, it is not the intention that orders should remove taxes or lower tax rates, but it is important that any amendment to Clause 6 does not rule out the possibility of such mergers. When an order under Clause 1 is considered appropriate by Parliament and its committees to deliver such a merger for the purpose of removing or reducing burdens, it is important that the order can also make the necessary provision varying the incidence of taxation in that particular case.</p>

<a name="60719-0011.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="06071990000064"></a>On the basis of that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will be satisfied. He asked, too, about the definition of taxation. For these purposes, taxation is the compulsory levying of money for state revenue, either nationally or locally, when the levy is not a fee or charge to recover the costs of supply in a specific service to which the fee or charge relates. Fines are not taxation; they are penalties for unlawful activities. It should be noted that there are precedents for using the term &#147;taxation&#148; as it is used in this Bill.</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="06071990000065"></a>For the purposes of Clause 6 it is important that, to prevent the imposition or increase of any tax, the meaning of taxation is not restricted to any particular taxes and is not narrowly defined. I hope that the use of that precedent in that way will reassure noble Lords. With the thrust of what we are trying to achieve, we shall need to bring something back to meet the narrow circumstances that I outlined, with the need to have some tax provisions, possibly associated with mergers of regulators.</p>

This is something that I am entirely satisfied with in principle, so I hope that the Government will bring back something that achieves their purpose, without giving a general power to reduce or remove taxation. I may in due course bring the amendment back simply to keep the Government on their toes and to ensure that we see something from them. I would obviously withdraw my amendment in favour of theirs.

<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="06071990000078"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall also speak to Amendment No. 74B. These amendments would insert more protections into Clause 8. Subsection (1) currently inserts only two prohibitions to the order-making power. An order cannot authorise any forcible entry, search or seizure or compel the giving of evidence. The Explanatory Notes are particularly unhelpful on this; when explaining why these provisions appear, they merely state:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="06071990000293"></a>&#147;The restriction in clause 8(1) on making provision authorising forcible entry, search or seizure, or compelling the giving of evidence, derives from the 2001 Act (section 3(5))&#148;.</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="06071990000079"></a>The reliance on the 2001 Act as some kind of precedent to justify the Bill has been a somewhat disingenuous tactic throughout our debates. I hope the Minister will not merely recite that justification, which is implicit in the Explanatory Notes. Just because the Government succeeded in getting their Bill passed in 2001, that does not mean we should cease to scrutinise any similar measures in this new Bill. The Minister has often referred to how the Bill will be more effective than the 2001 Act. Any protections or safeguards, therefore, have to be considered against these new powers to test whether they are sufficient. With that in mind, will the Minister explain exactly why those particular protections have been singled out in Clause 8, as opposed to anything else?</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="06071990000080"></a>The Committee will see that in AmendmentNo. 74A my noble friend has suggested a list of possible protections to be built into Clause 8, in addition to the two that were already there. She took as her starting point the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, where, in Section 22(3), the Government have provided a frankly alarming shopping list of things they would like to do by emergency regulations. I hope that transposing the powers suggested in that Act into protections in this Bill will be a useful starting point in discussing what protections are needed here in Clause 8.</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="06071990000081"></a>As always, I am not suggesting&#151;as, I suspect, my noble friend Lord Onslow would&#151;that this Government would use the order-making powers in Part 1 as a substitute for using the powers in the Civil Contingencies Act. My point is that if the Government believe that these types of powers are necessary only in an emergency, why can they not provide a safeguard, written into the Bill, that these types of powers will never be included in the order-making powers the Bill proposes?</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="06071990000082"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 74B. Clause 8(2) provides for the circumvention of the protections provided by Clause 8(1), and states that subsection (1) does not prevent an order from extending any power for purposes similar to those to which the power applied before the order was made. Does that not effectively render any protection in subsection (1) redundant? In other words, so long as the purpose of the power is similar to a previous power, it can be extended, regardless of the fact that it would authorise search and seizure of property or compel the giving of evidence.</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="06071990000083"></a>No doubt the Government will again pray in aid the 2001 Act. However, that is not a satisfactory argument by itself to justify the appearance of this provision. Section 3(5) of the 2001 Act stated that an order could not do anything that would authorise forcible entry or compel the giving of evidence,</p>
<ul><a name="06071990000333"></a>&#147;unless a provision to that effect is contained in an enactment repealed by the order and the powers conferred by the provision to that effect contained in the order are exercisable for the same purposes as the powers conferred by the repealed enactment or for purposes of a like nature&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06071990000272"></a>I accept that this has the same effect as Clause 8(2), but I would be interested to hear who decides whether the new extended powers to be granted by the order are for purposes similar to the previous powers. I imagine that in the end it would be the courts themselves. The key question is to what extent &#147;similar&#148; allows a margin of flexibility for the Minister making the order-making power. Would not &#147;identical&#148; be more appropriate, if Clause 8 is to have any point whatever? I beg to move.</p>

<a name="06071990000084"></a><b><a name="60719-0012.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="06071990000365"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> Amendment No. 74B seeks to restrict the power of an order to make provision authorising forcible entry, search or seizure or the compelling of the giving of evidence, except where an order is merely restating an existing provision in an enactment that does one of those things. This amendment removes the ability of an order to extend existing powers for purposes similar to those to which they already apply. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, has carefully set that out.</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="06071990000085"></a>I understand the noble Lord&#146;s concern about the scope of the power in Clause 8(2). However, the provision, as he has noted, is not new; it is a carryover from the 2001 Act. The Government believe that that is correct, to retain the flexibility that Clause 8(2) provides. I shall describe why that is the case. I ought to add in parenthesis that I am not aware that the provision in the 2001 Act has ever been used, and it would only ever be our intention to ensure that the provision would be used sparingly.</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="06071990000086"></a>There may be occasions when both the Government and Parliament agree it is appropriate for an order to extend existing powers for purposes similar to those to which they already apply. I give an example: where an existing statutory power is conferred on a particular body authorising it to search and seize certain types of goods from cars and vans. Extending it for a similar purpose could mean so that trains could be searched by that body. In the case of an order under Clause 1, the order would of course need to remove or reduce burdens. Where an order reformed a particular inspection regime and replaced it with a less burdensome one, the changes to the regime might require an existing power authorising forcible entry, search or seizure to be extended slightly to fit better with the new regime.</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="06071990000087"></a>Amendment No. 74A lists additional restrictions on the powers an order may authorise. The restrictions given are unnecessary and, without listing specific activities, it is unclear what effect the third condition would have. There are existing protections against the misuse of the order-making power in Clause 1, both within and outside the extent of the Bill. The effect of the Human Rights Act 1998 is that it is unlawful, for instance, for a Minister to make secondary legislation that includes orders under Part 1 which are incompatible with the convention rights. For example, in Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights already protects property rights.</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="06071990000088"></a>Regarding both Amendments Nos. 74A and 74B,I reiterate that orders must also satisfy the preconditions in Clause 4. In particular, provisions must not remove any necessary protection or prevent any person continuing to exercise any right or freedom which that person might reasonably expect to continue to exercise. Ultimately, though, Parliament may veto an order it considers inappropriate on any grounds, so the power of veto is a powerful tool indeed.</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="06071990000089"></a>I have already made clear on a number of occasions that we have given an undertaking not to deliver highly controversial proposals by order, and not to force orders through in the face of Committee opposition. I also stress the importance of viewing the powers in Clause 8 in the context of better regulation. Investigative powers should not have a negative impact on good businesses. Rather, they should be used only in a targeted way; for example, against rogue traders. For those reasons, I cannot support the amendment, and I hope the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw it.</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="06071990000090"></a>The noble Lord asked who decides if the purposes are similar, which is a fair point. It is the Minister making the order, subject to the decision of both committees, which have the power of veto, and subject to the views of the court in the case of a judicial review&#151;perhaps one arising from a criminal prosecution. That fairly settles the question that he reasonably asked.</p>

In the end it comes down to his relying on the same arguments as were put forward for the 2001 Act, and simply saying that the provisions will continue on that basis. I will look carefully at what he had to say, but I have a sneaking feeling that we will have to come back to this on Report and see if we can get a slightly better answer out of him. At this stage, though, it is probably best if I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

With Clause 10 we move north of the border. The clause ensures that orders made under Part 1 may not affect devolved matters. However, the words which the amendment seeks to omit make an exception for consequential, supplementary, incidental or transitional provisions. Would such provisions not require the consent of the Scottish Parliament under the Sewel convention? Ministers may be able to confirm that. What would happen to an order if that consent were withheld because, for instance, somebody in the Scottish Parliament persuaded his colleagues that it was not just purely consequential or supplementary but was a substantial issue? Let us suppose that that Parliament wanted further changes to the order. What would happen? The amendment seeks to probe the Government on that.</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="06071990000105"></a>Clause 10 makes clear how the Bill works in relation to matters devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The general position is that orders made under this Bill cannot make provision in areas devolved to Scotland. As has been recognised, the only exception to this, as Clause 10 sets out, is that orders can make consequential, supplementary, incidental or transitional provision even in areas devolved to Scotland, so long as the need for this arises out of provision made by the order for purposes which are reserved to Westminster. Orders cannot make any free-standing provision in matters devolved to Scotland.</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="06071990000106"></a>The intention behind Amendment No. 76 maybe to prevent an order making consequential, supplementary, incidental or transitional provision which would be within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament were it contained in an Act of that Parliament. An example of where the ability to make such provision is needed is where an order, in amending Westminster legislation, re-numbers some of its provisions, or if the name of a body is changed or a body is abolished. If a Scottish Act cross-referred to those provisions, the changes to the numbering made by the order would mean that the Scottish Act then referred to the wrong provisions. Under the Bill the order could be used to tidy up the Scottish Act by updating the references to correspond to the correct provisions. This would mean that there was no need for the Scottish Parliament to legislate to make the consequential amendments needed. The amendment appears intended to remove this useful ability, but I hope that the Committee will now accept that it is useful.</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="06071990000107"></a>The ability to make such changes is fully in accordance with the convention agreed between Westminster and the Scottish Parliament. This convention requires the consent of the Scottish Parliament where the Westminster Parliament intends to legislate on devolved matters, but it is agreed that such consent is not required when legislation deals with devolved matters only incidentally to, or consequentially upon, provision made in relation to a reserved matter. This position is set out in Devolution Guidance Note 10 issued by the Department for Constitutional Affairs, which has responsibility for devolution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="06071990000123"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment raises an issue of considerable importance. Its purpose is to ensure that all changes to primary legislation by orders made under the Bill must be made either by the affirmative resolution procedure or the super-affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="06071990000124"></a>Power to amend primary legislation by secondary legislation&#151;the notorious Henry VIII clause&#151;is now fairly frequent but it must be used with great care and restraint. As a former member of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Select Committee, I recall that there are some cases where the Select Committee has approved a power inserted in a Bill to amend primary legislation by negative resolution, but those cases are very strictly limited to transitional or consequential amendments resulting from the implementation of the Bill which contains those powers. This Bill is conferring a very wide general power to make orders. The nature of the orders which will be made under this Bill and the degree to which those orders will alter primary legislation is totally unpredictable. It is essential that orders under the Bill which alter primary legislation should be subject to debate in both Houses, which requires the affirmative or super-affirmative procedure to ensure that it happens. That matter should be put beyond doubt by this amendment and not dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<a name="60719-0012.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="06071990000125"></a>I accept that there may be a few cases where some of the changes in an order are so minor that the useof the negative resolution procedure would be appropriate if looked at independently of the general principle, but those are likely to be a very small minority. In any event, non-contentious orders can go through both Houses very quickly even if the affirmative resolution procedure is used. It is better to make it clear that any change in primary legislation by procedure under this Bill should be by the affirmative resolution or super-affirmative resolution procedure and prevent future Governments trying to extend their ability to make or alter primary legislation through the negative resolution procedure. This Bill, after all, takes powers from Parliament and gives them to the Government. Of course, nothing in the amendment excludes the possibility that orders can be made by the negative resolution procedure if no change to primary legislation is involved.</p>

<ul><a name="06071990000301"></a>&#147;it is right that a committee&#146;s recommendation that an order should not proceed...should have the consequence of preventing further proceedings unless and until the House says otherwise&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06071990000274"></a>That is a sound principle.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="06071990000128"></a>That provides the backdrop to the amendment, which seeks to prevent any order made under Part 1 being delivered by the negative resolution procedure if it amends or repeals existing primary legislation. It would remove the option of the negative resolution procedure for orders. The very purpose of the order-making power in Clause 1 is to provide a vehicle for reducing or removing burdens imposed by primary and secondary legislation, and most, if not all, orders made under Clause 1 will amend or repeal primary legislation. The Government believe that, where orders are evidently straightforward, it is right that there is the option of delivering them by a more proportionate procedure, subject of course to Parliament&#146;s approval. As the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee&#146;s report stated, the Bill is clear that it is Parliament and not the Minister, as I just said, which has the final say.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="06071990000129"></a>The range of procedures provided for in the Bill is intended to encourage delivery of smaller or simpler proposals such as those seeking to reduce administrative burdens. One example is the Regulatory Reform (NHS Charitable and Non-Charitable Trust Accounts and Audit) Order 2005. That was delivered under the 2001 Act, and removed the unnecessary burden imposed by primary legislation on National Health Service charitable trusts of having to prepare two separate sets of accounts. That duplication was simply an anomaly. The order dealing with the anomaly was not complex and could have been adequately scrutinised under the negative or affirmative procedure. The amendment therefore imposes an unnecessary degree of inflexibility on the order-making process. Why do we need to put a very simple change, such as that which I have just given as an example, through the mill of an overly complex process when it is not controversial and where there is a very simple way of doing it?</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="06071990000130"></a>We need something that is appropriate and proportionate to the problem that it is dealing with; that is what the negative procedure can on occasion be. It is not our desired intent to circumvent parliamentary approval; I have made that quite clear. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has accepted that point. I cannot accept the amendment, although I understand the noble Lord&#146;s caution and reason for moving it. I hope that he will reflect on those points before considering his next step.</p>

I remain unconvinced by it, because under the 2001 Act the super-affirmative procedure needed to be used in every case, which is excessive. However, it is an important principle that Parliament as a whole should have an opportunity to discuss amendments to primary legislation. One should not need to pray against an order to bring that about. We are well aware now that the affirmative resolution procedure can be dealt with very quickly. We now have in your Lordships&#146; House an arrangement under which the affirmative resolution instruments can be dealt with in Grand Committee and then brought back to your Lordships&#146; House for formal approval, so it does not take up any significant time. In those circumstances, I am still of the opinion that this is a desirable amendment, and I am minded to bring it back at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="06071990000140"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 84 requires a Minister to make a statement that in his opinion an order is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. I tabled my amendment before the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Maclennan, tabled their Amendment No. 85. I am sure that their drafting is more appropriate than mine, and I certainly will not object if the Minister says that he intends to accept Amendment No. 85 rather than Amendment No. 84.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="06071990000141"></a>Under Section 19(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act, a Minister introducing a Bill must declare whether, in his view, the Bill is compatible with the convention rights. That is an express duty, and it places an onus on the Minister to consider convention rights when bringing a Bill forward. It is not a case of simply going through the motions, since the Joint Committee on Human Rights will not necessarily accept that the Minister is correct in believing that the Bill is compatible. A Minister may have to justify his claim.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="06071990000142"></a>The Joint Committee has been extremely active in considering whether Bills comply with the convention and other human rights instruments to which the United Kingdom is a party. In the first three years of its existence, it drew the attention of each House to about 100 Bills out of the 300 it considered. There has been considerable correspondence with Ministers, all of which has been published. As a consequence of its work, it has helped to build up in Government what its first chairman, Jean Corston, now the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, termed &#147;a culture of justification&#148; rather than one of assertion.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="06071990000143"></a>If we accept that the Section 19 requirement is appropriate and has served a useful purpose, there should be a similar requirement in respect of orders made under this Bill. As the Constitution Committee pointed out in its report on the Bill, Parliament is delegating its authority to change the statute book. The committee states, at paragraph 59:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a><a name="06071990000307"></a>&#147;We see considerable merit in requiring Ministers to treat draft orders in similar ways to bills in relation to explaining and certifying compliance with Convention rights&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06071990000275"></a>Providing for such a requirement will deliver the same benefits as with Bills. In this case, the orders willbe drawn up in departments, rather than by parliamentary counsel. The knowledge that an order has to carry a compatibility statement and that the statement may be subject to scrutiny by the Joint Committee will help to focus minds, contributing to the development of the culture so ably identified by the noble Baroness, Lady Corston.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="06071990000144"></a>The case for this provision is both clear and compelling. I beg to move.</p>

It is already an accepted practice that when affirmative resolutions are madeto approve secondary legislation, a statement of compatibility should be made by the Minister introducing them.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="06071990000146"></a>My amendment is similar in intention to that moved by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth. The difference is that my amendment specifically requires that the Minister should make a positive statement that the provisions are compatible with the Human Rights Act. If a Minister acting in good faith is unable to make that statement, the Government should proceed by primary legislation, not by order, because it is self-evident that the proposal must be controversial.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="06071990000147"></a>Therefore, it would be an abuse of power to use procedure under the Bill for purposes that are recognised as being incompatible with convention rights. We should not be more generous in allowing an incompatible order to stand when the Minister acts in good faith, but under a mistaken view of the Human Rights Act. My amendment is based on a provision having the same purpose as that in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. The width of the powers given by the Bill justify more rigid treatment than the limited Henry VIII powers, exercisable for the specific purpose of the Act that confers that power.</p>

I am thinking of some Bills that have emanated over the past few years from the Home Office. Having said that, if it were a requirement for Bills to have such certification from Ministers, I do not see why such a requirement should not also be added to measures made under this Bill. Therefore, I support my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="06071990000150"></a>As Ministers of the Crown are public authorities for the purposes of the Human Rights Act, and Section 6 of the Human Rights Act makes it unlawful for a public authority to act in a way that is incompatible with the convention rights, all orders made under this Bill must be compatible with the convention rights. There is simply no alternative.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="06071990000151"></a>Noble Lords have referred to and are familiar with the Section 19 statement that appears on the front of every government Bill presented to your Lordships&#146; House. In nearly every case, including this Bill, that is a statement of compatibility under Section 19(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act. It certifies that, in the opinion of the Minister in charge of the Bill, the provisions of the Bill are compatible with the convention rights. But there is a real and practical purpose to having such a statement, for it is possible to make an alternative statement under Section 19(1)(b) of the Human Rights Act.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="06071990000152"></a>A statement under that section would be a statement that, although the Minister cannot make a statement of compatibility, the Government nevertheless wish the House to proceed with the Bill. Section 19(1)(b) statements are rare. In fact, only once have the Government had to give such a statement on first introduction of a government Bill into Parliament. But the point of the statements under Section 19 is that it remains possible for Parliament, if it so chooses, to pass primary legislation that is incompatible with the convention rights.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="06071990000153"></a>It is, however, proper that if the Government are going to ask Parliament to legislate incompatibly, we should be absolutely clear when they are doing so. In this way, the Section 19 statement serves as a starting point for the scrutiny of the Bill by Parliament.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="06071990000154"></a>I know that, as a matter of procedure, the Government make statements of compatibility for secondary legislation that is subject to the affirmative resolution or super-affirmative procedures, or which amends primary legislation. As your Lordships may recall, the undertaking that the Government would do so was made to your Lordships&#146; House by the late Lord Williams of Mostyn. Similarly, in another place, my honourable friend Jim Murphy undertook that the Government would, again as a matter of practice, give statements of compatibility for orders made under this Bill. I do not seek to go back on those undertakings.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="06071990000155"></a>It is important to realise, however, that such statements of compatibility only confirm that which already must be the case&#151;that in the Minister&#146;s view the order is compatible with the convention rights. Whereas Parliament has the power to make incompatible primary legislation if it wishes, a Minister is not permitted to make secondary legislation that he does not believe to be compatible.</p>

Surely, the Human Rights Act provides that secondary legislation amending primary legislation should be treated for the purposes of the Human Rights Act as itself being primary legislation. Therefore, the Minister can then introduce an order under this Bill amending primary legislation that would be treated as primary legislation for the purposes of the Human Rights Act and, therefore, could not be quashed by the court&#151;it would simply be declared incompatible. That comes up in relation to an amendment that I will move later. </p>

In light of the noble Lord&#146;s comments, we should look at that again. If his point was right that may well change the position. No Minister may, by virtue of Section 6, ever make incompatible secondary legislation. Perhaps we should follow this up outside our debate.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="06071990000158"></a>While I stand by our undertakings, I would not wish to enshrine in statute a procedure that is, with the greatest respect to those undertakings, confirming something that is already compulsory. Indeed, it could even give the false impression that it would be legitimate for the Minister to make secondary legislation that he considers to be incompatible with convention rights. While I understand completely the intention behind Amendments Nos. 84 and 85, and while I reiterate the undertakings that the Government have given, I invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Secondly&#151;this is why I prefer the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart&#151;I can see a case for arguing that when a Minister indicates, they have complied with the duty they have to comply with, particularly in the context of the argument that I developed about a culture of justification. I have concerns but I do not intend to push my amendment, not least because I defer to the noble Lord&#146;s amendment and I find persuasive the reasons that he gave. I do not intend to persist with my amendment but I suspect that the noble Lord may wish to come back later in light of what has been said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It is clear that the Bill has the capacity to increase burdens as well as to reduce them. None of us would like to see increased burdens. The amendment is entirely straightforward and would ensure that, at the very least, Parliament is fully informed of the effect of a draft order before deciding which procedure under Clause 16 should apply.

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="06071990000165"></a>It is important that orders should be able to impose new burdens. When an order removes a burden, this will often need to be replaced with a smaller, better perfected and more proportionate and refined burden. For instance, perhaps a business is currently inspected five times a year for its compliance with a particular regulation, which takes up to five man-hours. This amendment would prevent an order removing this requirement and replacing it with a requirement for the business to carry out self-assessment once a year, which takes up one man-hour, as this would be a burden to which the business was previously not subject.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="06071990000166"></a>The ability to add new and, in this case, more proportionate burdens was a key improvement of the 2001 Act over its predecessor, the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. More than two-thirds of orders that have been made under the 2001 Act imposed new but more refined and appropriate&#151;and, I would argue, ultimately more proportionate&#151;burdens.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="06071990000167"></a>Clause 15 provides that for orders under Clause 1, the Minister must lay an explanatory document before Parliament, including an assessment of the extent to which the orders would remove or reduce any burden or burdens. Amendment No. 85A adds to that requirement so that the explanatory document must also detail any burden or burdens imposed by the order.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="06071990000168"></a>I do not oppose the principle that the order-making process should be transparent. I could fairly argue that that is what we are trying to establish. In practice, where orders add any new burdens as defined in Clause 1, the Government would expect any reduction or increase in burdens to be detailed in the proposal&#146;s impact assessment, which will be made publicly available. The parliamentary committees would likely consider the burdens imposed or increased as part of their scrutiny of individual orders.</p>

<a name="60719-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="06071990000169"></a>I understand and appreciate the principle behind Amendment No. 85A. I simply argue that it is disproportionate in its effect and is already covered by the process that we have put in place that will, of course, strengthen our impact assessments. I believe that the noble Lord and I are in the same area as regards our intent, but we have got there first.</p>

</ul>
<a name="60719-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="06071990000183"></a>The noble Lord said: Mine is the lead amendment in what is a rather large group of amendments. The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that Parliament exercises the responsibility to determine the procedure to be adopted in respect of an order under the Bill. As the Bill stands, the Minister responsible for an order recommends that it be considered under the negative, affirmative, or super-affirmative resolution procedure. Within the set time limit, either House can determine that an order be considered under a higher procedure if recommended for consideration under either of the first two procedures.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="06071990000184"></a>I appreciate that ultimately Parliament can determine the procedure. However, I wish to shift the onus from the Minister to Parliament and for Parliament to adopt a proactive rather than a reactive role. My reasons are twofold. First, in terms of principle, I believe that Parliament should have greater responsibility than it presently has for determining its business. The British Parliament, or rather the British House of Commons, is distinctive among legislative chambers in the extent to which the Executive determine the business of the House. Experience elsewhere shows that allowing a chamber greater say over its own timetable does not prevent the Government getting their business. However, it can be of value, in ensuring that the time is more effectively used in subjecting Government to scrutiny. I certainly believe that Parliament itself should be, as far as possible, the master of its own procedure. That is my starting point.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="06071990000185"></a>My second point is specific to this provision. As the Bill stands, there is a danger of Parliament missing the significance of a particular order. A Minister may recommend that an order be subject to the negative resolution procedure and each House may assume that it is not of great import, focusing instead on orders recommended for one of the other procedures. If a committee does not recognise its significance, I doubt whether the Chamber will do so. A great deal rests on the vigilance of the committees.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="06071990000186"></a>Under my amendment, Parliament would determine the procedure with the default option being the super-affirmative resolution procedure. To my mind, that has the double benefit of giving greater responsibility to Parliament&#151;it moves to a proactive rather than a reactive role&#151;and it ensures that no order slips under the net, with an order of some significance getting through under the negative resolution procedure. Under my amendment the responsibility rests on each House to check an order as soon as it is laid by a Minister and to decide whether it merits being moved from the super-affirmative to the affirmative or negative resolution procedure. It places a far greater onus on Parliament and it means that no order is neglected.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="06071990000187"></a>I have a great deal of sympathy with Amendment No. 79 in the name of the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Maclennan. They make an important point regarding primary legislation and I fully support the case that they make. I do not think that their amendment is necessarily incompatible with mine. I can see a case for ring-fencing orders that create or repeal primary legislation, subjecting them to the affirmative or super-affirmative resolution procedure. I think we could possibly bring together the two amendments to ensure that orders are subject to the appropriate level of resolution procedure, with the level of ministerial discretion or involvement in determining that limited or removed altogether. The more we can do to strengthen the involvement of Parliament in the process the better. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="06071990000188"></a><b><a name="60719-0014.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="06071990000393"></a>Lord Goodhart:</b> A large number of amendments in this large group are in the names of myself and my noble friend Lord Maclennan. I refer to Amendments Nos. 92, 93, 97 to 100, 103 to 105, 108, 110 and 111.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="06071990000189"></a>Before I get onto my own amendments, I find the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, extremely persuasive. It is important that powers to deal with orders of this kind should as far as possible be parliamentary rather than ministerial, given that the amount of scrutiny that Parliament will be able to give them would be far less than for primary legislation. My only comment on the noble Lord&#146;s amendment is that the super-affirmative resolution procedure should apply unless within 30 days both Houses of Parliament determine that another resolution would be appropriate.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="06071990000190"></a>Our amendments as a whole aim to ensure that any recommendation made by a Select Committee would be final. Amendment No. 92&#151;which would not be moved if Amendment No. 91 were approved&#151;would mean that a final decision on whether the Minister&#146;s selection of the appropriate method was correct would rest with the committee and could not be overruled by Parliament as a whole. Similarly, on our other amendments, we are concerned that a committee&#146;s decision to recommend that an order should not be proceeded with in either House should, again, be final.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="06071990000191"></a>The procedure under this Bill should be broadly consensual. If there is enough opposition to persuade the Select Committee to recommend that the order should not be proceeded with, it is inappropriate to proceed further. The prospect of votes being called in either House to override that recommendation, especially when those votes are whipped, is an unattractive one. Our amendments would allow an immediate restart of the reconsideration process. I prefer the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for a two-year moratorium on reintroduction of an order of this kind, with one exception. A recommendation made less than two years before the end of a Parliament should not bind a subsequent Parliament. Otherwise, however, I accept the amendments in this group on that point as preferable to my own as regards the time at which orders can be resubmitted. For these reasons, it is desirable that a committee&#146;s recommendation on these issues in either House should be final.</p>

<p><a name="st_196"></a>
<a name="06071990000192"></a><b><a name="60719-0014.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="06071990000394"></a>Lord Henley:</b> This is a rather complicated group, headed by my noble friend Lord Norton&#146;s Amendment No. 91, with a large number of amendments and a diverse collection of noble Lords putting their names to each. We have a number of amendments down on behalf of the Conservative Front Bench, some of which seem to have the support of the Liberal Democrats. I notice that Amendment No. 95 also has the Government&#146;s support. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has been good enough to say that he likes Amendment No 94A tabled in the name of my noble friend Lord Kingsland, although he has not yet put his name to it. I suspect that it may be necessary for certain conversations to take place between now and Report, and we will have considerable time to decide how to proceed with these amendments at a later stage of the Bill.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="06071990000193"></a>At this stage, it may be worth setting out what is behind our amendments in this group. We have given notice that we intend to oppose the Question that Clause 19 stand part of the Bill, and we have tabled Amendments Nos. 94A and 95, and added our names to Amendments Nos. 92, 97, 108 and 111. I shall speak first to those amendments and then to the Question on whether Clause 19 should stand part. However, I assure the Minister that I have no intention of dividing the Committee on that issue.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="06071990000194"></a>Amendments Nos. 92, 97, 108 and 111 turn what is merely a recommendation by a committee of either House into an absolute veto. In the debate in another place on the appropriate parliamentary procedureto be applied to these orders, the words &#147;recommendation&#148; and &#147;veto&#148; were sometimes used interchangeably. Noble Lords should be clear that, at present, the committee&#146;s only power is to recommend that no further proceedings be taken on any draft order. Either House can then by resolution reject that recommendation and the order can go through. We on these Benches think that that is not a satisfactory safeguard. We believe that the inherent potential for abuse in these order-making powers means that the committee should be given the power to reject the orders. To leave its recommendations vulnerable to a vote of either House does not provide constitutionally sound protection.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="06071990000195"></a>I should modify my support for these amendments by saying that I am aware of the argument against turning a committee&#146;s recommendations into a veto: it deprives the House of an opportunity to decide for itself whether an order is appropriate. I also appreciate that it might make a committee more timid in its remarks and recommendations if it felt that it was the final arbiter of what should happen to an order. In our discussions on the substantive constitutional safeguards that should be in the Bill, the Government have not yet made any concessions, and that is disappointing. In the absence of such concessions, bolstering the recommendation of the committee is the only option left. However, we believe that it is a last resort. We fully accept that if other constitutional safeguards are incorporated into the Bill, the necessity for an absolute veto might be lessened.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="06071990000196"></a>The committee&#146;s composition would be an important factor. The convention in this House is that the Government do not enjoy a majority in committees but, as we all know, the arrangements in another place are different. By convention, the usual channels decide to which committee legislation or subordinate legislation should be referred. I would be grateful to hear from the Minister the kind of committee he envisages will deal with these orders. I imagine that the expectation is that the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, would consider these orders, but I put it to the Minister that there is a case for these orders to be considered by a Joint Committee of both Houses.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="06071990000197"></a>Amendment No. 94A proposes an alternative way of strengthening the committee&#146;s recommendation that no further proceedings should be taken on a draft order. Currently there is nothing to prevent an order which the committee has considered inappropriate being retabled in the same Session of Parliament. As we made clear when discussing the previous group, there needs to be a means of investing the committee with a more powerful sanction than merely the recommendation in Clause 15. If the Minister knew that it was absolutely critical to get the terms of the order drafted appropriately in the first place, and that if it was not he would risk losing the opportunity for the next two years of getting the order through, then it might act as a disincentive for a Minister to introduce an order that pushed the boundaries of what might or might not get past the committee.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a><a name="06071990000198"></a>I turn now to the Question on whether Clause 19 should stand part of the Bill. We think that the Bill should not be allowed to proceed further without consideration of the question of the appropriateness of the super-affirmative procedure. This procedure was first introduced in the 2001 Act. Although it made a brief appearance in Part 31 of the Company Law Reform Bill, the Government then decided to remove such procedures from that legislation. That decision seemed to be on the basis of a recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in its ninth report. At paragraph 40, the committee considered what it called the &#147;proportionality of procedure&#148;. It stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_79"></a><a name="06071990000316"></a>&#147;Although not taking much time on the floor of the House, the mechanism proposed is no quicker than a bill...For a small measure, it is no more proportionate than a short bill, particularly when preparation of the supporting documentation is taken into account. But we do not see how the timetable could be abridged without violating the safeguards which this process is intended to give&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="60719-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="06071990000199"></a>Surely the same arguments could be applied to any new regulatory reform orders under this Act. No doubt, the Government will try to say that the super-affirmative procedure ensures that any draft order will receive added scrutiny and is at least an improvement on the affirmative procedure. However&#151;try as the Government might to dress up the affirmative procedure as something more onerous with the prefix of &#147;super&#148; and the added 60 days scrutiny by committee&#151;they are still proposing to reform primary legislation by an order introduced as a statutory instrument rather than by primary legislation.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="06071990000200"></a>The committee said in paragraph 38 of its report that,</p>
<ul><a name="06071990000334"></a>&#147;whatever the Government&#146;s intention as to amendability, it is impossible for the two Houses to reconcile any proposed amendments due to the fact that the instrument is considered in parallel by the two Houses. In this regard, it cannot be considered a substitute for a bill&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06071990000276"></a>That is the key point and endorses everything I have said. I am interested to hear from the Minister how that problem can be overcome.</p>

<p><a name="st_197"></a>
<a name="06071990000201"></a><b><a name="60719-0014.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="06071990000395"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, is of course right in saying that Parliament must determine which of the variety of possible procedures should be followed, but I would add the word &#147;ultimately&#148;. Surely it is appropriate in our Parliament, where Ministers are also Members of Parliament and take a lead in determining business, that they should be the ones who propose. Parliament should then dispose and determine the result.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="06071990000202"></a>I oppose the suggestions of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I think it would be quite inapt in our Parliament to elevate a Select Committee to the position of determining matters that should ultimately be within Parliament's right to determine. It is not at all right that that should be so. &#147;Recommend&#148;, it seems to me, is the suitable word to use. Anything else would be a way of subverting the normal life of Parliament. I can understand why the device has been proposed, but its use would not be in accordance with our conventions.</p>

<p><a name="st_198"></a>
<a name="06071990000203"></a><b><a name="60719-0014.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="06071990000396"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> This is an important group of amendments which, as the noble Lord, Lord Henley, said, range far and wide in their cover. There is a thread pulling them all together in that they deal with the Bill&#146;s procedural requirements for making orders, including the statutory veto provided to parliamentary committees.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="06071990000204"></a>In the interests of clarity, I shall address the government amendments first, as noble Lords would expect. Government Amendments Nos. 94, 95, 101, 106 and 109 deal with the statutory veto that the Bill provides to relevant parliamentary committees. In the light of concerns that have been expressed during the Bill&#146;s passage through Parliament, including those of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, the Government resolved to remove the criteria to which the statutory veto is currently tied&#151;a measure to which government Amendments Nos. 95, 101, 106 and 109 give effect.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="06071990000205"></a>A number of noble Lords have supported Amendment No. 95, which removes from the Bill the criteria for exercising the veto for orders subject to the negative resolution procedure. I assume that noble Lords would agree that, if the conditions for exercising the veto should be removed, it is right that that be the case for all orders, irrespective of the procedure to which they are subject. An alternative arrangement would be inconsistent and is likely to be unacceptable to Parliament and its responsible committees. On that basis, I hope that noble Lords are satisfied by the government amendments on the issue.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="06071990000206"></a>Government Amendment No. 94 also makes a minor drafting change to Clause 17 to clarify that the effect of exercising the veto, where orders are subject to the negative resolution procedure, is that the Minister cannot make the order. I commend both sets of amendments to the House.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="06071990000207"></a>Government Amendment No. 110A is minor and technical, and mirrors a similar provision in the 2001 Act. Clause 15(2)(f)(ii) requires the disclosure of details in the explanatory document laid before Parliament of representations received as a result of the consultation required by Clause 14. However, that is subject to Clauses 15(4) and (5). The first provides that the Minister must not disclose information which the consultee asked not to be disclosed, if the disclosure of it would amount to an actionable breach of confidence, were it not for parliamentary privilege. The second provides that where the consultee provides information about another person, the Minister need not disclose that information if it appears to the Minister that the disclosure could adversely affect the interests of the other person, and the Minister has not been able to obtain the third party&#146;s consent to disclosure of the information which could affect them. Clause 15(6) makes clear that neither of these restrictions prevents disclosure to a committee charged with reporting on the draft order which asks for the information.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="06071990000208"></a>Clause 19&#151;the super-affirmative procedure&#151;requires the Minister to disclose details of representations made during the 60-day period of scrutiny about the draft order. There is, however, no provision restricting that obligation similar to the provisions in Clause 15. So the Minister would have to disclose that information even if the disclosure would involve a breach of confidence or would adversely affect the interests of a third party.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a><a name="06071990000209"></a>Amendment No. 91, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, provides for all orders to be subject to the super-affirmative resolution procedure unless either House of Parliament requires a less onerous procedure. I understand why the noble Lord moved the amendment and I am grateful to him because, in doing so, he accepted my point when we were debating Amendment No. 79, which is that it is Parliament, rather than the Minister, who is, if you like, in control of the process. I remind noble Lords that the Bill already provides that Parliament can, in all cases, request that an order proceed via the more onerous super-affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a><a name="06071990000210"></a>As an example of that, I cite the example of the Regulatory Reform (National Health Service Charitable and Non-Charitable Trust Accounts and Audit) Order 2005. That demonstrates how this works. Some orders are straightforward, and in such cases there seems little value in preventing a Minister from even recommending that an order should proceed by the affirmative or negative procedure.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a><a name="06071990000211"></a>Amendment No. 91 provides that the method for determining the appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny should be left to the House to determine, thus removing explicit reference to the committees&#146; ability to recommend a more rigorous procedure. I understand that the noble Lord wishes to remove that detail from the Bill.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a><a name="06071990000212"></a>Our view is that, following government amendments tabled on 27 June, the Bill contains the right level of detail to ensure legal certainty about the order-making process. The inclusion of detail is necessary, as it clarifies the procedural requirements for delivering proposals via the order-making powers and ensures that the procedures in the Bill present a useable mechanism for delivering reforms by order. For that reason, I cannot support the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a><a name="06071990000213"></a>Amendments Nos. 92, 97, 103, 108 and 110 seek to remove the ability of a House of Parliament to overturn recommendations made by its responsible committee. Amendment No. 92 would make a committee recommendation for the level of scrutiny indisputable, and Amendments Nos. 97, 103, 108 and 110 would make a veto exercised by the committee final. Like the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, I express my concerns about the effects of the amendments. Making provision that a committee decision could override the opinion of the rest of the House and bind it would be an unprecedented step that may be unworkable in practice. Ultimately, it is a matter for the House to decide whether and how often it might want to overrule the recommendations of one of its committees. However, the Government do not consider it appropriate to rule this out entirely and leave no flexibility for the House to decide. The recent Delegated Powers Committee report supported this view. It found that,</p>
<ul><a name="06071990000335"></a>&#147;it is right that a Committee&#146;s recommendation that an order should not proceed...should have the consequence of preventing further proceedings unless and until the House says otherwise&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06071990000214"></a>So it must be for either House of Parliament, or perhaps both of them, to make that final determination. That must be right. In saying that, we respect the right and proper parliamentary process and, for that reason, I cannot accept the amendments.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="06071990000215"></a>Amendments Nos. 93, 98, 100 and 104 seek to remove the time restrictions on when committees can exercise their statutory veto over orders. As a result, the parliamentary scrutiny committees could veto an order as soon as it was laid before Parliament. The time restriction for exercising the veto is in place to encourage committees to explore all the options before fully rejecting an order, to consider increasing the level of procedure to which the order is subject, to undertake full scrutiny and, in the case of the super-affirmative procedure, to undertake further consultation and recommend amendments to the order. The civil registrations regulatory reform order is a good example of what we consider to be thebest approach. Here, parliamentary committees recommended that the order should not proceed, but only after extensive and careful consideration. We simply want to build on this experience, which is an invaluable guide to how matters should develop in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_420"></a><a name="06071990000216"></a>Amendments Nos. 99, 105 and 111 seek to clarify that if an order is vetoed under the negative, affirmative or super-affirmative procedures, the Minister may return to the consultation process and subsequently re-lay the same draft order before Parliament. By contrast, Amendments Nos. 94A, 103A, 108A, and 110B specify that if Parliament vetoes an order, no order may be tabled in the terms of the original draft for a period of two years.</p>

<a name="60719-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="06071990000217"></a>On Amendments Nos. 99, 105, and 111, there are no restrictions in the Bill concerning the resubmission of a draft order, so the amendments are unnecessary. Both sets of amendments, however, although approaching the issue from different perspectives, give rise to an important question about the future of a proposal that has been vetoed by Parliament. My response to the amendments is that this Government and any future Government would not be inclined to reintroduce a proposal in exactly the same form after it had been vetoed by Parliament. Parliament would obviously be liable to veto the order again, and a Government would be unlikely to allocate the time or resources required to restart the process. Equally, however, it is right and proper that if, following additional consultation, evidence exists to substantiate a proposal, it should be possible to re-lay an order before Parliament, perhaps in a slightly amended form and at a later date. In other words, if it can be improved, if there is time to improve it, and if there is evidence, it seems unreasonable and inflexible to prevent that from happening. One would expect the order to be an important element of the deregulatory programme. We are not trying to create a situation where the Government might try with a minor amendment to slip something through on which they failed the first time; it is a matter of making a substantial improvement to the proposal and ensuring that the evidence is there to substantiate it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="06071990000218"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Henley, gave notice of an intention to oppose Clause 19. This clause sets out the requirements for making orders subject to the super-affirmative procedure. As I am sure noble Lords are aware, it is a well tried and tested process which has proved suitable for more complex regulatory reform orders. In its recent report, the Regulatory Reform Committee commented that a strength of the process is that regulatory reform orders received more detailed scrutiny than they would if they had been included in a large Bill. The Government anticipate that the super-affirmative process will continue to provide appropriately in-depth scrutiny for those more complex orders. I admit that the rationale for removing the most onerous level of parliamentary process from the Bill is not clear to me. As a Government we are committed to ensuring that orders receive effective and proportionate levels of parliamentary scrutiny. Central to that, however, is ensuring that, where orders require more comprehensive scrutiny, they can be made subject to the super-affirmative procedure. For that simple reason, which I should have thought is one to which we could all sign up, we wish to retain the provision for orders to be made under this procedure. I therefore propose that Clause 19 should stand part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="60719-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="06071990000219"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Henley, made the point that the super-affirmative procedure was withdrawn from the Company Law Reform Bill. It was withdrawn when the order-making power was removed from the legislation. As I am sure noble Lords are aware, the procedure is a part of many different pieces of legislation, including the Human Rights Act 1998. The noble Lord also asked an important question about the nature of the committees the Government consider should be responsible for scrutinising orders under the powers in this Bill. We had considered that the Regulatory Reform Committee and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee would continue to perform that role, but we have absolutely no objection in principle to other committees such as departmental Select Committees becoming involved in the process. It would be a very appropriate way for them to ensure that the process is thorough, and they would bring to these considerations their specific, detailed knowledge. We want to continue a constructive dialogue with the chairs of those committees on this issue.</p>

However, as the Minister indicated, there is a common theme among them, hence the grouping. I am grateful to all noble Lords who spoke to my Amendment No. 91. Earlier tonight I thought that I was on a roll with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, since he was kind enough to make some positive comments about my amendments. On this amendment, he is quite right in his description of current practice, but I am afraid that here he is being a conservative and I am being a radical because I want to change the practice. What we do is largely out of line with what happens elsewhere, but as a general principle Parliament should have greater control over its own business. I refer not to the substance of what the Government are bringing forward, because that is for them, but it is up to Parliament itself to determine the procedures for looking at what the Government wish to do. Business committees are common in other parliaments, including the Scottish Parliament. We should look at how we can strengthen Parliament by ensuring that it has much greater control over its own business. My amendment is very much in line with what I have been arguing for some time regarding what should happen within Parliament.</p>

I see no harm in that at all. In fact, I see it as an argument for pursuing the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_450"></a><a name="06071990000254"></a>The noble Lord said: The purposes of this amendment are related to those in Amendment No. 85, which I moved earlier. It is a technical but important amendment, recommended by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in its 17th and 21st reports of the current Session.</p>

<a name="60719-0015.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a><a name="06071990000255"></a>Under Section 21(1) of the Human Rights Act, an order which amends primary legislation is itself treated as primary legislation and cannot be quashed on the grounds of incompatibility with convention rights. It is certainly my understanding that that is the correct interpretation. The Government appeared earlier to take a different view and suggested that such an order could be quashed on the grounds of incompatibility, but I do not think that that is correct. I believe that the effect of Section 21(1) of the Human Rights Act is that an order which is introduced under this Bill cannot be quashed on the grounds of incompatibility; it can only be declared incompatible.</p>

<a name="60719-0015.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a><a name="06071990000256"></a>Confusingly, it appears that an order made under this legislation can be quashed on other grounds. For example, it is <I>ultra vires </I>on grounds other than incompatibility, such as failure to comply with a statutory procedure or to meet the conditions set out in Clause 4. It seems plainly inappropriate that such a distinction should be drawn. It would be an abuse of the order procedure under the Bill deliberately to make a provision which was incompatible with the Human Rights Act. Such provision would be in breach of what is plainly one of the core statutes of our constitution. If incompatible legislation is to be passed, which Parliament has the power to do under the Human Rights Act, then it should be part of primary legislation only after it has had full consideration in both Houses of Parliament. I beg to move.</p>

It was first raised under Amendment No. 85 and dealt with by my noble friend Lord McKenzie of Luton. It may assist the Committee if I return to this point; it clearly vexes the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart.</p>

<a name="60719-0015.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a><a name="06071990000258"></a>The noble Lord queried whether a Minister may ever make secondary legislation which is incompatible with convention rights. In this respect, it is important to draw a distinction between what is unlawful and the remedies for unlawfulness and incompatibility. Under Section 6 of the Human Rights Act:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_90"></a><a name="06071990000327"></a>&#147;It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="60719-0015.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a><a name="06071990000259"></a>Under Section 6(3) of the Act, a Minister of the Crown is clearly a public authority. He must therefore exercise the function of making secondary legislation in a compatible manner, regardless of what the secondary legislation does. Therefore, all orders, including all those under this Bill, must be compatible with the convention rights. The distinction between primary and secondary legislation becomes important only in respect of the remedies available when a legislative provision is found to be incompatible with the convention rights.</p>

<a name="60719-0015.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a><a name="06071990000260"></a>Under Amendment No. 111A, any amendment made by order to primary legislation would be treated as secondary legislation for the purposes of the Human Rights Act. Under the Act, secondary legislation may be struck down by a court if it is incompatible with the convention rights, as is understood. Primary legislation, including where it is amended by order, may not be struck down but instead may be the subject of a declaration of incompatibility. The noble Lord seeks to replicate a provision in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. However, the considerable difference with orders under that Act is that they have only a short-term effect, usually a maximum of 30 days. Orders under this Bill would permanently amend the law.</p>

<a name="60719-0015.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a><a name="06071990000261"></a>One of the reasons for the declaration of incompatibility procedure is to limit the impact of the Human Rights Act on legal certainty. People should be able to rely on primary legislation. If it were possible for Acts of Parliament to be struck down by the courts, leaving aside the issue of Parliament&#146;s position, it would give rise to serious questions about the legality of actions taken in reliance on provisions that were later found to be unlawful. I should reiterate that it is already unlawful to make secondary legislation that is incompatible with convention rights. As I explained, this protection is contained in the Human Rights Act and needs no repetition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_457"></a><a name="06071990000262"></a>The Government could not make the order if they did not believe that it was compatible with convention rights. Where primary legislation, including that as amended by secondary legislation, has been declared incompatible by the courts, the Government have always responded positively by proposing appropriate remedial action to Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_458"></a><a name="06071990000263"></a>I do not seek to disguise that this is a difficult choice to make between legal certainty on the one hand and enhanced remedies for incompatibility with the convention rights on the other, but as my right honourable friend the Chancellor for the Duchy of Lancaster indicated in her letter to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the Government are not persuaded at this stage that a provision such as Amendment No. 118 is appropriate.</p>

The line which the Minister has taken seems highly questionable. It was certainly not taken by the Joint Committee on Human Rights when it proposed that my amendment should be introduced. Indeed, the Government seemed not to assume that that line was correct when they introduced a similar provision into the Civil Contingencies Bill. The fact that orders made under the Civil Contingencies Act would last only a short period while orders made under this Bill could last indefinitely is wholly irrelevant to the issue raised by the amendment. Although the line taken by the Government is perhaps arguable, it is far from certain and should be strengthened and confirmed by the amendment which I moved today and expect to move again at a later stage.

If it transpires that the Bill has had as little effect as the 2001 Act, we must consider whether we should return to that Act as the default position. To do otherwise would leave on the statute book extremely wide, unnecessary powers. I beg to move.</p>

The amendment is extremely important, as there is a clear and compelling case for reviewing such an important Act within a set period. I take issue only with the point she made that if we did not get any of the constitutional amendments we should have this one. My point is that we need both, because an awful lot could be done if this legislation were to be used in an inappropriate way within the five years. It is not an alternative; it is actually complementary to some of the amendments that we have considered. But in itself it has my full support.</p>

<a name="06071995000004"></a><b><a name="60719-0015.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="06071995000154"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am sure that noble Lords will not be at all surprised to hear that I am not a fan of this amendment and that I am firmly set in my opposition to it. The idea of sunsetting Part 1 does not make a lot of sense to me. The government amendments tabled ahead of and accepted on Report in the Commons mean that the order-making power is clearly focused on better regulatory outcomes. Simply to set an arbitrary date for the expiry of Part 1 would, for the reasons I am about to adumbrate, be wholly inappropriate.</p>

<a name="60719-0015.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a><a name="06071995000005"></a>It is my firm belief that there is no need for a sunset clause. The safeguards contained in the Bill, coupled with the rigorous parliamentary scrutiny that any proposal will undergo, and the ability for Parliament to veto orders, are sufficiently robust. There is no need to introduce the level of uncertainty that a sunset provision would bring. We can be confident that we are passing a robust Bill that will stand the test of time.</p>

<a name="60719-0015.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a><a name="06071995000006"></a>The approach that we need to take is one of partnership of regulators and regulated working together. What message would we be sending the business community and the public and voluntary sectors if we arbitrarily stopped working with them on this? I think this would be the only conclusion that they could draw were we to insert a sunset clause. Are we to say that the Government are interested only in the short term? Of course we are not. This is a long-term approach to legislation and regulation, and any Government would be foolish not to look to the future.</p>

<a name="60719-0015.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a><a name="06071995000007"></a>We have talked a lot about changing the culture, and a lot of that means that we have to get departments to invest resources in pursuing reforms that may in the end not prove possible. Will departments do that if there is a five-year cut-off point? An important element of the culture change we see as necessary is one of confidence in methods for delivery, and knowing we are achieving what is needed, and that work can continue without an arbitrary deadline preventing it. People should be able to rely on primary and secondary legislation&#151;a point made on a number of occasions already during today&#146;s debates. We want to avoid a situation where those who are regulated by an order do not have confidence in its provisions and think that it will simply be overturned and lapse. I hope that orders will be able to deliver wide-ranging reforms such as those that I have elucidated in connection with the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order. It is important that, for instance, the large numbers of businesses complying with the fire safety order have confidence in its provisions. We want Parliament to pass a power that it has confidence in now and, this being the case, should have confidence in for the future.</p>

<a name="60719-0015.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a><a name="06071995000008"></a>The Government have already given the undertaking that a Minister of the Crown will report to the House within five years after enactment on the operation and effectiveness of the Bill. If the sunset clause was included in the Bill, then even if at the end of five years Parliament wanted this power to continue, it would simply expire; no further orders could be made and the 2001 Act certainly would not revive them. We would have two options in those circumstances, neither of which is edifying or compelling: either to introduce new primary legislation for a new order-making power, or to have sensible and beneficial proposals that would have been made by order having to wait to be made by primary legislation instead. Those appear to me very cumbersome ways in which to deal with things that we believe are best dealt with in this respect. I doubt whether noble Lords have given this careful consideration, particularly in terms of its impact on businesses.</p>

<a name="60719-0015.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a><a name="06071995000009"></a>There is nothing in Amendment No. 112 to ensure that orders already made under Part 1 will remain in place&#151;if, indeed, that is the intention. If they do not remain in force, everything done by them, including amendments to primary legislation, would in effect be repealed. I can only assume noble Lords intend existing orders to remain in force, otherwise all the efforts of departments and the beneficial reforms made over five years would be completely wasted. Unless there is an express provision to that effect, however, the position cannot be entirely free from doubt. That is why we have a saving provision in our Bill to make it completely clear, when we repeal the 2001 Act, that orders made under it will continue to have effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_468"></a><a name="06071995000010"></a>Similar amendments to introduce a sunset clause were tabled when both the 1994 and 2001 Acts were going through Parliament, and during the passage of the 1994 Act the then Conservative Administration&#151;wisely, in my view, although perhaps I would not have thought so at the time&#151;resisted them. I think they were right to do so. What was good enough for a good old-fashioned Tory Administration in 1994 was good enough for us in 2001, and should be good enough in 2006. Noble Lords opposite should stick to their original intentions and withdraw this amendment.</p>

<a name="06071995000014"></a><b><a name="60719-0016.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="06071995000156"></a>Lord Norton of Louth</b> moved AmendmentNo. 112A:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_94"></a><a name="06071995000125"></a>Page 13, line 17, leave out paragraph (a).</p>
</ul>
<a name="60719-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a><a name="06071995000015"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment seeks to tease out of the Government the justification for embodying principles of better regulation in statute and having a statutory code of practice. There is no argument about the importance of the principles embodied in Clause 23(2)(a), nor of the value of having a code of practice. What is at issue is whether the principles are best realised through a voluntary or a statutory code.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a><a name="06071995000016"></a>Applying the principles of better regulation did not create a problem when applied at the level of general functions. As the Bill is drafted, however, it opens up the prospect of particular regulatory decisions being challenged in the courts for failing to fulfil one of the enumerated principles. On the face of it, that may seem quite justifiable. However, I draw a parallel with what we see happening at the moment at the European level with Ordnance Survey material. There would seem to be an obvious case for making such material publicly available, but the Government have now realised that there are security implications if all the material is made available, and are seeking to achieve some change to the proposal.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a><a name="06071995000017"></a>Similarly, with regard to this clause, the principle of transparency would appear to be incontestable. However, what if it were utilised for the purpose of acquiring material about the activity of regulators in tackling suspected criminal activities? The same applies to the principles. There is an arguable case that they could be utilised to undermine regulators in the fulfilment of their functions. I know a number of regulators are unhappy about this part of the Bill, and would prefer a voluntary agreement rather than a relatively inflexible statutory code.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a><a name="06071995000018"></a>I have therefore put down my amendment and given notice of my intention to oppose the Questions that Clauses 24 to 26 stand part of the Bill. I appreciate that there are probably better ways of getting at what I seek to achieve. I do not regard that as crucial, since my purpose is essentially to eke out of the Government a justification for Part 2. Not surprisingly, we focused very much on Part 1, but it is important that we ensure that this part is adequately probed and considered. I think the regulators&#146; concern deserves a response. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a><a name="06071995000023"></a>I question why we are leaving yet again to codes of practice matters that could reasonably be stated in the Bill. The Government generally try to leave too much to guidance and codes of practice, and sometimes it is hard to see why. If they are concerned that putting guidance into statute will lead to more cases of decisions of Ministers or public bodies being judicially reviewed, I suggest that that concern is misguided. The courts look at adherence to guidance anyway when assessing whether the decision of a Minister or action of a public body was irrational or procedurally incorrect. Although guidance is not binding in the same way as a statutory duty, the courts will none the less consider that there is a legitimate expectation that such guidance will be followed.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a><a name="06071995000024"></a>With that in mind I question why much of the content of the code is not placed in the Bill. The Cabinet Office has kindly supplied the draft code in advance of this debate, so I welcome the fact that at least we can debate Clauses 23 and 24 with it available. Section 2 of the draft code begins with the statement:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_95"></a><a name="06071995000126"></a>&#147;This section is based on the principle that no inspection should take place without a reason&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06071995000116"></a>Why cannot that be placed in the Bill as a legal requirement? I read on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_96"></a><a name="06071995000127"></a>&#147;Regulators must use risk assessment to programme all inspection activity&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06071995000117"></a>Where is the drafting problem there in getting those exact words into Clause 23?</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a><a name="06071995000025"></a>Section 3 deals with data requirements. This is the bane of every business&#146;s existence&#151;endless form-filling and sending in of returns. The code contains a very pithy statement; that,</p>
<ul><a name="06071995000149"></a>&#147;if two regulators require the same information, they must, in so far as possible, share data so that it is only collected once&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06071995000118"></a>Why cannot that be expressed as a legal requirement? It would allow businesses to tell a regulator to go back to another regulator and get the information from it, rather than making the business do all the work again just because the regulators were being inefficient. I have delved into the code enough; it contains useful advice which ought to be in the Bill.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a><a name="06071995000026"></a>I shall now discuss in detail Amendments Nos. 112B and 113. These amendments seek to question the extent to which these principles will apply to regulators. The Explanatory Notes state at paragraph 82:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_97"></a><a name="06071995000128"></a>&#147;The duty to have regard to these principles is subject to any other legal requirement, such as a statutory duty or a requirement of EC law, which will take priority over the principles&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06071995000119"></a>This worries me slightly because at first sight Part 2 sounds very positive: here we have set out in statute some sensible principles with which no one could really disagree. If the regulators do not have to operate according to these principles&#151;if their statutory duties are incompatible with that&#151;how much regulatory activity would therefore be exempt from the operation of these principles? I understand that this subsection would exempt the economic regulators, particularly those explicitly referred to under Clause 26(5). Whether those exemptions in Clause 26 are appropriate is another matter; I seek to find out the extent to which these principles will have any real effect.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a><a name="06071995000027"></a>Amendment No. 113 attempts to give more teeth to Part 2. By ensuring that a report on the operation of that part is laid before Parliament, we will be able to keep a check on what regulators are up to and how they have been behaving. I expect that the work entailed in compiling such a report would already be taking place. The Better Regulation Executive in conjunction with the Better Regulation Commission would surely be up to date with what was going on with the regulators, so there should be no reason not to expect a formal report to Parliament on an annual basis.</p>

<p><a name="st_218"></a>
<a name="06071995000028"></a><b><a name="60719-0016.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="06071995000161"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I will work through the grouped amendments and the stand part clauses. I am not entirely sure what the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, is trying to achieve with his amendment because it would mean that the only principle of good regulation left in Clause 23 would be the one to ensure that regulatory activity should be targeted only at cases in which action is needed. I am aware that the noble Lord chaired the Lords Select Committee on the Constitution when it produced its report <I>The Regulatory State: Ensuring its Accountability</I>, but I am not clear from my understanding of that report whether the noble Lord has another target in mind in moving his amendment.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a><a name="06071995000029"></a>I am not here to defend whether the Better Regulation Task Force, now the Better Regulation Commission, accepted this recommendation from the committee, but I am here to defend the fact that all five principles of good regulation are sensible principles that should underpin regulatory activities. I challenge the noble Lord to dispute the importance of those five principles of good regulatory practice. They are widely regarded as the gold standard for judging regulation, and they are the baseline standard that our Government want to set for the exercise of regulatory functions. However, they are not unprecedented, and they can also be found in the Communications Act 2003, where they apply to the regulatory functions of Ofcom. Given the variety of functions that regulators have and the variety of contexts in which they operate, inconsistency of approach is a real risk and could cause difficulties for those regulated businesses.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a><a name="06071995000030"></a>Would the noble Lord have it that regulatory activities should be targeted only at cases in which action is needed but that these activities are carried out in a disproportionate, unaccountable or inconsistent manner? We insist that the regulatory environment that we are trying to foster is one in which regulators do not use a sledgehammer to crack a nut, and where there is a clear understanding of accountability and the need for consistency. Regulatory activity should be targeted only at cases in which action is needed, but the action taken must be proportionate to the problem or risk involved. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment implies that so long as you are targeting the right nut, then however you crack it is fine.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a><a name="06071995000031"></a>I think I understand the rationale for Amendments Nos. 112B and 113A. The noble Baroness seems to require the duty to have regard to both the principles and the code of practice to be more onerous than it currently is. While I am delighted that the noble Baroness is as eager as we are that there is a statutory duty to have regard to the principles of good regulation and the code of practice in the Bill, I do not share her view that we should remove subsections (3) and (4) of Clauses 23 and 24. The effect of these subsections is that the statutory duty to have regard to the principles and the code of practice is subject to any other legal requirement affecting the exercise of the regulatory function, such as another statutory duty or Community law requirements. That means that, in the event of overlapping obligations, any other legal requirement affecting the exercise of the regulatory functions to which Clauses 23 and 24 apply takes priority over the duty to have regard to the principles and the code. That ensures legal certainty for those exercising regulatory functions.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a><a name="06071995000032"></a>This clause is not a let-off for regulators, as was suggested in another place. Regulators will not be able to use their founding legislation to ignore the principles. They will have to have regard to the principles and the code of practice, once issued, when exercising any functions which have been listed in an order under Clause 26 wherever the exercise of the function is not already affected by a legal requirement. Where there is a conflict, this Bill will provide the Government with more tools to act and intervene.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a><a name="06071995000033"></a>Amendment No. 113 is an unnecessary amendment, which the Government cannot accept. Philip Hampton, in his report <I>Reducing administrative burdens: effective inspection and enforcement</I>, recommended that the Government establish a Better Regulation Executive at the centre of Government. We accepted those recommendations in the Budget Statement in 2005. Noble Lords will know that the BRE has been established and is working with regulators to devise how best it can hold regulators to account for their performance against the principles of regulation. Alongside this assessment work of the BRE, regulators will continue to be held to account for their financial performance by the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission, and for policy by their sponsoring departments, whose decisions in this area will be assessed by the BRE.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a><a name="06071995000034"></a>For example, following an invitation from the Treasury under Section 12 of the Financial Services and Markets Act, the National Audit Office is reviewing the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which the Financial Services Authority has used its resources, when discharging its statutory functions. Moreover, the draft regulators compliance code, which the Government seek to place on a statutory footing under the provisions of Clause 24, proposes that regulators be required to publish clear standards for service and performance, against which they measure their performance each year, and publish the results.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a><a name="06071995000035"></a>We feel that enough is being done to ensure that regulators are held to account with regard to the exercise of their regulatory functions and that Amendment No. 113, if accepted, would add an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy to the existing mechanisms by which the Government hold regulators to account. For those reasons, I insist, or, rather, suggest that noble Lords opposite do not press their amendments.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a><a name="06071995000036"></a>For many of the reasons that I have set out, we would also oppose the removal of Clauses 24, 25 and 26. The code of practice procedure is important. The Minister must follow particular requirements when proposing to issue or revise the code of practice. The procedural requirements are broadly similar to those in place for revising the code of practice set out in Section 10 of the 2001 Act.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a><a name="06071995000037"></a>Clause 26 enables a Minister of the Crown to specify by order which regulatory functions are functions to which the duties have to have regard in relation to the principles in Clause 23 and the code of practice in Clause 24 and its application. We welcome the general support that we have had from opposition parties, but I would draw to the attention of noble Lords opposite the importance of Clause 26, which ensures that the Minister or the Assembly must consult any persons whose functions are to be specified in the order made under that, and consult other persons as the authority making the order considers appropriate. An order made under this power must be made by statutory instrument, and where the Minister makes the order, it will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, by virtue of subsection (9).</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a><a name="06071995000038"></a>Clause 26 stands or falls with Clauses 23, 24 and 25 and will enable us to deliver the recommendation of Philip Hampton&#146;s report through changing the way in which regulators behave. For those reasons Clause 26 should stand part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a><a name="06071995000039"></a>The noble Baroness asked why the detail of the code is not on the face of the Bill. We have produced an initial draft of the code. We are working with regulators on its detail and it is subject to change. So we require that flexibility in order to be able to change it&#151;very much having listened to the views of formal consultees. Formal consultation on the code will take place after Royal Assent but that does not diminish our commitment to ensuring that we pay careful attention to the representations made to us.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a><a name="06071995000052"></a>The noble Viscount said: I am so glad that this amendment is not grouped with anything. Nobody in the Committee can be expected to understand what it concerns except those who sit on the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee. That includes, or did include, the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton. I have given detailed comments to the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, about what I am going to say so I hope that he will be able to follow it. I do not expect anybody else to understand it at all.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a><a name="06071995000053"></a>It is all about transparency. There are two keynotes in this Bill. One of them is the removal of burdens, including, among other things, criminal sanctions. That involves criminal sanctions not only on businesses, charities and everything else but also, I was delighted to hear the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, saying on 3 June, on individuals. The Bill alsohas a keynote of promoting, in Clause 2(3)(a), transparency.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a><a name="06071995000054"></a>Departments in drafting statutory instruments are complying with neither of those principles. That is especially a matter for Defra but the DTI is not exempt; it is when it is transposing EU directives or regulations that it falls into the trap that I am about to describe. I have given the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, some examples, which I hope he haslooked up.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a><a name="06071995000055"></a>I shall begin with an example from the Department of Trade and Industry&#151;2006/1719. It states in Regulation 2:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_102"></a><a name="06071995000133"></a>&#147;Any person who, except under authority of a licence ... infringes the prohibition on the acceptance of technical assistance in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 shall be guilty of an offence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06071995000120"></a>The penalty in a magistrates&#146; court is up to level 3 on the standard scale. What is that? It does not say. I am not particularly sorry for the people who are being attacked by this regulation; they are those who provide materials or instruments that can be used for torture or cruel and inhuman treatment, such as thumbscrews and cattle prods. Nevertheless, whoever they are, they are entitled to know what the offence is that they are not allowed to commit but it does not say what that is in the statutory instrument.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a><a name="06071995000056"></a>From Defra, I have chosen two examples. First, there is 2005/3280, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_103"></a><a name="06071995000134"></a>&#147;Any person who contravenes or fails to comply with any of the specified provisions of Regulation 183/2005 set out in paragraph (2) is guilty of an offence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06071995000121"></a>The penalties vary; on indictment it would be up to two years in prison or an unlimited fine or, in the lower courts, less.</p>

<a name="60719-0016.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a><a name="06071995000057"></a>Paragraph (2), one of the provisions with which one has to comply, specifies Article 6(1) as read with paragraphs (2) and (3). That is described as the HACCP system. It then goes on to Article 7(1), on documents concerning the HACCP system. Nowhere in the statutory instrument is the HACCP system explained. In fact it is a hazard analysis and critical control points system; but one can find that out only if one reads the Explanatory Memorandum, which of course is not published with the statutory instrument at all and can be obtained only separately. There are also Community codes of good practice. We do not know what will be in those, and presumably if one fails to comply with them, that will also be a criminal offence. But we do not know what they are. The provision is about animal feed. However, it does not apply only to those commercially producing animal feed, but also to individual farmers.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a><a name="06071995000058"></a>Recently, we have had statutory instrument 2006/1228, which came into force on 3 May 2006. It revoked a previous statutory instrument, 2006/68, which came into force on 1 March this year. It concerns what I fully appreciate is an extremely serious problem: TSE&#151;transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. It is a licensing provision for premises, which have to be maintained and operated in accordance with what is called &#147;the Community TSE Regulation&#148;. There are provisions for inspections and prohibition on the movement of animals, or parts of them, a breach of which carries the normal range of penalties allowed under the European Communities Act. &#147;The Community TSE Regulation&#148;, with which one has to comply, consists of 29 European Union instruments, including the original one&#151;999/2001&#151;which has at least 11 annexes, of which Annex III has been amended five times since then, and Annex XI seven times. It applies to farmers as well as to slaughterhouses and cutting plants, and some of the enforcement falls to trading standards departments.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a><a name="06071995000059"></a>To understand that, there is no alternative but the internet. Trading standards departments are fairly busy. They do not deal only with animals but with all kinds of other frauds, counterfeit goods and heaven knows what. Recently I was talking to the head of a trading standards department in a very large rural community. He said that, quite apart from what they themselves need to know as enforcement officials, farmers want to know what they can or cannot do. I do not know how many of them have time to look up 29 European Union instruments on the internet&#151;compiling the amendments to all the annexes as they go about their daily business. I remember the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, saying recently that farmers are under great pressure these days and I am sure that she is right.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a><a name="06071995000060"></a>It does in fact go wrong. I am told by my noble friend Lady Mar, who had been listening to &#147;Farming Today&#148; on the BBC, that, a fortnight ago, there was a case in Flint concerning the European Union cattle passports. A man named Mark Payne, I think, was charged with 19 offences of failing to keep proper records. I think that the district judge found that there was no foundation in English law for the offences. It was said to be a legal grey area going back to 2000. I asked the noble Lord, Lord Bassam&#151;and now ask the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie&#151;whether I could have further information on the case. I think it is quite an important illustration of what happens.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a><a name="06071995000061"></a>Why will government departments not put the ingredients of the offence into the statutory instrument? Well, it has been perfectly plainly explained by Defra. It says that,</p>
<ul><a name="06071995000150"></a>&#147;because EU Regulations are directly applicable in all countries, normal drafting practice is to avoid repetition of EU provisions in domestic legislation, as it may result in duplication or in the meaning of the Regulations being obscured&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06071995000122"></a>That was in a letter that the department sent last month to the committee which I sit on. What does it mean? Are we to suppose that there will be different interpretations of the directive, or regulation, in Portugal, in Latvia and in this country? The result, of course, must be an enormous burden on farmers, as well as many others. As farmers run small businesses, they are well within the ordinary scope of this Bill. Are they supposed to go straight from the milking parlour to the internet to see what is the latest regulation to affect their trade and how they carry out their farming? It is not reasonable to suppose that they could do so. The result is that the whole of these provisions are completely opaque. That is why the Bill ought to deal with this sort of matter.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a><a name="06071995000062"></a>If one contrasts this approach to what happens with ordinary criminal legislation in your Lordships&#146; House, one sees that it is very different. Members of the Committee will remember, for instance, the Theft Acts, or the recent Fraud Bill, both of which originated with the Law Commission. I do not remember anyone saying that anybody likely to be affected by these criminal provisions need only go back to the Law Commission&#146;s report to find out what the offence consisted of&#151;of course not. We have always put what are the several ingredients of the offence in the legislation, so that people know exactly what they are not allowed to do. That is not so in the case of European Union legislation.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a><a name="06071995000063"></a>I do not want to be totally unconstructive about this. If there is a difficulty over obscurity or different interpretations in different countries, then maybe Defra has the solution. There is one in the over 30-month scheme, which comes originally from regulation 719/96, but was most recently amended by statutory instrument 2005/2109 in England&#151;I am not sure whether it applies to Wales. It now has a parallel column, setting out the article in the original European Union regulation and, in the other column, what is called &#147;the subject matter&#148;: the requirement or prohibition. That does not appear to cause duplication or obscuration. If not, why can it not be used as a general approach? I put in the amendment that any such explanation would not be used in a criminal court by way of interpretation. It would simply help those being dealt with under these various instruments.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_513"></a><a name="06071995000064"></a>Can the Minister tell me, what is the policy on duplication and obscurity? Is this Bill not the very vehicle to try to import some transparency into the process? As the parliamentary Clerks responsible for statutory instruments in their various departments evidently will not depart from this probably quite long-standing technique, should Parliament not deal with it now? I am not going to ask anybody to decide upon it tonight, but it must be addressed and I look forward to what the Minister has to say. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_221"></a>
<a name="06071995000065"></a><b><a name="60719-0017.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="06071995000164"></a>Lord Henley:</b> In offering support from these Benches to the amendment of the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, I first say how much we all admire his staying power. He has sat through all three days of Committee, and we have finally reached Amendment No. 114. Secondly, I ought to declare an interest as, many years ago, I sat at the noble Viscount&#146;s feet as his pupil. I was possibly the worst pupil he ever had to endure, but at least I learnt enough to be able to say that I think I understood what he was getting at with his amendment seeking greater transparency. He explained it to us with such clarity that it is easy for all of us on these Benches to say how much we support his amendment and hope he will return to it on Report.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_514"></a><a name="06071995000066"></a>Too many restrictions, regulations and offences are created and passed with far too little scrutiny or wider awareness of the contents because of the amount of subordinate legislation that comes out of Europe. Any steps that can help us to maintain a grasp of what is being imposed on all of us throughout the Community are to be welcomed. These Benches support the amendment tabled by my noble friend.</p>

<p><a name="st_222"></a>
<a name="06071995000067"></a><b><a name="60719-0017.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="06071995000165"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thank the noble Viscount for moving this amendment and for taking us through some detailed examples. He is right that I spent some happy months on the Merits Committee, although I am not sure that some of the fun we had perusing the intricacies of the instruments was always the best use of my time.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_515"></a><a name="06071995000068"></a>I fear that my response may be inadequate to the challenge the noble Viscount has posed me, but he has given us cause for reflection for subsequent stages. The purpose of the amendment is to make it possible, by reading UK legislation, to tell what one is obliged to do, or what one must not do, to avoid an offence, without the need for cross-reference to EC legislation. I have no doubt that he would want this amendment to add clarity for those dealing with statutory instruments that transpose Community obligations into domestic law.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_516"></a><a name="06071995000069"></a>However, the second subsection of the amendment appears to undermine the noble Viscount&#146;s intention. Its effect is that any description of subject matter, as required by subsection (1), would be indicative only. In practice, that would mean that in cases before courts or a tribunal&#151;for example, criminal prosecutions&#151;the court could still interpret the words in the relevant Community instrument so as to establish precisely what one is obliged to do, or what one must not do, to avoid an offence. The provisions of the amendment would not remove the need to refer to the relevant EC instrument, as it is that and not any description made under the requirements of subsection (1) of this amendment that will be determinative before the courts.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_517"></a><a name="06071995000070"></a>This could lead to confusion, not clarity, for those dealing with SIs implementing Community instruments, as the inclusion of &#147;descriptions&#148; may lead some to believe that they do not need to refer to the relevant Community instruments. It should also be noted that even if descriptions made under the requirements of this amendment were not merely indicative, the description in the Community instrument would still be deemed definitive by a court. Therefore, one would still have to refer to the relevant Community instrument.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_518"></a><a name="06071995000071"></a>The provisions of this amendment would also create an unnecessary legislative burden, as any description of a &#147;subject matter&#148;, as required under the provisions of this amendment, would have to be updated each time the relevant Community instrument was amended. The creation of such a legislative burden does not fit with the tenor of Part 3, which is designed, in part, to reduce bureaucracy with respect to the implementation of European Community obligations in domestic law. For those reasons, the Government cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_519"></a><a name="06071995000072"></a>The noble Viscount asked whether courts in England interpret differently from courts elsewhere in Europe. Courts in different member states may take a different view on the interpretation of Community law, but they are all interpreting and bound by the same law, and ultimately the interpretation of Community law is a matter for the European Court of Justice. If a case reaches the ECJ its interpretation would bind the domestic courts of all member states.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_520"></a><a name="06071995000073"></a>Notwithstanding that, and the technical difficulties in proceeding as the noble Viscount suggests, he has given us food for thought about trying to get more clarity in the statutory instruments to make sure they are more user friendly.</p>

<p><a name="st_223"></a>
<a name="06071995000074"></a><b><a name="60719-0017.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="06071995000166"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> I had not intended to take part in the debate but I was overwhelmed by the noble Viscount&#146;s arguments. Earlier in life I sometimes had to deal with successive instruments which referred further and further back until major research was needed to find out what they were about.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_521"></a><a name="06071995000075"></a>I detected a sign of some movement in the reply of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, that he wanted to reflect on the problems. I do not believe that the bureaucratic burden on which he seemed to lay so much weight, in arguing against the amendment, should prevent departments that implement European regulations spelling out clearly in layman&#146;s language what they mean: the offence being defined and the penalties. You could always add, as one frequently sees, &#147;This is a description only&#148;. We get that in the Explanatory Memorandums supporting Bills, which say that you have to look at the actual clauses but outline what they mean.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a><a name="06071995000076"></a>The noble Viscount referred to the huge torrent of European legislation that pours out. We have heard the example of farmers, but it has happened to employers and others affected by the legislation. Unless its meaning is spelt out in simple layman&#146;s language, my guess is that most people give up and don&#146;t do it. As the noble Viscount said, if there is an occasion when we really ought to address what has become a very serious burden for those affected by the legislation, it is this Bill, where we are trying to lift the burden of regulation.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a><a name="06071995000077"></a>One of the biggest burdens is trying to understand, if I may use unparliamentary language, what the bloody hell it is all about. The noble Viscount is saying that an explanation should be available with the document, in it or attached to it. I thought he made an extremely strong point and I hope that Ministers will take this up, because&#151;and I say this to my noble friends on the Front Bench&#151;we should return to it at a later stage.</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a><a name="06071995000078"></a>The noble Viscount was congratulated on having sat through three days of Committee; I think he deserves a much better and more positive response than he got from the government Front Bench.</p>

It was only his assiduous work in looking up all the previous connections of what was in front of us that made the Committee understand what we were doing. Without him we would never have understood the statutory instruments we were dealing with. All he is saying is that perhaps we should all help farmers by laying the regulations before them in simple terms so that they can understand what is happening to them. I commend the amendment to my noble friend on the Front Bench.</p>

It is a burden on the noble Lord&#146;s officials, but it is lifting the burden on the farmers who have to understand it. That is what it is about. We want to make sure that the people to whom the regulations apply understand what they are being asked to do or not to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_525"></a><a name="06071995000082"></a>I am grateful for the support of the noble Lord, Lord Desai, who also served on the committee. We need to address this problem. Where better than in this Bill?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_526"></a><a name="06071995000085"></a>I am not sure that I am very sympathetic about legislative burdens. The Government have gone to Brussels and agreed these things. Now they propose to impose them on people running businesses in this country, but they will not explain what it is that they have submitted to. The Minister said that he did not like the second paragraph in my amendment. Very well, I have given him the reference. What is wrong with Statutory Instrument 2005 No. 3522, the Older Cattle (Disposal) (England) Regulations 2005, which contains in its schedule&#151;this is what I was copying in my amendment&#151;provisions applicable to operators of slaughterhouses? Under the heading,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_104"></a><a name="06071995000135"></a>&#147;Provision of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 716/96&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="06071995000124"></a>Then there is a whole list. What is wrong with that? Why does the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs produce that sort of document if the Government say that it is an administrative burden? What is wrong with the system that they have introduced?</p>

<a name="60719-0017.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_527"></a><a name="06071995000086"></a>All that I suggested was that the Government might give an indication. Very well, if the Minister and the Government do not like it, we can take it out but the fact remains that the people on whom these impositions fall will have to undertake a major research project, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, before they can find out what is the offence that they might have committed. I find that unacceptable. Of course, I shall not press the amendment tonight, but I am very glad to hear a fairly sympathetic response from the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, and I hope that we can return to the matter later. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This is consistent with the long-standing constitutional convention that the Government will not legislate on anything within the competence of the Church of England, which has <I>de facto</I> delegated powers, without first reaching agreement with it. My understanding, as one would expect, is that the amendment is very agreeable to the Church of England. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Coventry raised the issue on Second Reading. Officials have been in discussion with the Church authorities on this point for some time, and my understanding is that the Church is entirely happy with the proposition. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_544"></a><a name="06071995000107"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 117 is a minor change to what will become the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006. The Wireless Telegraphy Bill is a consolidation Bill and is drafted on the basis of the law as it now stands. On that basis, it includes provision in relation to the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 in that it disapplies the two-year rule in that Act, which endeavours to prevent a regulatory reform order amending or repealing a provision that is less than two years old or has been substantially amended in the past two years. The disapplication means that the two-year rule would not stop a regulatory reform order making provision for wireless telegraphy just because that provision has been consolidated in the Wireless Telegraphy Bill. As our Bill will repeal the 2001 Act, the provision in the Wireless Telegraphy Bill serves no purpose, and I entreat Members of the Committee to accept the amendment without demur, because it will be very helpful indeed. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="06071965000017"></a><b><a name="60719-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="06071965000410"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="06071965000018"></a>I have today published the technical report of the air quality technical panels instituted after the 2003 air transport White Paper to review the basis on which air quality assessments should be carried out for Heathrow airport.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="06071965000019"></a>We continue to support further development at Heathrow, including the addition of a short, third runway in the 2015 to 2020 period, after a new runway at Stansted, but only if we can be confident that the conditions set out in the White Paper can be met. Publishing this report is a significant milestone in the programme of work to review the scope for meeting those conditions. I am grateful to the panel members who have devoted their energies over the past two years to a very full review of the issues and who have produced a detailed and comprehensive report.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="06071965000020"></a>The report has been peer reviewed and I amhappy to accept its recommendations. It isprimarily concerned with methodology&#151;how future assessments of air quality around Heathrow should be conducted. It does not attempt to prejudge the question of whether development at Heathrow is more or less likely to be achievable within the critical air quality limits. But, importantly, it provides a sound scientific basis on which we can now proceed to carry out the remaining stages of the work to address that question in the coming months, building on the panels&#146; recommendations.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="06071965000021"></a>Copies of the report are available in the Library and full details will be available on the department&#146;s website.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="06071965000023"></a>On behalf of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI inspection reports on the following councils were published today: Bath and North East Somerset Council, Elmbridge Borough Council, Exeter City Council, Gateshead Borough Council, Reading Borough Council, Shepway District Council, Stevenage Borough Council and Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council.

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="06071965000025"></a><b><a name="60719-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="06071965000412"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord Drayson):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="06071965000026"></a>I am pleased to announce progress on the complex weapons sector of the defence industrial strategy (DIS). This sector provides key missile development capabilities to our Armed Forces.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="06071965000027"></a>The DIS identified that maintaining the industrial capability that we wished to retain onshore represented a substantial challenge given that we expect investment in new systems to decrease in the next five years from the current level due to a sharp decline in market size. We undertook to work with UK industry to meet this challenge and can now announce that we are forming a &#147;Team Complex Weapons&#148;. &#147;Team CW&#148; is led by MBDA and is centred around QinetiQ, Thales Air Defence Ltd, Thales Missile Electronics and Roxel. &#147;Team CW&#148; will enable the UK to maintain key skills and technologies through a mixture of directed procurements and open competition, enabling controlled restructuring to take place while maintaining onshore access to the capabilities that our Armed Forces require.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="06071965000028"></a>Together, we will develop &#147;Team CW&#148; during the second half of this year. We intend to agree a strategic partnering agreement in 2006. This will require contractually binding measures focused on business transformation both within the Ministry of Defence and within industry, allowing better-informed through-life decisions to be made and a more incremental approach to technology insertion to be adopted.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="06071965000029"></a>We intend to use a range of programmesto incentivise the restructuring process. Most significantly, we have changed our procurement strategy for the loitering munition demonstration and manufacture programme, potentially worth more than &#163;500 million. It will be single-sourced to the MBDA-led &#147;Team CW&#148;, subject to an enduring requirement for this technology, to affordability and to the ability to clearly demonstrate value for money.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="06071965000030"></a>We are also announcing four contracts for the development of technologies to contribute to the enhancement of Storm Shadow, and the future anti-surface and future rapid effects programmes, which will offer significant opportunities for collaboration. In the support area, we have placed a contract for availability known as PROJECT RevISE, which covers air-launched weapons designed by MBDA.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="06071965000031"></a>Our joint approach with industry will enable usto develop a globally competitive industry that will deliver the technologically advanced missiles that our Armed Forces will need in the future.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="06071965000034"></a><b><a name="60719-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="06071965000414"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions(Mrs Anne McGuire) has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="06071965000035"></a>Increasing the number of disabled people whom we support into work is a core part of our welfare reform agenda. This is central to meeting the department's aim of an 80 per cent employment rate and central to ensuring equality of opportunity for disabled people.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="06071965000036"></a>Remploy was set up after the Second World War to provide employment to facilitate rehabilitation and progression to open employment. Employing around 5,000 disabled people, the Remploy factories are engaged in a wide range of sectors ranging from office furniture through textiles to electronics. These industry sectors have experienced significant change over the past 60 years, not least through increased international competition.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="06071965000037"></a>In addition, the way in which we support disabled people into work has evolved. Strengthened disability rights mean that we are now in a stronger position to support people in a mainstream environment. This is why Remploy developed its Interwork business, which supported 4,300 people into jobs in 2005.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="06071965000038"></a>These changes have raised significant questions about the future strategy for Remploy. That is why in March I commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers and Stephen Duckworth, a disability expert with wide experience of disability rights and employment issues, to conduct a strategic review of the future business options for the company.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="06071965000039"></a>Today, I have published the findings of the review. Copies of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report have been made available in the Libraries, Vote and Printed Paper Offices and on the DWP website, http://www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/dwp/2006/remploy.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="06071965000040"></a>The report delivers a hard-hitting financial assessment of the challenges facing Remploy. Factories are facing growing cost pressures as aresult of increased international competition and technological development. The average cost per employee is &#163;18,000 per year and over &#163;48,000 in the household and toiletries factory&#151;far greater than, say, the &#163;5,000 cost per head of other Workstep providers.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="06071965000041"></a>The report sets out a range of possible scenarios for the business, from no change to complete closure of the factory network. I am ruling out both these options.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="06071965000042"></a>It is clear from both this report and that of the National Audit Office that doing nothing is not an option. This view is shared by the Remploy board, its management and the trade unions. The necessity for change is clear, but I believe that there is still a role for sheltered employment in the future.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="06071965000043"></a>We recognise that change will have an inevitable impact on the disabled people whom Remploy employs. We want to give Remploy the time and support to determine the best way to modernise and restructure its business. We intend, therefore, to provide the necessary funding to enable this to happen&#151;in particular, so that there is sufficient time to consider factory reorganisation as part of an overall restructuring package. This is not a cuts package for Remploy; on the contrary, we will be maintaining the baseline funding and investing more this year to help to deal with the short-term issues.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="06071965000044"></a>I will be asking the board of Remploy to undertake the preliminary work to bring forward later next year a five-year restructuring plan with proposals both to modernise the business and to support substantially larger numbers of disabled people into work. Full consultation will take place with the trade unions and employees in developing this strategy. I will be making it clear that any such proposals must protect Remploy's disabled employees from compulsory redundancy. Once this plan is brought forward, we will consider whether we are able to offer the board additional funding for modernisation; we will also consider at that stage with the chair whether we need to enhance the range of skills on the board to help it to do this.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="06071965000045"></a>Currently, Remploy supports around 9,000 disabled people in factory employment, Interwork and managed services. In the longer term, our ambition is that any restructuring should enable us to help significantly more disabled people in work than if we continue with the status quo, thus providing substantially more opportunities for disabled people and better value for the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="06071965000046"></a>The efforts of Remploy's existing workforce, its chair, current board and supporters must not be underestimated or taken for granted. They have much to be proud of. But Remploy cannot stand still and we need to examine how the ideals that lay behind its creation 60 years ago can fit the world that it now faces.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="06071965000047"></a><b><a name="60719-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="06071965000415"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My honourable friend the Minister for Local Government (Phil Woolas) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="06071965000048"></a>The Government are today confirming individual grant allocations to administering authorities for the Supporting People programme in 2007-08, which will fund housing-related support services for over1 million vulnerable people&#151;including victims of domestic violence, teenage parents, older people and those with mental health problems&#151;to help them to live independently in their accommodation.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="06071965000049"></a>As part of the two-year local government funding settlement in December 2005, minimum allocations for 2007-08 were announced guaranteeing 95 per cent of the total available. Five per cent of the funding was held back pending consultation on the draft Supporting People distribution formula, with a commitment to confirming full Supporting People allocations for 2007-08 before the Summer Recess.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="06071965000050"></a>The consultation on the Supporting People distribution formula is now complete and responses to this exercise have been assessed. Following consideration of the available options, a decision has been taken to target the remaining funding in 2007-08 to help to address some of the inherited uneven distribution of grant between authorities by increasing Supporting People funding to over half of all Supporting People local authorities.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="06071965000051"></a>This decision is consistent with the approach taken to determining allocations in both 2005-06 and 2006-07, when an earlier version of the formula was used to inform the grant allocations to those authorities furthest from their correct relative share of the budget. Further work will be carried out on the analysis of responses to the consultation with a view to taking forward work on how we can distribute future funding based on need. All Supporting People grant allocations are listed below.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="06071965000052"></a>The Government are also targeting funding from the Supporting People programme to assist linked programmes of national importance.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="06071965000053"></a>This early announcement of funding for 2007-08 will help to provide the stability required by local authorities and the sector in order to plan for the future.</p>

<a name="06071965000387"></a><b><a name="60719-wms0002.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="06071965000420"></a>The Minister of State, Home Office (Baroness Scotland of Asthal):</b> My honourable friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality (Mr Liam Byrne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_360"></a><a name="06071965000388"></a>I would like to update the House on progress in deporting foreign national prisoners, following the Home Secretary's Statement on 23 May (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons; col. 77WS).</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_361"></a><a name="06071965000389"></a>Our objective is that foreign national prisoners should face deportation and that deportation should happen as early as possible in their sentence. As an immediate step, we now have an imminent release team in IND working with HM Prison Service to ensure that foreign national prisoners who meet the existing criteria are not being released from prison without being considered for deportation. My review of the past few weeks confirms that, in order fully to achieve our objective, there is a need for legislation, as well as for fundamental reforms in the eight areas identified.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_362"></a><a name="06071965000390"></a>First, the Home Secretary identified that there is today no unique identifier to link individuals who come in contact with the asylum, immigrationand criminal justice systems. We have therefore commenced development of a comprehensive approach to identity management across all Home Office areas and will finalise a strategic action plan by the end of September 2006.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_363"></a><a name="06071965000391"></a>Secondly, we have identified that the police, Crown Prosecution Service, courts and prisons depend on self-declaration of nationality and that there is no requirement for the police to record the nationality of people brought into custody. There is no requirement in law for a detainee to furnish details of their identity or nationality. IND and the criminal justice agencies have now designed and tested proposals for newways of working, alongside options for new legal requirements to address this. We will conduct detailed field tests with front-line staff over the summer and produce recommendations in October.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_364"></a><a name="06071965000392"></a>Thirdly, work has to be done to ensure that all future instructions are given to all agencies of the criminal justice, asylum and immigration systems and are both consistent and fully implemented. IND needs to work much more closely with the criminal justice agencies. Lin Homer has therefore joined the National Criminal Justice Board to ensure that this is done. Since 23 May, new guidance has been issued to IND and the Prison Service. Over the summer, we will audit related guidance of six key agencies, benchmark implementation and develop recommendations for change, including training provision, by October. This will be followed up by training and awareness events for staff working in the 20 key prisons, which process the largest numbers of foreign national prisoners at the earliest stages of their sentences, by the end of 2006.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_365"></a><a name="06071965000393"></a>Fourthly, the Home Secretary asked for an audit of policy criteria and processes and, fifthly, for steps to be taken to ensure that all deportation decisions are made according to the most robust interpretation of the requirements of our international obligations. Guidance in May to IND and prisons identified interim criteria, so that all non-EEA nationals sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment or more, either in one sentence or in two or three sentences over five years, and all EEA nationals sentenced to24 months or more, should be considered for deportation. We are changing the Immigration Rules with effect from midnight tonight to confirm the presumption that all such prisoners should be deported. The guidance also sets out that only rarely will factors other than international obligations weigh against deportation.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_366"></a><a name="06071965000394"></a>But the current law does not go far enough to link criminality with deportation in the way that we would want and the public would expect. We need to change the law to make deportation the norm for foreign national prisoners, to remove some in-country rights of appeal, to streamline procedures and otherwise to remove barriers to deportation and removal, including existing exemptions for some Commonwealth nationals. We shall announce further steps in the wider IND review, to be published before the Recess.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_367"></a><a name="06071965000395"></a>Sixthly, new formal arrangements are now in place to refer cases for consideration of deportation where the foreign national prisoner is in custody in Scotland or Northern Ireland. Prison authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland have confirmed that these processes are working well. These arrangements involve IND officials and officials in the Scottish Executive, the Scottish Prison Service, the Northern Ireland Office and the Northern Ireland Prison Service. Agencies are now developing proposals to extend these formal arrangements for referral across the justice systems in these jurisdictions: for example, with the police, Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) and Scottish courts; and at each stage in the system in Northern Ireland, as approved by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_368"></a><a name="06071965000396"></a>The seventh priority area for action is the sensitive issue of mentally disordered offenders, where there has hitherto been no established system of referral and nationality has not routinely been recorded. As with Scotland and Northern Ireland, arrangements have now been put in place to ensure that cases are referred for consideration of deportation for this particular group when their formal restriction is due to end. Home Office officials are considering with the Department of Health what other actions we might take to ensure that mentally disordered offenderscan be considered for deportation at the earliest appropriate opportunity.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_369"></a><a name="06071965000397"></a>Finally, the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is conducting targeted interviews with foreign national prisoners who qualify to transfer to serve their sentence in their home country. An urgent amendment is being sought to legislation currently before Parliament to remove the need for prisoner consent in these cases, and prisoner transfer agreements are being negotiated with more foreign Governments. We have agreements with 96 countries and territories. NOMS, IND and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office are assembling a package of measures to accelerate this work further.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_370"></a><a name="06071965000398"></a>There remains much to be done. Progress in all these areas will be reported in due course.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_371"></a><a name="06071965000400"></a>Those powers are contained in Part 2 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, which came into force on 1 April. They enable the director of RCPO (and prosecutors to whom he has delegated such powers) to serve disclosure notices, obtain material, conduct compulsory interviews and execute search warrants. These powers are powers of RCPO, not of HMRC; they are RCPO's to use. However, the prosecutor can authorise use of the powers by an officer of HMRC in respect of tax offences where the prosecutor has decided that such use is appropriate.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_372"></a><a name="06071965000401"></a>As the powers are for RCPO to use, the issue for the review of HMRC's powers to consider was the guidance that was available to HMRC staff when a prosecutor had authorised the use of the powers by an officer of HMRC. The review has looked atthat guidance and, following minor changes, has approved it.</p>

<a name="06071965000403"></a><b><a name="60719-wms0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="06071965000422"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_374"></a><a name="06071965000404"></a>In July 2003, Alistair Darling, in response to the Orbit multi-modal study, confirmed his intention to add an extra lane of capacity to bring most of the remaining three-lane sections of the M25 up to four lanes in each direction. Construction work on this major investment project costing over &#163;2 billion is expected to start in 2008 and run through until 2016 with the widening being undertaken in stages.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_375"></a><a name="06071965000405"></a>At the time of the decision to increase the capacity of the M25, it was made clear that widening wouldbe pursued alongside measures to improve the management of traffic flow in order to lock in the benefits that the additional capacity would provide.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_376"></a><a name="06071965000406"></a>The department has been exploring how traffic management technology already being used on the motorway network might be used to control congestion on the orbital motorway and its junctions. But traffic using the motorway also uses surrounding local roads and not just the motorway. The modelling that has been completed shows that there is potentially considerable benefit to be gained inthe department applying and operating traffic management techniques jointly with local authorities. The benefits would be reflected in better overall journey times for the majority of road users across both the national and the local networks.</p>

<a name="60719-wms0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_377"></a><a name="06071965000407"></a>It is vital that we harness local authorities&#146; local knowledge at the planning stage, as well as developing a joint approach in applying that knowledge. I am therefore writing today to all the local authorities around the M25 to start this dialogue, focusing initially on those in the north-west segment, where the first section of widening will take place, with the aim of developing an approach that will ensure that long-distance traffic and local residents all benefit from this huge national investment.</p>

 The carbon-abatement technology strategy demonstration programme, worth &#163;35 million, will formally launch its first call for proposals in September 2006. The first call is worth &#163;10 million and will focus on the pre-commercial demonstration of key components and systems to support carbon-abatement technologies.On carbon capture and storage, work of the CCS regulatory task force will continue in consultation with industry and other stakeholders in order to clarify and develop proposals on appropriate regulations.The Government believe that the next stage would be a commercial demonstration of CCS, if it proved to be cost-effective. More work on the costs of such demonstration projects will be undertaken, and a further statement will be made at the Pre-Budget Report.<a name="wa_subhd_8"></a>

There are close links between IND and the devolved authorities in respect of issues surrounding asylum seekers and refugee integration. Links across the relevant criminal justice agencies will be enhanced by the new UK Immigration Service Local Enforcement Office, presently in place in Belfast, which will be fully operational by the end of 2006.

The European Commission is still working to make the first payments to medical workers in July, but the security situation is slowing progress. The mechanism will ensure that healthcare continues to be provided in the Occupied Territories. It will also work to help to provide the poorest segments of Palestinian society with basic needs allowances and to ensure the uninterrupted supply of utilities, including fuel.

The UK stated that it would support all efforts made by the German authorities during this period to prevent the trafficking of women for sexual exploitation, should such a request be received. In connection with this, a 500-word article raising awareness of the possibility of trafficked women being forced to work in brothels was placed in the England football supporters fanzine that was distributed to travelling supporters to coincide with the first World Cup game against Paraguay. I am pleased to say that monitoring of the movement of people from eastern Europe to Germany has not revealed an increase in human trafficking for sexual exploitation during the World Cup.</p>

The particular areas of concern relate to issues surrounding the provision of recovery and reflection periods (Article 13) and residence permits (Article 14). The mandatory nature of these provisions, when coupled with the scope of the convention, has led to concerns that the provisions will act as an immigration pull factor, encourage spurious claims and be used by those who have no right to remain in an effort to frustrate removal. Abuse of the provisions would ultimately impact on those in genuine need of assistance. The Government are examining how the convention's approach could best be harmonised with effective immigration controls.</p>
