The report identifies areas for international action that closely reflect the UK's development priorities to reduce female mortality, close education gaps, improve women's economic opportunities, increase women's voice in society and limit the transmission of poverty across the generations. The Secretary of State for International Development is speaking at the UK launch of the report on 23 November.</p>

Does she agree that while the report's concentration on gender is very welcome, its implementation plan is weak and insufficient? Does she further agree that the plan should include concrete objectives on gender equality, particularly in areas such as political participation and access to justice?</p>

It is notable that the World Bank does not necessarily match rhetoric with reality, and we hope that this will be a step on the way to making those two things dovetail. The noble Baroness is right that we have to make sure that we support the World Bank in making sure that this is carried through much more effectively than may have been the case in the past.</p>

What are we doing through our embassies and otherwise to promote the goals of that campaign? Will the UK Border Agency review its country of origin information service to ensure that, in considering women's asylum claims, officials have full and up-to-date information about this appallingly common phenomenon?</p>

In fact, domestic violence runs as something of a theme throughout the main report. It is clearly an issue that needs to be taken extremely seriously. When you look at some of the evidence it contains-for example, that in Cusco there are reports that 50 per cent of women suffer domestic violence-it is an astonishing situation. The UK Border Agency publishes country of origin information reports on the 20 countries that generate the most asylum claims, and all those reports have a section dedicated to covering matters relating to women, including violence against women. The independent advisory group on country information last month commissioned a review focusing on women and girls. I hope that the noble Lord will find that encouraging.</p>

The noble Baroness knows that six out of 10 women in the world are subjected to domestic violence. Will the noble Baroness tell us what, if anything, the Government intend to do on 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to celebrate the things that have been done and, more importantly, to make sure that more is done to reduce domestic violence worldwide?</p>

Clearly an awful lot more needs to be done. I am speaking at a meeting on that day and I will get the details of that to her. Of course, we have appointed my honourable friend Lynne Featherstone as the UK's international violence against women and girls champion. She has been trying to ensure that when Ministers go overseas, they routinely raise this in their bilateral meetings. DfID is working on domestic violence in 15 of the countries that it focuses on, and I hope that will extend further as well. The World Bank report mentions ensuring that domestic laws are put in place. One of the things that DfID is working on is trying to make sure that, in the countries in which it is working, the judicial systems and the police take this seriously and act upon information that comes to them.</p>

Can the noble Baroness assure me that in our emphasis on schooling for girls in developing countries we do not place emphasis only on the provision of schools but on qualified teachers? In many countries that is where the problem is: we help provide the buildings but do not ensure that the qualified teachers are there.</p>

It is therefore a very useful tool for UN Women in its overarching approach to what the UN is doing worldwide. I would expect that UN Women would find this to be a useful tool. It is not just a matter of justice, but of the economic significance of gender inequality in terms of development. The noble Baroness also asked about education. It is absolutely vital not just to get girls into school but to get them through school, and she is certainly right that ensuring the teaching is there is absolutely vital.</p>

Good authorities are restructuring with care, and many are keeping all their children's centres open. The Government have retained statutory duties requiring local authorities to provide sufficient children's centres, and my department is monitoring the situation with local authorities.</p>

Will the Minister agree that the Government have made repeated promises that Sure Start centres will not be cut, and that it is not acceptable to give such undertakings and then blame local authorities when those projects could easily have been ring-fenced by the Government? Was it not an act of dishonesty by the Government to cut Sure Start centres?</p>

On his second point, we have put money into the early intervention grant to pay for a network of Sure Start children's centres, but we have a difference of opinion with the party opposite about whether those services are best delivered by local authorities with flexibility about how to spend the money-which is what I think local authorities are keen to have-or whether it is delivered through a ring fence. We took the view that we put the money in and then give local authorities the discretion to make the decisions themselves.</p>

We will, however, try to get the focus to shift to the outcomes and the results from those services rather than simply the buildings themselves.</p>

We found that Haringey made very severe cuts and closures, whereas Cambridgeshire, Nottinghamshire and Manchester did not make any. Why does he think different local authorities are taking such different approaches, when they are all affected by the same economic constraints?</p>

Local authorities are taking different priorities in different parts of the country, and that reflects, in some local authority areas of the sort to which I know my noble friend refers, the weight and significance that they put on the provision of Sure Start children's centres. All local authorities-and I accept that this applies to everyone-are having to face difficult financial decisions caused by the need for the Government to make savings, caused by the financial situation that we inherited.</p>

I have been asked questions about the funding of Sure Start children's centres. We have put the money into the EIG, and we have managed to find more resources to extend the offer to disadvantaged two year-olds and to increase the offer we have made for three and four year-olds. There is also the pupil premium. Those are priorities that the Government are putting money into, but we cannot wish away the economic situation that we inherited.</p>

Equally importantly, services are really being cut back in the remaining centres. The noble Lord neglected to say that the early intervention grant has been reduced by 22 per cent in real terms. Yet, for a tiny fraction of the cost of the health reorganisation, the Government could have protected children's centres. Does this not reflect the fact that the Government are out of touch, particularly with women's concerns, and why so many women now think that the Government are going in the wrong direction?</p>

One whole focus of the Government's work is to seek to increase funding into greater concentration on the early years. That is continuing despite the difficult financial situation that we face. I agree that the more one can do with young children to help them become ready for school and to achieve and to learn, the better they are likely to do later and the less chance there is of them going off the rails when they are older.</p>

For example, if smokers had had an intervention in childhood and their relationship with their parents had been strengthened, perhaps 40 per cent of them would not be smoking now. It would probably be the same for alcohol and drugs. Failing to intervene is hugely costly. Will the Minister ensure that the Department of Health carries a proper rate in support of this early intervention and will provide funding to Sure Start children's centres? Further, will it provide adult mental health services to parents in Sure Start children's centres and that there is full recognition of this? Will the Minister also discuss with his colleagues how children and families can be prioritised in the Health and Social Care Bill so that these often overlooked groups get the early support that they need?</p>

We have led the way in these negotiations. It is true that it has taken some time but we have come away with most, if not all, of our key objectives met. Nutritional information will now be displayed in a consistent manner on the back of all pre-packed foods, which is a major plus. A voluntary approach has been secured for front-of-pack nutrition labelling and for non-pre-packed foods, including those sold by caterers. It will also be made easier for alcohol companies to include energy information on their products on a voluntary basis.

Obviously, the Government would like to see greater consistency in front-of-pack labelling. We know that, if we can achieve it, that is likely to increase consumer understanding and indeed the way that consumers use the information. Now that the regulation is finalised, we have the opportunity to discuss with all stakeholders the way to achieve that. It is advantageous that there is the flexibility available for us to do that.</p>

If you put "food labelling" into a search engine, you will get hundreds of different versions of how food can be labelled. It feels like we are going backwards because of the flexibility that the Government have sought through the EU regulations. What part have the Government's relationships with the corporate sector played in this matter, and, indeed, if food labelling is going to become more confusing, will that not count against the drive to have good and well balanced diets?</p>

As a matter of fact, that has lain at the heart of the difficulty in reaching agreement in Europe, because there are so many divergent views around this. It is quite true that we do have very strongly held views-not least by the Food Standards Agency-about the value of traffic lights. We have equally strong views, held by certain sectors of industry, on the GDA model. As I said earlier in answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, it would be desirable to have consistency, but we are not there yet. We will continue to work at that objective.</p>

In 2009, the Food Standards Agency commissioned some research to examine which front-of-pack labelling system performed best, and the main finding was that the strongest performing front-of-pack label is one which combines the use of the words "high", "medium" and "low", traffic light colours and the percentage of guideline daily amount, in addition to levels of nutrients. That was the same across all socio-economic groups.</p>

The modernisation of the Commonwealth, based on Heads of Government agreeing the Eminent Persons Group core recommendations, is our priority. A reinvigorated Commonwealth with increased trade and investment flows is good for all its members and can help uplift prosperity levels for all its 2 billion citizens.</p>

My noble friend will be aware that the UK Government have led the way in the polio eradication programme and that earlier this year the Prime Minister announced a doubling of the funding for it, which will lead to an additional 45 million children being vaccinated over the next two years.

I do not guarantee that all these things will be accepted exactly as they are proposed by the Eminent Persons Group or the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, which is proposing similar ideas, but these matters will be pushed extremely hard and are a very high priority for Her Majesty's Government.</p>

There are 106 recommendations in the EPG report and many more in the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group report. There are funding implications for the Secretariat and for the machinery of the Commonwealth, and we are looking at those very carefully. We will have to evaluate them and decide what we can do, given the inevitable limits of resources. One also has to remember that a large part of the Commonwealth is both bilateral between Commonwealth countries and, even more important, separate from government. The unique nature of the Commonwealth is its huge latticework of professional, business, scientific, medical and judicial relationships that exist in no other multinational organisation. Those, too, will need to be developed and encouraged.</p>

Their highest representatives will be at Perth; I hope that they can get together at that and other opportunities to resolve the problems that face those two great nations.</p>

I would even go as far as to say that if it did not exist it would have to be invented. I have already acknowledged that there are funding implications; we will look at these carefully. Not everything is solved by more and more secretariats and central organisation, as we well know from our European Union experience, but funds will certainly be needed to make this whole programme go forward successfully.</p>

The old planning system had regions, regional spatial strategies and many planning policy statements; the new arrangements have no regions, no regional spatial strategies and, instead of planning policy statements, one national planning policy framework, with its special ingredient of a presumption in favour of development. We have discussed this a great deal over recent days. There was a wonderful speech from the noble Lord, Lord Deben, in the previous session on the Localism Bill, in the debate led by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, who also made a wonderful speech. My position on that issue is on the side of the Government and not on the side of the National Trust and the CPRE. However, we are not going into that today but will look at the transitional period between the old planning system and the new.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="1110176000059"></a>In Committee, I brought forward an amendment to deal with those aspects of the local development frameworks used by local authorities that made reference to regional spatial strategies that are no more. The problem I was addressing with that amendment was that, without the regional spatial strategy to which the local development frameworks referred, the validity of the whole local development framework was called into question. My amendment sought to allow local authorities, even though there was no continuing regional spatial strategy, to continue to operate as if there had been in respect of those pieces of the regional spatial strategy that they had transmitted into their own local development framework.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="1110176000060"></a>For example, Woking Council had important policy decisions in its framework that related to sustainability in Woking. However, it did not put them into its own local development framework but referred to the south-east of England plan which covered those points for it. Under the new regime there is no longer a south-east plan, and Woking Council's own local plan becomes invalid. At that stage in Committee we found ourselves with a need for my amendment because of the gap between the old system and the new, which it was suggested we could remedy by allowing a continuation

That amendment received short shrift from the Government at the time and I felt that it had not been fully appreciated when we discussed it. I was going to bring it back last week but it was bounced by an earlier government amendment which, by pre-emption, meant that mine could not be taken.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="1110176000061"></a>However, I have now brought forward Amendment 204EA, which looks at the question of the interregnum between the old system and the new system which includes the presumption of development provided projects accord with the necessary sustainability requirements. It has been said that all the existing local development framework plans and all the existing plans in the pipeline will become invalid and have to go back to square one-that they will all require evidence to be heard in public, extensive consultation, the use of an inspector and about a year's delay before anything can happen, unless we can have in that interregnum a fast-track, speeded-up process to expedite the approval of local development frameworks and local plans.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="1110176000062"></a>There is widespread anxiety that if we do not fill this gap there will be a free-for-all, with planners able to lean on the fact that there is a presumption in favour of development and to come out with all kinds of unsuitable developments. I am not saying whether or not I believe that to be true, but there is a widely held view that there will be great difficulty if councils do not have time to settle into the new system and there are not arrangements in place. The procedures for that are set out in my amendment to carry us forward from the old to the new.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="1110176000063"></a>When we did this last time, with the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, there were three years in which local authorities were enabled to catch up and move to a new system. I have heard, for example, from the 74 councils in the south-east of England, which come together in the South East England Councils group. It states:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="1110176000064"></a>The Royal Town Planning Institute, which has prepared this amendment, wants to make clear that these amendments are not designed in any way to reinstate the contents of a regional spatial strategy; they are designed to strengthen the operation of the planning system during an inevitable period of uncertainty following the major reforms that there are. I know that the Local Government Association-I have declared my interest as its president-is very keen to work with government on this. The LGA makes the point that there has clearly been severe disquiet expressed by environmental lobbies, and the media, that the Government's reforms could lead to unfettered "sustainable" development in places where local plans are not in place. To assuage these fears, government must listen to local authorities and local

The LGA pledges itself to help in that process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="1110176000065"></a>I am not at all convinced that my amendment contains the perfect way of doing this, but I am convinced that we need transitional arrangements to see us through from the old to the new. I beg to move.</p>

I very much support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Best, and what he said in his speech. In our view this is one of the important remaining issues in the planning parts of the Bill. The two amendments are about the pragmatic position of the local planning authorities. Some are faced with old plans under the pre-2004 legislation; some with emerging new plans-local development frameworks-under the 2004 Act; and some with adopted core strategies-new plans-under that Act. All of those are now up in the air as a result of the Government's wish to do away with a great deal of the previous planning guidance and instructions which local authorities had in regional strategies and in the planning policy statements. Instead those will be replaced by a much shorter document, the national planning policy framework, but that is going to take some time to approve.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="1110176000067"></a>The Government originally said that local authorities would have six months in which to adapt their local plans, whatever state they were in, to the new guidance. Frankly, they have not thought through the practical problems that this would have caused. They are now doing so, and that is extremely welcome. I am taking a lot of advice from planning authorities, from the planning world and, indeed, from Members of this House. We understand that it is now their intention to include clear guidance on how to adapt their local plans, and pursue their new local plans, in line with the NPPF. My first question is to ask the Minister if she will confirm that that is the route they are taking. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Best, would put a great deal of the detail of how this is to happen on the face of the Bill, and this would be our first choice. Transitional provisions have appeared in quite some detail in previous planning legislation. In our view this would be the best place for it, but for various practical and other reasons, the Government do not want to do that.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="1110176000068"></a>My amendment would put a duty on the Secretary of State to issue regulations which would set out the transitional arrangements. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="1110176000250"></a>"The Secretary of State may by regulations specify transitional arrangements concerning the timetable and procedures involved in the introduction of changes to local development schemes and the preparation and adoption of local development documents".</p>

<p><a name="1110176000237"></a>Regulations are stronger than guidance so we would prefer to have it in regulations rather than simply in guidance. Wherever it is, it needs to be clear and well understood. It needs to give local planning authorities the necessary flexibility and time to get it right.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="1110176000069"></a>There have been fears that local planning authorities will be left with no defences against any kind of inappropriate development as a result of some of the wording in the draft national planning policy framework, particularly the suggestion that in the absence of a  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_16"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>plan the default position on planning applications would be to approve. The noble Lord, Lord Best, said that that might be opportunistic and unplanned development. My description of it might be a bit cruder than that but I am happy to align myself with his more elegant wording there.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="1110176000070"></a>The timetable from transition is crucial. Six months is clearly ludicrous. We have heard rumours of 18 months but in practice it needs to be a lot more than that. The noble Lord suggested three years. We would perhaps go along with that. We clearly do not want it to be seven years or more, which is the position now following the 2004 Act, where half or more of the authorities have still not got their new local plans in place. My second question is about the timescale.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="1110176000071"></a>Thirdly, do the Government believe that the inspectorate will be able to deal in a practical way with the huge congestion that there will be in all this work of getting the local plans in line with the new planning guidance? How much work will be needed locally and at the inspectorate simply to get a certificate of conformity for approved core strategies? In determining planning applications during the transitional period, what reliance will local planning authorities be able to put in the mean time on approved core strategies under the 2004 Act which have not yet been certificated as compliant with the new NPPF? What reliance can they put on old, pre-2004 local plans which are still being used by many authorities as the basis for planning? As material considerations in planning application decisions, what reliance can be put on emerging core strategies which are perhaps near inspection but not there yet? What will be the relationship between these existing local plans and the emerging NPPF? Finally, what will be the relationship between the adopted NPPF and all these various kinds of uncertificated local plans?</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="1110176000072"></a>This is absolutely crucial if there is not to be a free-for-all but a smooth transition from the existing, old system to the new one. This is not in any way trying to undermine the new system but rather to make sense of converting from one system to another, which will take a number of years.</p>

I completely understand why the Government have eliminated the regional tier but there remain instances where regional decisions are particularly valuable-I would say irreplaceable-such as matters to do with housing shortages, the issue of Gypsy and Traveller sites, which we discussed at the last Committee meeting, and the lack of planning expertise at a local level which could result in really unattractive developments. If we are not to go backward in all of these areas we need a transitional period as the amendment specifies for local authorities to work out how to co-operate where it is really essential.</p>

The Government say that these difficulties will be ironed out in a new version of the amalgamated documents which will be published at some time in the future. Meanwhile there is a policy vacuum which is being only partially filled by the Secretary of State's dictum that all previous work on planning for Traveller sites has been torn up and local authorities are free to decide how many pitches for Gypsy and Traveller sites will be provided in their area, if any.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="1110176000075"></a>The result of this new-found freedom, according to research by the Irish Traveller Movement in Britain, is that roughly 50 per cent of the needs which emerged from the regional spatial strategies, the Gypsy and Traveller accommodation needs assessments, the public inquiries following those GTANAs and the redistribution between local authorities in the region-to accommodate the fact that some councils had done nothing whatever to meet the needs-have not been met. Perhaps I may just interpolate an aside here. In the new process the local authorities will only have to consider their local needs and will not have to co-operate with neighbouring authorities; and if authorities have steadfastly avoided making provision for Gypsies and Travellers in the past they will be able to demonstrate zero need because there are no Gypsies and Travellers in their particular area.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="1110176000076"></a>I see no way in which under the proposed system-and subject to what we do not know yet about the guidance that will be issued by the CLG-there will be any mechanism for adjusting that. I would like to know from my noble friend where we have got to in this process. Are we still in the position where every local authority will make up its mind irrespective of what any of the neighbours are doing? Will there be no contribution to the provision of sites for Gypsies and Travellers where a local authority can demonstrate that it has not had a need in the past because it has been successful in excluding Gypsies and Travellers from its area?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="1110176000077"></a>We in the Liberal Democratic Party made a reservation to the abolition of regionalism in our manifesto. We said that the numbers emerging from the regional spatial strategies with regard to Gypsies and Travellers should be preserved and should be the basis on which planning for Gypsies and Travellers would be effected under the new system. If we had done that we would have avoided the process that is currently being undergone all over the country as local authorities start again from scratch to consider their local needs and come up with figures which, as I say, are only 50 per cent of what had been provided where the regional process had been completed, as for example in the east of England. This will result in a severe shortage of sites in the whole country and there will be a proliferation of unauthorised sites, which is the chief source of friction between Gypsies and Travellers and the settled population. I do not know whether that is intentional but it will be the result of following the Government's present policies.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="1110176000079"></a>We need a transition period probably of three years, certainly not less than two, to provide time for proper consultation to take place. That is extremely important to win back the confidence of the public because it has been shaken on the basis of considerable amounts of misinformation having been provided. If the public had the opportunity to read the draft national planning policy framework, they would gain a lot of reassurance. The fact of the matter is that many people are disturbed and worried about what the new planning regime portends, so consultation will be particularly important. I would not want to see a truncated process of consultation in the interests of hurrying the process along unduly.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="1110176000080"></a>Time will also be needed to assist the process of co-operation between local planning authorities that will no longer be brought together under the umbrella of a regional development agency to facilitate that co-operation. We know that there are tensions-indeed, conflicts of interest-and interests that are very difficult to reconcile between different local planning authorities, so time must be allowed for that process to run its course. The inspectorate will need time, which is why I think three years rather than two years would probably be appropriate, as the noble Lord, Lord Tope, suggested in the debate last Thursday.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="1110176000081"></a>Will the Minister take this opportunity not only to say what the Government's view is about a transition period but what supplementary guidance they may be minded to offer? While the Government are entirely entitled to revisit the planning policy statements, those statements are of pretty recent origin and represent a huge amount of work that has been put in by all the relevant expert interests. It would be a shame to discard them altogether. I wonder whether the Government are minded to look at a way in which planning policy statements, appropriately modified and updated to reflect the Government's current policies, could none the less be made part of the system again so that we do not waste all that good will, expertise and very useful practical guidance that went into the development of those statements.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="1110176000082"></a>If the Government allow a three-year transition period, they will not abort the development that is so badly needed if we are again to have growth in this country because, unfortunately, the lack of confidence and available finance mean that there is not a lot of development in the pipeline. Even where the necessary confidence and funding exist, there are large numbers of extant planning permissions, so I do not think that a transition period would in any way obstruct the sustainable development that we all want to see in the interests of creating more jobs and homes and ensuring that our economy is modernised and made more powerful and effective. If the noble Baroness is able to indicate the Government's thinking in this regard, more particularly whether their thinking is positive, it would be hugely welcome.</p>

I commend both the amendments. The questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, were absolutely pertinent, and I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to answer them in some detail. They go to the heart of what local authorities are trying to do at the moment.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="1110176000084"></a>The only thing that I want to say is that we should reflect on what is happening on the ground. These may sound like extremely technical issues, but in fact local authorities, a few of which I have seen in the past week, are wrestling with all manner of different states of maturity in relation to their planning policies: some have completed LDFs, but they do not know what will constitute an up-to-date LDF because of the need to accommodate with the national planning policy framework; some have not completed their LDFs but are quite close to doing so, but they are finding, for example, that their original planning assumptions on housing are being challenged by local people and local developers. Developers are challenging some of the decisions based on the premises that preceded this situation. There is genuine confusion on the ground and a real problem with uncertainty. We all know that the most crucial elements in delivering a proper planning system are certainty and clarity.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="1110176000085"></a>The noble Lord was right to raise the issue of planning guidance. When we reflect back on PPS5, one of the reasons why it was such a successful planning statement was that it had a great deal of clear and useful planning guidance, so there is a precedent.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="1110176000086"></a>On the transitional period, I know that the Government must have at the back of their minds the fact that almost half of local authorities have not yet completed their LDF in the time available. It was a very difficult challenge that the previous Government imposed on local authorities to take on board for the first time the notion of spatial planning. Too many demands were made on the nature of the conceptualisation and on the nature of the documents, so we cannot easily extrapolate from the time that that took to the time it will take to accommodate the transitional changes. I would ask for a transitional period, but possibly not for as long as two years. I know that clarity and speed are really important and that people need to get on with it and remove the uncertainties.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="1110176000087"></a>Finally, we need to bear in mind the fact that all this is happening at a time when local authorities are losing planning staff, conservation staff and some of their most important expertise while being faced with a bank of rolling fog around how to go forward. Anything that the noble Baroness can say to reassure local authorities, and not least noble Lords, will be extremely welcome if it deals with some of these difficult issues on the absence of transitional arrangements.</p>

They are a prescription not for foot-dragging but for orderly progress, and it is essential to have that. Clarity, yes; speed, up to a point; but orderly progress is absolutely essential. There has to be a transitional period. I am sure that my noble friend the Minister will accept that. Whether or not she accepts the amendments, it is incumbent on the Government to explain to us that there will be proper transition and that we are not plunged from one situation into another. The fact that so many authorities do not have plans gives us all cause for concern. There has to be proper time to put those plans together.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="1110176000089"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, was right to indicate that this is not the easiest of times for local authorities. Many have laid off staff and have not replaced conservation officers and people who did a vital job. In my local authority of South Staffordshire, which had an admirable record on these matters, the absolutely first-class conservation officer took early retirement in the early part of last year and has not been replaced. The local authority is trying to replace the work that he did, but without him it is not easy. For every possible reason, therefore, I ask the Minister to let us have a period of orderly transition and progress, so that if we are trying to create a better situation, we do not confound our own efforts by over-haste. Once again, there is good sense in the motto that I have quoted in this House before: festina lente.</p>

The thought has been raised in this House and outside that this is what the Government intend with this Bill. Along with my noble friend Lord Cormack, I find myself worried. I do not understand how this transition is to be managed: how we are to get from a position where there are not valid local plans in a large number of local authorities to the position where there are, without there being a succession of undesirable planning permissions given. The core of this Bill is to allow localities to determine what happens in their areas. It would be most unfortunate if we had a period where an awful lot of bad will was created by the exact opposite happening, just because some superior authority had failed to get the ducks in a row.</p>

One of them, as has already been touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, is the corpus of knowledge that is currently involved in the planning system.

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="1110176000094"></a>My last point is to do with neighbourhood plans. I must declare another interest here as the president of the National Association of Local Councils, whose member parish and town councils may be those very bodies that are having to draw up a neighbourhood plan. A neighbourhood plan has to be in conformity with the principal authority's local plan, and if the principal authority's local plan is not in place, or is in disarray or is out of date, then we have a problem. This has a knock-on effect. I ask the Minister to give the House some reassurance that there is going to be some sort of seamless transition that will take place. I do not wish to add to what has already been said about the timescale over which that is to be done; and there may be different timescales for different bits for all I know, but the transition does have to be, to some degree, seamless. With regard to my first point about the economics of doubt, it is very important that we get this right.</p>

Like the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, I believe that this is probably the most serious issue left unresolved from Part 5 of the Bill. We hope that we will get a clear message from the Minister today. We added our name to the original amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Best, which bit the dust by being pre-empted, and we support the thrust of the amendments of the noble Lords, Lord Best and Lord Greaves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="1110176000096"></a>It is imperative that we avoid a lacuna, with the prospect of all or most local plans being absent, silent or indeterminate or having policies that are out of date under the current NPPF formulation. Under the presumption in favour of development, this would lead to an emphasis on approving development proposals unless the adverse impacts of development would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits when assessed against the framework policies. I assert that 50-odd pages of framework cannot be an effective substitute for all the local plans and the thousands of pages of guidance that currently exist.</p>

Also, the Inspectorate will have to look at everyone's CIL frameworks ... the Inspectorate will be under operational pressure ... and developers will be seeking to use the vacuum in policy (combined with the presumption in favour of sustainable development) to get consents which they

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="1110176000098"></a>This is a very serious issue, so the Bill cannot be left as it is. The minimum that we want to hear from the Government is that they will support effective transitional provisions and, after discussion in which I hope we can all be involved, bring forward amendments at Third Reading. I say to noble Lords who tabled the amendments in this group that they should bring them back at Third Reading if the Government do not.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="1110176000099"></a>The Government's amendments to Clause 97 that were moved last week hold out the prospect that existing regional spatial strategies and saved structure plan policies will not be revoked until an environmental assessment of the revocation has been undertaken. Perhaps the Minister will explain the position in the interim. Regional spatial strategies and saved structure plan policies could mean that some local authorities will have a core strategy that is effectively complete in the light of those strategies, or intact subject only to the NPPF. Of course, we do not know when the NPPF will be finalised. Will the presumption operate only when that happens? If the presumption is to predate the demise of some or all of the regional spatial strategies, will the NPPF prevail nevertheless? If not, there will be parts of the country where regional spatial strategies will prevail and parts where they will not because they were never completed or because they have been separately revoked. Clearly, there must be a robust transition in place to cover this and myriad other points that noble Lords have raised in the debate. We support the amendments in this group.</p>

It seems that the central issue is the maintenance of up-to-date local plans. They are absolutely essential to set out communities' aspirations for the development of their areas. We are clear that the early review of plans will be the way forward to help manage transitions and deal with local issues arising from, ultimately, the revocation of regional strategies and the introduction of the national planning policy framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="1110176000101"></a>All of this has been about transitional arrangements. First, these need to be thought through very carefully. Secondly, my honourable friend at the other end has committed us to having transitional arrangements in policy and, where necessary, in guidance. Therefore, consideration to this is already being given. However, I am bound to say that this point has also been raised in the consultation on the NPPF, so the request of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, that we should come back at Third Reading may not be one on which I can deliver, because consideration may not have been given to what the full-blown transitional arrangements are going to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="1110176000102"></a>It has been said that not all local authorities have local development plans. In fact 46 per cent do not and they have had more than eight years to produce them. The worry is that if you time limit a transitional  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_23"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 23</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>period in some way you are back exactly where we started before, that people do not pay the slightest attention. They think that they have got a long time to do it and they do not actually do it. It is absolutely essential that we put pressure on local authorities to get their local development plans completed and to get them up to date.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="1110176000103"></a>It may be helpful if I take this opportunity to clarify that the status of local plans will not change when the final national planning policy framework comes into force. Local plans will always be part of the statutory development plan and that is the first port of call for all decisions. As now, decision-makers are able to give weight to emerging plans in planning decisions and that weight will depend on how far these plans have progressed. Therefore, they are capable of being used to help planning decisions wherever they stand at the moment. Nor do our proposals change the situation for authorities who do not have a plan. Such authorities, because they do not have a plan, already have to have regard to all material considerations in their decisions. That will often include national policy. Areas without a local plan are lacking strategic community oversight, and the introduction of the national planning policy framework does not change this position.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="1110176000104"></a>As I have said, it is of course open to local councils to decide when they should update their local plans. It is in fact entirely a matter for them, but they are going to be under some pressure if they want to ensure that they have conformity with the national planning policy framework and that they are able to progress their plans in the most up-to-date way.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="1110176000105"></a>Transition is going to be helped by councils drawing on evidence that informed the preparation of regional strategies. We understand that that will need to go across. They will need to do that to support their local planning policies, supplemented as needed by up-to-date local evidence. If there are issues that councils regard as being an essential part of the development plan for the purpose of determining planning applications they must undertake an early review and work with local communities as they would be expected to do anyway.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="1110176000106"></a>With regard to the national planning policy framework, consultation ended yesterday and, as we said in our debate last week, this has now got to come under consideration. We have listened to the views of local government and we have said that we will put in place transitional arrangements that advantage plan making to reflect the fact that the national planning policy framework is all about putting local communities in control of planning. But the framework is policy, not legislation, as I discussed at some length on Thursday. Any transitional measures will be more appropriately delivered through policy or guidance rather than legislation. I suggested that we may not be able to come back with this at Third Reading, though it is a matter that I will take away. It looks very much as if we will be able to issue guidance within a timescale which we may be able to save.</p>

We actually expect that many elements of local plans will already conform with the direction of that because the policy framework in fact reflects all the guidance and planning policy statements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="1110176000108"></a>I was asked a number of questions and I think that I have answered some of them on the way. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, asked whether there will be regulations and guidance. There will be guidance through the NPPF, but we will need to find out when that will happen.</p>

She will recall that in the debate last Thursday, the noble Lord, Lord Hart of Chilton, an experienced member of the planning bar, made the point, as did other noble Lords, including me, that the higher the level of generalisation in the national planning policy framework short document, the greater the risk of litigation. He thought that where there was litigation, the courts would take into account the planning policy statements, even if the Government have removed their formal status as policy documents, in default of other clear guidance. Therefore, de facto, the planning policy statements are going to have a status. They are still going to be a force on this scene. Would it not therefore be preferable for the Government to recognise that and embrace them in some appropriate form, given that the high level and major planning policy document will be the national planning policy framework?</p>

I should like to go back to the question of whether the PPS and PPG are going form part of it. I suspect that this is all part of the consultation about how much background is going to be needed and how those planning policy statements are going to be included. I will come back to that by Third Reading because I do not have the direct answer at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="1110176000111"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Greaves and Lord Best, asked about the timescale. I have already said that I do not think we will be putting in a firm timescale. We expect the changes to take place as soon as possible, and we hope that local councils will get a move on with them. I think I said that the transition is going to be helped by drawing on evidence that informed the preparation of the regional strategy, and part of that will be the PPS and PPG. The NPPF will supersede the PPS and PPG, but they stay in place unless and until the Government revoke them.</p>

If in the interim the NPPF is introduced with its presumption in favour of sustainable development, those two will not be identical.

They will also have to have regard to the emerging NPPF in determining a planning application. Unless they conflict wildly, that should work very well. There is going to be a short period only before the regional strategies are revoked. I do not think there will be any inconsistency. Local authorities are going to want to keep only part of the regional strategies in their local development plan and they ought to be able to work in conjunction with the NPPF for the short space of time, if that is necessary.</p>

The transitional arrangements will come about as a result of the consultation on the NPPF. The noble Lord thinks that a set period might be a good idea.

However, it would be very helpful before we get to Third Reading if the Minister were able to share her thoughts and put a bit more flesh on the bones of how these transitional arrangements may work. In particular, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has said, perhaps she could give us a little more  specificity-if I have got that right-and be a little more definite on the timescales that local authorities will be expected to adopt-indeed, timescales that are reasonable in the circumstances and allow sensible things to happen.</p>

First, any body to which funds are passed under new Section 216A will benefit from these wider spending powers. Secondly, where a charging authority does not have to pass funds under Section 216A, we will have the power to specify that they can use a proportion of the CIL funds in this way. It is our

The remainder of the funds will be retained by the local authority and must be used to support development of the wider area by funding the provision, improvement, replacement, operation or maintenance of infrastructure.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="1110176000129"></a>Our amendments will allow receipts raised from new development to be applied to the range of costs that it creates. They strike the right balance between enabling funds to be directed to the localised demands that development places on the areas that host it and the cumulative burdens that development creates across the local authority and wider area. The levy is to support new development. While the provision of infrastructure is essential to physically unlock new development, it is not the only matter that needs to be addressed to make development acceptable and sustainable to the communities that are asked to host it.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="1110176000130"></a>At the neighbourhood level, the impacts of development are more localised, direct and diverse. The impacts will, for the most part, be concerned with local infrastructure, but communities often identify other unfunded pressures on local services as the reason why new development is not acceptable. If communities are to accept and welcome growth, they must be satisfied that they will not suffer as a result of doing so. By placing a meaningful proportion of the contribution that new development makes under the control of the community that hosts it, and by giving that community the flexibility to spend those funds on the matters that it identifies need to be addressed, we will ensure that communities share in the benefits of growth rather than suffer as a result of it. When residents see and understand that development is making a fair contribution towards meeting the demands that it places on their communities, they will be more likely to accept and, indeed, welcome it.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="1110176000131"></a>Our amendments will enable the levy to support new development more effectively. The levy will mean that more development can go ahead by providing a valuable contribution towards delivering the infrastructure needed to unlock and enable it, and by ensuring that communities have reasons to say yes to growth. In making our changes we have taken the opportunity to make economic viability an explicit component of the purpose of the instrument. This will mean that local authorities must ensure that charges are reasonable and do not prejudice the delivery of their local plans, including matters such as affordable housing.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="1110176000132"></a>My noble friend Lord Jenkin has tabled Amendments 204H and 204J, which are concerned with restricting spending of the levy to matters publicly identified by the local authority that charges it. It may be helpful to the House if I use his amendments as a peg to provide further reassurance. I fully understand my noble friend's concern to ensure that use of the levy should be transparent; indeed, it must be if developers and communities are to see and understand how the contributions are being used to support development and manage its impacts. That is why we are strengthening, through the levy and the town and country planning regulations, the requirement for local authorities to report openly and regularly on levy income and expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="1110176000133"></a>Our experience from the front runners scheme, which is supporting more than 33 local authorities to implement the levy, is that local authorities are in any case choosing to publish a list of their spending intentions. This demonstrates that a flexible approach to infrastructure lists is working and that a more prescriptive approach is not needed at this time. The legislation already allows for regulations to require them to do so, should we wish to in the future.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="1110176000134"></a>I appreciate my noble friend's concerns, but I hope that he will be reassured by the steps that we are taking to improve transparency and accountability of levy income and expenditure, agrees that our changes are the right means to achieve that, and will be willing not to pursue his amendments. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="1110176000135"></a><b><a name="111017-0001.htm_spnew76"></a><a name="1110176000402"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend for the care with which he has set out these quite significant changes to the whole process of charging and applying the community infrastructure levy-or CIL, as he called it. We have moved a long way from the original intention of the CIL. In the Planning Act 2008, Section 205 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="1110176000255"></a>"In making the regulations the Secretary of State shall aim to ensure that the overall purpose of CIL is to ensure that costs incurred in providing infrastructure to support the development of an area can be funded ... by owners or developers of land".</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="1110176000136"></a>It was perfectly clear to those of us who debated those provisions during the passage of the Planning Act 2008 what the previous Government were looking at. For instance, if you build a large housing estate, that is going to involve the building of roads. It may well involve the provision of a new school, and a number of other capital infrastructure measures that are necessary to support the community that will be enlarged by the main application when it is allowed and when it takes place.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="1110176000137"></a>It is quite clear from what my noble friend has said that we are moving a long way from that. It has caused a good deal of concern among those who are anxious to champion the promotion of more infrastructure. The British Property Federation, referring to what he called a "raft of new amendments", has said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="1110176000256"></a>"The upgrading of the country's infrastructure is vital for our future economic success and the contribution from CIL will be a critical part of that at a time when public funding is heavily constrained".</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="1110176000138"></a>The letter that I had from my noble friend Lady Hanham, dated 7 October-just a few days ago-makes it perfectly clear that, under the new arrangements proposed, the CIL is not limited to providing infrastructure. Having set out the proposals, she writes:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="1110176000257"></a>"We have concluded that spending at the local authority level must continue to be directed to the provision of infrastructure".</p>

<p><a name="1110176000139"></a>I will press a little further on that in a moment. She continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="1110176000258"></a>"However, at the neighbourhood and community level the demands and concerns amongst local people that new development creates are more diverse, direct and localised".</p>

<p><a name="1110176000140"></a>She then refers to the amendments which my noble friend has just spoken to. She goes on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="1110176000259"></a>"We believe this change is vital if we are to genuinely change attitudes to new development and secure sustainable growth".</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_30"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="1110176000141"></a>Changing attitudes is quite a long way from building capital infrastructure. It has changed the nature of what the CIL was originally introduced to achieve.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="1110176000142"></a>It may be that, in the new planning regime, it will be desirable to provide means whereby local communities can feel that they are getting some benefit. This may not take the form of schools or roads but may be some other form of benefit that will compensate them for the impact of the development to which they might otherwise have been opposed. I have always quoted the example of the French electricity system; if you want to build a new power station, in order to reconcile the local population to having to put up with that-after all it involves substantial interference in their normal lives, not only during the building but during the operation-they get electricity at a cheaper rate. That seems to me to be a very sensible thing to do. I am therefore not opposed to the idea that we need to provide something that will secure the consent, as my noble friend was saying, of the local community to the development that is being imposed upon them and to which they might have been quite vigorously opposed.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="1110176000143"></a>However, one point that I want to emphasise is still unclear, and I would welcome it if my noble friend could clarify this when he winds up. If councils in spending the CIL are confined to providing infrastructure, which is what I understood him to say and what my noble friend Lady Hanham said in her letter, spending at the local authority level must continue to be directed to the provision of infrastructure. That is fine, but then we are faced with the proposition that a "meaningful proportion" of the proceeds of the CIL, which is charged on the developer, can be devolved to the local parish or community, which, as I understand it, is free to spend it on anything it thinks would improve the condition of the community. What is a "meaningful proportion"? As I understand it, a local authority will be perfectly free to say, "We don't think any more roads are necessary or that we need to build a new school, or anything like that, and therefore 100 per cent of the CIL for this particular development is going to be devolved to the local parish or community to spend as it wishes".</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="1110176000144"></a>I made the point previously in Committee that the CIL must not simply be used as a way of filling the gaps in local authority spending. It is not intended for that. It is intended to balance the provision of a planning application for a new structure of some sort with the infrastructure that is necessary for it. I have of course accepted that that must include the operation, maintenance and upkeep of the infrastructure, a matter that we discussed at length in Committee, but is there no limit to what the devolved body, parish, community or whatever it is can spend of the "meaningful proportion" that is delegated to it?</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="1110176000145"></a>There is a good deal of concern about this among various bodies. The County Surveyors' Society, which I understand is now called ADEPT, the British Chambers of Commerce, the British Property Federation, the Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation and the local government tactical advisers group have all expressed the concern that this seems to be slipping away to the point at which it is simply providing inducements-I will not use the word "bribes"-to  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_31"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 31</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>persuade a local community that it would be to its advantage to cease to oppose a planning application. I hope that my noble friend will be able to give me some reassurance that it is not intended to go as far as that, but there will have to be some specific measures.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="1110176000146"></a>I come to my two amendments, on which my noble friend has given his views. Amendment 204H would make a minor change to replace "may" with "must", and would compel planning authorities to outline the infrastructure that they actually intend to support through CIL. If local authorities are going to have to confine their spending of CIL to infrastructure, I see no reason why they should not be instructed by the Act to outline the infrastructure they intend to support. Amendment 204J is also intended to link the evidence base used to justify an area's CIL charging schedule to the levy's actual expenditure. As I think my noble friend recognised, these are both intended to add to the transparency of the application of what CIL is: a tax on development. So far as local authorities are concerned, I see no reason why both these amendments should not be applied to them.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="1110176000147"></a>That leaves the "meaningful proportion" that is to be spent by other people. At the moment I feel that it is wide open for them to decide more or less what they would like to spend it on. I cannot believe that that is a wise way to spend the proceeds of what is in fact a tax. I hope that my noble friend can reassure me on this, but I have to tell him that there is a good deal of apprehension out there. He has told me that he has come under a lot of pressure from local authority and other community interests, which are saying that this sort of thing is necessary in order to reconcile people to new development in their area. But there must be some sort of limit on it, and I am not sure that the government amendments moved by my noble friend and the explanation set out in my noble friend's letter of 7 October give that reassurance. I hope that my noble friend will be able to allay my anxieties.</p>

<a name="1110176000148"></a><b><a name="111017-0001.htm_spnew77"></a><a name="1110176000403"></a>Lord Shipley:</b> My Lords, I agree with my noble friend Lord Jenkin on the need to be clearer on the gain to neighbourhoods and parishes from the community infrastructure levy. Whether that is done in the Bill, through guidance or by other means, it will be extremely important that local people in neighbourhood areas where development is taking place understand what the community gain might be as a consequence of that development.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="1110176000149"></a>My point is a parallel issue which relates to the duty to co-operate. It is implicit in the Bill that there is a duty to co-operate between councils on the community infrastructure levy. However, I am not certain that it is sufficiently explicit and in urban areas where there are boundaries between different local authorities, a development that could take place wholly in one council area might well impact upon the infrastructure and the wellbeing of one or more neighbouring council areas. To what extent should we make it explicit that there should be a duty to co-operate between local authorities on the community infrastructure levy where a development is taking place very close to a boundary? That will need to be clear, certainly by Third Reading, otherwise there could be a great deal of strain between

<a name="1110176000150"></a><b><a name="111017-0001.htm_spnew78"></a><a name="1110176000404"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, we share some of the concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and have some sympathy with his amendments. When we discussed this issue at Committee I thought we had established that, as previously structured, CIL gave quite a lot of scope for supporting local communities beyond what one might think of as the very strict interpretation of infrastructure, but this seems to be taking us a step further. The letter that I had from the noble Baroness was, I think, generally circulated and says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="1110176000260"></a>"We are proposing amendments that would allow local authorities and parish and community councils to use this proportion of the funds to support development by providing infrastructure or addressing any other matter necessary to address the demands that new development places on the local area".</p>

<p><a name="1110176000151"></a>This is potentially a very wide extension of what it was anticipated that CIL would be used for.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="1110176000152"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Shipley, raises a different point about what happens with adjoining authorities and how that fits together with the duty to co-operate. We also need to consider how this sort of formulation fits together with Clause 130, which we are going to discuss in due course. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said that he would not go so far as to call this a bribe, but it is potentially a substantial inducement to an area to accept development and we need to reflect on that as well. Having expressed concerns about the possible dilution of funding for infrastructure, which is needed up and down our country, I pose the question that we raised when we covered it in Committee-my apologies to the Minister if he covered it-about the prospect of CIL being used for affordable housing. I am not sure where that discussion has gone, but there have been some real questions asked about the extension of CIL which takes it beyond its original intent. The new intent is not necessarily bad, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, but we need to reflect on what it means for the funding that is available for infrastructure in an area.</p>

Responding first to my noble friend Lord Jenkin, yes, we have moved a long way with the community infrastructure levy. My noble friend talked about Section 205 and the restrictions on the application of CIL. He is accurate in terms of history but he will recognise the need to develop good policies as time goes on. He kindly organised a meeting between me, him and the Institution of Civil Engineers, which I found useful.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="1110176000154"></a>My noble friend referred to local needs and to changing attitudes. We need to change attitudes because, quite often, the knee-jerk reaction can often be "no", and that is not helpful for development. Local authorities are best placed to determine the infrastructure need in terms of logistics and so on, but local communities are best placed to determine their much more local needs.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="1110176000155"></a>My noble friend asked what a meaningful proportion of CIL is. We are consulting on the matter and have invited views on the question. We have not taken a  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_33"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>view on this and will carefully consider the representations made during the consultation period before determining the proportion of funds that should be directed to neighbourhoods that host new development. However, we are clear that the level must be sufficient to give neighbourhoods a meaningful contribution to meeting the impacts of development in their area. This needs to be balanced with the central purpose of the levy, which is to ensure that some or all of the costs of supporting new development are met by the developers.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="1110176000156"></a>My noble friend also asked whether there was any limit on how a meaningful proportion must be used. Our changes allow for a proportion of CIL receipts to support development of parish and neighbourhood areas by providing either infrastructure or anything else that is concerned with meeting the demands that the development places on the area. However, the spending must support development of the area. It may not be used to fill gaps in local authority resources. I am happy to give that reassurance.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="1110176000157"></a>We are making this change because new development creates local demands that are concerned with matters other than infrastructure. For instance, the provision of new dwellings will increase the population of an area and new or extended office premises will increase the number of people working in an area. Increased numbers of residents or people coming into an area to work will create demands on services in the area, including transport, training, education, health, social and other services, community assets and utilities.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="1110176000158"></a>My noble friend Lord Shipley asked about cross-boundary needs in urban areas. It is a good question but I shall have to write to him before Third Reading.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="1110176000159"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, asked about affordable housing. When setting a CIL charge a local authority must have regard to the viability of development in its area. In considering this viability, the local authority must take into account requirements normally provided for through Section 106-for instance, affordable housing-that will arise from the development. My noble friend will recall that we have tightened up on the use of Section 106.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="1110176000160"></a>The statutory framework for CIL provides for protection for affordable housing. This was, no doubt, in the minds of the previous Administration when they implemented the levy. However, we acknowledge that the guidance does not set this out as clearly and robustly as it could. We will revisit the guidance to make it clear that the imposition of a levy must not harm the delivery of affordable housing or other local policies set out in the local plan. I have asked my officials to work with the National Housing Federation to develop appropriate changes and we will reflect on the outcome in updated guidance from the Secretary of State. We are consulting on whether to allow CIL receipts to be used to fund affordable housing. We have asked for views on whether this approach could support local delivery of affordable housing by improving outcomes and offering better value for money. We will determine whether to make the change once we have received and considered the responses.</p>

We are actually slightly unusual in having a regional plan that is going to stay in place, and also an adopted core strategy. We are now very actively involved with local communities in trying to create what we call "village plans", but for the sake of this argument I will call "neighbourhood plans". I do not think we need to be told by a government Bill how to go about this. I hope that does not sound too vainglorious.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="1110176000169"></a>I am a strong supporter of giving people the opportunity, and where opportunity is not given the right and the power, to directly influence decisions affecting their lives. Nothing in the amendment before the House detracts from that. My noble friend has been an absolutely admirable listener on this Bill. The Government have made major changes, on shadow mayors, EU fines, referendums, the right to challenge and on assets of community value. I do not ask for sweeping change on neighbourhood planning. I support the Government's wish to have local involvement in  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_37"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the planning system. Most other council leaders also support that and many already practise it. In many of our views, planning led from the bottom up is essential. My amendment does nothing to stop the Government's objective there.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="1110176000170"></a>I also recognise the Government's wish to have back-stop-as I think it should be-regulation to enable local public engagement with planning where that is not happening. That may be necessary where communities are systematically excluded from having a voice in planning. Of course they should have a voice, and that inspiration behind the Bill is right. My amendment does nothing to stop that. The amendment proposes a system that allows the Secretary of State to permit local variety and discretion-that is, more localism and, I would argue, more trust in the best-performing local authorities.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="1110176000171"></a>On neighbourhood planning so far in the Bill, the Government have set down one model in the rather compendious schedules. Surely councils that are engaged in local neighbourhood planning can be approved, indeed encouraged, to go on doing so in their own way. My amendment also seeks to allow that, if other local authorities have a scheme for neighbourhood planning to do the job in ways that do not coincide in every dot and comma with what is in these labyrinthine schedules, they can be given the go-ahead and frankly be spared the constant potential challenge to react to a parallel national regulatory model at the same time. We have to go on from where we are now and from where we started. With a more permissive approach, we might even learn something from the differing approaches of differing councils and communities, with different sizes and places, run by people often with different views. A more permissive approach goes with the spirit of the Bill and in no way against it.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="1110176000172"></a>If there is in place a solid, reputable process in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, of local people have become engaged, why in principle should that local authority and those local communities be caught up with having to consider or fend off demands to set up a neighbourhood forum from what may be groups of as few as 21 people? As we argued in Committee, these may sometimes even be malcontents who have lost out in community debates, perhaps people who even court rejection by the council as a device to gain publicity. That is not necessary in the ideal world. I fear we may confuse the means of how to do this with the ends, on which I sense there is wide agreement in the House.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="1110176000173"></a>I set out in Committee a number of detailed aspects in the Bill's area planning procedures that I do not understand. In particular, I do not understand why, under new Section 61G(2) that Schedule 9 to the Bill will insert into the 1990 Act, a local authority can designate neighbourhood areas only where a would-be forum asks for one. Why on earth can a council, informed by its knowledge of local events and the surveys it has done with local people, not go ahead and designate its own neighbourhood areas? I do not see why urban neighbourhood planning has to be done through forums that, by definition, are made up of the few rather than the many in any given area. I have argued in various places that the default position

The best body for facilitating that is the elected authority, of whatever size or nature, if it operates well.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="1110176000174"></a>I have not tabled again the amendments that I tabled in Committee that dealt with a number of those issues. I hope that my noble friend the Minister may even now be able to reflect on them and clarify some of those detailed points as we move towards Third Reading. They are embraced within the case for allowing different approaches made in the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="1110176000175"></a>In concluding, I must emphasise that my proposal is not made from the standpoint of one who opposes the Bill. It is made on the basis of active commitment and experience, as with many other noble Lords who spoke, in seeking to put the principles of this Bill into practice. From that standpoint I must say-and I have had this from a number of other council leader colleagues-that the creation or imposition of a parallel system of challenge by would-be forums will in some cases not be a help but potentially a hindrance.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="1110176000176"></a>When the principle of allowing the best performing authorities freedom to do local planning in their own way was debated in Committee, I felt I had wide support from various parts of the House. I have been very grateful for discussions and conversations with Mr Greg Clark and with my noble friend and I am perfectly ready to accept that my amendment may not be the perfect route. It may indeed be that devising an exemption system run by the Secretary of State would create its own complexities. It may be that the operation of the system in this Bill, given the undesirability of seeking to run two parallel systems together, can be clarified in the guidance we hear about. I apologise that I have not had an opportunity to study in detail the draft guidance I hear has been published.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="1110176000177"></a>One way or another my fundamental plea, in which I am grateful for the backing of London Councils, is that local authorities engaged in robust neighbourhood planning should not also have to grapple with the parallel legislative and regulatory framework currently enshrined in the Bill. I believe, I hope not naively, that freedom would encourage and stimulate the best councils to be leaders in neighbourhood planning. I believe, and I know from our conversations, that my noble friend and her right honourable and honourable friends share that commitment to localism and neighbourhood planning, and so I hope even now that the Government may be able to offer some more flexible way forward on this very difficult, but I believe important, matter. I beg to move.</p>

I do not want to repeat everything he said about the common sense of building on existing successful systems and structures rather than trying either to set up a separate parallel structure, as the noble Lord suggested may well happen, or alternatively closing down something that exists or trying to transform it into a template imposed from on high.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_39"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="111017-0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="1110176000179"></a>I have been involved in the idea of getting people in communities to take a much greater involvement in local affairs generally, and in planning specifically, for about 40 years now. Forty years ago, when some of us started to talk like this, we met total opposition, and indeed hostility, from almost everybody else in British politics outside the Liberal Party at that time. Opinion has so changed that we have won the argument over those years. The last Labour Government talked about double devolution-central government devolving powers, and perhaps even resources, to local authorities and the local authorities devolving them to "communities". It never actually happened very much but there was a lot of talk about it.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="1110176000180"></a>In the present Government we have had the idea of the big society coming from the Conservatives and, separately really but perhaps as part of that-I have never really been quite sure-the idea of neighbourhood planning, which is a very strong part of this Bill. Always, mechanisms are difficult because there are always the questions: "What is a community?" and "Who are the big society?". Many of us have argued for a long time that, on a democratic basis, the default position is: "The many, not the few", as the noble Lord, Lord True, said. A neighbourhood is a clearly definable entity, unlike a community which is much more difficult to define as you may have several communities in a neighbourhood. In a neighbourhood you start off from the basis that everybody who lives there is a member of that neighbourhood and you build it from the bottom upwards. Of course, some do not want to take part in it but that is up to them.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="1110176000181"></a>As regards who in the neighbourhood area takes part, lots of councils of pretty well all dispositions have been working hard on this idea in their patches. In a truly localist way, they are approaching the matter in different ways that are appropriate to their area, the ideas of the people who live in that area and, indeed, the people on the local authority, so the systems that exist in many parts of the country are different. There are obviously similarities but, basically, each area has built its own system according to its own circumstances: the noble Lord waxes lyrical about Richmond; my noble friend Lord Tope could wax equally lyrical about Sutton; and I could go on for ever about attempts to do all this in Pendle, some of which have been very successful. Many others could make similar remarks, but the systems are all different.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="1110176000182"></a>However, the real problem arises when central government comes along and, in order to do something which is very worth while, imposes a national template on very different systems. Where there is nothing at all, that is a good way to tackle this matter as at least you get people going. However, where measures exist on the ground, it is counterproductive and, indeed, ridiculous to force people to spend a lot of time either closing something down in order to start something else up or, indeed, trying to adjust and adapt to the new rules and regulations coming from on high. Therefore, I very much support this amendment. If nothing else, I hope that the Government will be rather more flexible in carrying out this measure than seems to be the case at the moment.</p>

I was sorry that I was not able to be present, but then the amendment was not reached. We have now reached it and I am per contra glad to be here to add my support for what my noble friend has proposed. However, I am very conscious that the word on the street is that everybody wants to see the back of this wretched Bill today, even though it is less wretched than it was before my noble friend started amending it, and I do not want to delay the House. Indeed, I may shortly put myself beyond temptation in order to avoid doing so later.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="1110176000184"></a>Meanwhile, the House is already aware that I think this Bill is misnamed. Certainly, as it started, it was not a Localism Bill but a centralism Bill because "localism" meant what the Secretary of State said that it meant, not what local authorities decided that it meant. This debate is essentially on that very point.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="1110176000185"></a>I do not pretend to wish to defend the detail of the amendment, any more than my noble friend did. However, its fundamental thrust is that, where satisfactory local arrangements to achieve the Government's objective exist, the Government should not stamp on them and insist that they are replaced with a template-I repeat the word used by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves-imposed from the centre. I cannot see any sense in that. It is the opposite of localism and common sense, and the Government need to look at it again.</p>

<a name="1110176000186"></a><b><a name="111017-0001.htm_spnew92"></a><a name="1110176000419"></a>Lord Lucas:</b> My Lords, I entirely support my noble friend's amendment for two principal reasons. One is that local authorities can game the system anyway-all they do is get their councillors to get a group of 20 members round locally and kick off the process that is in the Bill. That will be an expensive and tiresome way of doing it and will result in councils being divided up on ward boundaries, which is not perhaps the right way of doing it because wards have been created for equality of size and electoral convenience rather than to encompass natural communities.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="1110176000187"></a>My other reason for supporting the amendment is that it is the best hope-despite all the other hopes that I shall express later in respect of my amendments-of getting the Bill to work in cities. As it stands, the Bill has very little to offer a city community. What a city wants, by and large, is the local application of the policies of its council rather than a hand in planning, where in a built-out environment there is very little to offer. Co-operation and working with the council to establish the area that is a neighbourhood will be a great deal easier if that comes from the council rather than a community that does not exist and has no momentum or reason to create itself. The whole process of creating neighbourhoods will happen much better in cities when guided by councils. If we consider not just relatively easy parts, such as Lavender Hill, but areas where communities are at loggerheads, how the system set out in the Bill will work when it will merely become a vehicle for neighbourhood power struggles rather than anything really creative, is beyond me. The department needs to get a grip on the question of cities, particularly inner-cities, and how we are to bring the benefits of the Bill to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="1110176000188"></a>My noble friend's amendment seems to address this most constructively, and I hope that the department, even at this stage, will start to pay some attention to that. We all had a wake-up in our holidays and reappeared here when we suddenly discovered that communities in cities were not as strong as we might have liked to hope. This is the "Department for Communities" and it ought to be doing something, but it is not, I am sad to say.</p>

I was almost there when the noble Lord, Lord True, had finished his introduction. Let me say, first, that a world in which the noble Lord, Lord Newton, is beyond temptation is not something that I wish to contemplate.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="1110176000190"></a>We accept entirely the thrust of the proposition of the noble Lord, Lord True. If you have robust engagement with communities that works and delivers, why tear that up and replace it with something else? However, there is a conundrum. What will the process be by which we say that not only is the existing process sufficient but we have to withdraw from parish councils the other opportunities that are provided in the Bill in respect of the creation of neighbourhood forums? One might read the proposition in the noble Lord's amendment to say that that has to be decided between local authorities and the Secretary of State. Of course, that would leave out the voices of the community.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="1110176000191"></a>I agree with what the amendment is trying to achieve, but-perhaps the noble Lord has simply truncated his presentation and has thought this through-how you decide whether what is working locally is sufficient such that you will not apply those other provisions in the Bill is a question that needs to be answered. One could not disagree with the proposition that, if you have good engagement at the moment in a variety of different circumstances across the country-particularly important is the issue of urban communities, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said-that should be preserved. How you do it and how you switch off the other mechanisms is key.</p>

I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, for putting his finger on one of the conundrums. One would have to decide how you work out how a local authority is doing it better than anyone else. That is perhaps something that will have to be decided anyway in the course of the process that has been laid out.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="1110176000193"></a>This amendment would allow a local authority to make a neighbourhood plan or order without a referendum being held or a neighbourhood forum being established. The basis on which this decision would be made is whether the local authority has an adequate process of neighbourhood engagement-I am not quite sure that that is how my noble friend put it, but I think that that is what it means-to enable the formation of neighbourhood plans. It is, as he suggested, a permissive approach. Whether this process is adequate will be determined, as the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, has said, by the Secretary of State-which is not a terribly localist aspiration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="1110176000194"></a>The effect of the amendment would be to give a very significant degree of power to the Secretary of State. I wonder whether that is entirely what is wanted. The Secretary of State would be allowed to control the neighbourhood planning process and bypass the referendum stage, because he would have to agree whether a local council is well advanced in what it was doing. I fully appreciate, however, the noble Lord's concerns about the delay in holding a referendum on a neighbourhood plan or the way that it can be demonstrably shown that the local planning authority and the community at large are content for the neighbourhood plan or order to come into force.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="1110176000195"></a>I have previously said that, under the current proposals, if the local authority and the neighbourhood forum, or parish council, are in agreement over proposals, they have the option of using development plan documents, supplementary planning documents and local development orders to take forward the policies, or give permission to developers, without the need for a referendum. Where this is not the case, it is essential that the neighbourhood plan has the support of those who have a real interest in the planning of the neighbourhood area and the proposals that are developed. There is a project here for local people to get involved in what their own areas are going to look like. This support needs to be clearly demonstrated. A referendum will give everyone in the community the opportunity to have their say and demonstrate evidence of community support in a manner which cannot be demonstrated through a petition or consultation.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="1110176000196"></a>The referendum in that situation-where you have the neighbourhood forum-is important in retaining the credibility of the principle that this is a community-led system, with the local planning authority's role being one of facilitating and enabling the community to draw up plans at the neighbourhood level.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="1110176000197"></a>We have previously discussed the fact that no neighbourhood has to have a forum. It is not a requirement. If a neighbourhood does not want to have a forum and it is happy to rely on the local development plan or local development orders, that is perfectly permissible. There is nothing to stop that at all. But this moves me on to my noble friend's concerns-which he has raised on several occasions-about the situation where there are established groups in the local authority and where the authority already has well advanced plans.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="1110176000198"></a>I hope my noble friend will accept if I say that I will undertake to look again- without making any commitment at this stage-at the position which he has described, with a view to possibly returning to the matter at Third Reading. This is not an easy matter, but we ought to allow the opportunity to have a last look at it, before this Bill passes from this House.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="1110176000199"></a>I hope with that reassurance, and the undertaking, of course, to talk to him and to other Members of the House who are interested before Third Reading, he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I am grateful for the support of all noble Lords who spoke. There is a principle of concern here. The answer in brief to the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, who asked how we would get out of this problem, is "What a pity we got into it". Localism was going along very happily in many parts of the country until the Government came along, plonked down a Bill and said: "This is how you do localism, boys and girls". I drafted my amendment to try to give content and relief to the Secretary of State, who seemed to want to designate a system to allow him at least to take a view on whether what was going on was satisfactory.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="1110176000202"></a>I would rather an alternative to a back-stop power. I have always thought that a problem in many sections of the Bill is that a back-stop piece of legislation that should have guaranteed certain rights has become potentially all-embracing. I am not trying to push the Secretary of State into anything: it is a way of trying to find a solution. The Secretary of State has already come into the question.</p>

It refers to subsection (2)(a) instead of (2)(b). The misprint will be obvious to anybody reading it. I am sure that it was my fingers that got it wrong and not the Public Bill Office.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="1110176000205"></a>The amendment tackles the problem of the democratic deficit and creates the opportunity for more democratic legitimacy in unparished areas where neighbourhood areas and neighbourhood forums may be set up. It does this by amending the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, covered by Schedule 9 to this Bill, which then affects the sections of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 that cover community governance reviews. It is slightly complicated, but I think that what is set out is clear.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="1110176000206"></a>I remind noble Lords that in parished areas, the body that will be responsible for neighbourhood planning-for the creation of a neighbourhood plan or of neighbourhood development orders-is the parish council. In unparished areas, the local planning authority can, on request, designate a neighbourhood area; and no fewer than 21 people in that area can be designated as a neighbourhood forum. Clearly in that situation there is a democratic deficit in the formation and accountability of the neighbourhood forum compared with parished areas where there is an elected local authority-the parish council-responsible for carrying out the work.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="1110176000207"></a>This is a modest proposal. It does not force anything on anybody. It seeks to give a neighbourhood forum-where it exists and is recognised by the local planning authority for the purposes of neighbourhood planning, and where it believes that it would be advantageous to convert into an elected parish council-an easier and quicker means of doing that than exists at the moment. The Government recognise the problem. After the summer the Minister wrote a number of letters to various Members of the House setting out the views of the Government on this. I want to quote from the letter to my noble friend Lord Shipley, because when I was digging this out I could not find the letter to me, which I think includes the same stuff. My noble friend Lord Shipley apologises for not being present at this debate on a topic which he has raised repeatedly. He has had to go to another gathering in order to make a speech.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="1110176000208"></a>The Minister wrote to my noble friend as follows:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a><a name="1110176000287"></a>"In these neighbourhood areas, we have sought to recognise the democratic legitimacy of parish councils by ensuring that, within an area that includes any part of a parished area, only the parish council has a mandate to undertake a neighbourhood plan. We would therefore encourage communities to use the opportunity of preparing a neighbourhood plan to consider whether they wanted to apply to become a parish, town or community council-with the extra powers and responsibilities that brings".</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="1110176000209"></a>Community councils, of course, are parish councils in Wales. The letter continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a><a name="1110176000288"></a>"However, we do not want to force communities to become parish or community councils before they undertake neighbourhood planning-hence our neighbourhood forum provisions".</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="1110176000210"></a>The problem with the way that the Government want to go ahead on this is that where a neighbourhood forum and a neighbourhood wish to consider setting up a parish council, the process under a community  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_45"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>governance review-under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007-is fairly cumbersome. More to the point, the principal local authority-the district or unitary council responsible for the community governance review-can put a stop to it if it wants to do so. In the best of all worlds, it will not be carrying out local community governance reviews very frequently. It may say, "Well, we have just done one and we are not going to do another for five years", or something like that, or it may, as has happened with a number of local authorities, simply be hostile to the idea.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="1110176000211"></a>This amendment puts forward a means by which a neighbourhood forum can require a community governance review covering just its area, which has to take place fairly quickly. It also provides for a presumption that, unless there are some very good reasons, it will be approved. That is the purpose of this amendment. What I would really like to come out of this debate today is for the Government to tell us how they intend to tackle this problem, which they have recognised, and how they will make sure that there are more community governance reviews for more parish and town councils, particularly in urban areas where they do not exist at the moment, and where local people, through the neighbourhood forum, actually want them. They should not be compulsory by any means, but there should be a means by which a lot more could be created. I beg to move.</p>

I cannot speak to the wording, even less to the typos I am afraid, but noble Lords will of course know of my interest in parish and town councils. At present a parish council is the only community-based organisation that combines a democratic base, truly local roots and a statutory status. So it has a special cachet from that point of view, and indeed many communities aspire to that status. Crucially it is independent of other local government bodies in having its own power to precept, and that of course gives it a financial independence as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="1110176000213"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has touched on this, and it is certainly no reflection on the borough-which I think has an exemplary record towards communities in its area-of the noble Lord, Lord True, who I see is no longer in his place, but some local authorities have been obstructive to the formation of new parish and town councils, and I do not think that there is any point in overlooking that. That has happened on occasions despite an authentic and well-argued local desire having been put forward.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="1110176000214"></a>I would put one caveat in here and that is that the geographical template for new parishes in unparished areas needs to be a reasonably good fit. I am concerned not so much about the precise geography as about the cohesion and the identity which is to some extent reflected, as it must be, in geography. Size is clearly not the main issue because, up and down the country, we have very large and very small parish and town councils. One feature that they benefit from is that they serve the needs of the community and have grown up to reflect that community, whether large or small, over very many years.</p>

It enables neighbourhood forums that wish to to migrate to the statutory basis where they can join and become one of the family of democratic structures that form the first tier of local government. I welcome the principle behind this amendment and I hope that the Minister will be able to give a positive response.</p>

I agree with everything that has been said. I will add just one rider to it. It seems to me that where a community has got itself together and has gone to the lengths of putting together a neighbourhood plan, dealing with the criticisms of it and then winning a referendum, that should count for something in the arguments with its local authority about whether it should be a parish. At the moment it does not, and I think that it should.</p>

Meanwhile, I have been tempted. Perhaps I may ask a possibly elementary and perhaps even naïve question. How does all this relate to the fact that, in my understanding, and certainly in my neck of the woods, the concept of parish is basically an ecclesiastical one? Indeed I am slightly surprised to find that the Bishops' Bench is empty during this debate. Is the parish essentially an ecclesiastical concept? Whether it is or is not, this clearly raises the possibility of parishes being extended in a rather curious way, by a proposition coming from an adjacent district-albeit requiring the consent of the parish council-which creates a parish council that then, by definition, extends into more than one parish. I find this very curious. If we are going down this path, which I do not object to in principle, at the very least we need some different terminology, because it would not be a parish council as normally understood in my kind of area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="1110176000218"></a>My second point-noble Lords will be glad to hear that it is my last one-is that subsection (4) states that there must be a community governance review if there is a request for one, and that if there is a review, there must be a presumption that a new parish will be created. Why? Why cannot a review come to the conclusion that the world is all right as it is and that no change is needed? Whatever the merits of the intended fundamental thrust of this amendment, the amendment needs a lot of looking at.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="1110176000290"></a>"The provisions of this apply only insofar as they do not prevent action being taken on the request made under this section".</p>

<p><a name="1110176000223"></a>It is not clear to me what that means. Does it mean the provisions of the previous subsection, or does it mean the provisions of the whole clause? I am at a loss to understand what that implies.</p>

<a name="111017-0001.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="1110176000224"></a>However, I agree very strongly with the noble Lord, Lord Newton, there is no case for there to be a presumption that a new parish should be created on the simple fact that a request has been made by a neighbourhood forum that might constitute 21 people, of whom a majority of 11 against 10 would therefore trigger not only the whole process but a presumption as to its outcome. It seems a ridiculous proposition given that we are presumably talking about areas of several hundred people, if not thousands of people, possibly, in an area the size of an urban ward or a significant rural community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="1110176000225"></a>The clause also requires the commencement of a review within three months. That might be all right if there was to be one review, but supposing there was a rash of applications from these neighbourhood forums, is a local authority obliged to commence reviews on all of them in that timescale? It does not seem at all realistic. There certainly should be a method of facilitating a legitimate demand-or a widespread demand, let us not prejudge the issue-for the creation of parish councils or town councils. They have a perfectly proper place in our system of local government and that should be facilitated, but this clause really goes much too far in that direction.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="1110176000226"></a>Nor is it the case that, once created, all of these bodies are trouble-free. Your Lordships will be aware, from the debate about the standards boards and the need for codes, that most of the complaints that arose under the existing procedure actually came from parish councils. The noble Lord, Lord Shipley, who is not in his place at the moment, will no doubt have told your Lordships of the case in Newcastle where a council inherited three parishes on local government reorganisation, and one inner-city area opted for a parish council. That particular grouping did not seem to perform very effectively, to the extent that Councillor Shipley's colleagues in his political group decided that they would go in and in effect take it over, which they did-by perfectly legitimate democratic

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="1110176000227"></a>However, there is one other issue in which, again, the drafting is perhaps defective-certainly it raises an issue-and that is subsection (2), which says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="1110176000291"></a>"A request may be made to create a new parish council for ... the area of the neighbourhood area together with the area of an adjacent parish council".</p>

<p><a name="1110176000239"></a>Is it not conceivable that there may be more than one existing parish council? Certainly there are contiguous parish councils in my authority; there will be in other authorities, particularly urban authorities, I suspect. You may well find a community between the two wishing to align with both rather than one, and creating an entirely new structure. For a variety of reasons, I suspect I may find myself-unusually-agreeing with the Minister when she replies and, I hope, says that she may want to take this away and look at it, but that she cannot agree the amendment as it stands. Certainly that would be my position.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, was correct that this is not a speedy process at the moment, but if we speed up the process there will have to be safeguards to ensure that parish areas reflect community identity and interests.</p>

I have to point out to my noble friend Lord Newton of Braintree that there is a fundamental difference between a parochial church council and a civil parish. If he would like to do some historical research he will find that a not very great Liberal Government in the middle of the 1890s-perhaps in 1894, but I would not stick to that-introduced the concept of civil parishes against the hysterical opposition of Conservatives, particularly in your Lordships' House, who thought that the idea of elected parish councils in the countryside was the nearest thing to communist revolution they could think of. But it was forced through, and it was just about the only good thing which that short-lived Liberal Government managed to do before they lost power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="1110176000235"></a>Having made the party political plug, if I can comment very briefly, the point is -and I am grateful for the support from the noble Earl, Lord Lytton-I accept the nitpicking complaints about the amendment from the noble Lord, Lord Beecham. If he were to investigate the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 he would find out what is in this section which this amendment is referring to. In my opinion, it is all together far too long-winded and bureaucratic in terms of community governance reviews. On standards, it is often little rural parishes which cause the most bother.</p>

I immediately welcome the Government's amendment moved by my noble friend the Minister, which leads this group, and express appreciation for it in response to what was said in Committee. It still does not go quite as far as I wished, as expressed in Amendment 205ZC on the Marshalled List, which I moved in Committee on behalf of the Heritage Alliance. Amendment 205ZB addresses that. I shall not rehearse everything I said on the previous occasion, except to explain why I have put it down again and to repeat the final sentence of my speech in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="11101720000003"></a>On that latter occasion, I said that the amendment's essence was to make sure that there is a consideration of cultural well-being in addition to the considerations that the Government have placed in this part of the Bill. As to why I have repeated this amendment, last Monday night I said that I understood and concurred with the Government in their emphasis on economic growth in their planning policy, but I retain a concern that we shall not have fully done our job of scrutiny on this Bill unless the Government have made their peace more fully with the heritage lobby.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="11101720000004"></a>Since last Monday, I have spoken to the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, to air my concern about this issue. I received their encouragement to bring it back to your Lordships' House. I recall the treatment, perhaps due to their funding decisions towards the heritage, meted out to DCMS Ministers in the previous Government at the annual dinners of English Heritage. Of course I realise that in such an instance the Government are the Government are the Government. But it is not DCLG Ministers who will carry the can in terms of criticism of the Government's planning policy within that heritage arena but rather their DCMS colleagues if some planning cruces are left unimproved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="11101720000005"></a>The Government will know better than I how they can resolve this matter but the acceptance of Amendment 205ZB would be a helpful sign that they understood the problem. The Minister may well say that the word "environmental" embraces "cultural". But environmental is much more of a portmanteau word; the old contradistinction between the Department of the Environment and the Department for Culture, when in 1992 the responsibility for the built environment was separated at the creation of the new department, itself makes the separate culture point. That is reinforced as a cultural emphasis when I say that I have no emotional capital tied up in the words of my first amendment but I hope that the Minister can recognise the significance of the issue. I should add that within the Heritage Alliance, this view is particularly held by the Theatres Trust, which falls into the area of responsibility of DCMS. I beg to move.</p>

I had the pleasure of taking a small deputation to see my noble friend the Minister a couple of weeks ago. It included the chief executive of the National Churches Trust as well as the chief executive of the Heritage Alliance. We discussed a range of issues as we also had a representative from the National Trust present. We had an extremely constructive and amicable meeting, for which I am very grateful to my noble friend. But I do not think that she could fail to have been impressed by the quiet passion expressed by those I took with me on that occasion. A very special concern was expressed by the chief executive of the Theatres Trust. My noble friend has just referred to that.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="11101720000007"></a>This is not just a semantic point. There is real substance in his argument and it is not sufficient for any Government or Minister to assert that environmental embraces cultural. Because of the demarcation to which my noble friend referred when he talked about the establishment of the Department of National Heritage, as it originally was, the Government have decided that there is a distinction, but it is not a distinction without a difference. When the Minister replies to this debate, I hope that she will at the very least promise to come back at Third Reading on this issue. I hope that it is not an issue on which we have to divide the House because these matters transcend all party and petty differences. We are concerned about establishing a new system that will be in place, I hope, for a long time. I trust that it will bring real benefit. But it will not bring the real benefit that we all desire unless there is sufficient recognition of the points made so succinctly and admirably by my noble friend. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us at least some comfort when she comes to reply.</p>

He may not be from the area but he will be an expert community organiser.

The reason for that is very clear. First, I have to declare an interest: the division between the Department of the Environment and the Department for Culture was a huge mistake. But it was not made on the basis of a difference: it was made on the basis of personalities. It was set up in that way to provide particular jobs for particular people, which is why culture and sport were put together. As it was done by a Prime Minister whom I strongly supported, I do not think that people can complain about my point.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="11101720000010"></a>I do not think that the idea that there is an eternal justification for this distinction based on the division in government is acceptable. I understand the reason for it but it has some very dangerous aspects to it. Let me give a simple example. I have fought for a long time to protect the countryside in Suffolk-its environment and its beauty. Part of that is stopping the sea taking it away. One of the things that the previous Government did, which was wholly unacceptable, was to downgrade the nature of the heritage contribution to the environment by making the points that they scored when they came to discuss the issue of coastal defence. Without any discussion with the heritage lobby, they lowered the importance of heritage within the environment.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="11101720000011"></a>I cannot consider the environment without considering culture. I believe that "environment" is a word which covers our cultural heritage as much as it does-I am afraid I am going to insult people-woolly animals. One of the problems is that the environment is often talked about as if it is about woolly animals. It is not-it is about the whole ambience in which we live. To exclude culture from the environment, or to suggest that there is a distinction, seems to me to have very serious import. I would hope that a future Government would reunite the environment with culture. That is where it should be. It is much closer to that than, for example, the media, which seem to me to have only a tangential effect on it. Much of the media seems to me neither cultural nor environmental. I do not see that the media should therefore necessarily be in the same box. To be told that the future of legislation should be based on a mistaken decision in the past about divisions between Ministries seems to me to be a fault.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="11101720000012"></a>One of the problems the Government have got themselves into-I am sure my noble friend Lord Cormack will agree with this-is that some of the language that has been used in the context of planning has led people to believe that our commitment to our environment, be it the cultural environment or the natural environment, has been less than strong. I think that has subsequently been put right and has been remedied not only by my noble friend but by the Prime Minister and others. However, I beg my noble friend

I know that the House wishes to move on, but I have stayed-I have not had temptation-for this amendment, because I think we have to stand firm on the statement that the environment is not just about the natural environment but that the urban environment, the cultural environment and the spiritual environment all fit in. If she gives way on this, I would argue that there ought to be amendments about the spiritual environment. We have had this before. If we are going to start dividing the environment up, I would find it unacceptable to leave the spiritual side of life out of the Bill. I am able to accept it because the word "environment" carries that meaning for me just as much as it implies the natural environment and the cultural environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="11101720000013"></a>I hope that the Government will take this very seriously and that those who lobby my noble friend Lady Hanham are told very clearly that if they have not managed to establish the idea that great poetry, plays, architecture and heritage are part of the environment, then they need to present their case more effectively.</p>

I doubt whether the wording is actually necessary, as it is probably encompassed by what is already in the Bill, but I do think it is an admirable amendment and its thrust is certainly something we support.

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="11101720000015"></a>I should like to ask the Minister for clarification concerning the Government's amendment, the thrust of which was to dispel a concern that business neighbourhood forums were going to be focused on business to the exclusion of the environment and other social and economic aspects. I think the wording has now changed, so that it ensures that neighbourhood forums always have a purpose which seeks to promote the overall economic, social and environmental wellbeing of the neighbourhood area. The original formulation-which is the one used in the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Brookes-was that it should relate to individuals who want to live in the area. There may not be a great distinction in those formulations, but I should be grateful if the Minister could help us on that. Amendment 205ZA, which deals with concerns about the focus of neighbourhood business forums, is to be welcomed.</p>

This picks up that point and makes it clear that it is possible to have business areas as well as neighbourhood areas which are mostly residential. A business area can also include residents and often does. However, there are places such as

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="11101720000017"></a>Amendment 205ZB has generated the most emotion. I have some sympathy with my noble friend Lord Deben and what he said about adding "cultural". We had quite a long debate at the previous stage about the definition of sustainable development. At one stage I recall myself saying that if we were not careful we would have a whole string of additions to sustainable development. The cultural and spiritual aspects were both discussed, and we were in danger of developing a wider and wider concept of the environment.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="11101720000018"></a>We still have to decide what we will do about the definition of sustainable development. However, I am not anxious to have extra elements added in to it. This is specifically because the national planning policy framework is very clear about the preservation of historic regions, areas and buildings. These have to be taken into account and looked at by a neighbourhood forum. It cannot simply ignore them and they will probably already have been identified in the local development plan. There are sufficient ways of making sure that culture is protected. The noble Lord, Lord Cormack, is correct that the question of theatres, opera houses and other cultural buildings was also raised. There is enough to protect all of these and make sure that they are taken into account in any question about the development of a neighbourhood plan.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="11101720000019"></a>Amendment 205ZC explicitly promotes the purpose of business. Amendment 205A would specify that neighbourhood forums shall be open to employees, owners of businesses premises, and, as was specifically raised by my noble friend Lord Lucas, volunteers. We do not think that this amendment is necessary as the wording in the Bill, which was amended in the Commons, is sufficiently broad to include individuals who work in businesses carried on in the neighbourhood area, who own businesses, or other organisations operating in the area or who otherwise work in the neighbourhood area. That very specifically also includes volunteers. It must be right that an organisation which is helping in an area or providing volunteers for it should have a say. We do not think that the amendment is necessary and I hope my noble friend will take that reassurance.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="11101720000020"></a>The word "businesses" in the context of this amendment is used in the broadest of terms. It includes commercial, industrial and professional activities, the public and third sectors as well as the agricultural and fishery sectors, but ensures that membership is open only to those with a local connection. This encompasses practically everybody, but they have to be specifically related to the neighbourhood area. By specifying these categories in the Bill, Amendment 205A would reduce the scope we have provided for in terms of the diverse range of people who can become members of a neighbourhood forum.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="11101720000021"></a>I hope that, with those explanations, noble Lords will feel able not to press their amendments.</p>

My noble friend Lord Deben and I have, on one or two occasions both in this House and the other place on matters of some importance, differed in a most agreeable way in the course of respective debates. I can remember defending Westminster Abbey and its Dean and Chapter against him, and I now find him defending the Department of the Environment against me. I am not suggesting for a moment that I am trying to put the tanks on his lawn with my amendment, but I will remind him of something in terms of what he has said about the 1992 division of responsibilities. It is not for me to comment on whether it was done for personnel reasons, not least because I was a totally incidental participant in that process. But I will say that one of the great virtues of the separation made in 1992 is that it removed the need for Chinese walls within the Department of the Environment. Previously the department had been involved both in making listing decisions and in listing building consents. The great advantage of the separation-I can remember it when my noble friend Lord Deben was the Secretary of State for the Environment-was that we did not have one department making all the same decisions. That was extraordinarily useful.</p>

This brings back an amendment that was introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, in Committee. In responding to the amendment, I think the noble Baroness confirmed that plans could not be approved under these provisions unless they were compatible with the Human Rights Act, but she said that neighbourhood forums do not exercise a public function and therefore we have the anomaly originally pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that parish councils are subject to the equality duty while neighbourhood forums are not. This remains an issue of concern because the impact assessment for these provisions points out that certain communities are much less likely to engage and therefore be involved in this process than others. I do not think we dealt with the question of whether there is a technical problem in bringing neighbourhood forums within the scope of the equality duty, notwithstanding that they apparently do not exercise public functions. Otherwise, there is an issue about doing all we can to ensure that all communities have a chance to become engaged in these neighbourhood planning opportunities. I beg to move.</p>

By definition they are expected to be widely inclusive in terms of who is on them, and that will be checked by the local authority. The neighbourhood planning proposals cannot be approved unless they are compliant with human rights obligations. Built into this is an expectation of equality both in terms of who should be on the neighbourhood forum and in the way that plans have to be compatible with human rights obligations.

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="11101720000037"></a>Amendment 206A is intended to make clear that neighbourhood development plans are flexible and that the policies can apply to all or part of a neighbourhood area. That is to say that they do not need to have policies that apply across the whole neighbourhood area. That had always been our intention, but this amendment addresses concerns raised in Committee that the provisions about flexibility were not clear on this point. This flexibility is important. We want communities to be able to use neighbourhood planning in ways which reflect their aspirations and their vision for the future. We want to make clear, therefore, that there are no unnecessary, top-down restrictions: neighbourhood development plans can be as simple or as ambitious as the community wants to make them. They can include policies covering the whole area, or could have just one or two policies focused on a specific site, such as a high street or valued green space.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="11101720000038"></a>Amendment 210B seeks to emphasise the central importance that the Government place on effective consultation in neighbourhood planning. Therefore, rather than leaving consultation requirements to secondary legislation, this amendment would require a qualifying body to submit a consultation statement to the local planning authority prior to independent examination. Amendment 210B also makes clear that this consultation statement should set out who has been consulted in developing the neighbourhood plan or order and a summary of the key issues raised through that consultation. It responds to concerns raised by several Peers and partner organizations in Committee that the Bill did not contain explicit consultation requirements for neighbourhood planning or the need for evidence to show that the views of others had been listened to and considered in the development of the neighbourhood planning proposals. Further detailed consultation requirements will be set out in secondary legislation. I beg to move.</p>

This amendment is in my name as well as that of the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes. Let us hope that she comes back to your Lordships' Chamber before we get to the end of this. I feel that these amendments are very important. I have had several close experiences of party wall failures. I am going to talk not about fracking-that comes in a later amendment-but about people extending their basements in rows of terraced houses and things like that. I have had one experience which persuaded me of the need for changes to the legislation. The amendments put down by the noble Baroness will achieve this.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="11101720000043"></a>My experience was to do with a garden wall in London. The people next door wished to build a house against the garden wall and to go down to build a basement. They had to go about five feet down and said that they had to take five feet of the garden in order to achieve this, which, of course, is allowed under party wall legislation. They put up a temporary fence, knocked everything down and dug the hole. Then they went bust and the hole stayed there for two years. By that time I had sold the house to somebody who, luckily, was a professional architect and knew what he was talking about. In the end, he took the neighbours to court but had to get two separate court orders; one before they would construct the basement up to ground level and reinstate the garden and another before they completed the wall up to the requisite height. Five years later the wall is still not finished-if you push the top of it, it moves, which is interesting. Having had to go to court twice and suffered two burglaries as a result, I think it demonstrates that something needs to be done. I certainly support these amendments which the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, has put forward and co-ordinated. I am sure that she will wish to speak after me, but in the mean time I beg to move.</p>

I will speak to Amendments 206, 224 and 227. Amendment 206 is the one about consultation. I have a somewhat sceptical view about consultation because when I was building my house, we consulted all the neighbours and they all objected just the same, so it is of limited value. However, Dr Thompson, who has done a lot of work and held public meetings on this issue, quoted me an example of someone who consulted their neighbours and agreed that they would have all the cars washed every day and would have everything swept and cleaned. Apparently the whole basement development went through without a hitch. That person has now moved into the basement and the people next door to her have started to do theirs. Apparently, it is absolutely chaotic and they have not consulted or agreed anything, so consultation might be of value but it is of limited value.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="11101720000045"></a>It is far more important to deal with the other items which I am covering in Amendment 224. One is the question of precedent. I should declare an interest in that, when I die, my children, in order to get the best value for my home, will definitely want to be able to say that they could have a basement under it, because in that part of London a hotel has just been built with six storeys underground. Other people are building to a lesser extent, but at least half the people in the streets adjoining my house in London have already either got permission or done their basements. Because you cannot go up, the only way you can continue to live in a place with an expanding family is to go down so there is a definite need and a case for basements. That is why I have included in subsection (1) of Amendment 224 the issue of precedents. If an area is already full of basements, why should you not have the same right?</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="11101720000046"></a>More importantly, subsection (2) refers to a bond or security. When my husband was alive, he represented St John's Wood as a councillor and I certainly know of a basement there that was under construction for three years. There was another one in Brompton Square. After three years, the people each went bankrupt and with that, the people in the houses on either side of them were faced with a terrible situation. They could do nothing: their houses could fall into the hole or fill with water, as the basement was filling with water. It is quite alarming. A bond or security could be an answer in this kind of situation. It should be easy to find cover as part of your buildings insurance. Subsection (3) refers to "a qualified structural engineer". Some of the better London boroughs already impose such conditions. They apply them to any such planning consent and the work has to be both planned and supervised. The three subsections in Amendment 224 are important.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="11101720000047"></a>Even more important is Amendment 227, which relates to amendments to the Party Wall etc. Act. I am grateful to the noble Lord who gave me some marvellous papers from the RICS, on its practice standards for UK party wall legislation. They were very interesting. The noble Lord is an expert on the subject. If the party wall legislation were updated to cover these matters, there is already a great deal of provisions for security in there, which would also cover the consultation issue. As far as I can see, basements are more or less a big city issue. I do not know whether it is a big issue in big cities outside London, but in London it has certainly become one.

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="11101720000049"></a>I say at once that I was extremely grateful to my noble friend Lady Hanham for acceding to my request that I should take a deputation from two of the community bodies interested in this subject. We met my noble friend on 31 August. The community bodies included representatives of some of the householders who have been so appallingly affected by these basement developments-"subterranean developments", they seem to be called. So impressed was my noble friend by what she heard and read that she instructed her officials-I hope I quote her correctly-"to find a

The delegation therefore left in some considerable hope that something might be done to meet their concerns.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="11101720000050"></a>In passing, I asked them whether they had tried to raise this issue in the other place. Their answer was rather revealing: they had tried but they could not find any Member of another place who was prepared to take up the issue. There was no delegation to see a Minister in the other place. It has been left to this House to pursue the issue and to gain the assurance from my noble friend that her department should find a solution.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="11101720000051"></a>I have four amendments in this group. The first two were tabled for Committee and have been carried through to Report. One was intended to provide a code of practice and the other to provide some form of recompense for the massive disturbance that householders face. However, I have subsequently received a letter from my noble friend explaining that those amendments were not acceptable. In the letter of 9 August she said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="11101720000083"></a>"With regard to your proposals relating to the Secretary of State issuing guidance, in the spirit of localism, I believe it is best to leave it to local authorities to issue guidance".</p>

<p><a name="11101720000073"></a>Relying on that, I then tabled Amendment 230 to provide that the local authority shall issue guidance.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="11101720000052"></a>However, my noble friend also was not keen on the idea of compensation. She said she believed that,</p>
<ul><a name="11101720000084"></a>"the introduction of such a provision would set an unwelcome precedent for this to be adopted more generally".</ul>
<p><a name="11101720000053"></a>I have therefore tabled a second amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="11101720000054"></a>My noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes is absolutely right that we need an extension of the Party Wall etc. Act 1996, which was passed after a good deal of discussion in order to deal with the problem of party walls dividing two houses. I say this with some hesitation as the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, is a considerable expert. As my noble friend has already pointed out, he chaired the RICS panel which has recently produced the sixth edition of its guidance on party wall legislation and procedure. However, we need an amendment to the Party Wall etc. Act because, as presently drafted and operated, that legislation is not apt to catch the kind of experiences that neighbouring householders are facing as a result of these subterranean developments.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="11101720000055"></a>It is perfectly clear from page 3 of the guidance that the Act,</p>
<ul><a name="11101720000088"></a>"authorises work that may involve physical encroachment onto a neighbour's land, or produce dust, vibration, noise or some other inconvenience".</ul>
<p><a name="11101720000074"></a>However, the work must be carried out in such a way as not to cause unnecessary inconvenience. That is what we are talking about, and yet I have been advised-I think that this will be confirmed by the noble Earl, Lord Lytton-that the Act is not in a form in which it can be used to remedy these evils. I use the word advisedly. This applies to householders in many parts of London. It happens not only in Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster; I am told that it happens also in Camden, Hammersmith and Fulham. It occurs where the value of the land is so high that it is cheaper to carry out an expensive excavation downwards than to

That is what is driving it. It is a function of the value of land.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="11101720000056"></a>Perhaps I may give an indication. A very old friend of mine, a distinguished former ambassador-he and his wife are now both over 80-sent me a message when he realised that I was taking an interest. He writes as follows:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a><a name="11101720000085"></a>"Our little London house in Hamilton Close St John's Wood was once the groom's cottage for the main house in Hamilton Terrace. When we bought it in 1985 Hamilton close was a quiet cobbled backwater. In recent years we have been plagued by noisy builders, excavators and concrete mixers obstructing the Close and damaging the cobbles as well as making an infernal noise during working hours".</p>

<p><a name="11101720000075"></a>As with the experience of the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, they, too, suffered not just one but two failures by the contractors, who were building next door an underground swimming pool and gym.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="11101720000057"></a>As for those employing the contractors, often these are people for whom it is only one of a number of houses, and as my noble friend said, these things are apparently considered necessary in modern society. When one is told that people can spend £750,000 on building an underground swimming pool in that sort of area, one can see that huge resources are involved. The effect on neighbours is simply horrendous. The owners of the house, of course, move out. They can go and stay in a hotel while it is all going on. The neighbours just have to put up with it.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="11101720000058"></a>I am not in the least surprised that my noble friend Lady Hanham told her officials that a solution must be found. It may well be that none of the amendments I have tabled is sufficient to do this. It may well be that my noble friend's reason-which she has put to me-is that if one is going to change the law in this respect, it must be the subject of consultation, but there really is not time for that. However, it should be possible for this House to ask the Government to table an amendment which would give the Government the power to amend the Party Wall etc. Act so that it can be extended to this sort of development, that it can provide for an effective code of practice, and that it can provide for some measure of compensation-as does the party wall Act-for the disturbance, and horrendous interference with normal life, which these developments are causing.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="11101720000059"></a>I agree with noble friend that something must be done; a solution must be found. My noble friend has convened a meeting tomorrow to discuss this issue, and I am fascinated to know what we are going to discuss. However, I give her notice that if none of these amendments is acceptable to the Government, then I would want to table an amendment on Third Reading to give the Government the power to amend the party wall Act, so that it can be extended to cover precisely the problem that we have been discussing. There is no doubt about it: something has to be done. I hope we shall find a way that this House can achieve that.</p>

Noble Lords will realise straight away that it is named after Shakespeare's characters in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" who whispered, conversed and conducted their courtship through a chink in a party wall. I have to say that most of the things that go on through chinks in party walls are anything other than courtship, as we have already heard. A further charge to add to the sheet is-</p>

It is actually called the Pyramus and Thisbe Club, and it has London and regional representation. It expanded quite considerably after the Party Wall etc. Act 1996 became law. Noble Lords-and certainly the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner-will remember that I took that Bill through its stages in this House in a previous parliamentary incarnation. I make no apology for saying that I have always thought that Section 10 of that Act-which is the dispute resolution process-was a model for our time. It is a form of alternative dispute resolution, and I thought it was well worth applying to a much larger range of inter-neighbour issues, as opposed to people having to go through the courts.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="11101720000064"></a>Let us leave aside for one minute the point that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, mentioned about the state of the housing market and the huge pressures that that brings to bear on scarce urban space, about which I will make a comment later. Many of the things that noble Lords have referred to are, of course, true. Subterranean development can have very significant implications for neighbouring properties both during the course of construction and in the subsequent effects, often several years later. The planning and building regulations regime provides only a partial protection. Sometimes it provides none, and the common law gives rise to actions often only once damage has become apparent, sometimes long after the original developer has gone from the scene.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="11101720000065"></a>I turn to the question of whether the Party Wall etc. Act 1996 can be usefully amended. At this juncture I would say that that legislation is, of course, very narrowly framed. It came out of the old London Building Acts, which had broadly similar provisions. That legislation risked being abolished under the terms of the repeal of the London Building Acts with the abolition of the GLC. It was saved from that in no small part by the prompting from the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. I am very grateful to him. From his knowledge and experience at the time, he was one of the mainsprings for making sure that that legislation  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_64"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was preserved. I pay him tribute for that. But widening its scope would have to be considered very carefully. It is a very finely drafted construct. There are many professional and technical understandings that are interwoven right the way through the Act. To amend one particular bit through an amendment to this Localism Bill would, I am afraid, have other consequences that might be less desirable-possibly the law of unforeseen consequences. That said, I would welcome the opportunity to see whether that Act can be amended to deal with this issue.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="11101720000066"></a>On security for expenses, we have this issue with the technically challenging nature of very deep excavations. They often create larger risks than those just arising from works for which notice would have to be served under the party wall provisions. So there is an issue about how you extend that scope, and make sure that it remains cohesive. There must be very few surveyors involved in this area of work who have not come across a building site where the contractor or the developer-or sometimes both-have gone bust, possibly leaving a building site with a large hole in the ground, and creating huge ongoing liabilities for adjoining properties. Enabling a default mechanism where this can be addressed is in the public interest. But then comes the question: if you are going to empower something to be done about it, how do you pay for it? This brings into question the matter of an insurance-backed warranty of some sort.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="11101720000067"></a>Again, this is a very difficult area. It depends how the provision is constructed, how it is worded, and how it benefits other people, who are not necessarily identified from inception as being beneficiaries of this. Overseas-based developers, non-resident owners and possibly eastern European builders do go to make a bit of a heady mix in the more valuable and economically important parts of our inner cities. Clearly these matters need to be dealt with by technicians who are competent and know what they are doing, know what they are looking at, can identify issues of boundaries and know something about construction. However, there is no generally applicable or enforceable code of practice for this type of development. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, referred to Camden. The London Borough of Camden probably has the most competent of all the codes of practice that I have seen.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="11101720000068"></a>However, the whole process is permissive at the moment. It is actually dogged by having poor enforcement procedures. It needs to have something better than it has. It operates by a process of consensus. With those who wish to play fast and loose with the system, often the consensus does not exist. That is a criticism of the whole process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="11101720000069"></a>I hope nobody will suppose that I am in favour of putting impediments in the way of undertaking development, to cover the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner. I did professional work for those involved in the development process so the principle of being able to do works on one's own land should, within limits, be properly protected. Local residents should not be able to veto a scheme just because they dislike it. There is a broader question of how far the effects of that development process should be visited

That needs to be internalised within the development process to a greater degree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="11101720000070"></a>While I am nervous about how these amendments would affect the Party Wall etc. Act, I would be happy and willing-as would many chartered surveyors, engineers, architects and others who are actively involved in party wall matters-to assist the noble Baroness and her department in trying to find a solution. With that in mind, I hope that there is some way that this can be brought forward a little faster than waiting for some remote next legislative opportunity while at the same time perhaps not rushing to see that something must be done in the context of this particular Bill.</p>

<a name="11101725000001"></a><b><a name="111017-0002.htm_spnew34"></a><a name="11101725000061"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, before I speak to our Amendment 226 in this group, I have a few general comments about the contributions of other noble Lords. Some compelling points have been made about the need to address this issue. I suspect, although it may not be the case, that this is largely a London issue because, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, it is particularly associated with very high land value. I can honestly say that I have not encountered it in Luton to date, but it may apply to other areas of the country. I see that the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, has clearly experienced it. We are interested in hearing the Minister's view on whether the way forward is to deal with a combination of codes of practice, party wall legislation changes, and issues around insurance or bonds.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="11101725000002"></a>Our Amendment 226 would amend Amendment 225 from the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and my noble friend Lord Berkeley, with its code of practice for subterranean development. It is simply to ensure that the importance of promoting good health and safety and minimising the risk of injury or ill health to workers and the public is part of any addressing of the issue. I was prompted to bring it forward by simply looking at the text of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, about the code of practice. He talks about "noise and vibration", and,</p>
<ul><a name="11101725000058"></a>"dust, dirt and the risk of an infestation of vermin"-</ul>
<p><a name="11101725000049"></a>all things that one can imagine are an integral part of excavation. It is important that we focus on the safety of people working in that environment as well as the convenience of neighbours and the owners of the property itself.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="11101725000003"></a>Construction is still a pretty unsafe working environment. It has got a lot better over the last decade, although I do not have the very recent figures on fatalities and fatal accidents. Most concerns arise in small house-building and refurbishment projects, the sorts of projects that one would envisage being involved here. Although I am advised that no special codes or regulations need to be introduced to deal with this-the CDM regulations of 2007 and the guidance around them are sufficient-in considering all these matters we should have uppermost in our minds the safety of people who undertake what can be quite dangerous work. In so far as protecting the public is concerned, I was advised that on one occasion

Obviously there were risks of injury to the public from that. That is the purpose of my amendment, which I hope is entirely non-contentious.</p>

My patience ran out when we had one that went down three floors. When I asked why it had to go so far down, they said that the person who owned the house wanted a high diving board.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="11101725000006"></a>I am not at all unsympathetic to this particular discussion. After my noble friends Lord Jenkin and Lady Gardner came to see me originally with some representatives from Kensington and Chelsea, and Westminster, I thought carefully about what we would do here. The fact is that this Bill will not solve the problems. There are too many elements to this to help by legislation. There is legislation all over the place that governs this. I was concerned to see what could be done within the legislation that is there at the moment and whether codes of practice, guidance and all the elements could be brought together and given to local authorities to help them. For that reason, I asked my noble friend Lord Jenkin and the people who came to see me to agree to be a small working party to discuss with officials the ideas that they had for amending this, with the officials bringing together what can already be done. Could we, through some discussion and feeling our way, find a solution that did not require primary legislation, or has this been going on for so long that it is well beyond that? We want something quick that guides local authorities in what they can and cannot do.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="11101725000007"></a>The local authorities that have to deal with this are becoming quite adroit, but the effect on people who live roundabout is absolutely atrocious. I know of one person who complained that a basement extension was being dug up on either side of his house and opposite it, too. Once basements are developed you cannot see them and they are all gone, but it is during this development process, which can take anything up to two years, when the trouble starts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="11101725000008"></a>I hope that my noble friend Lord Jenkin will not bring back an amendment at Third Reading. We have an awful lot already and the Bill managers are becoming slightly anxious. I feel that we can resolve the problem more quickly than this. There are already endless Acts covering this. I am concerned that those Acts are not properly understood or implemented by local authorities. There are building and environmental regulations. Construction method statements are required. There are party wall implications, construction design and management regulations, the

As a result of the meeting that we had prior to this being brought up this time, we are already working with the Basement Information Centre to see about guidance on the construction of basements and how those could be developed to cover the issues we have raised. Defra is looking to prove an updated version of the British Standard so as to give it statutory force under the Control of Pollution Act. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors publishes guidance on the Party Wall etc. Act, as the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, said. I would accept, immediately with gratitude, his help with this. We already have a meeting tomorrow if the noble Lord is free, and we will take it into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="11101725000009"></a>The party wall issue is clearly another very major area, and the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, has pointed out the difficulties with bringing this into more legislation when there may be ways of making it clearer and more acceptable by guidance. We and the department are going to review the guidance on the Party Wall etc. Act so that it reflects matters better. The Health and Safety Executive is developing guidance for builders, and all the issues which the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, has raised will come under health and safety; they must do. We do not underestimate the disturbance and distress that poorly executed work on subterranean developments can cause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="11101725000010"></a>I want the small group that we have now, working with our officials, to go through what has been picked up on now, what the legislation is, what guidance is needed and where local authorities need to be given a better helping hand with a code of conduct, and to see whether we can do this without having to go to primary legislation again. I think we can probably do this, and I would like to be given the opportunity to try. I cannot complete this between now and Third Reading, so I am going to have to rely on the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, perhaps not moving this at Third Reading, but with my commitment to try to see this through. I fully and totally understand the concerns around this. I am not surprised that it has provoked discussion to get it into the Bill. By the time we have had a consultation on legislation, if it is possible to have that, we are going to be way off down the line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="11101725000011"></a>I will personally take a lead in this to see what can be done, what guidance can be provided and what extra clout can be given, one way or another, either through the Party Wall etc. Act or by strengthening the guidance. I would like an opportunity to be able to do that, but having said that I am very grateful to the noble Lords who have spoken. I gather that the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, had to leave to chair another meeting, but his amendment was very much along the lines of the others moved in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="11101725000014"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, talked about unnecessary inconvenience, but that is not the big issue. Every bit of building work is always an extreme inconvenience for everyone else around it. In the street where my house is in London I have gone through eight years of all the office blocks being demolished and replaced with giant blocks of flats. It meant that the whole street was congested and you could not move. It was extremely inconvenient, but I do not expect compensation for that. We have to encourage development and any necessary construction. I am not so concerned about compensation for disturbance, but I am concerned about people who find themselves left with a hole in the ground beside them when the people who have dug it have gone bankrupt. It should be simple to set up some sort of insurance, and I would like to speak to the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, whose views I greatly respect, because he said there might be complications with this. I thought that insurance was a pretty common feature in building. Most builders have insurance. We should discuss that at some further time.</p>

I appreciate the complexity of the Party Wall etc. Act and I can see that the points made by the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, are again very good. He and others mentioned foreign builders, which really are a major issue in central London. You do not get it outside London so much. In rural areas you get very helpful local builders who seem to do what they say they will do. People near me have found that even when they have told builders that they are working outside the official hours, those builders just ignore that totally. It has been mentioned how poor the enforcement is on these issues, which is another issue. I do not know whether a code of practice would deal with that as there is already a code of practice and special hours for people to be building-from 8 am to 6 pm, or from 8 am to 4 pm on certain days of the week. That is just ignored.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="11101725000016"></a>I thought the point made by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, about the safety of the workers was, again, very important. Again, foreign workers seem very often to just ignore normal safety precautions. I have taken in everything that has been said, but I cannot promise not to proceed again at Third Reading. I will need to consult the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, before that. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

These amendments are about the referenda for approving and adopting the neighbourhood plans. One of the major changes to the Localism Bill has been the extensive change to the requirements for referenda with the removal of Chapter 1 from Part 4, but neighbourhood plans are still subject to referenda.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="11101725000018"></a>I understand that if local people are at loggerheads with their local authority but feel very strongly that their particular neighbourhood plans should proceed, it is no doubt necessary before imposing the plan on everybody else to find out what the whole community thinks of it. However, if the local authority accepts the neighbourhood plan, and it is acceptable to the parish council or the town council, there is no real democratic deficit. A number of elected politicians are involved, and where everyone at the local level, the local authority level and the parish level thinks it is a good idea, it does not seem very wise to proceed with a referendum that brings in people who have had very little to do with working through the neighbourhood plan.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="11101725000019"></a>The Government are setting up 126 front runners, as they call them, with some funding to see how things work. I have seen one of these and talked to the group that is bringing forward its neighbourhood plan. The group is in the parish of the Cerne valley, north of Dorchester in Dorset, and it is doing great things. I strongly approve of the idea of people in the neighbourhood working out a plan for their area. This is all about a culture change. Instead of everybody being against development, people are thinking through the fact that there has to be some development and deciding where it is best sited. People reject some of the sites the house builders might have liked but bring on stream others and bring together their plan.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="11101725000020"></a>There are lots of difficulties, hassle and arguments at the local level, but I say good for them. Finally, at the end of a long and tortuous business, I am sure they will have a neighbourhood plan and it will be agreed with the parish council. If the local authority, the district council in this case, says that that is fine, for goodness sake let us not put this out to a referendum that brings in all kinds of people who have had absolutely nothing to do with the process and have not come to any of the meetings. It is always so much easier for people to say no to something than to say yes. If you want to keep your head below the parapet you do not say you are in favour, you stay at home. The people who get up the petition and want to say no are very

I fear that an awful lot of hard work in the Cerne valley, or wherever it may, can be lost when, as I said, all kinds of people who have had little to do with the process turn out for a referendum.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="11101725000021"></a>My amendment contains a couple of safeguards. I have to admit that I am having second thoughts about my own safeguards. I am just about to talk against my own amendment at this point. However, fearing that it might be unacceptable not to keep the referendum ingredient in the Bill, I have included two ways in which a referendum would legally be required. One would be a petition is signed by 5 per cent of villagers who say that they want to have a proper referendum in which more than 50 per cent would have to vote in favour of the proposed measure. The amendment suggests that if 5 per cent did that, a referendum would go ahead.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="11101725000022"></a>The other safeguard is that if one of the ward councillors-there might be three ward councillors for the parish-was opposed to the idea of the plan being taken forward, a referendum would have to be held. I have talked to people at the local level-I met a number of people in Dorset last Friday-who thought that my amendment was great up to the point where it referred to the 5 per cent petition. I was told that that could comprise 125 people in one of the parishes concerned, who all go to the local shop and sign any petition that is put under their noses. Local people were also not in favour of one recalcitrant councillor who wishes to curry favour-perhaps he is in a different party from the majority in that particular patch-saying that a referendum must be held. They did not think that it was a bright idea for my amendment to include those safeguards.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="11101725000023"></a>I should have been emboldened by the comments of the noble Lord, Lord True, who is, indeed, a true believer in localism but who does not see the need for a referendum in circumstances such as I have described. He favours a much more permissive regime involving consultation with local people. I had a very good meeting with Greg Clark during the summer. His view at that point was that if the neighbourhood plan is acceptable to the council and the council agrees to prepare a local development order that embraces the plan-I think the noble Baroness reiterated this today-that can go ahead without the need to go through the rigmarole of a referendum. That is a significant point. In these circumstances it would be enormously helpful if that could be clarified.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="11101725000024"></a>The noble Baroness said that she would look again at the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord True. I wonder whether the proposals in my amendment might be wrapped up in his to determine whether there is a way in which we can make it clear to people that once a neighbourhood plan is devised and agreement is reached with a district council, parish council or town council, and everyone is okay with this, a referendum will not be needed. At the moment people's understanding, fear and anxiety is that a referendum will have to be held in all cases. I am preparing myself for reassurance. I beg to move.</p>

Therefore, it is an extremely good idea that these matters should be taken away and discussed further and perhaps enlightenment will dawn on me by the time we get to Third Reading. However, I agree with the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Best, that if we can avoid a plethora of unnecessary referendums, so much the better. In that light, I would be happy for the Minister to consider the matter further and for it to be perhaps slightly reshaped at Third Reading.</p>

<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="11101725000026"></a><b><a name="111017-0002.htm_spnew42"></a><a name="11101725000069"></a>Baroness Eaton:</b> My Lords, I declare an interest as a vice-president of the Local Government Association, which has offered its broad support for the neighbourhood planning reforms. Indeed, a lot of the thinking on the reforms has come from the innovative and creative local planning schemes which councils have introduced over many years. I do not know of a single council that does not want a more flexible and consensual planning system-indeed, the most consensual possible-and common sense tells us that this benefits communities. The Government have made great strides forward, shredding down the national planning policy framework and confirming that residents will be firmly at the heart of local developments. However, within these new parameters we need to ensure that the planning system can move as fluidly and quickly as possible. I hope that this amendment, to which I am happy to attach my name, clarifies that in certain cases referendums on planning issues might be locally appropriate, as we have heard. The noble Lord, Lord Best, said that discussions with the Minister have suggested a mechanism whereby, if there is consensus, this process will go straight ahead without a referendum. I think that would be well received.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="11101725000027"></a>The Local Government Association has estimated that the cost of holding a local referendum on a planning issue will be in the region of £5,000. This is a very significant figure when you consider the sheer number of referendums that could take place around neighbourhood planning issues. It would not be a case of a one-off cost of £5,000 as many costs would arise for local authorities. When the public sector, particularly local government, is so tightly squeezed, that hardly seems a wise use of public resources and public money. I share the request of the noble Lord, Lord Best, for clarity. We would all be much happier if this process was made much simpler and referendums were rarely used in neighbourhood planning. Certainly, councils across the country would support that. I support the noble Lord, Lord Best.</p>

It follows from my arguments on my own amendment that I think there are many cases where a referendum is not necessary. Indeed, my amendment suggested that local authorities should be able to proceed without the need for referendums. Therefore, I was interested to hear about the discussions that the noble Lord mentioned. As he knows, I am not axiomatically against all referendums. There is a place for a referendum in  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_72"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some circumstances to empower those who are disempowered or, indeed, to resolve a genuine heated dispute in a community.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="11101725000029"></a>However, for the reasons the noble Lord implied, I could not support Amendment 207 because it would give too much potential power to an individual councillor. This may not be the case only as regards councillors from a minority party. In my authority five out of 18 wards are split wards with minority representation. Frankly, there are wards where everybody is nominally of the same party but they cannot stand each other, although that does not apply in my authority, of course. Therefore, there is scope for a lot of potential mischief. The threat of provoking a referendum, which would cost money unless someone does something for someone else behind closed doors, is probably better avoided. In other respects I have a lot of sympathy with the amendment. In the context of the discussions, I encourage the noble Lord to follow the direction in which he has begun to move.</p>

I am happy that noble Lords still remember what was said on that amendment. At the outset I confirm what I said when responding to Amendment 205. Where there is agreement on the neighbourhood plan between the neighbourhood forum and the local council under the local development plan, a referendum does not have to take place. As long as they are all in agreement and are all working to the same end, the local authority can accept that the neighbourhood plan conforms with the local development plan and therefore does not require a referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="11101725000031"></a>Referendums need to be held where the local neighbourhood forum is putting forward a new plan which may or may not conform to a local development order or the national planning framework. Somehow it has to be confirmed that everybody would like to see what has been put forward. It is not inconceivable in the way that a plan is drawn up by a body of people that it should be tested against the people who will be affected by it. We have accepted that there ought to be real consultation with people beyond the neighbourhood forum to make sure that what is being suggested is what they want to see. That is when a referendum would be appropriate to test out their views. It is not essential. As I said, where there is broad and happy agreement between the authority and the community at large, the neighbourhood plan does not require a referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="11101725000032"></a>I understand what has been said about the costs of referendums but we covered quite a lot of the discussion in response to the proposals of the noble Lord, Lord True. I have already said that we will consider these before Third Reading. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Best, will feel able to withdraw his amendments because they are not necessary. The situation is that either you have to have a referendum, which is very clear, or you do not need to have one, which is also reasonably clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="11101725000033"></a>I shall speak to government Amendments 211, 238, 239 and 240. Government Amendment 211 requires regulations about neighbourhood planning referendums to be subject to an affirmative resolution in both Houses. Government Amendments 238, 239 and 240 give effect to that change, following the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which we are happy to accept. The committee also recommended that the regulations on charges relating to neighbourhood planning to be made under Clause 105 should be subject to affirmative resolution by both the Commons and the Lords, instead of just the Commons. Again, we are happy to accept that recommendation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="11101725000034"></a>Bearing in mind what I said on Amendment 205 and what I have confirmed on Amendment 207 that you do not always have to have a referendum, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Best, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="11101725000036"></a>The distinction that we have been drawing out in the course of our discussions today is between the local authority saying, "The neighbourhood plan is in conformity with the local plan", and the local authority saying, "Although the neighbourhood plan makes some embellishments and has some bright ideas that the people within the locality wish to see which may change the local plan, nevertheless the local authority is happy with those changes and will issue a local development order that will embrace that neighbourhood plan". There is a slight distinction between accepting what the neighbourhood plan says and accepting simply that it is in conformity with the local plan. We have gone a little bit further. The local authority may say, "Okay, you didn't want to use those sites over there that were in our local plan. We fully understand. We are still going to have the housing or whatever it is that is required in the area. They will be in a slightly different place but that is what you have all negotiated and worked through. You have spent 18 months on this hard work and we are prepared to accept that as a local authority". We have got to the point where that change to the local authority's original intentions triggered by the neighbourhood plan will be something that does not require a referendum. The local authority accepts it at the neighbourhood level. It is, of course, approved by the parish council neighbourhood forum.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a><a name="11101725000057"></a>"Neighbourhood planning offers an exciting opportunity for local communities-through a parish council or neighbourhood forum-to initiate meaningful negotiations with landowners over how their land may be used in a way which benefits the landowner and the community alike. It is of course of fundamental importance that any agreements reached are transparent, that any developments coming forward are acceptable within the broad 'basic conditions' for neighbourhood planning, and that landowners are not 'held to ransom' or unreasonably prevented from developing their land in any way which is acceptable in broader planning terms. The parish council or neighbourhood forum will in developing their neighbourhood planning proposals consult with a range of stakeholders, including landowners. They may also talk to the landowner about whether their land is accessible and deliverable and what types of development the landowner may consider accommodating on their land. This is important to ensure that any proposals in a neighbourhood plan or order have the support of those organisations and individuals needed to ensure delivery during the plan period. In the case of a neighbourhood development order they may also discuss what conditions may need to be built into the order, or whether there are any matters that will need to be provided for via a related planning agreement (for example the provision of services or infrastructure), to make development acceptable when considered against the basic conditions for neighbourhood planning. The responsibility for confirming what conditions or planning agreements are necessary to make the proposed development acceptable will sit with the local planning authority and the independent examiner. If a neighbourhood development order gave permission for a modest housing development, but required that to be accompanied by such extensive community bene?ts that the overall development would be rendered financially unviable, then the landowner would remain at liberty to apply to the local planning authority for planning permission for a less expensive scheme, in the normal way. Planning obligations need to meet strict legal tests if they are to be relevant considerations. These are set out in regulations, case law and guidance. These provide that a planning obligation may only constitute a reason for granting planning permission for the development if the obligation is necessary, directly related to the development and fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development. If a planning obligation does not satisfy these tests it will not be a material consideration. Whatever negotiations and agreements do take place, it is important to note that what land is allocated in a plan or given planning permission in an order should never simply be a matter of which landowner can be persuaded to share the biggest proportion of any land value uplift with the community. It has to be about enabling any developments which the community support and which are acceptable when considered against the basic conditions".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="11101725000040"></a>That is a very fair summary of the position as is. But, of course, this is localism. In a parish, words such as "fair" and, indeed, "sustainability" have altered meanings. The parish might, for instance, choose to talk to all landowners and ask them to put forward proposals for the way in which they might like to see development on their land, and for ways of mitigating any adverse effects on the neighbourhood that they perceive. The parish will then publish all proposals and invite comments from the public, which will be passed on to the landowners. The parish will then invite landowners to submit modified proposals in the light of comments, together with binding commitments to the mitigations that they have themselves-the landowners-proposed. The parish will then publish all proposals and invite the public to rank them. The most popular of the proposals will then go forward as a draft neighbourhood plan.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="11101725000041"></a>That is as fair as fair can be. There are no obligations on the landowners that they have not proposed themselves. All factors will be taken into consideration in the process of the parish ranking which ones they like best. I am sure that in most parishes the process will result in a large slice of the landowner's planning gain ending up with the parish community. That is what I hope we are going to see as a result of the Bill. I hope that my noble friend will tell me that she sees no holes in my logic. I beg to move.</p>

He then worried me a bit when he went on to describe it as an auction among landowners in the parish potentially seeking out the highest bidder. I would need to read the record and I would be interested in what the Minister has to say about that. Does that not have the potential to be outwith the strict application of planning obligations and the rules that go with that? I do not assert that it is, but certainly the way in which it was expressed gave me some cause for concern that that might be the path that one was heading down. I would be happy to read the record and be reassured otherwise.</p>

We discussed the issue of parishing earlier on.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="11101725000044"></a>The first part of Amendment 210A would allow a qualifying body-the neighbourhood forum or the parish-to negotiate with landowners for contributions to be paid to the community. The expectation is that the landowners would subsequently agree the contributions with the local authority through formal agreements-for example, Section 106 agreements. There is nothing to stop local communities talking to landowners about how their land may be used in a way which benefits the landowner and community, but the responsibility for confirming what conditions

In determining a planning application, the authority will have regard to the provisions of the development plan, including any neighbourhood plans in force.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="11101725000045"></a>The amendment would cause significant confusion about when such contributions would be paid by the landowner, how they would meet the strict legal tests for planning obligations and how any of the community's negotiations could be secured by legal agreements between the landowner and the local authority. I want to make it clear that whatever negotiations and agreements take place, what land is allocated in a plan should never be simply a case of which landowner is prepared to share the biggest proportion of land value uplift with the community. That was the point that the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, was making. I accept the broad approach of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, to this. However, I must reassert that it is the local planning authorities which must determine what obligations are necessary to mitigate development impacts, and that will include financial ones.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="11101725000046"></a>The second part of Amendment 210A seeks to empower qualifying bodies to promote referendums or proposals on parishing alongside referendums on neighbourhood planning. In my recent letter to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, which he has quoted extensively and which I have placed in the House Library, I repeated our commitment in the public services White Paper to consider how to make it easier for local people, including neighbourhood forums, to take advantage of existing legislation which allows for the establishment of parish or community councils. Nothing would legally prevent the joint holding of referendums into a neighbourhood plan and into proposals for creating a new parish council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="11101725000047"></a>With these reassurances-on the commitment from landowners and on parishing-I hope that the noble Lord will be happy to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Amendment 210AC, which is in this group, was admirably covered earlier by an amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. I will not need to speak to Amendment 232A, which appears later; I am sure that the reply my noble friend will give on these amendments will cover that too.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="11101730000002"></a>Since we have done away with local referenda, we need some way of making localism relevant within cities. Planning is not the issue that is really going to get to people in cities. It is much more, as I said earlier, aspects of the way that they are dealt with by local councils within the matters that they have within their gift. I have picked up, in Amendment 210AB, their control over the way roads are used. When an area wants to examine pedestrianisation and alternative uses for parts of the street, to allow children to play or to affect the speed limits-and, talking more of Lavender Hill, the way in which parking regulations are enforced-those aspects are the sort of things that engage the spirit of the community.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="11101730000003"></a>A lot that happens under permitted development orders within planning-the way in which the streetscape changes, the way in which change of use is permitted to commercial premises and the developments of shopping streets that result from that-just goes ahead under permitted development and is not within the scope of neighbourhood planning as foreseen in this Bill. Yet those are the things that engage an urban community. If we want to make something of this Bill and the virtues that it will bring in urban communities, we have to look at giving local, neighbourhood communities some power over these things. I prefer the route that my noble friend Lord True proposed. That is a better way of doing things: to have a clear and formal partnership with good local authorities that will allow these things to develop and allow a voice.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="11101730000004"></a>In Battersea, which is within Wandsworth-a good Conservative council; it has been that for a long time-one still does not get that sort of bite on the way that things happen locally. I cannot afford to move to Richmond, so I am rather keen that we do something that will bite on my local council and to get to the position where we have within a neighbourhood plan some things to give urban communities a hold on things that they care about. I have picked two examples of the right way to go about it. That way, we have a hope of using the Bill to create vibrant urban communities that will have a real effect on what happens locally, which is mostly an apparition of the power of the local council. I am not addicted to this way of doing it. However, it is very important that we take this chance to try to create strong, geographically based-rather than racially or spiritually based-neighbourhood communities in cities. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="11101730000005"></a><b><a name="111017-0002.htm_spnew53"></a><a name="11101730000112"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, this is another interesting series of amendments tabled by the noble Lord. I cannot but agree with the proposition that doing what we can to build and empower strong local communities must be right. I am not sure that the prescription which the noble Lord offers is right in its totality, particularly on road traffic regulations. In my experience, if one wants to engage a community one has a consultation on pedestrianisation, a one-way  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_78"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>system or residents' parking and sees what the response is. If a council sought to impose something like that without proper consultation, we would certainly see the spirit of the community engendered by those events. However, if we gave each neighbourhood particular powers, for example over pedestrianisation, we would face a clear issue of the view taken by adjoining neighbourhoods. We would almost need to reinvent the duty to co-operate at neighbourhood forum level if we went down this path. The basic proposition to use the opportunities that the Bill presents to enliven, empower and engage communities in an urban setting is absolutely right, but I am not sure whether the prescription of the noble Lord is the best way to achieve it.</p>

<p><a name="st_170"></a>
<a name="11101730000006"></a><b><a name="111017-0002.htm_spnew54"></a><a name="11101730000113"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> My Lords, Amendment 210AA would allow neighbourhood development orders to restrict permitted development rights in a neighbourhood area in order to preserve local amenities. Neighbourhood planning has been designed as a new addition to the existing planning system. It is permissive in nature. Therefore, it adds to existing permitted development rights rather than removing rights that already exist. Neighbourhood planning is at the forefront of delivering the Government's reforms and it should not be used to stop or restrict development. Rather, it gives people a real opportunity to shape and influence the places where they live. We need to ensure that the ambitions of people for their neighbourhood are consistent with the needs and ambitions of the residents of the wider area. I listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, when he spoke about cities and the effect on neighbourhood planning there. I have a lot of sympathy with the fact that local communities often do not come together, but part of the neighbourhood planning ought to ensure that groups are coming together to discuss all the issues around planning.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="11101730000007"></a>My concern with Amendment 210AB is that it would extend the powers available to communities to control the development and planning of their local areas by amending the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. It would expand the local authority's ability to make traffic regulation orders and by-laws to preserve or improve a local area's amenities. This is not strictly related to the neighbourhood planning provisions being introduced by the Bill, but does relate to the Government's wider commitment to extend the powers of local authorities and communities to shape their local areas.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="11101730000008"></a>First, I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that I support the principle that local authorities and communities should have a greater say in safeguarding local amenities. Similarly, the planning of a neighbourhood should be a holistic process that looks beyond just land-use planning matters to the wider community well-being of an area. A community may use the opportunity of preparing a neighbourhood plan to discuss its priorities for transport in the area. However, there are two key issues with the amendment. First, because neighbourhood plans form part of the statutory development plan for a local area, they can relate only to the development and use of land. Secondly, traffic regulations and by-laws should be a measure of last resort in achieving the goals of sustainable transport that the noble Lord seeks. By-laws create criminal offences intended to

If used inappropriately, they can have a significant adverse effect on the local environment and economy. They should be employed only when all other measures have failed. Therefore, this amendment is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="11101730000009"></a>Again, I do not want to undermine the noble Lord's principle of making sure that local neighbourhoods have the opportunity to discuss the things that affect them. If ever there was anything that affected them, it is traffic, parking and so on. However, this cannot be dealt with under localism in this part of the Bill, which covers neighbourhood planning. As a wider objective, I do not think that anybody would have any disagreement with the idea that local neighbourhoods should be at the forefront of thinking about the wider things that matter to them. It is just not appropriate here. I hope that with those explanations, the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

It is clear that I am not going to get anywhere. However, I shall come back to this when we get our next opportunity, because I have been converted by the Government's enthusiasm for localism.

The committee has received the Government's formal response and welcomes the opportunity to press them on points raised in the report in the light of recent developments. I am grateful to the Members of the Justice and Institutions Sub-Committee, our clerk, advisers and witnesses, who gave both oral and written evidence.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="11101730000012"></a>We embarked on our inquiry, first, because of the extension of the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice into the area of freedom, justice and security as a result of the Lisbon treaty, and the potential work that that may create. Secondly, there is the potential impact of the expansion of the European Union from 15 to 27 member states, and the Court's published analysis of its workload, which shows an average time of more than 33 months for a competition case before the General Court.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="11101730000013"></a>For the record, since all noble Lords participating in the debate are aware of the position, I will make it clear that the Court of Justice of the European Union comprises three courts: the Court of Justice, the General Court and the Civil Service Tribunal. Any reference that I make in this debate to the Court of Justice refers to the first and highest court, not the Court of Justice of the European Union. For the benefit of too many media commentators, none of them has anything to do with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="11101730000014"></a>Our evidence was drawn from professional bodies, a former advocate-general, representatives of the Commission and the Attorney-General. Discussions were held in Luxembourg at the Court with the three United Kingdom judges serving within the three courts of the Court of Justice of the European Union and with the president of the General Court.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="11101730000015"></a>May I make two general comments which relate to the Court of Justice of the European Union as a whole before turning to the separate courts? Firstly, the Union is based on the rule of law and respect for human rights. The Court is a vital institution for the proper functioning of the Union. For example, while some question some aspects of European Union policy,  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_81"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>without the Court we have nothing to buttress the operation of the single market, which is so much more complicated than a trade deal and is essential for our interests.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="11101730000016"></a>Secondly, the amount of money is quite small. Of a 2011 European Union budget of €126,527 million, the cost of the Court is just over a quarter of 1 per cent. It is often assumed that the need for translation is the cause of cost and delay. This was not our conclusion. Of course translation has its cost, but not everything is automatically translated into the 23 official languages. Everything is translated into French, which is the working language of the Court. This is the case for historical reasons and some have suggested that an additional language be added, but to add another would only add cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="11101730000017"></a>In the Court of Justice, which deals with preliminary references on points of European law referred from national courts, the reference is sent out to all member states in their language for their observations. The judgment in each case is also translated, which is not unreasonable given that the judgment is of universal application to the Union and everyone in all member states should be able to read it in their own language. Contrary again to much popular belief, using other languages is not a luxury, as not everyone everywhere speaks English or, for that matter, French or German. In the case of the General Court and the Civil Service Tribunal, the language regime is much more restricted and may only be the language of the Court and the parties, and only judgments of particular interest are the subject of translation into all official languages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="11101730000018"></a>Turning to the individual courts, we looked first at the Court of Justice, which may be described as the supreme court of the European Union. The majority of its workload relates to preliminary references to which I have already referred. The number of judges is laid down in the treaty-one per member state-and they are assisted by advocates-general, who give the Court a written opinion which is not binding. The number of advocates-general may be increased by unanimity without treaty change and we recommend that this be done to assist the Court in increasing the speed at which cases are dealt with. We believe that the Court of Justice faces a crisis in its workload following the expansion of membership and the expansion of its jurisdiction into freedom, justice and security.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="11101730000019"></a>The Court of Justice has had a good record in managing its workload in the past, but in this it was helped by an automatic increase in the number of judges following enlargement but that predated the expansion of jurisdiction and the work now flowing from enlargement. The General Court, however, is where we believe that the problem lies. The General Court deals with almost all the cases brought against the institutions and agencies of the European Union. These are often complex, involving both written and oral evidence. We found that the General Court has significant problems in managing its current and likely future workload.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="11101730000020"></a>We proposed a number of solutions. We accepted that there may be a case for better case management but we were of the opinion that that would not solve the essential problem. We also gave consideration to the creation of additional specialist chambers similar  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_82"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 82</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the model of the Civil Service Tribunal, but we rejected this as a long-term solution. The Civil Service Tribunal is a special case dealing with internal European Union staff matters. Its significance is quite different from that of the Court of Justice and the General Court. It has been a success and we found no reason to recommend any changes. But in our opinion it is not the right model to follow for the General Court. We agree with the Luxembourg judges that more specialist tribunals would diminish the character of the Court as a general court combining a mixed expertise. Those judges appointed to the tribunals would have reduced or few opportunities to sit in the General Court and, similarly, the judges of the General Court would have few opportunities to sit in the tribunals.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="11101730000021"></a>Additional judges can be appointed to the General Court without treaty change, and this in our opinion is the answer to the problem. Without specifying a particular number, we suggested an increase of a third. The Government in their written response do not seem convinced that the problem is as serious as we believe and certainly do not warm to the idea of more judges other than in a specialist tribunal.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="11101730000022"></a>Since we reported, matters have moved on and the committee currently holds under scrutiny three proposals for reform of the Court of Justice of the EU. The first is a proposal from the Court: to create within its number a vice-president; to amend the rules relating to the composition of the grand chamber; to abolish the rule requiring the reading of the judge rapporteur's report at the oral hearing; and to increase the General Court judges from 27 to 39. There is a second proposal for the revision of the Court of Justice rules of procedure to take account of changes of workload. Thirdly, there is a draft regulation to allow the appointment of temporary judges drawn from the ranks of retired judges to assist the Civil Service Tribunal, which seems to us to be eminently sensible and an economic way of dealing with the short-term problem. We have welcomed all these but the Government seem to lack some enthusiasm, save for the revision of the rules of procedure.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="11101730000023"></a>While we have the original response to our report, in the light of recent developments will the Government please give active and urgent consideration to increasing the number of judges in the General Court? If not, what is their alternative solution, bearing in mind that even specialist tribunals, which we do not favour, will cost money? Will the Government also consider the recommendation in our report that, before approving legislation, an assessment of the possible impact of such legislation on the Court of Justice of the European Union should be undertaken?</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="11101730000024"></a>Lastly, will the Government also take account of the observations of Sir Konrad Schiemann which is referred to in Appendix 4 of the report, in which he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a><a name="11101730000096"></a>"The Court had to interpret legislation which had been designed by politicians whose political priority was the achievement of a formula, if necessary at the expense of a clear formula. Where the original legislation was imprecise, the Court was required to intervene. This was often the case with Directives, but could also be seen in the Treaties themselves".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="11101730000025"></a>As so often when governments look to others to solve the problems, this could be an example of where the Council could assist by remembering that, in many

I am very pleased to have been a member of the sub-committee which undertook this investigation and I want first of all to pay tribute to our chairman in guiding us through what I believe was a very good report with a deftness of touch, and also to the staff, the clerks and the legal advisers who gave excellent advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="11101730000027"></a>I want to address the issue of judges and resources in the courts. In a time of austerity, for a lawyer to make a plea for more resources and more judges in a court may sound like special pleading if not perverse. To ask for such resources for European institutions is always asking for trouble. In the popular mind, a European court is one that interferes with British interests, perhaps to the detriment of parliamentary sovereignty. The failure in the popular mind to distinguish clearly between the European Court of Human Rights on the one hand and the Court of Justice of the European Union on the other makes the task even more difficult. Yet it is apparent from our report that the delays in the Court process as a result of the situation that now faces the Court are a significant impediment to economic activity and the achievement of the goals of the European Union.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="11101730000028"></a>The committee was particularly concerned about the workload of the General Court, which deals with cases that turn crucially on the assessment of often large amounts of factual material, including competition cases where challenges to the decisions of the Commission, which themselves run into 600 pages, may generate files that contain 20,000 pages or more. Competition cases now represent 10 per cent of the workload of the General Court, and the average turnaround for all cases, including competition cases, is 33 months. As the CBI has said, an average turnaround of 33 months in competition cases is simply unacceptable. It cites the particular example of the ICI case which, exceptionally, took over nine years to be resolved.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="11101730000029"></a>The move to have decisions under the EU regulation on the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals-the so-called REACH regime-from the European Chemicals Agency subject to appeal in the General Court will undoubtedly increase pressure on that court. One estimate suggests that there may be over 2 million applications to the European Chemicals Agency, and there is real concern that the General Court may be overwhelmed as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="11101730000030"></a>One way of helping to ease this is by the creation of specialist tribunals taking some of the work-trade marks have been suggested-away from the General Court. As we have already heard, the committee considered that specialist chambers were a more efficient way of proceeding because they would allow judges to be redeployed within the Court structure to cope with

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="11101730000031"></a>In my submission, we cannot get away from the need to increase the number of judges in the General Court. To that extent, I was pleased to see the response from the Government in the letter of 4 July to the chairman of the European Union Committee. The Minister, Mr Lidington, said that the Government were working actively with other members discussing the size of the judiciary in the General Court. Will the Minister tell us what progress has been made on that issue?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="11101730000032"></a>Turning to the Court of Justice, we believe that there are problems ahead. It is true that the present workload is being coped with, but we saw a crisis looming because of the number of new cases that are likely to come forward from the new states following enlargement and the new jurisdiction in freedom, security and justice. It is clear that these pressures are going to be there, and I was disappointed to see in the same response that the Minister is not convinced that the Court of Justice is facing an imminent crisis without any real specification of that. What evidence does the Minister have to counter that of the committee that the Court of Justice is indeed facing a crisis? How imminent it is may be a matter of conjecture, but does he agree with the committee that something needs to be done, and done soon, otherwise we will face further problems?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="11101730000033"></a>I believe that this is a good report that will set a benchmark for the future of the Court if the Government act in conjunction with other member states. I will be pleased to hear in general what the Government's response is to this report.</p>

As he said, we are deeply grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, for being chairman of the committee and for having launched and taken the initiative on this report. We had an enormous amount of expert advice and guidance from our officials and special advisers, and I warmly thank them for it.

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="11101730000036"></a>We know what kind of reception Europe gets in the British press. I hope that the situation will be a little easier now after the hacking scandal. There may be no connection at all, but you never know. There might be a bit of luck in that and most, though not all, of the British press might be more serious about reporting and carrying stories about European institutions. The wicked Commission is attacked far more often than the European Court of Justice because the European Court of Justice is harder to explain to the ordinary reader. I am not criticising the ordinary reader; it is just one of those things with highfaluting, high-level courts. However, it is essential that there should be more explanation because it is embarrassing when people get the Council of Europe mixed up with the European Union.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="11101730000037"></a>Despite the workload problems and the excessive time taken to deal with cases, the European Court of Justice does a very good job on behalf of the citizens of this country, who under the Maastricht treaty are also citizens of the whole of the European Union. I wish that British newspapers would sometimes remind us of that important reality. A British citizen is not just a patriotic citizen of our own country; he or she is also able to work, operate, retire and travel in the European Union as well as to use the facilities of the European judicial system mainly under the General Court of the ECJ-not so much the staff court, the European Union Civil Service Tribunal, which is a separate matter-in order to deal with things in a way which is much more just than many people in this country think because of the poison in the press. It is tragic that they should believe that.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="11101730000038"></a>I suppose that that happens to a lesser extent in other countries, and perhaps also on a case-by-case basis, but here there is general agreement in the printed press that Europe is a bad thing and that the European institutions, the Commission and the European Parliament are menaces. The Council of Ministers is all right because that is member Governments, but even that comes in for attack if it does not agree with what the British Government are suggesting. This nonsense really ought to stop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="11101730000039"></a>The recommendations in the report are very important. The suggestion of increasing the number of judges by one-third is important. I hope that my noble and learned friend Lord Wallace of Tankerness will respond on that. I think it is very important to bear in mind that although there are no severe problems like this in the European Union Civil Service Tribunal, the sentiments about it expressed in paragraph 54 need to be looked at quite carefully. Coming back to the ECJ itself, and the need to get the workload down, and to increase the number of judges in the General Court, this needs to be done with some urgency.</p>

At the hearing, the Attorney-General kept on harping about financial problems and problems of government spending and that we had to be very careful-of course that is a general position that a lot of people accept-but really these are small amounts of money. The idea that a court's functioning would be impaired and would suffer not just at the margin but quite significantly in its general activities because of a lack of funds is totally unacceptable, particularly in the international context. This is a treaty-based institution, where we have to work with our fellow member states, and I think sometimes they psychologically and in an ineffable way seem to give much more support to these institutions than we do in Britain.</p>

I hope I do not misrepresent them when I say that they are both enthusiastic supporters of our membership of the European Union-I am glad to see the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, confirming that-and so we can go onwards and upwards with this excellent report and get some good responses from the Government tonight.</p>

Like a rather large number of Members of this House, I am something of a veteran of European treaties and the institutional changes that have flowed from them: Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon-I have been through them all. I have sat through and taken part in some of the debates we have had.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="11101730000043"></a>If we retrospectively reflected on the experience of treaty change and institutional change, I have a sneaking suspicion that we would find a rather high proportion of either unintended consequences of those changes or that at least the assessment of what impact these changes would make has often been wrong or ill conceived. My noble and learned friend Lord Boyd made a reference to one such glaring example to which we draw attention in our report, in paragraph 52, on the European Chemicals Agency. This was established on an assumption that there would be only 250,000 licences granted. As my noble friend has said, the figure is now likely to be 2 million. As the president of the General Court said in evidence, a proportion of them will be challenged so it is inevitable that the workload of the General Court will increase. Here is a perfect example of the way in which treaty change was made or institutions were established without any effective impact assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="11101730000044"></a>This strengthens our case for being, if not pessimistic, realistic about the that the changes of the Lisbon treaty will have on the work of the Court of Justice. The Lisbon treaty created a fundamental change in the architecture, destroying the whole of that third pillar and bringing within the jurisdiction of the Court  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_87"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Justice the areas of freedom, security and justice. What will flow from that is a very significant increase in the workload of the European Court of Justice. It was flagged up first by our European Union Committee in 2007-08 in what I thought was the most thorough and wonderful scrutiny of the impact of the Lisbon treaty. On page 127, the European Union Committee flagged up that there would be problems with the workload of the Court of Justice as a result of this change and the inclusion of this extra jurisdiction.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="11101730000045"></a>We have followed that up and have confirmed those concerns in our report. In paragraphs 42 and 43, we spell out that it is not simply a matter of more cases but that they will be in areas likely to generate much more difficult and important forms of litigation, and that for the first time the Court will be dealing with individuals in custody, and therefore will need speedy justice, a fast-track approach. Indeed, that is presumably partly why in the Lisbon treaty there is a fast-track procedure to deal with it. If one reads further on what this fast-track procedure is, the assumption was that 10 or fewer cases a year would be fast-tracked. Now we suspect that with the changes that have occurred to the jurisdiction there will be a lot more fast-tracked cases. There will be two consequences of that. First, it could displace other, less urgent cases to be dealt with over a longer and longer time. Secondly, in the annexe to our report, on page 67, it says that if there were an increase in fast-track cases,</p>
<ul><a name="11101730000098"></a>"the number of cases that the Court could handle ... would decrease sharply"-</ul>
<p><a name="11101730000088"></a>because of the nature of fast-tracking, there is going to be a very significant potential displacement of other cases. I do not think we are being alarmist in saying to the House and to Ministers that this is going to create a much greater problem than is being recognised at the moment.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="11101730000046"></a>When I joined our chairman and two others in going to Luxembourg, I was rather surprised by how rather sanguine many of the Court administrators were about the impact these changes are going to have on the work of the Court of Justice. Sadly, not only did I find them sanguine in Luxembourg, I now find that Ministers here are sanguine. The letter from Mr Lidington says that he is not convinced that the Court is facing an imminent crisis. I do not know what imminent means, but certainly within the next two or three years we are going to see a very significant increase and significant pressure. It is not unjustifiable to present it as a potential crisis, with which Ministers do not appear to be fully engaged.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="11101730000047"></a>I hope tonight when the noble and learned Lord replies that we will at least have something more than the replies we have had so far to our reports, and of course to the other suggestions that have been made by the Court itself since our report came out. Reading Ministers' responses so far, it appears that they are very good at telling us what they do not want to do but not at telling us how they are going to handle the crisis. I think they are in a state of semi-denial that there is a crisis on the horizon and I hope tonight to be enlightened not only on the proposals they have but to be reassured that in fact they appreciate and understand the potential seriousness that the courts face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="11101730000049"></a>It is clear that everyone agrees that European courts, both the Luxembourg courts-the Court of Justice and particularly the General Court-and the Strasbourg court, the European Court of Human Rights, are overloaded. I need not go into the position of the Strasbourg court, but there are 160,000 cases pending and the numbers are increasing annually at a rate of 12.5 per cent. There is of course now a linkage between the Luxembourg court and the Strasbourg court, with the EU becoming a party to the European Convention on Human Rights, and there is therefore a danger of possible further delays.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="11101730000050"></a>The Government may be reluctant to call the position of the Court of Justice a crisis, but there is clearly a major problem of delays, as the CBI pointed out, which are relevant to our business, and therefore something has to change. Even if the intellectual property cases were shunted into a separate court, that would still leave a backlog of 1,000 cases before the General Court, where much of the work is of course consideration of fact. That is roughly two years' work if one sees that perhaps 500 cases are concluded in a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="11101730000051"></a>What, then, to do? The editorial in the most recent edition of the <I>Common Market Law Review</I>, which again is a tribute to the committee's work, stated as follows:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a><a name="11101730000097"></a>"It would seem that by now, all the possible options for reform and their respective pros and cons have been on the table several times ... a big leap seems inescapable. It is only a matter of time".</p>

<p><a name="11101730000052"></a>The Government thus far seem to want to avoid a big leap. Their proposed changes range from: reducing the supply of cases; changes to the rules of procedure-and the Government state that there is little prospect of member states agreeing to a degree of autonomy of the Court in respect of its own procedures; broader, better case management; more new specialist courts; and the appointment of more judges.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="11101730000053"></a>Clearly there is a need to look at procedures; the editorial states that essentially the procedures of the court reflect the Court's role as an administrative court carrying out judicial review in respect of the activities of member states, when increasingly now the emphasis has changed to references from member states for preliminary rulings.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para125"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="11101730000054"></a>The Government appear to oppose limits on pleadings to cut down more prolix advocates, and the Court's potential powers to dispense with oral hearings. As one of our colleagues said earlier, we know what the Government are against; we do not know what the Government are for. The Government are surely not just outside observers but should be active participants in these debates.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="11101730000055"></a>There must surely be some scope, despite what the committee says, for a reduction in translation. French is of course the working language, for understandable

Alas, there is clearly a veto possible for the French Government, so we cannot see much change there.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="11101730000056"></a>Changes in the structure of the Court have helped in the past. In 2005 the Civil Service Tribunal was established, and the committee calls it a success story. Some 30 years or so ago I was writing the section on the European courts in <I>The S</I><I>olicitors</I><I>'</I><I></I><I>D</I><I>iary</I>, and it was clear at that time that there was too much able judge power on cases that were relatively trivial, save for the individuals concerned, and that would have gone to employment tribunals in the UK. That was 30 years ago. It took all that time to set up this specialist court, which perhaps does not augur well for changes to come about in a timely fashion.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="11101730000057"></a>The case against further specialist tribunals and in favour of an increase in the number of judges is set out persuasively in the letter of the president of the Court to the president of the Council: that there are risks in relation to consistency, the flexibility of judge power, the speed of implementation and so on. The letter states that an increase in the number of judges in the General Court is,</p>
<ul><a name="11101730000099"></a>"essential ... to reduce within a short time the volume of cases pending before the court and the duration of proceedings".</ul>
<a name="111017-0002.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="11101730000058"></a>If it is true that it could be solved in only a short time, one must ask why the large increase from 27 to 39 should be permanent, and what the prospects are of a reduction in the future if the case load were to warrant it.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="11101730000059"></a>There is clearly now a conflict between the views of a number of member states and the president of the Court. This is a matter of judgment in respect of both the costs and the efficient running of the courts. There is probably no prospect now of an outside independent expert being asked to report on the comparative costs, as this would only lead to further delay.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="11101730000060"></a>However, I end where a number of colleagues have ended. It is uncertain where Her Majesty's Government stand, so perhaps the Minister will clarify for us on which side the Government stand. Are the Government leaning towards more specialist tribunals, with all the problems set out by the president, or do they now accept the case for an increase in the number of judges in the General Court?</p>

It once again shows the value of our European Union Select Committee and the work that it does. The subject of the Court of Justice is-and I come on to this in a moment or two-a subject that arouses great passions in some quarters, but this is a model of a balanced report based on careful study of evidence and entirely non-partisan  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_90"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 90</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in its spirit, and I think, as the Opposition do, that the Government would do well to heed its recommendations.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="11101730000063"></a>My only regret-and it is a point that I have made about these reports before-is that it was completed at the end of March and we are now debating it in the second half of October. In this case, it so happens that the report and its recommendations remain relevant, topical and timely, but that is not always the case, and we should give these Select Committee reports a high priority in our work.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para133"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="11101730000064"></a>Obviously there is a real problem about the Court's growing case load. I looked up how many cases the ECJ had before it or had settled in the year before we joined the European Community in 1970, and the number was 70. In 2010, the figure was 574, which tells you something about the expanded scope of the European Union's work. I agree with my noble friend Lord Rowlands that some of this is the result of unintended consequences, but at the same time one also has to acknowledge the technical complexity of operating a single market as seen in the REACH chemicals directive or the extension of the scope of European activity into areas such as criminal justice, because our security depends on our interdependence with our neighbours. This will inevitably bring more work into the remit of the Court.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para134"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="11101730000065"></a>In one respect, the letter that we have received from the Minister for Europe, the right honourable David Lidington, is encouraging. It acknowledges that there is a workload problem, and it is encouraging that the Government are having discussions about this. However, the sentence,</p>
<ul><a name="11101730000100"></a>"we are not convinced that the court is facing an imminent crisis",</ul>
<p><a name="11101730000066"></a>suggests to me that the Government are not grappling with this issue with the urgency that they should.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="11101730000067"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Boyd of Duncansby, explained how the delays in the Court are very damaging. If you look at the evidence on how long cases such as competition cases take to get resolved-33 months-that is not terribly satisfactory from anyone's point of view. It is not satisfactory on grounds of efficiency and justice, nor does it happen to be in Britain's national interest. We need an effective Court, as we need an effective Commission, to police the single market's rules. Perhaps I may make an obvious point that is worth repeating again and again; there is a huge contradiction in the attitude of Eurosceptics towards the European Union. They say that they joined only a single market and that all they want is a single market, but they refuse to accept that the functioning of the single market depends on effective supranational institutions such as the Commission and the Court: that you cannot have one without the other. I would like the Government-I know that the pro-European half, or section, of the Government is facing me from the Front Bench-to feel that the whole of the Government recognise the truth of that argument: namely, that it is in Britain's national interest to have an effective ECJ.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para136"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="11101730000068"></a>There are Members in the other place who have strong views about the ECJ. I was very alarmed to read that Mr George Eustice, in this new group of Eurosceptic Conservative Back-Benchers that was

That is the attitude in important sections of the governing party.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para137"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="11101730000069"></a>The fundamental reason why these sensible proposals are not being squarely addressed by the Government is because of this politics, which is getting into very dangerous territory. Some Members in the other place have attacked individual British Members. One attacked the British Advocate-General, Eleanor Sharpston, just because she happened to be, in their view, on the wrong side in the metric martyrs case. That kind of populist approach to the European Court is quite unacceptable. We need to see on the part of the Government a willingness to deal with these issues in the kind of objective manner that is in our national interest, as this report recommends. I commend the report to the House.</p>

I think the first call for evidence was in the summer of 2010 and that the report was published just one week after the president of the Court published his proposals. The fact that it was timely shows the foresight of the committee in identifying what is undoubtedly a very important issue.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para138"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="11101730000071"></a>I believe that the report's conclusions and recommendations have been a valuable contribution to the current debate. We have heard those conclusions and recommendations echoed in the contributions this evening, which I will seek to address. It is important that we take this opportunity to discuss these matters. The noble Lord, Lord Anderson, asked what the Government believe in. They believe very much in the effective and uniform interpretation, application and enforcement of European Union law across the Union, which was a point well made by my noble friend Lord Bowness in his opening remarks.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para139"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="11101730000072"></a>We believe that the Court of Justice has a vital role to play in ensuring that member states and European Union institutions act in accordance with the treaties. It is therefore essential to the functioning of the single market that it ensures that there is a level playing field for United Kingdom businesses operating in other member states, and vital in upholding the rights under European Union law of British citizens living and working in other member states. That point was well made by my noble friend Lord Dykes, who emphasised that the Court has that important role in safeguarding the rights of people who are not only United Kingdom citizens but citizens of the European Union.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para140"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="11101730000073"></a>Accordingly, the Government share your Lordships' views that the Court of Justice of the European Union is in need of reform in order to work through its  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_92"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 92</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sizeable backlog of cases and to reduce the time taken to process cases in the future. I can confirm that since the publication of the committee's report, officials have been engaged in discussions with their counterparts in the European Union about reform of the Court, following on a set of six recommendations made by the president of the Court to the Council. Discussion has continued between officials and at ministerial level on a bilateral basis and within the Council. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Boyd of Duncansby, asked about that. I can confirm that there have been meetings. In July, the Minister for Europe raised the issue at the General Affairs Council. As I have indicated, discussions continue at a working level, most recently on Friday of last week. The Government are engaging constructively in these meetings with an open mind. We certainly see merits in a number of the recommendations, to which I will deal with in more detail.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para141"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="11101730000074"></a>I am sure your Lordships' House will forgive me for not divulging the details of working group discussions, which by their very nature are confidential, but I can indicate in the broadest terms that officials of the United Kingdom Government have been focusing on negotiating changes to the Court's structure and its rules of procedure, which would enhance the quality of the Court's judgments and reduce the turnaround time of cases while emphasising-it is important to emphasise this and to remind ourselves of the need for-cost efficiency. In the current economic climate, it is vital to ensure value for money for our taxpayers, and the proposals that the Court makes must be assessed according to financial and budgetary implications. Indeed, I think that even the summary of the conclusions of the committee's report acknowledged that there were cost implications.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para142"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="11101730000075"></a>As the debate has made clear, the most significant reform under discussion is the composition of the General Court and specifically the question of how to expand its capacity. I will perhaps deal with that in more detail later. We know that the committee proposed an increase of one-third to 36 members. The president of the Court has tabled a proposal to add to the number of members of the General Court by 12 judges, which is of course one of the key subjects under discussion within the Council. As has been identified, and as I will elaborate, there are other possible options, such as the creation of a specialist trademark court or specialist chambers within the General Court, for managing trademark cases. Officials are considering how each would improve the efficiency of the court, the political and legal implications that they would have and the financial ramifications.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para143"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="11101730000076"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Boyd of Duncansby, and the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, asked whether there was an imminent crisis. Although we recognise the huge challenge with regard to the General Court, the report itself, as well as contributors to the debate this evening, recognises that the Court of Justice has done a remarkable job in managing its case load. It was in that context that we did not accept that there is an imminent crisis with regard to Court of Justice-I think the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, said "potential crisis". Clearly this is something that we want to focus on to ensure that it continues to build on the advances that it has made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="11101730000077"></a>The report itself recommended that there should be the appointment of extra Advocates-General. It is not clear what evidence this is based on. Significantly, it is not one of the proposals which the Court itself felt was necessary when the president of the Court put forward its proposals. Other measures have come forward from the president of the Court that we would aim to assist: the possibility of the appointment of a vice-president, and the proposal with regard to how grand chamber might be restructured. We are looking at that seriously. We want to ensure that, in doing so, there is continuity, across the courts, of the jurisprudence of the Court. That particular proposal is somewhat complex.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para145"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="11101730000078"></a>On the issue that was described in your Lordships' report as the "green light", we would not necessarily go as far as that but we think it is of considerable importance, when national courts are framing their reference, that they do so concisely. We would certainly encourage them to put forward any proposal and conclusions that they may have reached in framing that reference, so that when the Court of Justice looks at these preliminary references it is very focused on the particular issues.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para146"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="11101730000079"></a>My noble friend Lord Bowness made some specific points, reminding us that the Council also legislates. Those points were extremely well made. Certainly the Government are seeking to ensure that there is clarity not only for those who subsequently have to interpret the law in the courts but perhaps most importantly for those who have to implement the law in their businesses and daily lives. That is certainly the objective of the negotiations, but I think it is also fair to say that, in a negotiation involving 27 member states, that objective is not always as easy to achieve as one might hope.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para147"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="11101730000080"></a>A similar answer applies to the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, and my noble friend Lord Bowness about the legislative implications of certain decisions. Perhaps that should not be a counsel of perfection. It ought to be given attention, but again I suspect that that is easier to say, and to make exhortations for, than it is to deliver in the legislation itself.</p>

There are issues there which need to be considered. There is not yet any evidence of that coming through, but it is not something to which we are turning a blind eye. According to the Court of Justice's report on its work in 2010-after the Lisbon Treaty came into force-the use of the urgent preliminary measure in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice was requested in six cases, and granted in five. It is of course relevant to the work of the Court of Justice in its consideration of preliminary references, which is its other main volume of work. It is less

I shall come onto that, as there is agreement across the House that there are quite clearly issues as regards the work of the General Court.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para148"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="11101730000083"></a>We fully recognise that there are issues that need to be considered in terms of the particular problems which the General Court is facing. Justice delayed is justice denied: it is a phrase which trips off the tongue, but it is one with substance and truth. The position of the General Court is one to which we are giving our attention. The proposal on the table is the one that has come from the President of the Court. It is that there should be an increase in the size of the Court by nine. The House has reasonably asked about our position with regard to the consideration of a specialist trademark court or specialist chambers within the General Court. We see merit in the proposal put forward by the committee of your Lordships' House of increasing the number and we are considering it against our basic criteria of quality of judgments, their timeliness and cost-effectiveness. That is why we are not ruling it out, but why we also believe that some of the other options ought to be given consideration too.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para149"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="11101730000084"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Boyd of Duncansby, referred to the letter sent on 4 July by my right honourable friend the Minister for Europe to the noble Lord, Lord Roper. He pointed out that while he recognised the point that judges on a specialist tribunal may not be widely deployable, creating a specialist tribunal would free up judges in the General Court currently working on trademark cases to deal with other types of case. It is important to note that judges currently dealing with trademark cases, which form a substantial part of the General Court's work, would be freed up for other work. The Commission itself said in its response to the President's proposals, published at the end of last month, that it has looked at the possibility of specialist chambers within the General Court. It is important that these options are fully explored with regard to what will deliver the best in terms of efficiency, speed and quality of judgment.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para150"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="11101730000085"></a>However, as I have indicated, we cannot ignore the question of finance. I take the point made by my noble friend Lord Dykes that in the totality of the European Union budget it may appear a small matter, but nevertheless it is the Government's position that there should be no increase in real terms over the next spending period. We want to examine the costs of the different options. The estimate of the Court itself on an increase of 12 judges is some €13 million. We would want to drill down on that and ask why the cost is more than €1 million per extra judge. We would also wish to look at the fact that the Court has had over the past year an underspend of €5.5 million. It is not unreasonable, in exploring the different options, to bear in mind the costs and to try to ensure that we not only achieve what is best in terms of speed of delivery, but also that there is efficient use of taxpayers' money-not just that of British taxpayers, but of taxpayers throughout Europe.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para151"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="11101730000086"></a>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Boyd, said, we recognise that delay sometimes brings its own costs, and that must be part of the equation, but we feel that  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_95"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 95</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>considerably more work could be done, not least given the fact that there was a €5.5 million underspend of the Court's budget last year. Obviously, as the committee itself indicated, it may be possible to find funds by deprioritising other parts of the budget.</p>

<a name="111017-0002.htm_para152"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="11101730000087"></a>I hope I have emphasised the fact that the Government take this issue seriously. We appreciate the constructive proposals that have been put forward. As I have indicated, we are not ruling out the possibility of an increase in judges. At the present time, the proposal on the table is for an extra 12 judges, which has come from the President of the Court. We are giving these matters detailed consideration through working groups and at ministerial level. We are also conscious that the outcome in the end should be to ensure that the Court of Justice, as one of the institutions of the European Union, delivers and serves the wider purposes both of the Union itself and of European citizens. They should be on the receiving end of justice when the call comes for it. I hope that I have reassured your Lordships that we are taking this matter seriously and working diligently to get the right outcome in terms of speed, quality and cost-effectiveness.</p>

Turning first to Clause 111 on retrospective planning applications, these amendments will, I think, allay the concerns raised by my noble friend Lord Avebury in Committee. He thought that the drafting of what is now Clause 111 was ambiguous in that it might be possible for a local planning authority to negate the purpose of this clause by both declining to determine a retrospective planning   


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_96"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>application and arguing that an enforcement appeal on ground (a) was also inadmissible. These amendments solve the problem. Amendment 211A specifies that the enforcement notice in question must be "pre-existing". Amendment 211B defines a "pre-existing enforcement notice" as one that was issued before the application-being the retrospective application-was received by the local planning authority. To paraphrase what my noble friend Lord Taylor of Holbeach said in Committee, our policy is that those people seeking planning permission after the event should have one, but only one, bite at the cherry.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="1110182000002"></a>I move on to Clause 115, on powers in relation to unauthorized advertisements. In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, supported by my noble friend Lord Black of Brentwood, was concerned that the provision for serving a removal notice for an allegedly illegal advertisement hoarding was not subject to a right of appeal to a local magistrates' court, but only by means of a judicial review. Since that debate the Government have been convinced by the arguments made. We have therefore come forward with Amendments 213A, 213B, 213C and 214A. Amendment 213A says that removal notices should be subject to a right of appeal. Amendments 213B and 213C are minor drafting amendments for consistency of expression. Amendment 214A contains the right of appeal itself. The format of the right is very similar to those in new Sections 225C and 225H further on in Clause 115, but with some small differences to reflect that this right of appeal applies to notices requiring the removal of advertisement hoardings, rather than fly-posting or graffiti. I therefore hope that these amendments will meet the concerns of the noble Lords, together with their colleagues, the noble Lords, Lord Smith of Finsbury and Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank. I therefore also urge the noble Lords not to press their Amendments 214 to 223, which have the same purpose as the government amendments, but do not quite work in the way intended. I beg to move.</p>

We were concerned in Committee that advertisers ought to have a right of appeal to magistrates' courts against orders for removal of structures for the display of ads. They ought to have a right of appeal against orders made by planning authorities. There have in the past been such rights of appeal outside London and we were concerned that fairness suggests that that right should also exist within London and not just through the more expensive procedure of seeking a judicial review in the High Court. The amendments have, of course, been put down again at this stage, but one has learnt over the weeks-and it is now confirmed by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt of Greetland-that the Government have moved considerably on the matter. As it seems that the government amendments are satisfactory from the point of view that I have mentioned, I will at the appropriate moment not press the non-government amendments in this group.</p>

In talking to this group, I declare an interest as a director of the Advertising Standards Board of Finance. I first raised this issue at Second Reading with the health warning that it appeared to be a rather dry and technical issue. So it is, but it has been an important issue to a substantial industry. The outdoor advertising industry in the UK is worth well over a billion pounds and accounts for 10 per cent of all display advertising, employing, directly or indirectly, about 15,000 people. It is also a very responsible industry and is fully committed to the codes of advertising practice enforced by the Advertising Standards Authority. Although the noble Lord, Lord Smith, may be able to tell us more, complaints about outdoor advertisements have, as I understand it, dropped by more than 30 per cent in the past year or so. It is absolutely right that we should do what we can to support the industry, and the Government's amendments-which will give the industry real local power over appeals against enforcement notices-do just that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="1110182000011"></a>This has happened to me in both London and the country. I supported the application in the country, only to find that an extra metre and a half had been built on a wall, cutting off totally our view of the village green, which was a very pretty part of the place. When I rang the council to ask why nothing had happened about this, they said, "Oh, we gave him retrospective permission for it". The same happened in London, where I actually phoned the council during the construction and said that it was not being built according to plan. "Oh of course it is", they said. Eighteen months later the council came back and said, "You're quite right, it was not. However, we felt that as people had already moved into it, we should give them retrospective permission".</p>

If an application for retrospective consent is a fresh application, it would, or should, be notified to those occupiers-not necessarily those who objected before, who might be living anywhere. However, surely it should be treated as an application de novo, and therefore the normal processes would apply. So those affected on a retrospective application would receive notice. I should think, unless the Minister disagrees, that the amendment is otiose.</p>

I thank my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes for bringing this forward. It is important that we get this absolutely clear. This word retrospective largely means that something happened for which there was no permission. Someone spots it and says, "Look here, you'd better put in a planning application". That's the position. In all instances where there is a change, there are requirements in place for local planning authorities to publicise and consult on those applications-that is, the retrospective ones. This is true when a new revised planning application is submitted, and where the holder of a planning permission wishes to delete or vary one or more of the conditions

I moved this amendment in Committee-or an amendment very like it-but when the government reply came, the Minister thought that I was asking about the right to take a new enforcement action well after six years, which is apparently the limit. That was not my point. My point concerns situations where enforcement action has been taken. Again, somewhere near me there is a property which is in foreign ownership; enforcement notices have been served; it has gone through the court process-everything-but nothing has happened for about 10 years now. They have absolutely failed to comply and cannot be contacted anywhere. That is really why I tabled the amendment. However, I hope that the Government will tell me that it is not necessary. I beg to move.</p>

Again, however, this amendment is not necessary. Section 171B deals with time limits for taking enforcement action-essentially, serving an enforcement notice. It does not deal with ensuring compliance with that notice. A valid enforcement notice-in other words, one that has not been appealed against, or has been upheld on appeal-remains in force indefinitely unless the local planning authority withdraws it. If the person on whom it has been served does not comply, they can be prosecuted. The maximum penalty is a £20,000 fine in the magistrates' courts, or an unlimited fine on indictment, and can be subject to a repeat prosecution if they still fail to comply. The penalty is a daily fine until compliance. The local planning authority can also do the works in default and recover its expenses from the landowner. So I believe that there is no need for the amendment, and I trust that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw it.</p>

I first apologise to the House for bringing these amendments forward comparatively late in the day. I will be as quick as I can although the amendments are fairly technical, with some pretty detailed arguments behind them.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="1110182000020"></a>The amendments stem from the issue of the change in responsibility for decision-making from the Infrastructure Planning Commission to the Secretary of State and provide that Parliament, in the form of the House of Commons only, approves the national policy statement series that is supposed to underpin the new regime. There have already been some minor changes to improve the process of planning major infrastructure projects and to streamline the whole process. I suspect that now that the Secretary of State will be the final decider-that is a political decision-rather than an official, many of the checks and balances that were in the original Act could possibly be dispensed with or reduced in scope to try and simplify the procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="1110182000021"></a>I know that these points have been made to officials quite frequently over the past few months and that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, moved similar amendments in Committee. When the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, responded to the noble Lord on 19 July, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_105"></a><a name="1110182000062"></a>"I would like to consider the points he has raised in more detail and consult him and others between now and Report to see whether anything further can be done".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/7/11; col. 1319.]</p>

<p><a name="1110182000034"></a>I am not aware of any meetings that have taken place since then, which we probably all regret in retrospect. I will try to go through these various issues as quickly as I can and hope that we can all have a meeting with the Minister between now and Third Reading to see whether any of these particular issues can be resolved. The Government could then bring back some amendments at Third Reading.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="1110182000022"></a>To go through them quickly, starting in not quite the right order, Amendment 223ZD refers to Section 127 of the Planning Act, which requires a separate consent to be sought from the Secretary of State in some circumstances when it is proposed to acquire statutory undertakers' land compulsorily. Again, now that the decision has been transferred back to the Secretary of State, this is probably an element of gold-plating. I suggest it would be sufficient if the Secretary of State was required to take into account the views of the undertakers.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="1110182000023"></a>Amendment 223ZE refers to Sections 128 to 132 of the Planning Act, concerning the special parliamentary procedures which are available if there are objections from various organisations and authorities which end up having to go through a Joint Committee of Parliament, which could take quite a long time to resolve. The restoration of the Secretary of State's decision-making power could allow these provisions to be removed and for it to be left to the Secretary of State to decide whether to grant consent for an application that affects these types of special land holders. The SPP seems to be unnecessarily complex and gold plating.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="1110182000024"></a>Amendment 223ZF refers to Section 137 of the Planning Act, which requires a separate consent to be sought from a statutory undertaker or the relevant Secretary of State in some circumstances where the undertaker's apparatus is installed. Again, the same comments could apply to that. Amendment 223ZG refers to Section 138 of the Planning Act. It inserts an additional test and a consent from the relevant Secretary of State where the undertaker's rights to use land are being extinguished.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="1110182000025"></a>All these separate consents, which will often involve other Secretaries of State as well, fly in the face of one of the main purposes of the Planning Act regime which was to create as far as possible a single consents regime. There are many examples I can quote but it is well known to your Lordships' House and Ministers. It seems that the Planning Act provisions set out in these texts go much further than the two key order-making procedures that the Act replaces-TWA and harbour orders. Taking them as precedent there is an argument for saying that there is a bit of gold plating in here.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="1110182000026"></a>It is interesting that on 13 October we heard the first IPC decision which was to allow Covanta's proposed energy from waste project in Bedfordshire. It was  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_103"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>made within the statutory timescale of nine months. I am sure we are all happy to see the IPC sticking to its timetable. However, 43 of the 96 plots of land to be purchased are owned by statutory utilities or local authorities and they have made representations about the project. The Planning Act requires the project to be subject to the special parliamentary procedure which could add six to nine months to the programme, which for a big project is actually quite serious. There is an opportunity to put this right and to incorporate some of these amendments to simplify the process and accept that because we now have the Secretary of State making all the decisions he can take all these issues into account.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="1110182000027"></a>I will now mention one or two other items as briefly as possible. There are a large number of things that we really cannot go through at this time of night but there is one issue that refers to the construction of these big projects. It means that regulations made under Section 150 of the Planning Act still require the promoters to seek myriad other consents and regulators before they can start construction. The Infrastructure Planning (Miscellaneous Prescribed Provisions) Regulations 2010 lists 42 separate agencies or authorities from which permissions have to be sought and a further 36 for Wales only, which I find quite interesting. Why is Wales so much more complicated? Again, it would be an enormous help to these projects if there could be just one consent which went through the IPC process.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="1110182000028"></a>I could spend a lot more time going through the detail of the technical issues. I hope that it might be possible for those of us who take an interest in this to have a meeting with Ministers before Third Reading to see whether we can encourage the Government to make some changes at that stage. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, and perhaps other colleagues, would wish to participate fully in such a meeting. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_207"></a>
<a name="1110182000029"></a><b><a name="111017-0003.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="1110182000089"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, has masterfully reduced what could have been a very long speech into one that lasted less than 10 minutes. There has been some confusion about this whole matter. The group of amendments that I moved in Committee on 19 July contained a large number of separate and discrete subjects. The amendments that I moved were concerned primarily with ensuring a seamless transition from the existing IPC procedure to the NSIP procedure. I will not go into the details now but my noble friend Lord Attlee very kindly said that there should be discussions on this. Those who were advising me on this matter did have discussions with officials in the department. The result was that when we approached Report stage, when I asked them whether they had achieved what they were looking for, they said yes. Therefore, I have not retabled those amendments. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, has rightly said, there were other amendments, a lot of which were aimed at the proposition that there should be a one-stop shop.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="1110182000030"></a>As I understand it-I am open to correction-for some reason the meeting with officials did not take place until last week. There was a misunderstanding about who was seeking to organise the meeting and  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_104"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>make sure that proper discussions could take place. I think that the meeting took place on 13 October, with the result that the large number of amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, were tabled only on Friday and appeared with an asterisk in this morning's revised Marshalled List. I had not realised that they would appear on the Marshalled List. I have made inquiries and I have a great deal of information on this issue but most of them are the same as those we discussed on 19 July in Committee, although there are one or two additional ones to which no doubt attention will be drawn at some stage. Whether it was the fault of my noble friend on the Front Bench or of those who have been advising us, the fact of the matter is that there have not been the discussions that there should have been and that my noble friend offered when he wound up the debate on 19 July. Therefore, we are in a slight difficulty on this. I hope that the request of the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, that serious meetings should be held before Third Reading so that we can, if necessary, retable the amendments, or some of them, at that stage and have them debated will be taken note of.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="1110182000031"></a>I am getting a little alarmed about the number of issues which we are reserving for Third Reading. I am told by the Whips that we are likely to have only one day for that stage so we may find ourselves sitting even later then than we are likely to do tonight. However, I also have two new amendments in this group about which I would like to say a few words. This is a question of how and when a planning application can be referred to the NSIP procedure. There is a process in the Bill whereby the Secretary of State can call in an application and ask that the NSIP procedure should be applied but it also provides that anyone can make a qualifying request. It is astonishing that anyone can make a qualifying request. It has been put to me that that is a great deal too inclusive. Anybody could take a controversial project that that they did not like that was being put forward to the local authority and say, "Right, it should go to the planning inspectorate under the NSIP procedure". My first amendment restricts who can make a qualifying request to the prospective promoter and the relevant authority-the authority to whom the application would ordinarily have been made.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="1110182000032"></a>My second amendment introduces a cut-off date. It is rather like some of the points mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley: the more delays that you build into this process the more the infrastructure that is needed will itself be delayed. I know that it is my noble friend's intention that these procedures should operate as swiftly and effectively as possible while at the same time giving local communities the right to be heard and to present their case. Of course, all the pre-application consultations that are now required, which are a very important part of the NSIP procedure, are now in place and are happening. I get the newsletter from the IPC regularly when it is issued and it is fascinating to see how many applications it is now considering that have gone through a pre-application procedure. If we are then to have people entitled to say that an ordinary application should be handled by the   


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_105"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>NSIP procedure rather than by the local authority, it cannot be without limit. Therefore, the amendment says that it should be done before the application has actually been made. All the pre-application procedure will have told them and objectors may then say, "This ought to go through the NSIP procedure". Once the application is made to a local authority, that should be that, and the application should then be heard by the local planning authority.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="1110182000033"></a>These are two new points that stand a little apart from those of the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, and the amendments are different from the amendments that I moved in Committee which I have not retabled. They have merit and I hope that my noble friend will consider them sympathetically.</p>

<p><a name="st_208"></a>
<a name="1110186000001"></a><b><a name="111017-0003.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="1110186000029"></a>Lord Boyd of Duncansby:</b> My Lords, this is the first time that I have spoken on Report, so I repeat my declaration of interest: I am a solicitor in private practice and registered as a foreign lawyer in England and Wales, and some of my practice involves planning. I recollect that in Committee I stood to support amendments in terms very similar to those before the House this evening. I cannot now recollect in whose names the amendments stood, but I was pleased that the Minister, the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, offered to discuss that issue. It may be that I and others took our eyes off the ball, as it were, in following up the matter. I do not want to take the time of the House unnecessarily because both my noble friend Lord Berkeley and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, have gone through remarkably succinctly the detail of the amendments in the group.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="1110186000002"></a>The central issue is that the development consent order is expected to be an omnibus order that will encompass a range of other consents and will reduce the number of applications that a developer has to make, thereby making the development procedure that much easier.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="1110186000003"></a>The amendments address two issues seriously. The first is the range of further consents required beyond the development consent order. My noble friend Lord Berkeley listed the consents that are still needed-another 42 are still required, including 36 in Wales. Of course, there are occasions when you require specialist input that only specialist agencies can give-these are necessary safeguards-but, on the other hand, the policy behind this ought to be to reduce to the minimum the number of other consents that are required. That would be consistent with this Government's approach to reducing regulation and removing red tape. There are a large number of these further consents that can be effectively removed without reducing the necessary safeguards. At Committee stage, I gave an example of the London Gateway Port Harbour Empowerment Order 2008, which is an order under the Harbours Act which included provisions for the benefit of the Environment Agency, and would be a model for that.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="1110186000004"></a>The second strand is the further consents and procedures necessary on top of what the IPC grants in a development consent order-in other words, the further consents from the Secretary of State where, for example, land of statutory undertakers is being compulsorily acquired or the special parliamentary procedure applies. This procedure is not one that is  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_106"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>used very often, yet we find, as my noble friend Lord Berkeley said, that the first application to be granted by the IPC requires that further consent.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="1110186000005"></a>Some might say that we need to have a proper check and balance. I accept that when the Infrastructure Planning Commission, which the Government told us was an unelected quango, was making its decisions independently of any outside scrutiny, it might then have been appropriate to keep a number of other procedures and safeguards in process-safeguards which were accountable. Now that we have the Secretary of State giving the final decision, you can incorporate within that the necessary safeguards that some noble Lords may wish to see.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="1110186000006"></a>There are also, within this group, issues in relation to the discharge of requirements. I do not intend to take up the House's time on that, but there are important issues in relation to ensuring that the regime that we create works effectively and that the transition from the Infrastructure Planning Commission, which makes the decision at present, to one where the Secretary of State is deciding on the recommendations of the major infrastructure unit of the Planning Inspectorate, is effective too.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="1110186000007"></a>I hope that the Minister will look at these issues seriously. They are important and they are designed to reduce the amount of bureaucracy and red tape that there is and make this a streamlined process.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="1110186000008"></a>I make one final point. A European Commission study into the consenting regimes for major infrastructure projects throughout the European Union commended the one-stop shop, which at the moment is encompassed within the Infrastructure Planning Commission, but which, when this Bill goes through, will still be there but with the Secretary of State. My understanding is that the European Commission is likely to make regulations to ensure the acceleration of the deployment of priority energy infrastructure projects by concentrating resources, simplifying and enhancing permission procedures and making use of innovative financial instruments. In order to enhance national permitting and granting processes, each member state will be required to create a competent authority-a one-stop shop-responsible for those tasks. Therefore, it looks as though we will get a seal of approval, if that is required, from the European Commission. We can make things better.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="1110186000009"></a>I hope that the Minister will take away these matters and look at them seriously.</p>

Whether we get through Third Reading in one day remains to be seen.</p>

I say to my noble and learned friend Lord Boyd and to my noble friend Lord Berkeley that I would need a bit of convincing to step aside from a parliamentary procedure just because the Secretary of State is making the final decision. We have debated the Bill in some detail and the issue of the powers of the Secretary of State has been a running sore in our deliberations, but I remain to be convinced on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="1110186000012"></a>Certainly I agree with and support the importance of having a one-stop shop on the raft of consents that apparently are still needed. However, the clock is ticking on Third Reading. This is an opportunity to sort out some issues, but we do not have much time in which to do it. It may be, as my noble and learned friend Lord Boyd said, that the EU could overtake us on this matter. We have a couple of weeks before Third Reading and there are very serious issues that have been raised tonight by all three noble Lords. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, also raised new points that we had not touched on before about who can make these qualifying requests, as well as issues around pre-application consultation. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us a full response on these issues. Generally, I find that we are in an unsatisfactory position on a hugely important issue for this country.</p>

Although they are technical in nature, they are none the less important, so I shall respond to each in turn. Amendments 223AA and 223AB, in the name of my noble friend Lord Jenkin, seek to limit the circumstances in which a qualifying request for a direction under Section 35 of the Planning Act 2008, as amended by Clause 120 of the Localism Bill, may be made. The amendments would restrict those who can make a qualifying request to the proposed applicant and the authority in question. Amendment 223AB would prevent a qualifying request from being made after an application is made to the relevant authority.</p>

The new provisions contained in the Localism Bill set out a clear, tightly constrained timetable in which the Secretary of State must decide a qualifying request. If someone were to make a vexatious request simply to slow down the local planning process, the Secretary of State would be quickly able to provide a response in the negative. The scope for delay is therefore minimal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="1110186000016"></a>My noble friend Lord Jenkin suggested that an application has been made to the local authority and that should be that. At present, an application to a local authority can be directed to the Planning Act regime by the Secretary of State after submission. This amendment enables someone to draw key information to the Secretary of State's attention if it had not already come to light. With these assurances, I hope that my noble friend is willing to withdraw his amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="1110186000017"></a>Turning to the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, Amendments 223ZD and 223ZE would, by amending Schedule 13 to the Bill, repeal Sections 127 to 132 of the Planning Act 2008. These sections draw into the Planning Act long-standing protections from compulsory purchase for certain special types of land-land belonging to a local authority, statutory undertaker or the National Trust and commons, open spaces or fuel or field garden allotments. Amendment 223ZA replaces these protections with a significantly weaker requirement for the decision-maker to have regard to the effect of the compulsory acquisition of the land or statutory undertaker when taking decisions.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="1110186000018"></a>Amendments 223ZF and 223ZG would repeal Section 137 and subsections (4) to (6) of Section 138 of the Planning Act. I understand the purpose of the noble Lord's amendments and sympathise with his aim to simplify the major infrastructure planning regime. However, the existing protections embodied in these sections of the Planning Act are well established in existing compulsory purchase law. The proposed amendments would significantly weaken them, effectively creating a two-tier system for compulsory purchase with a stronger set of protections existing outside the major infrastructure system than within it, and I just do not think that that can be right. Secondly, these rights are well established in law and I see no evidence that the need for these rights has diminished. I do not believe that it is right to weaken them. I do not agree that a significant extra burden exists, and I hope that the noble Lord will not press these amendments.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="1110186000019"></a>Amendment 223ZB seeks to clarify that the Secretary of State may modify the proposals contained in an application when making an order. I am pleased that the noble Lord has raised this point. It gives me the opportunity to put an important assurance on the record. Section 114(1) of the Planning Act already grants a wide discretion for the decision-maker to decide the terms on which a development consent order may be made. The Secretary of State may already modify the consent order submitted as part of the application in whatever way the Secretary of State believes is necessary.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="1110186000020"></a>Section 150 of the Planning Act provides an important function. The Planning Act contains wide powers for development consent orders to amend and disapply  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_109"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>other legislative requirements. Section 150 protects certain key consents from this power by requiring the agreement of the consenting body for the consent to be modified or disapplied. In doing so, it provides clarity to potential applicants that certain consents should not ordinarily be absorbed into the major infrastructure planning process. I understand that some have argued for a less bureaucratic approach to regulatory and environmental consents from the Section 120 power, but this is a complex issue and a better solution has not presented itself.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="1110186000021"></a>Amendment 223ZJ would allow an order or regulations made under the Planning Act, with certain exemptions, including a development consent order, to include a procedure to waive compliance with any of the requirements if compliance would be "unnecessary, impossible or impracticable". This provision is not necessary. Orders made under the Planning Act may already provide for such a waiver procedure if it is deemed necessary.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="1110186000022"></a>Amendments 223ZK and 223ZL seek to increase these powers, enabling offences to be created in relation to any type of development consent by creating a new power to vary by order the list of offences that can be created by a development consent order. I am not convinced that this widening of powers is necessary or appropriate. The present provisions of Schedule 13 aim to replicate equivalent provisions in paragraphs 12 and 13 of Schedule 1 to the Transport and Works Act 1992 and Sections 14(3) and 16(6) of the Harbours Act 1964, with which the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, will be very familiar. The proposed power goes considerably wider than those of the Transport and Works Act and the Harbours Act, and I can see no evidence of the need to expand these powers so dramatically.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="1110186000023"></a>Amendment 223AC would amend Section 120 of the Planning Act 2008 to provide that, for the purpose of discharging the requirements and making a related appeal, the requirements are to be treated as if they were conditions imposed under Part 3 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Again, I am pleased that the noble Lord has raised this matter as it gives me the opportunity to provide clarification on the record. Together, Section 121 and Section 120(5)(c) of the Planning Act provide a wide power for a development consent order to provide for third-party discharge of requirements and for any related processes, including appeals, to be specified.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="1110186000024"></a>Finally, Amendment 223ZM seeks to amend Clause 117, which gives the Secretary of State the power to make directions regarding the handling of applications which would transition from the IPC regime to the Secretary of State when the IPC is abolished. Specifically, the amendment seeks to enable the Secretary of State to make directions regarding environmental impact assessment screening or scoping decisions which have been issued by the IPC or where the IPC has authorised the applicant to obtain information about interests in land. I can confirm to the noble Lord that this amendment is unnecessary. Where the IPC has issued a screening or scoping opinion or has authorised someone to serve a notice under Section 52 of the Planning Act, these actions will generally stand

This is something that has come up quite recently, when we have tried to see how the IPC and the Planning Act 2008 should be applied to railway projects. It appears that there is no minimum size for railway projects to have to go to the IPC under the Planning Act. The example that has been brought to my attention is the electrification of the Great Western main line between Airport Junction, which is near Heathrow, and Cardiff, where Network Rail may have to demolish certain bridges or do other works. It mainly has the permitted development rights for those works but some of them may creep a few yards outside those rights. It has been suggested that any such creep would need permission through the IPC, so the amendment suggests that it would be nice if the Secretary of State were minded to direct that specific and maybe small developments outside the limits of permitted developments could proceed without any other process, on the basis that they were quite small.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="1110188000002"></a>It is not just about the electrification of the Great Western main line. The East West Rail project, roughly between Oxford and Milton Keynes, has found two places where the existing railway has never had permission. One little connection between two lines was built in the last war and nobody can find the documentation giving it permission; it may be with the British Rail Property Board but it has not found it. There is another place where the route that got permission went through a farm and the actual railway went round it; clearly the person owning the farm at the time saw somebody all right and there was a gentle deviation, which of course was no problem 150 years ago. Quite rightly, the promoters of this line want to get the legal situation correct before they start building.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="1110188000003"></a>There is a problem here which requires some change to the Planning Act, probably to Section 14. Perhaps the Secretary of State might be minded to bring forward

One can debate whether the problems here are with the Transport and Works Act, an ordinary planning application or something else, but I am sure the Minister will understand them. Maybe he has a better solution. I am grateful to him for the meeting that he arranged some time this summer. I cannot remember when it was now but we had a good discussion about this. What we do not want is for our new Secretary of State for Transport to turn round in six months' time and say that the electrification is held up for a couple of years because they cannot get permission for a couple of yards' extension to a bridge and that it has to go to the IPC. On that basis, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="1110188000006"></a>Amendment 223A would amend the provisions of the 2008 Act which relate to railway projects. The amendment seeks to introduce two new powers. The first relates to a case where a railway project contains both development for which consent is required under the 2008 Act and development for which permitted development rights exist. In this case, the amendment seeks-on application from the promoter-to permit the Secretary of State for Transport to direct that the permitted development should be dealt with under the Planning Act along with the development for which consent is required under the Act. I confirm that Section 35 of the Act already provides a power of direction capable of achieving this. A new power is not necessary. The second relates to a situation where development consent is required for a railway project under the 2008 Act. In response to a qualifying request, if the Secretary of State for Transport thinks that the project is not of national significance, he may direct that the development should be treated as development for which consent under the Planning Act is not required.</p>

For some reason, one was not done at the time for railways-everybody thought that railways were big ones, and nobody picked it up. I suppose I should ask the Minister when the regulations will be tabled, but I am sure that he recognises the importance of this for certain projects. If it would help in drafting these things I am happy to meet with him, along with people from Network Rail and other infrastructure managers if they are interested.

I raised it very briefly in Committee, but we were short of time then and I am grateful to the noble Baroness for the letters that she wrote, dated 5 September. Since that time I have had further thoughts about it. I have had quite an amazing amount of correspondence from people on the basis of a very short entry in <I>Hansard</I>. That is why I have tabled this amendment tonight, because it needs a different solution.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="1110188000010"></a>Very briefly, fracking comprises drilling a hole that is probably several kilometres under ground, pumping in water and unspecified chemicals, and sometimes apparently causing an explosion in the hope that gas will come up to the surface. There have been some pretty horrendous stories from the United States, where this is apparently quite common. There, houses have collapsed or settled seriously while water sources, and  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_114"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>therefore water supplies, have allegedly been poisoned. In one instance, I believe that gas came out of the water tap, which must have been quite frightening.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="1110188000011"></a>I am not saying that that is going to happen here. However, the press release relating to what I believe is the first attempt at fracking in this country, somewhere near Blackpool, by a company called Cuadrilla Resources-the noble Lord, Lord Browne, an ex-chairman of BP, is apparently its chairman-said that it was excited because that could produce 200 trillion cubic feet of gas. I do not know what that means to the ordinary person in the street but it would be something like 30 years of gas. It all sounds very nice, with mouth-watering profits. But what will happen to the people who might be affected not by just the drilling and the things that I have mentioned, but by extra traffic on the roads, construction work and everything like that?</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="1110188000012"></a>I know that there would be licensing from DECC and others. But if it were to happen around the country, I do not think that one can expect a local planning authority to have the resources to give something that is pretty technical due consideration, especially when it is balanced by potentially exciting numbers of new jobs and extra revenue from rates. It would be unfair to expect local planning authorities to give it the consideration that it deserves. I believe that the right solution is to make another change to Section 14 of the Planning Act to create a new type of project to include hydraulic fracturing of underground rock -it is not called "fracking" in the amendment.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="1110188000013"></a>This new type of project would then be subject to the IPC process but, equally importantly, it would have to have a national policy statement in which all these questions that I have been suggesting and more could be investigated, responded to, debated in the House and consulted on. We would all then have confidence that if this process could be done safely with minimum upset to local residents, it could go ahead on a national basis. If not, it will be in trouble.

I have attended a number of lectures and presentations about the development of shale gas. As he said, it is perfectly true that there are substantial areas of shale several kilometres or more under the surface of this country, which could be, in appropriate circumstances, a source of gas for this country. However, a good many people have said to me, "But you would never be able to deal with this properly in a country that is as crowded and as fully populated as the United Kingdom".</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="1110188000015"></a>It has happened in the United States-indeed, it is happening on a very substantial scale-but there are wide open spaces there. It is apparently likely to happen in Poland where, again, there are substantial areas where it could be done without interfering with the life of the normal population. But in the crowded areas of western Europe and the United Kingdom, there is a widespread view that this is not likely to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="1110188000016"></a>I, too, have had correspondence from a farmer in west Lancashire who has written in terms of being extremely anxious about what is happening. Yes, we

But the real concern is the huge amount of surface activity that has to go on at regular intervals. There is a limit to the amount you can drill horizontally before you need to drill another hole down and have all the equipment and plant at the top to deal with it.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="1110188000017"></a>There is quite a movement now to say that there should be a moratorium on this until it has been examined a great deal more thoroughly. I do not know enough about it. The noble Lord, Lord Browne of Madingley, clearly regards it as very important: he is the chairman of Cuadrilla, which is the only company that I am aware of that is drilling so far in this country. One needs to treat this very seriously, as it is a serious prospect. If we could find an acceptable process for recovering very large quantities of shale gas, that would replace a lot of the North Sea gas, which appears to be coming towards the end of its life. At the same time, however, if there are enormous disturbances of local populations and communities because of a huge rash of surface activity, this solution would seem to be worse than the problem.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="1110188000018"></a>I do not know what the answer is-whether it is a moratorium, or it is simply sufficient to say that it will come under the NISP process. As I said to the lady who wrote to me, it is going to be jolly interesting to learn what the Minister says in answer to this amendment. All I know is that there is a widespread view that it is not going to catch on in this country for the reasons I explained a few moments ago. I look forward hearing my noble friend's response.</p>

<a name="1110188000019"></a><b><a name="111017-0003.htm_spnew35"></a><a name="1110188000209"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> My Lords, this issue is closer to me than to other noble Lords, since the Bowland shale, which is the reserve of rock that potentially contains a large amount of methane, if it could be extracted in a sensible and safe way, underlies at a very great depth of some two miles or so a large amount of the Lancashire plain, and extends up towards Pendle Hill, where it is rather nearer the surface. Like other noble Lords, I have taken an interest in this and decided that I ought to find out something about it, as it is clearly extremely controversial. I have been doing just that, and I spent an extremely interesting three hours last Friday afternoon at the site at Banks in Lancashire where the firm Cuadrilla is currently drilling. Its employees showed me around, explained what they were doing and told me a very good tale. I listened and, like all very good tales, will assess it against all the other evidence in this particular case.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="1110188000020"></a>I have been deliberately trying not to take a view on the desirability of the extraction of shale gas until I discovered a great deal more about it. My current view is that the people who claim that this will be the answer for decades to the gas problems of this country are overegging their case a little bit, or quite probably a very large amount, but, equally, the people who claim that it would be the kind of environmental disaster in this country that it clearly has been in parts of the USA are also overstating the case. The regulatory regime in this country is very much stricter and more acceptable than the regime in the USA, particularly in some states of the USA. I doubt whether we will get

I am told by Cuadrilla, although I cannot confirm it, that the famous picture which we have probably all seen on television of the water tap setting on fire was a result not of shale gas but of drilling into coal-seams. Even so, this clearly has to be taken extremely seriously indeed.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="1110188000021"></a>The licensing regime at the moment appears to be threefold. First of all, drilling for shale gas comes under ordinary petroleum exploration and development licences. Areas in which shale gas is currently being looked at have licences, issued in 2008 as I understand it, under that regime. It is a licence to explore and develop, but it does not grant planning permission or give the go-ahead even with planning permission. It is the first stage. The areas of this country where these licences have been issued in relation to shale gas include part of south Wales, where a different company, a British one I believe, is involved. I understand that there is also a wish to explore in a part of Somerset that has given rise to concerns in Bath about the spa waters.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="1110188000022"></a>The second stage is planning permission, which is what the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, has been talking about. Planning permission is needed for exploration, and that is what is taking place in Lancashire at the moment. That planning permission was obtained from Lancashire County Council because in two-tier areas, the upper tier authority gives permission for mineral extraction. I have to say that, given the scale of the present exploration, it seems reasonable that the local planning authority, the county council in the case of Lancashire, should be in charge of this, although if it really took off, the points made by the noble Lord make a great deal of sense.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="1110188000023"></a>The second thing needed in order to explore is to get consent from the Department of Energy and Climate Change. This is a separate consent in addition to planning permission. If you want to move on to commercial exploitation involving the extraction of the gas in order to sell it on, an additional and separate planning permission and an additional and separate consent from DECC are needed. So the consent regime is already quite complex. My view is that, given the scale at the moment, it is probably okay to leave this with local authorities, but just in the short term. That is because, as the noble Lord said, it is not just what happens underground that matters; it is also the infrastructure required above ground to get the gas into the mains gas distribution network or perhaps to turn it into electricity at the wellheads. That would clearly have a local impact and needs to be looked at.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="1110188000024"></a>I suggest that, as people learn more about it, this topic probably merits further debate in your Lordships' House separate from this Bill. It would be a useful exercise. I believe that central government needs to start to take an overall view on it because fracking for shale oil in different parts of this country and indeed in Europe, particularly in Poland, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, is not going to go away. Given the increasing shortage of oil and gas resources around the world, and given the large-scale exploitation of  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_117"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 117</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>shale gas in the USA, where it has contributed to a substantial reduction in gas prices, I repeat that it is not going to go away. For many of the reasons stated and others, extracting it in this country is going to be much more expensive than it is in the USA and probably in Poland because of our much stricter regulatory and planning regimes. Nevertheless, people are going to continue to want to do it.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="1110188000025"></a>As for a moratorium, if there is to be one it should be at the level of DECC consents to exploit. Continued relatively small-scale exploration is necessary in order to find out the facts, such how much of this shale there is in different parts of the country. It is found in quite a few different areas, including places such as Surrey, I have to say, where it might well send the balloon up, no doubt filled with methane. The Government ought to have an overview of this, perhaps in the form of a national policy statement or something different. They need an overall view to determine, first, whether it is a desirable process; secondly, whether it has undesirable side-effects, even if it is properly regulated and controlled; thirdly, what the implications are environmentally for the areas concerned; and, fourthly, the matter of the potential contamination of water resources, which ought not to happen if it is done properly. However, that has happened in certain parts of the USA on a large scale. Lastly, the use of water is a major issue. All these issues need to be looked at if this is going to take off, because the worst possible thing would be for a relatively large amount of development to take place in a relatively economically uncontrolled way, and then for it to become a disaster. If it is going to be done, it has to be done properly, and I do not believe that it can simply be left to the market.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="1110188000026"></a>I hope that that is helpful. If noble Lords want some contacts in order to go and look at it themselves, I will happily pass them on. I do not know whether this will be the El Dorado of tomorrow-I suspect that it is not. Equally, I do not know whether it will be a total environmental disaster-I suspect that it is not. I suspect that it will be relatively small scale in this country, but even so it needs to be done absolutely properly.</p>

I think we would have been rather more aware of the dangers and that the dangers would have been rather more real. Houses do fall down coal-mines from time to time; the idea that they could fall down a hole made by fracking gas two miles deep is really not tenable. I am very sad to say this, as an ex-member of both Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, but there is a typical, current environmentalist film around called "Gasland", which, as far as I can establish, peddles nothing but lies, including that tap. If you drill a well through coal-seams you get gas out of it. That is not surprising, and methane is not exactly dangerous anyway. We are talking about a technology that, by and large, chucks household chemicals two miles deep. There is a chance of them coming back to the surface, but I am sure we will be careful about what we allow to be stuck down the wells.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="1110188000028"></a>I am someone who, although I do not have the pleasure of living in Lancashire, has lived in the Hampshire oilfields. Noble Lords may remember that in the 1980s there was a nice little mini-boom in wells all over mid-Hampshire, which we suffered happily without any great effect. There was a month when the drills were busy and then you were just left with a hut. That is really what happens with shale gas; you have a well every half kilometre or so and you are left with a garden shed that produces gas. It is not exactly an environmental problem, other than the interference when the drilling is going on. I think this is something that we will deal with extremely well within the boundaries of our ordinary and sensible systems for dealing with potential environmental hazards and for planning.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="1110188000029"></a>In fact, the Bill will make things better, because one of the problems with such developments in the past has been that they have benefited the oil company, they have benefited the Government and benefited the landowner who is lucky enough to have the well drilled on his patch, but the local community, which has put up with the noise, the transport during the drilling and the continuing risk of something going on with the well, gets nothing. Under the Bill, of course-under neighbourhood planning-the benefit will be shared and that will be a great step forward.</p>

I think that is central to what my noble friend is moving. We have had a wider debate about the potential importance of shale gas, what that might mean and the risks associated with it. It seems to me that we need a broader regime that encompasses all those issues: licensing regimes, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said, not only to deal with exploration, but with exploitation as well. If there is to be no national infrastructure projects approach to this, then planning, presumably, is a matter for local planning authorities and, indeed, neighbourhood planning. That does not seem to me to fit well with something that is potentially of huge national significance, with potentially huge risks and uncertainties attached to it.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="1110188000031"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said that this issue is worthy of a further debate. Perhaps when we have debated the NPPF to death we might turn our attention to it. I am a novice on this, but it is a fascinating and hugely important issue. I can remember when North Sea oil first opened up. It was a project on which I worked in my former life and I know some of the debate that went on around that. However, if I understand it correctly, my noble friend's proposition about the environment within which the planning ought to be considered is a straightforward one, and he makes a good case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="1110188000033"></a>The first exploration for shale gas in the UK has begun only recently. Fracturing has so far been used on one shale gas drill site in Lancashire but is currently suspended pending a geomechanical study into seismic activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="1110188000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, raised some wider planning issues, but fracking is no more difficult or technical than other mineral extraction methods, and my noble friend Lord Lucas said as much. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, covered some of the regulatory issues, and I shall not go over that ground again. My noble friend Lord Jenkin referred to a small earthquake. Of course he was actually referring to a seismic event, which is slightly different.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="1110188000035"></a>The amendment would require hydraulic fracturing to be added to the types of activity that are considered nationally significant. It is not necessary, however, to use this Bill for that purpose; a secondary power exists to achieve this. I am happy to undertake that this issue will be raised with my colleagues in the Department of Energy and Climate Change and, if it appears appropriate to the purposes of the Bill to add this type of activity to the list of nationally significant infrastructure projects, we will use the secondary power. On that basis, I hope the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="1110188000042"></a>It was suggested by the Minister at the time that this was rather over the top as many authorities might not want to do it and that it would be a burden upon developers. The burden argument is grossly overstated. They already have to notify the appropriate authority, which might be the local authority, for development control purposes. In addition to that, if CIL is involved they have to make notification in relation to CIL, which will apply to larger projects, but not the very small ones. The amendment tries to take account of those objections by making it permissive:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_130"></a><a name="1110188000163"></a>"A local planning authority may require a person who carries out relevant development to inform the planning authority".</p>

<p><a name="1110188000129"></a>The authority can also make different rules for different classes of development. In other words, it would not be required for small developments, kitchen extensions, or whatever the authority thinks is a relatively small development. But it would be required for major and important developments, which would have a more important effect on the area, and where it may feel that having this kind of control is more important.</p>

I would urge the Government not only to take on board this proposition but to look and see what might be gained by trying to streamline other notification procedures, particularly in relation to building regulations and notifications in respect of the community infrastructure levy. Why can these not potentially be combined into one notification procedure? So you have got two out, and only one in, on that basis. That notwithstanding, it does seem a very sensible proposition which we support.</p>

However, I regret to say that it still does not overcome the Government's concerns that this would add yet a further element of complexity and box-ticking to the application process for both the applicant and the local planning authorities and yet yield no practical benefit for local planning authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="1110188000048"></a>In the March 2011 <I>Plan for Growth</I>, the Government clearly cited the problem of the cumulative additional cost to business of new regulations introduced since 1998. It is essential that reforms continue to reduce costs, delays and bureaucracy in the planning system and support the Government's collective approach to driving sustainable economic growth. Local planning authorities can, and do, ask for notification of commencement of development when and where they think it necessary. A developer failing to notify the local authority that the works had commenced would not be a good start to the relationship between them.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="1110188000049"></a>My noble friend may argue that an administrative scheme has no teeth if the developer does not return the form but the Government's view is that new Section 106D, to be inserted by the amendment, would have no teeth either. Making the commencement of development without giving notice a breach of planning control implies that enforcement action could be taken. However, the point of enforcement action is to remedy breaches of planning control. Once development has started it will no longer be possible to give prior notice, so the breach could not technically be remedied and enforcement action would be ineffective. If it turns out that the developer has failed to comply with pre-commencement conditions as well as not giving notice, then the local planning authority can take such action as it sees fit, perhaps by serving a breach of condition notice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="1110188000052"></a>The Minister made some good points. On reflection, the amendment could be further simplified, particularly by the removal of the last four lines. There is a problem. The Minister wants to reduce the amount of bureaucracy on the part of local planning authorities. At the moment, particularly on major developments where there is concern about whether the development has started, the authority sends people round to find out and look on site or ring people up.

I shall give a brief reminder of the key points before moving on to the amendments now tabled and the issues that I understand still worry some noble Lords.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="1110188000055"></a>I start by reiterating the Government's purpose here. As my noble friend Lady Hamwee noted in Committee, the issue of local finance incentives and planning decisions was made topical by the new homes bonus, or NHB. When we consulted on that scheme, uncertainty was expressed about its relationship with planning. The CPRE was concerned enough to seek a legal opinion, which implied that the scheme might taint the planning decision-making process. The supposition was that the scheme might encourage local planning authorities to take non-material considerations into account when determining planning applications for new homes.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_123"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="111017-0003.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="1110188000056"></a>The CPRE is right to keep a keen eye on this issue but in some instances its press releases and briefings have unnecessarily added to the sector's confusion and alarm. It has raised fears that that NHB will undermine the planning system and result in,</p>
<ul><a name="1110188000185"></a>"hugely damaging consequences for local communities and the environment",</ul>
<p><a name="1110188000130"></a>and result in any local decision in which a local finance consideration were taken into account being,</p>
<ul><a name="1110188000186"></a>"legally 'tainted' and open to question".</ul>
<a name="111017-0003.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="1110188000057"></a>The clause itself which the Government prepared in an attempt to ensure that local finance consideration would not be taken into account in inappropriate circumstances-in other words, to address the CPRE's core concern-has been branded as,</p>
<ul><a name="1110188000187"></a>"a brazen attempt to legalise cash for sprawl"</ul>
<p><a name="1110188000131"></a>and as a temptation for local planning authorities to,</p>
<ul><a name="1110188000188"></a>"fill shrinking coffers by permitting any development, regardless of its environmental impact or the views of local communities".</ul>
<p><a name="1110188000132"></a>All such claims, though doubtless borne of genuine concern, are based on a false premise about the effect of the clause. As such they are rather misleading. To be clear, the clause simply restates the existing legal position, confirming for the avoidance of doubt that, like any other consideration, a matter such as the NHB or CIL must be taken into account if they are material to the planning application under consideration.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="1110188000058"></a>Inevitably, the CPRE activity on this issue has not helped the confusion already apparent in the sector, evidenced, for example, by the London Borough of Islington which, in its response to the NHB consultation, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_133"></a><a name="1110188000166"></a>"The government should make it clear whether NHB can be taken into account as a material consideration when determining planning applications".</p>

<p><a name="1110188000133"></a>It was precisely to address this confusion and to give a clear and lasting reminder that local finance considerations should be taken into account only where they are material in the long-understood sense-in line with case law-that Clause 130 was prepared.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="1110188000059"></a>It is clearly untenable to allow confusion to linger, particularly within the bodies responsible for making planning decisions. As I said in Committee, this would undermine the planning system's integrity and affect public confidence. Making the legal position more clear should reduce the risk of local planning authorities being accused of letting financial incentives improperly influence their decisions and so facing legal challenges to their decisions.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="1110188000060"></a>In Committee, my noble friend Lady Hamwee asked why the necessary clarification could not be given in guidance. As I indicated at the time, we thought carefully about the option. However, the Government concluded that with confusion on this legal and technical issue so prevalent, the only responsible option was to bring the desperately needed clarity to the fore by using the Localism Bill.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="1110188000061"></a>Given the significant accusations the CPRE was asserting, the consequent confusion that local planning authorities were faced with, and the grave risk which that confusion posed to the proper operation of the planning system, we felt it essential to clarify the position and clear up the confusion in law. Using the Localism Bill presented the most immediate and visible  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_124"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>way to set the record straight on this important message. As the confusion concerned the legal position it made sense to use legislation to clarify the point and provide councils with reassurance on what they should and should not legitimately do.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="1110188000062"></a>It may be helpful if I remind the House of the tests for a material consideration. I know some noble Lords remain uncertain as to the circumstances in which the NHB or the community infrastructure levy might be material to a particular planning decision. Current statute confirms that in determining planning applications regard must be had to the development plan so far as it is material to the application and to any other material considerations. Statute does not define what a material consideration is but clear tests for materiality have been developed through case law.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="1110188000063"></a>The classic statement is to be found in Stringer v Minister of Housing and Local Government. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_134"></a><a name="1110188000167"></a>"Any consideration which relates to the use and development of land is capable of being a planning consideration. Whether a particular consideration falling within that broad class is material in any given case will depend upon the circumstances".</p>

<p><a name="1110188000134"></a>In order to be material, therefore, a consideration must relate to the use and development of land and to the planning merits of the development in question. These tests apply to all considerations, financial or otherwise, and are not altered by the clause.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="1110188000064"></a>Clause 130 clarifies that regard should be had to,</p>
<ul><a name="1110188000189"></a>"any local finance considerations, so far as material to the application".</ul>
<p><a name="1110188000135"></a>What this means in practice is that regard should be had where, and only where, the case law tests on materiality are satisfied; that is, where the local finance consideration in question relates to the use and development of land and relates to the planning merits of the development in question.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="1110188000065"></a>I am conscious that concerns were expressed in Committee that the clause as drafted might do more than this. There were suggestions that it might elevate the status of financial considerations above others; threaten the probity of planning; send a message that under the new system planning permissions can be bought and sold; allow financial inducements that are irrelevant to the merits of a particular development proposal to be material, and similar horrors. We took these concerns very seriously. We have taken all possible steps to ensure that the clause absolutely does not have the potential to result in such unintended consequences, and we have been consistently reassured on these points. Although it is not customary for Government to share their legal advice, perhaps it is opportune and helpful to do so on this occasion. I can categorically confirm that the Government are in no doubt that the clause as drafted does not represent any change in the current law whatever. It is declaratory of the current law, which is that where local financial considerations are material to a planning application they should be taken into account in the determination of that planning application.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="1110188000066"></a>Furthermore-this is of direct relevance to the concerns raised previously by noble Lords-the Government are absolutely certain that the clause does not require greater consideration to be given to  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_125"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>local finance considerations than to any other material consideration. The decision-maker retains the discretion to determine the weight to be attached, subject ultimately to the supervision of the court. To reiterate: the Government are confident on these points. However, we do not wish to dismiss the understandable and well-meaning concerns of noble Lords. We have not just blithely continued on our way without reflecting very carefully on the issues raised. Instead, we made a genuine commitment to consider further the wording of the clause to ensure that it is absolutely clear that apportioning weight remains a matter for the decision-maker. As noble Lords can see, we have now fully honoured that commitment and have brought forward an amendment which should put noble Lords' concerns completely beyond doubt.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="1110188000067"></a>As noble Lords will see, Amendment 223CA makes it absolutely explicit that the new reference to local finance considerations does not affect the weight to be given to any particular consideration. We have provided even greater reassurance by additionally confirming that the clause does not alter whether regard is to be had to any consideration. Apportioning weight remains a matter for the decision-maker. It may assist your Lordships if I give some simple examples to illustrate when matters relating to the NHB or CIL are likely to be material or not. In Committee, I used examples relating to new housing developments and the funding of improvements to commuter links. In the interests of variety, I shall use a different scenario. Take a situation where NHB and/or CIL moneys pooled by an authority will help fund new flood defence measures. In determining an application for a major housing development within the area to be protected, the fact that the scheme would generate funds to support the provision of the necessary defences would be material: it is clearly relevant to a planning issue arising from the proposal at hand. What, though, if the new proposed development would take place elsewhere, on land not at risk of flooding? The development would still result in moneys which would help fund the flood defences and this would still be a reasonable use of the funds. However, the provision of flood defences would not be material to the determination of the planning application.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="1110188000068"></a>Put simply, the crucial issue is not the nature of the policy instrument that results in funds being accrued, whether or not the Government require authorities to ring-fence funds for a particular use; it is whether at the local level there is a commitment to spend those funds on something that relates to the development and use of land and the planning merits of the planning application that is being considered. In practice it is likely that CIL will be more material in more instances than NHB. This is a natural consequence of the fact that authorities are free to spend NHB funds as they see fit while CIL must be spent on infrastructure needed to support the development of the area.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="1110188000069"></a>Of course, where regard is to be had to NHB or CIL, the local planning authority will need to be confident at the planning decision stage that the funds will be used to deliver the infrastructure anticipated. It will be for the charging authorities concerned to put adequate safeguards in place to ensure that the funds are spent appropriately and for the local planning authorities to be satisfied that the developments will  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_126"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be acceptable in planning terms, having regard to any relevant infrastructure that they can legitimately expect to be provided by the charging authority. Of course, none of this fetters the ability of an authority to choose not to spend its NHB moneys on matters relating to specific developments. The funds could, for example, be distributed as funds to local communities to spend as they wish. This would be a legitimate use of the funds, but in such circumstances the funds will not<I></I>be a material consideration in planning decisions.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="1110188000070"></a>I now turn to Amendment 223D. This amendment, tabled by my noble friend Lady Parminter, proposes that Clause 130 be withdrawn from the Bill. We have been clear that the clause does not alter the law but merely clarifies a topical point of confusion. Noble Lords may well ask, therefore, why the clause needs to remain in place. The simple answer is that having come so far in clarifying the question of when a local finance consideration should and should not be taken into account, it would be regrettable indeed to throw this matter back into doubt. Withdrawing the clause would not change the law. It would remain the case that decision-makers must have regard to any local finance considerations that are material to the planning applications that they determine, but there would be no clear reference in statute to this point. I hope that I have left your Lordships in no doubt that, irrespective or whether we are all in agreement that the clause is essential, we can at least be clear that it does no harm. I beg to move.</p>

As we know, this clause, which outlines that financial considerations can be material to a planning application, was added in the Commons as an incidental measure for clarification. As the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, indicated, the Government have argued that it is the new homes bonus that has necessitated such clarification. However, by using statute rather than the traditional route of guidance, the Government are undoubtedly creating further uncertainty.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="1110188000072"></a>The clause elevates financial considerations above all other legitimate planning considerations, which are not mentioned here or anywhere else in statute. As such, the courts will be used to decide just what Parliament means by putting financial considerations up front as a material condition. While the government amendment goes some way to try to tackle that ambiguity, there still remains a lack of clarity about when such financial considerations could be considered material. Until now, case law has determined whether or not a financial consideration is material. Over time that has been determined as it being necessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms, directly related to the application and fairly and reasonably related in scale to the application. On Report in the Commons the Minister gave an example of materiality which related to a road scheme that accommodates a development-a direct link between the use of the money and making the application acceptable in planning terms. Further, in the Government's response to the consultation on the new homes bonus in February this year, they stated that the new homes bonus could be lawfully taken into account as a material consideration,</p>
<ul><a name="1110188000190"></a>"where there is a direct connection between the intended use of the Bonus and the proposed development".</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="1110188000073"></a>My noble friend Lord Attlee gave a useful example of such a direct link. However, this key point about the direct link is not made at all in the clause or the government amendment. This direct linkage is what case law has determined makes a financial consideration material, and it is a fundamental principle-to me at least-that guarantees the probity of planning. The Minister has made much of the CPRE opposing this clause. However, it shows skill on the part of the Government to unite the CPRE, TCPA and RTPI in opposing this clause and government amendment.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="1110188000074"></a>Without that clarity it can be read that financial inducements that are irrelevant to the merits of a particular development proposal can be material in determining planning applications. It is just such a lack of clarity that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, rightly raised earlier when he talked about the changes around the use of the community infrastructure levy. It is quite clear that guidance will have to be issued to local authorities on how government incentives are intended to influence planning and how this will work in practice. If further clarification is needed on the relationship between financial considerations and considering planning applications, as the Government say it is, then cover that alongside government guidance about the workability of these incentives. That would avoid further legal wrangling over what Parliament intended to say by this clause. I beg to move.</p>

While I was enormously relieved to hear what the noble Earl said, and absolutely accept that that is the appropriate interpretation of the provision, none the less, since he also said that the addition of this clause and the amendment that we are debating to the new clause that the Government brought in at a late stage in Commons proceedings does not do anything to change the law, would it not be better to withdraw the clause and issue guidance to clarify, for anyone who may be in doubt, what the existing law means? That would be helpful. Of course, those who attempt to construe the law and the Government's intentions will take careful account of what the noble Earl said on the record this evening. However, it would be better to remove the clause, clarify the law as it is and allow everybody to settle down and get on with the work that they need to do.</p>

When we debated this in Committee, I made the point that the clause did not change the law at all. My noble friend made this clear and stated that there had been confusion, which the amendment was designed to remove. The noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, spoke eloquently. Her noble friend Lord Greaves suggested that perhaps, in order to remove doubt, it might be helpful if the Government could clarify the extent of the clause and explain that it did not put financial considerations above all others, but that it was entirely for the planning authority to determine what weight should be given to them. That has been done. I find myself very unsympathetic to the argument advanced by my noble friend Lady Hamwee that by going on and trying to make this clear, my noble friend is digging himself deeper into a hole. That is very unfair. He recognised the concerns that were expressed in Committee and moved an amendment that puts the matter beyond doubt. He deserves complete support.</p>

I spend a lot of time trying to do that on Bills. The Government should be congratulated on and thanked for the huge amount of time and effort that was put in by Ministers and their civil servants in the Bill team, and by their ministerial colleagues in the House of Commons, to try to sort out a bit of a mess-perhaps more than a bit of a mess-that has resulted from what some of us would say was the rather hasty addition of this clause at the end of the procedures in the House of Commons. They made a huge effort, and I have no doubt that the amendment moved by the noble Earl is an improvement. It helps a bit. My noble friend says that it takes him further into a hole, but I am not sure that that is the case; it probably keeps his head above water. However, it is our clear view after reflection throughout the summer that far and away the best thing to do would be to remove the clause altogether. That is why I support the amendment eloquently spoken to by my noble friend Lady Parminter.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="1110188000085"></a>I want to make a couple of points-and one point in slight jest, which I will make now. My noble friend Lord Attlee said that one argument for accepting that this clause should remain is that it does no harm. I must say that I am so used to Governments telling us that amendments that we put forward may not do any harm but are not necessary that I think the boot is on the other foot now. Every time I move an amendment, while the noble Lord is taking the clause for the Government I will look forward to reminding him that my amendment does no harm and therefore should be passed with acclamation.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="1110188000086"></a>I would like to make two serious points. There is a very clear difference between CIL and Section 106, for example, which are themselves tied to an application and cannot be untied in any way, and the new homes bonus, which is not tied to a particular application and can be tied, as I think the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, said, only by a clear decision, a resolution presumably, of the council that will receive the new homes bonus. That is the real difference. The noble Earl said quite clearly that it can be taken into account only if it is tied to the application by the receiving council.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="1110188000087"></a>I have been thinking about this. In a possible case study, which may happen more often than people might imagine, a big development may result in a lot of new homes bonus and a significant amount of money coming to that council. The use of that money might be politically controversial and contested within the council. In advance of that money coming, the council, the executive, the cabinet, or whoever it is that makes decisions about its allocation, might corporately pass a resolution that makes it quite clear that when it comes, and if planning permission is given, the money will be tied to a project linked to that development. However, it is controversial and the opposition on the council does not agree to it and campaigns against it. Then there are some elections and the opposition wins them, and this large amount of money is taken out of that project and put somewhere else. Once a planning decision is made and issued, that is it; it cannot be revisited by the council. However, decisions about how to allocate money can be revisited whenever the council wants to revisit them. What happens if the development is clearly given on the basis, say, of flood damage or a

They might have a huge budget crisis. Perish the thought that any council has a huge budget crisis nowadays, but if does have a huge budget crisis, the council may find that it simply has to put this money into the general fund in order to keep its head above water. It is quite clear that that could happen. What is the legal position? I do not believe that anybody can do anything about it, except that that planning permission will have been given on false pretences.</p>

Councillors on planning committees have to face the accusation, if they are not careful, that they are selling planning consents, that they are just doing it for the money. There is ambivalence as to whether they can take on board the fact that it is surely important to consider that the local community may benefit financially from what happens if the development goes ahead.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="1110188000089"></a>The Minister has clarified the circumstances in which it is entirely legitimate for the planning committee to say, "Yes, we have taken on board the fact that there are financial gains for the locality as a result of this. It is not the only thing we take into account. It has no greater weight than the other material considerations. The fact that local people are going to benefit from this"-as the noble Earl made so clear-"can be taken into account, but don't let anybody accuse us, the planning committee, of just doing it for the money. We're doing something that is legitimate", as this clause makes clear. I think it can be quite helpful.</p>

To argue that these amendments are unnecessary and that this clause is necessary because it addresses the issue of confusion seems to be turning the matter on its head. We know there is confusion because the clause exists. The noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, said that it takes something to get the CPRE, the TCPA and the RTPI in the same position and all very concerned about this. They do not arrive at spurious conclusions. They have impressed on us and all noble Lords their real concerns about the impact of these provisions.</p>

The Government's basic proposition in this is that the clause does not change the law. If the clause does not change the law, why have it? The proposition that noble Lords, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, referred to-that it does no harm-is an extremely spurious basis on which to legislate, particularly in such an important area. I accept that the Minister made some effort to differentiate situations where material considerations-local financial considerations-can legitimately be taken into account from where they cannot, but that analysis does not depend upon the clause and the amendments before us but upon the law as it currently is. Are we not much better off

<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="1110188000092"></a>The very existence of the clause, amended or not, has caused great controversy. What changes the existing position? How does the new homes bonus or CIL change, from the Government's point of view, and to what extent can it be taken into account as a material consideration? As I understand it from the Minister, nothing changes. All it does is describe the law as it is. If that description is the cause of confusion and uncertainty, surely we are better off without it. It seems a very straightforward proposition. It seems to me that the onus should be on those seeking to introduce and sustain the clause as amended to explain why. To say that it does no harm is a totally inadequate justification for a provision that is causing great consternation among many people involved in planning, who are experts and who have been in the field for a very long time. I urge the Government to reconsider this matter. If the only justification for the clause is that it will help to deal with uncertainty, I hope the Minister will accept just from the discussion tonight that in many quarters it clearly does not and that we are better off without it.</p>

However, I do not feel in the slightest that I am in a hole. I am entirely comfortable with Clause 130 and the Government's position.

On my point that it does no harm, the harm has been done by opinions that have muddied the waters in the past with regard to the NHB, and therefore it was necessary to introduce Clause 130. My noble friend Lord Greaves raised the issue that we need to be sure that the money will be tied to a project. In his expert case study, he described a situation in which the political landscape could change. The CIL-charging authority will need to be sure that it will spend the money in the way anticipated at the planning decision stage. If not, and things change, it may be challenged on the grounds of legitimate expectation. The local planning authority and the CIL authority will need to be sure that the money will be spent in the way anticipated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="1110188000097"></a>The reason for tabling it is that there are little pockets of between two and five acres in between lots of other houses and buildings. I know of some that are described as green belt and are so listed and yet there is a conference centre next to them and huge buildings around them. To my mind, those are infill sites. I do not know the government ruling as to what exactly comprises an infill site, but it seems to me that if you have a small patch of land, whatever its classification, it is not really green belt if it is just a little bit in the middle of places. Yet it might already have all the infrastructure of transport, electricity and the things that are needed for development, and could provide a valuable space for either a children's home or housing or something of that type. It is for that reason that I move this amendment.</p>

Obviously, we will have to await the final version of the NPPF. Of course, it is not for me to defend the NPPF in its current form, but as currently drafted it seems to address what the noble Baroness is in part seeking. The NPPF states that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_137"></a><a name="1110188000170"></a>"A local planning authority should regard the construction of new buildings as inappropriate in Green Belt.

<p><a name="1110188000136"></a>This test is not related to green belt policy, which is about preserving openness, preventing the unrestricted sprawl of built up areas and preventing the merger of towns.

It includes exceptions, set out in a similar way as current green belt policy, for certain categories of development. For example, it allows for the re-use of buildings, and the extension or replacement of dwellings. It also provides for the infilling or redevelopment of previously developed sites.

There were huge rows which went on for a period of a year or so about whether or not it was an infill. I do not know how it was eventually decided other than that eventually someone was allowed to build on it. Whereas in other cases I have met, people have been told, "Oh, well this has been a little smallholding, so if you put a barn on it, and you make it possible to live in the barn, you'll be able progressively to convert it", in the way that the Minister has just said, saying that you can rebuild and change things slightly.

Amendment 232 relates to vexatious town and village green applications. There is a widespread view that, under the Commons Act 2006, the measure allowing areas that had been used for sporting, leisure and recreational use to be declared village greens and never to be built on, a status that would last in perpetuity, was being abused and being used as a pretext for stalling and blocking developments that in other terms would have succeeded. It is a very cheap way to stop anything happening. It costs those who do it very little. I quoted the example of the 50 acre site for which I was responsible on the edge of York, which was held up for a considerable period of time because someone was deemed to have walked their dog on the site for 20 years. I think that the dog was changed somewhere along the way. Even if the application fails, this can inflict a great deal of damage, delay matters and cause a lot of expense.</p>

This is not the right Bill or the time to do this. It probably does not require any amendment to Section 15 of the Commons Act. It can be dealt with in two ways: first, local authorities can pull their fingers out and not be unnecessarily legalistic and bureaucratic, which in my experience they have been; and, secondly, by tweaking secondary legislation. It is not necessary to do it here. The problem can be solved in a much more efficient way in secondary legislation through Defra.</p>

Amendment 232 would provide regulation-making powers to allow commons registration authorities to decline new greens applications if there was insufficient evidence that they could meet the necessary criteria, or if they were frivolous or vexatious, and to award costs. It would also prevent applications for the registration of land on which use for sports and pastimes ceased before 6 April 2007 if the land was subject to planning permission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="1110188000114"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Best, asked what can be done through regulation. Through regulation, we can consider streamlining the process for registering greens and setting the fees. The consultation includes a proposal to rule out applications for land which is subject to a planning application or planning permission. This would address the purpose of subsection (5) of the amendment. It also includes a proposal to rule out applications for land which has been identified for development or protected by the local green spaces designation in a local or neighbourhood plan. There is also a proposal to introduce fees for applications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="1110188000115"></a>Commons registration authorities already have the power to reject new town and village green applications that are incomplete or lack the requisite evidence for registration. However, a specific power to deal expeditiously with such matters will provide an increased level of confidence to authorities. For that reason, we have proposed to streamline the sifting process. My noble friend Lady Byford and the noble Lord know that we are still consulting on our proposed reforms, though the deadline fast approaches-in fact, it is tonight. I am sure that they will appreciate how those who have responded to the consultation would feel if we were to legislate now in the manner suggested, without, it would seem, hearing their views on the options we have set out.</p>

We will want to work with my noble friend, the noble Lord, Lord Best, and with others with an interest in taking these conclusions forward.

<a name="1110188000118"></a><b><a name="111017-0003.htm_spnew70"></a><a name="1110188000245"></a>Lord Reay:</b> My Lords, this is a simplified version of an amendment which I moved in Committee. The idea behind it is to remove the right of the Secretary of State to overturn local planning decisions where these have been taken in accordance with the local development plan. Under the amendment, the Secretary of State would be able to overturn a local planning decision on appeal only where the decision had been to refuse permission for a development which was compatible with the local plan, or where the local authority had acted unlawfully, or where due process had not been followed. Where the local authority had refused permission for a development that contravened the local plan, the Secretary of State could not find in the developer's favour on appeal.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="1110188000119"></a>The aim is to redress the balance in the planning process to a small degree, so that developers do not have an entirely unfettered right of appeal. This has led to powerful developers-or, in the case of wind farm applications, to developers with the intoxicating whiff of enormous subsidies in their nostrils-wearing down local authorities and local resistance by systematically appealing every decision that goes against them. By linking the rights of developers and the powers of the Secretary of State to the local plan, the amendment goes some way down the road that the Minister in another place once said he wished to follow, of making the local plan sovereign. The amendment would reduce the scope for developers to ram through unpopular proposals against the wishes of the local community as expressed in local plans. It has the support of the CPRE, which had a large part to play in its drafting.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="1110188000120"></a>I also strongly support Amendment 232ZB, tabled by my noble friend Lady Parminter, which would introduce a community right of appeal. This was the policy of both the Lib Dems and the Conservative Party before the last election. Since then, they seem to have invented the doctrine that it is the planning system that is responsible for the failure of the economy to grow faster than it has, and that nothing new must be introduced which could possibly provide a further obstacle to development. I do not think that my noble friend's amendment is any different from the one she moved in Committee. She has been careful to circumscribe the circumstances in which an appeal can be made so that not any Tom, Dick or Harry can appeal whenever he likes.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="1110188000121"></a>I agree with the terms in which my noble friend has cast her amendment, with one exception. I am not convinced that whether an appeal can go ahead should depend on the position taken by the planning officer. In my noble friend's amendment, the planning officer has to have recommended refusal of planning permission before any appeal against a local authority's decision on the part of the local community can go forward. This seems to be too restrictive. But, even as it is, I would prefer the Bill to contain this amendment.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="1110188000122"></a>There is not much localism in the Bill now. Nothing would do more to restore meaning to the Bill than to reinstate into coalition policy a community right of appeal. Without it, the planning appeals system will remain most unfairly balanced in favour of developers. I hope that my noble friend the

A limited third-party right of appeal would provide stronger safeguards against planning applications which cut across local and neighbourhood plans. Such applications risk compromising the plan-led system and undermining public enthusiasm for taking a stronger role in plan making. As my noble friend Lord Reay mentioned, the Minister in another place has made statements about the importance of enshrining the primacy of the local plan. Granting a limited third-party community right of appeal, which was triggered where a decision to grant planning permission was not in line with the adopted local plan, would be a powerful support to that approach. It could also help to ensure that local councils put sufficient weight on policies in a democratically agreed plan and, crucially, strengthen mandatory pre-application discussions for major developments introduced by this Bill.</p>

I would like to associate myself very strongly with the remarks made by both my noble friends because they are good localist arguments. Having campaigned in all integrity on the basis of the promises that were put forward by my party in respect of a community right of appeal, like many colleagues in the Liberal Democrat party I remain in a state of puzzlement as to why this worthy and desirable policy, very sensibly circumscribed in the amendment spoken to by my noble friend, has disappeared. It is something that some of us will want to return to on a future occasion, and I hope sincerely that the leadership of my party and that of my fellow party in the coalition will think again on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="1110188000126"></a>We cannot support either of these amendments. There is a balance to be struck between what is purely local and where there are other considerations which might well be of significance in regard to major areas of public policy, including that to which the noble Lord, Lord Reay, refers and about which he is exercised-it is right that he should be, if those are his views. There is a legitimate role for the Secretary of State to determine, at any rate, some appeals beyond those which the amendment would refer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="1110188000127"></a>The amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, in addition to the general principle, also creates difficulties.

<a name="11101821000001"></a><b><a name="111017-0003.htm_spnew74"></a><a name="11101821000232"></a>Lord Shutt of Greetland:</b> My Lords, I thank noble Lords who have spoken. I should like, first, to respond to Amendment 232ZB in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, because it helps to set the scene. The amendment intends to give a new right of appeal for local councillors. Before going into detail it would be useful to start by setting out what we are seeking to achieve in the reforms and how communities can shape the area in which they live. The purpose of our planning reforms is to put the local plan at the heart of the system. In fact, the draft national planning policy framework explicitly says so. It is the plan where councils and communities weigh up and integrate different goals and long-term needs so that it sets the framework within which individual planning applications are assessed and decisions taken. We want planning decisions to be taken by local communities, not more appeals undertaken by unelected inspectors in Bristol.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="11101821000002"></a>Everything that we are currently undertaking in the Bill-removing unelected regional structures and the top-down targets which constrained local councils, stopping inspectors arbitrarily rewriting plans without a council's consent and removing unnecessary central government monitoring regimes and interfering in local timetables-gives control, choice and responsibility for local planning back to councils and communities. Other reforms which introduce neighbourhood planning and ensure appropriate consultation with local people before proposals are submitted have also been to that end, so that local people will, in future, have a real say. They will encourage developers to work with the local community to develop proposals all can support, rather than setting them against each other.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="11101821000003"></a>Given this, I have considerable sympathy with the noble Baroness's intentions here. She desires, as I do, to ensure that local communities and the plans agreed between them and their councils should remain at the heart of planning decisions and she is concerned that, in some cases, that does not always happen because of the way the system works. I do not think that her amendment is a solution here. We consider that this would risk adding unnecessary uncertainty and delay at this crucial time of recovery and growth. Applicants will have invested considerable time, money and effort in preparing their proposals and should expect a council's decision to be a corporate one. However, I recognise that there are issues that we need to address.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="11101821000004"></a>First, I understand that local councils have often felt pressure to approve applications which have not been consistent with the plan. One reason is that officers may advise elected members that if they do not approve development, even where it is outside the plan, they may lose at appeal and have to pay costs. Therefore I can reassure the House that we will revise the costs award circular which governs this  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_140"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column 140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>process so that where a council refuses a development proposal on the grounds that it is contrary to an up-to-date development plan and there is no issue of conflict with national planning policy, there should be no grounds for an award of costs against the council in question.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="11101821000005"></a>Secondly, in some cases applications are made and approved which fall outside the development plan. This is an important flexibility in the system. However, we must also be clear that if an application is outside the terms of the plan it should be approved only if locally elected representatives have considered the views of the local community and concluded that such a departure would be acceptable in planning terms. For this reason, we will consult on requiring departure applications to have compulsory pre-application consultation with the local community so that elected members are fully aware of local views before they decide an application. This will mean that local councils will have a clear understanding of local views when they deal with key applications, should have no fear of costs being awarded against them when they have followed the right procedures and will be able to decide cases in the long-term interests of local communities. These changes to the system will strengthen its resilience and ensure that our reforms achieve their objective of putting the local plan and the views of the local community at the heart of the system.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="11101821000006"></a>I pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, for raising these issues so vigorously. By doing so, she has done a service to the House. Given our proposals to strengthen community influence and the involvement in planning as a whole, which I have outlined, I hope she will agree that our measures are strong and effective ways to ensure that community views are heard in the process, especially where a development might depart from an up-to-date plan, and that she will not press her amendment.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="11101821000007"></a>Turning to Amendment 232ZA, as the noble Lord, Lord Reay, said in Committee, planning is a matter of getting the balance right. I agree. We are committed to a system of fewer appeals and want development proposals to be determined locally. However, in the few cases where appeals are made, the Secretary of State, as decision-maker, must be entitled to take other material considerations into account, as can councils, on finely balanced matters of judgment-for example, where a local policy is out of date because it does not reflect the changing circumstances of the local area or more recent national policy. In such instances the law allows councils to consider other material considerations in making the right decisions for their communities. They should not be restricted and neither should the Secretary of State's decision be fettered. Amendment 232ZA would therefore be unduly restrictive in this regard.</p>

<a name="111017-0003.htm_para133"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="11101821000008"></a>However, I understand the intention behind the noble Lord's amendment. We shall take the measures that I outlined earlier so that councils and communities feel confident, if challenged at appeal, in defending planning decisions made in accordance with an up-to-date plan and where there is no conflict with national policy. I reassure the noble Lord that judicial review proceedings can already be brought if a decision was

In short, it requires taking stock of how the new planning landscape is working in practice. It will no doubt be argued that there is going to be post-legislative scrutiny of this legislation in any event, but we consider the ramifications of this part of the Localism Bill to be of particular significance and that it should have this special focus. It requires this report within three years of entry into force, but this timescale is not sacrosanct for us.</p>

<a name="111017-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="11101821000013"></a>If Ministers have confidence in their case, this should not present a difficulty. There can be no doubt that in recent months, since the publication of this Bill, and particularly since the publication of the draft NPPF, the profile of planning-and the purpose of planning-has been raised in our country and our communities. One would not normally expect to see headlines in the <I>Telegraph</I> dominated by planning matters; and we have in a way been startled spectators in unpleasant exchanges between the Planning Minister and no less a body than the National Trust.</p>

<a name="111017-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="11101821000014"></a>Whatever the Government intended to be the outcome of these proposed changes to our planning system, there is no doubt that the way they have gone about it has caused chaos and added huge uncertainty in the planning system, of itself creating paralysis and holding back growth, the very thing they were supposedly designed to stimulate. The fears are that the Government were redefining the purpose of the planning system and refocusing on economic growth to the detriment of the broader requirements of sustainable development. There were plenty of signals to this effect: the presumption in favour of sustainable development; the denial hitherto of transitional provisions; the very wording of the NPPF, which contains no recognisable definition of sustainable development; the scrapping of "brownfield first"; and the inevitable uncertainty created by cramming 1,000 pages of regulation and guidance into 50, even accounting for the removal of overlaps and duplication. Alongside this was the introduction of the neighbourhood planning regime, to be supported by local planning authorities at a time of stretched resources; the duty to co-operate as a substitute for regional and sub-regional spatial strategies; and the operation of the new homes bonus as the supposed driver of new dwellings. Uncertainty abounds. We need a process for Parliament to be able to take stock of where this is all taking us. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="111017-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="11101821000017"></a>We agree that there should be a transparent system for monitoring and reporting. As with decentralising decision-making over housing and planning matters to councils and local communities, we expect them to report progress on all aspects of planning and to make this available to local communities to whom they are accountable. The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 already places a duty on councils to undertake a survey of matters affecting the development of their area, including-I promise I will not go back to sustainable development again-its physical, economic, social and environmental characteristics.</p>

<a name="111017-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="11101821000018"></a>The council is already required to produce an annual monitoring report of local planning activity. Our proposals in the Bill and local planning regulations, on which we have recently consulted, will streamline the process for preparing these reports, reducing the burden on councils and strengthening public accountability. Local planning regulations will also require councils to report progress in relation to neighbourhood development plans and demonstrate how they have worked with others under the duty to co-operate.</p>

<a name="111017-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="11101821000019"></a>My department will support councils in this process by continuing to produce official statistics that can contribute to the evidence base used by councils to develop their plans. With these reassurances, I hope the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.</p>

I accept that there are a range of reporting requirements for local authorities over a range of aspects, but the purpose of this amendment was to say that we have a new system here. A great deal of uncertainty surrounds it. It is right that both Houses of Parliament should be able to take stock of how it has worked out overall. If I understood him, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, was in favour of more frequent reporting than three years. Three years does not seem an unreasonable timeframe. It would be a pity if we could not take the whole of Part 5 and have some report back on how it has all worked out as a package at a macro level. This is not the time of night to pursue this in greater depth, but I ask the Government to reconsider this issue. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Like my noble friend Lord Attlee, I have two speeches. One was a very short speech which said, "I think this is a good idea". The other one was a rather longer speech which said, "I think that this is a very good idea". The Explanatory Notes to the Localism Bill estimated at paragraph 491 that the charge to local authorities would amount to £21 million per annum. I have seen an estimate of the net value of all the changes in the Bill as having a range of between £20 billion and £35 billion. There have been changes and many amendments to the Bill. However, local authorities are worried that they will still have to meet

The purpose of this measure, which is not, of course, a full post-legislative assessment-I have no doubt that the Government will want to do that anyway-is to place a very firm date on when there should be an estimate of the actual costs that will be incurred by local authorities.</p>

<a name="111017-0004.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a><a name="11101821000111"></a>I have here a three-page speech but I will not read it out. However, it seems to me that given that so much of this Bill has affected the way that local authorities are to carry out their duties, it is only fair for the Government to be prepared to have that estimate examined so that there can be a proper assessment of what local authorities have to pay and what will otherwise fall on council tax payers. I will read no more of my speech but I think this is a very just proposal which is supported by the local authorities. I beg to move.</p>

I have a couple of questions. I entirely endorse the thrust of the noble Lord's amendment. I hope that it will be acceptable to the Government. This is more a matter of process. We are not entirely clear how the new system of post-legislative scrutiny will work and what pieces of legislation will be included in it. I hope that this will be one of them. I do not know whether the Minister can indicate whether that is so but in any case it is understood from the impact analysis that the Government intend to draw up the finer details of the review methodology in the months ahead, as they put it. Since the relevant document was written some time ago, that will presumably be done through a soon to be formed Localism Bill review steering group. Has such a group been formed or will it be formed? Who will be involved in it if it has not already been set up? When is it likely to report? How will it work? These are the crucial procedural questions. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, rightly refers to the financial aspect and we entirely endorse the view that as this will effectively be a new burden on local government, it will presumably be within the new burdens doctrine. It will be good to have an assurance on the record that any additional costs of that kind will be met by central government.</p>

An established process is already in place for post-legislative scrutiny of Acts. As set out in Cabinet Office guidance, departments are required to submit a memorandum to their departmental select committees three to five years after Royal Assent of an Act. This memorandum sets out a preliminary assessment on how the Act has worked out in practice, relative to objectives and benchmarks identified during the passage of the Bill.</p>

Inevitably, putting the provisions of this Bill into practice will mean local authorities taking on some new responsibilities. However, the Government are committed to ensuring that any additional burdens on councils are funded in accordance with the new burdens doctrine. The impact of the Bill has been assessed in the usual way, and the necessary funding will be made available.</p>

I have argued that local authorities generally want to know early the total extra burden, but I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</p>

First, much of the relevant material of this order is still under consultation by the Financial Services Authority. The consultation concludes on 31 October and today is 17 October. Secondly, I draw the Minister's attention to the report of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, which, on 13 October, wrote to the Treasury with a reminder of the need to make summaries of consultation responses available at the time an instrument is laid and to ensure that the summary for this draft instrument is available before the debate in this House.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000004"></a>Thirdly, a lot of the scrutiny of this order is dependent on the Opposition and other noble Lords having access to the results of the consultation so that they can properly and fully scrutinise the consequences of the order. The results of the consultation are not available and it is therefore not possible for noble Lords to effectively scrutinise this legislation. If we proceed, it would be the sort of action that brings Parliament into disrepute.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000006"></a>Let me start by explaining the situation we are in, because it is complicated. The previous Government in March 2010 made a decision-a joint decision of Treasury Ministers and Ministers of the Department  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland-that credit unions in Northern Ireland should no longer be exempt from regulation under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and that responsibility for their regulation should transfer from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to the Financial Services Authority. That decision was taken by the previous Government and we are considering the order today. As the Deputy Chairman reminded us, the formal business is moved on the Floor of the House. We are considering the statutory instrument that puts into place a decision by the previous Government.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000007"></a>The running consultation is about consequential provisions relating to the details of the transfer, the transitional arrangements, grandfathering, temporary powers for the FSA, how information will transfer between the department and the FSA, and consequential issues to do with money laundering and terrorist financing. Those will all dealt with-to the extent they need to be-in the appropriate way through instruments or regulation. Therefore, what is being consulted at the moment is nothing that should detain us from putting in place a decision by the previous Government with which this Government completely agree. In our view, it is about time that we got on with the enabling instrument and there is no reason not to allow the consultation on the "how" of the transfer to carry on in the normal way.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000008"></a>The Treasury is publishing today responses to the original policy proposals in principle. However, the decision was originally taken and announced in a joint document by the UK Government and the Northern Ireland department in March 2010. I think we should turn to the substance of the order.</p>

Is there any reason why the Minister wants to move this Motion now, given that it would have easier to consider the two orders together for the sake of clarity?</p>

It is quite right that we should consult on the how. It is for this Committee to decide the simple and important issue of principle as to whether the people of Northern Ireland, 50 per cent of whose population have their money invested in credit unions, are given the proper and full protection which FSA regulation would give them. Of course it is important that the how of the transfer is properly considered, which is what the current consultation is all about, but it might be sensible if we considered the arguments-which I think are extremely clear cut; there is nothing between the previous Government and the present Government on this-that we need to get on and give those in Northern Ireland, a very significant number of people, the protection afforded to those who put deposits in banks in the whole of the United Kingdom and currently put deposits in credit unions in Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="11101713000046"></a>The order before us today is included in Chapter 3. Does the Minister know the answer to that question from the people of Northern Ireland?</p>

<p><a name="11101713000012"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="11101713000063"></a>Lord Newby:</b> My Lords-</p>

<p><a name="11101713000013"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="11101713000064"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall):</b> My Lords, I believe that the Minister has not yet finished the speech he wishes to make in order to put the Motion. We must first put the Motion before it can be discussed, so we must wait until he is ready to say that he wishes to put it.</p>

<p><a name="11101713000014"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="11101713000065"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> My Lords, credit unions operate throughout the United Kingdom, providing savings and loans services, mostly in their local communities. Although the credit union sector in Great Britain is relatively small, it makes a large contribution to the financial inclusion agenda by operating in areas of poverty where local communities often lack access to affordable credit. In contrast, the credit union sector in Northern Ireland is extremely significant within the financial services landscape. Approximately 50 per cent of the adult population of Northern Ireland are members of their local credit union.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000015"></a>That is why, quite properly, the previous Government decided that that situation needed to be looked at and resolved. It was the belief of the previous Government, confirmed by the present Government, that credit unions in Northern Ireland should be brought under the Financial Services and Markets Act. That is for three main reasons.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000016"></a>The first is for reasons of financial stability. Given the significance of credit unions in Northern Ireland, the collapse of the sector would have a devastating impact on entire communities' access to financial services and credit facilities.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000017"></a>Secondly, the order will ensure that the deposits of each Northern Ireland credit union member will be protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, the FSCS. This will guarantee each deposit up to the £85,000 limit, in line with credit union members in Great Britain. The current legislation exempts these credit unions from this guarantee. As a result, there is a distortion in the level of consumer protection provided for credit unions across the United Kingdom. Removing the current exemption from the Financial Services and Markets Act will address this distortion and prevent members from relying on untested depositor protection schemes run by the various trade bodies across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Those credit unions that are unaffiliated with one of those trade bodies currently have no depositor protection. That is wrong. Northern Irish credit union depositors should be put on the same footing as those elsewhere in the United Kingdom; and as with bank depositors.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000018"></a>Thirdly, by removing the exemption from the Financial Services and Markets Act, the members of each Northern Ireland credit union will have recourse to the Financial

Again, this is an aspect of consumer protection not currently afforded to members in Northern Ireland and is another positive aspect of the proposed legislative changes.</p>
<h5><a name="11101713000053"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000019"></a>The proposed changes will, of course, entail the industry bearing some additional costs. These costs are largely with respect to training staff on the new regulatory demands, amending computer systems and contributing to the FSCS levy. However, it is the Government's view that these mostly upfront costs are a relatively small price for the sector to pay for increased consumer protection and financial stability. Moreover, the increased confidence in the sector that will result has the potential to have a positive impact to the extent that the Northern Ireland credit unions will be better placed to attract additional deposits. This uplift in confidence was seen in the Great Britain credit union sector after it was brought under the Financial Services and Markets Act in 2002. While the initial impact on UK financial services may have gone unnoticed, the growth of the Great Britain credit union sector has been extremely strong since the transfer.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000020"></a>The Government strongly believe, as did the previous Government, that Northern Irish depositors should not be treated any differently from depositors in Great Britain. These proposals go a long way to levelling the playing field in depositor protection across the United Kingdom and are eagerly awaited by those seeking peace of mind about their family finances. They also support the Government's aim of promoting the mutuals sector in the United Kingdom as a whole, and in doing so have a positive impact on the diversity of financial services. For example, Northern Ireland credit unions will, subject to normal FSA approval, be free to offer basic products such as ISAs and mortgages. This can only be good for consumers and the mutuals sector.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000021"></a>While I look forward to hearing your Lordships' views on these proposals, I believe that they are uncontroversial and have the support of both the current and previous Government. A decision on them was announced by the previous Government in March 2010. The consultation responses to the original question have been published. The consultation on the "how" of the transfer will, as the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, says, carry on until 31 October, but today we are considering a very simple order that agrees the principle of the transfer. The details of how the transfer will be effected will, as I said at the outset, be the subject of either further orders or regulation in the normal course. I hope that the proposals will not be too long detained by procedural wrangling, which might get in the way of the Northern Irish people getting the protection that they deserve. I hope the Committee will offer its support to the order.</p>

<p><I>Relevant document: 28th</I><sup><I></I></sup><I>Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments</I></p>
</ul>

<p><a name="11101713000022"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="11101713000067"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> My Lords, I put a question to the noble Lord, which he has not answered, regarding the response of the people of Northern Ireland to the question about whether they agree with the order. On this side of the Committee we are entirely supportive of the objectives of the order. That is not the point that I am raising. My point is that the Merits Committee wrote to the Treasury on 13 October, reminding it to ensure that the summary of this draft instrument was available before the debate in the House. I have not been able to find a summary of the consultation on this draft instrument. Without the reactions of the people of Northern Ireland, who are closely and greatly involved in credit unions, as the Minister pointed out, it is very difficult to offer the order proper scrutiny. Therefore, I cannot continue, other than to say that it would be appropriate for the Treasury to ensure that relevant consultation material is published, as the Merits Committee requires, prior to consideration of draft legislation by the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="11101713000023"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="11101713000068"></a>Lord Newby:</b> My Lords, there seems to be a muddle over the consultation. The Explanatory Memorandum said that the summary of responses to the March 2010 consultation will be published shortly. I think the Minister said that it was published today. I do not know when the March 2010 consultation formally finished, but it was presumably quite a long time ago. It is indeed unsatisfactory that we do not have the results of that consultation.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000024"></a>However, I think it is appropriate to look at what the order says. It is an extraordinarily short order, and it says nothing, as the Minister said, about the detail of how this change will be effected. All it says is that the change will be effected and that Northern Irish credit unions will be brought under the ambit of the FSA. I do not know, but I would be surprised if there was a single, solitary soul in Northern Ireland who would oppose that change, particularly if they look at what has been happening south of the border in recent weeks. Only a couple of weeks ago, the Irish Finance Minister was called upon to inject €1 billion into the credit union sector south of the border, because many of those credit unions-and we are talking about a sector that is as predominant as it is north of the border-found themselves, as a result of rising unemployment and declining income, in some difficulties. Of the 407 credit unions in the Republic of Ireland, some 79 are now in need of this injection of capital.  It seems likely not only that that will need to  happen but that there will have to be some consolidation in the sector and smaller credit unions will need to merge.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000025"></a>My question to the Minister is, in a completely different sense to that of the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, why it has taken the Government so long to bring this legislation forward, given that the majority of the population of Northern Ireland would be affected if their credit union got into difficulty. Even if we approve this order in due course, it does not come into effect until 31 March next year. My question to the Minister was going to be, and remains, whether he has any  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>evidence that the travails that afflict the Republic of Ireland credit union sector are spreading north. Does he envisage that any individual credit unions north of the border will get into difficulties over the coming weeks and months? In the absence of any covering FSA jurisdiction, what would the Government's response be were they to find themselves in the same position of the Government south of the border, where a significant number-in their case about 15 per cent of credit unions-required short-term capital support?</p>

<p><a name="11101713000026"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="11101713000069"></a>Lord Myners:</b> My Lords, I broadly welcome the intention of this order, but I find myself wanting to ask the Minister why it has taken such a long time to bring it forward when it was self-evident that it was necessary and had been agreed by the previous Government and endorsed by the coalition parties when previously discussed. It seems lamentable that the Government have allowed the situation to go on for as long as it has without taking any necessary action.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000027"></a>When it comes to this particular order, we do not have sight of the evidence that we were assured would be available to us in informing our discussion and agreement. What harm would be done if the Government withdrew the order and brought it back after we have had an opportunity to consider the evidence that is so clearly necessary to inform our decision on this matter. It simply cannot be acceptable that the evidence has been published only this morning. As far as I am aware, no effort has been made to make it available to those who are likely to attend this session and discuss this matter. That is an inexcusable failure by the Minister and the Treasury, for which the Minister owes us a full and proper account. The right approach would be to withdraw this order until we have had adequate opportunity to discuss the evidence.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000028"></a>In the mean time, I support the question that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked. Can the Minister give us clarity, given that the Government have been so slow in bringing this matter forward, as to the position of people with accounts and business relationships with Northern Ireland credit unions that have experienced difficulty? Do the Government stand behind them until such time as the Financial Services Compensation Scheme becomes an eligible right of those with relationships with credit unions? Will the Minister also assure us that to the best of the knowledge of the Treasury and the FSA credit unions are not currently offering products in Northern Ireland to which they are not entitled by virtue of their authorities? The Minister at the end of his speech listed some of the products that credit unions would be able to offer once this order was implemented, but which they are not currently able to.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000029"></a>Finally-I ask this having dealt with these matters myself-can the Minister tell us whether any further action is intended with respect of the failure of the Presbyterian Mutual Society, and in particular the directors?</p>

<p><a name="11101713000030"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="11101713000070"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> My Lords, notwithstanding the welcome rare appearance of the noble Lord, Lord Myners as a former Treasury Minister in this Committee, it is a bit rich of the Opposition to talk about delay in this  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>order. The Northern Ireland credit unions were left out of FSA regulation from the time that the Financial Services and Markets Act was enacted in 2000 until the previous Government left office 18 months ago. So for members of the Opposition to talk about the delay of this Government in not getting the order through earlier while on the other hand asking for evidence of a decision that they had taken before the election-seemingly without waiting for the evidence that they are now asking for-is indeed a bit rich. If noble Lords on the other side really want to persist with this line, this order will not get through, as it has to in the next few days and weeks, in order to give the people of Northern Ireland proper protection of their money in mutuals from the proposed transfer date to FSA regulation of March 2012.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000031"></a>What does the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, who has come along with all kinds of clever procedural tricks this afternoon, have to say to the people of Northern Ireland if he is to deprive them yet further of proper protection under the Financial Services Compensation scheme? We need to get this order through if the people of Northern Ireland are to be protected from March of next year.</p>

<p><a name="11101713000032"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="11101713000071"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> My Lords, to refer to the fact that the Government have apparently published only this morning the evidence of the consultation and the raising of the objection of not having had access to it as a clever procedural trick is an abuse of language.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000033"></a>The point we are making is that the Government should take seriously the consultation with the people of Northern Ireland and make the results of the consultation available to the Opposition so that they can properly scrutinise and assess the impacts of the change. That is all that I asked for. I also pointed out that on 13 October the Merits Committee wrote to the Treasury requesting that the material be published, and it was not published until this morning.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000034"></a>As my noble friends and I have made clear, we are entirely supportive of this legislation. We want to get it through as soon as possible, but we want proper due process. This is an abuse of due process. I think it would be best if we let the Minister proceed with his Motion, because he is not interested in actually debating the issues.</p>

<p><a name="11101713000035"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="11101713000072"></a>Lord Myners:</b> I would always defer to the advice and conclusion of my noble friend Lord Eatwell, but the petulant language used by the Minister is a sign of how rattled he is by this subject. I invite the Minister to clarify. He has said that if this order is not approved today it would deny the people of Northern Ireland certainty and protection in due course, with effect from the end of March next year. Can the Minister confirm that delaying the approval of this order for another week so that the necessary information can be reviewed by Parliament would mean that that certainty could not be delivered and that this is, therefore, the last chance for us to discuss it? In the absence of a clear answer I think that the should withdraw this order and re-present it to the Committee in a week or so.</p>

<p><a name="11101713000036"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="11101713000073"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> My Lords, the situation is that we need to have the process complete, as I said, within the next days and weeks. There are a number of orders that need to be laid. In particular, four orders will need to be laid containing the transitional and consequential provisions, because those follow the negative procedure and they can only be made and laid after this affirmative order. So there must be a sequencing here, which we are starting today. All the information that has been requested will be available for the consequential technical provisions, which formed the main substance of the consultation. If we do not get on and lay today's order, with the four that follow, in the time that is available, there is a very serious risk that transfer to FSA control will be delayed by approximately six months. It could be longer, as the FSA would need to restart the clock on its transfer process.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000037"></a>I am sorry if noble Lords do not like my language, but for those who are looking at this from Northern Ireland and who thought that the previous Government had made a clear decision, I quote from paragraph 1.1 of the March 2010 document, which says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11101713000050"></a>"Following the decision that credit unions in Northern Ireland should no longer be exempt from regulation under the Financial Services and Markets Act".</p>

<p><a name="11101713000047"></a>We are today discussing the order which, if formally made, will enact that decision, made by the previous Government last year. The four enabling orders, for which the evidence must, of course, be considered, will be put through by the appropriate negative procedure. However, they cannot be laid until after this affirmative order has gone through. I hope that that explains matters.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000038"></a>In response to the question from my noble friend Lord Newby and the noble Lord, Lord Myners, I accept that there has been delay in this process, although not the 10-year delay of the previous Administration. There has been some delay because this is a matter not just for Her Majesty's Treasury, but also for the Northern Ireland department. There have also been elections in Northern Ireland. I would have preferred things to have been tidied up a little earlier, but I really do not think that this should prevent us making the critical decision which Northern Ireland is waiting for.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000039"></a>On the responses to the decision in principle, it is, indeed, supported by the Northern Irish public. The published responses are positive. I apologise if the document arrived rather late, but nobody approached us and asked to see it until five minutes before we started. Responses were, on the whole, in favour of the transfer. The concerns expressed, such as they were, were over the nature of the transfer, which is precisely why an FSA consultation is taking place, relating to the four subsequent orders which will come forward and be considered in due course.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000040"></a>The other substantive issues which have been raised in this short debate are important. My noble friend Lord Newby asked about the difficulties in the Republic of Ireland, the consequences of their spreading north and so on. Clearly, the credit union sector in Northern Ireland has been affected by the financial crisis but not to the same extent as institutions in the Republic of Ireland. There remains a divide in the business operations  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC9"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC9</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from those institutions over the border as credit union membership is usually limited to a local geographical common bond. There is some crossover with the Republic in the membership of trade bodies and their respective depositor protection schemes, which is another reason that supports getting on with this. However, it is something that we need to get on with as fast as we can anyway.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000041"></a>In answer not only to that question but the related question of the noble Lord, Lord Myners, until we get this new arrangement in place, credit union deposits will remain the responsibility of the devolved Administration, as they have been since the settlement with Northern Ireland some 15 years ago. That could have been cleared up by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 but it was not. This reinforces why it is right to get on with this, since the whole Committee seems to agree on the principle.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000042"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Myners, also asked for an assurance that credit unions are not offering products that they are not entitled to offer. That remains the responsibility of the Northern Irish department until 31 March 2012 and I cannot speak for the department. After that date, credit unions will fall within FSA regulation in the normal way. The noble Lord also referred to the Presbyterian Mutual Society, which was a sorry saga. The present Government stepped in and helped with the clearing up of it. However, the Presbyterian Mutual Society is not a credit union under the terms of the order and is therefore not directly relevant to this afternoon's discussion. However, it points out in a different way the importance of seeing that Northern Ireland gets a fair deal across the whole spectrum of financial services.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000043"></a>In summary, these measures are positive for credit unions and their current and future members. The transfer is important for the long-term security of and confidence in a very important financial services sector for Northern Ireland. While there are some upfront costs, they are relatively modest in relation to what we are putting in place. This is positive not only for consumers of financial services in Northern Ireland but should enable the credit unions themselves to develop their business in a positive way by offering further products.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="11101713000044"></a>I can only apologise to the Committee for the fact that we did not have the responses out earlier. I believed that they were not a matter of significance in relation to the basic decision, in principle, that was taken in March 2010. If we had received requests for them earlier, we would of course have seen what we could do to have a discussion and go through what was available. However, I was not aware until shortly before the start of this Committee that there were such concerns. I appreciate that the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, tried to get hold of my office but was not able to get through this morning. I say again that the evidence relates in particular to the four negative orders which necessarily follow and could never be laid at the same time as this order. I hope that this Committee will give its support to something which all speakers have said they approve of in principle.</p>

However, I shall support the order on the basis of the assurances that the Minister has given that the evidence is strongly in support of it. I shall support the order also on the basis that the Minister has assured us that failure to approve it would therefore slow the four consequential negative orders and could lead to the FSA delaying by up to six months taking on the responsibilities contemplated by this order. If the Minister's assurances on that point are not as clear as I interpret them, I would continue to be of the view that the right and proper process is for Parliament to have examined the evidence before reaching a decision. However, I believe that the Minister has given us a very clear indication that it is absolutely critical that the order be approved in the next few days or weeks-I hope that by "weeks" he does not mean several weeks, but a week or two at the maximum.</p>

<p><a name="11101722000001"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="11101722000066"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl Howe):</b> My Lords, the Medicines Act 1968 (Pharmacy) Order, being debated today, will remove the restriction placed upon pharmacists registered in Britain by virtue of a pharmacy qualification awarded by a relevant European state that prevents them being in charge of a newly established pharmacy. This refers to any pharmacy that has been registered for less than three years and is commonly known as "the three-year rule".</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000002"></a>The relevant European states referred to are Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and the European Union (EU) member states. It is not relevant to pharmacists who qualified in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000003"></a>I should first give the Grand Committee some background. All pharmacists practising in Britain must be registered by the General Pharmaceutical Council, as must all pharmacy premises. Some pharmacists are registered to practise in Britain under arrangements for the mutual recognition of pharmacist qualifications awarded by EU member states or other relevant European states.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000004"></a>EU Directive 85/433-now 2005/36/EC-includes provision for member states to place restrictions on the recognition of the qualifications of such pharmacists in the case of pharmacy premises registered for a  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC11"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC11</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>period of less than three years. In Britain, the restriction applies to the pharmacist in charge of such pharmacies, known as the "responsible pharmacist". In other words, while all pharmacists registered in Britain under the mutual recognition arrangements may work in any British pharmacy, however long it has been registered, such pharmacists cannot hold the position of responsible pharmacist in a pharmacy that has been registered for less than three years. The current restrictions on visiting pharmacists owning pharmacy businesses or acting as superintendents are not affected by this order.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000005"></a>The derogation in the directive was originally put in place in the mid-1980s for economic reasons, following concerns by UK MEPs. They believed that, given the UK's comparatively open arrangements in relation to pharmacy ownership, there was a risk that the mutual recognition arrangements would put existing UK pharmacies at a disadvantage. Since then, however, much has changed both in terms of pharmacy arrangements in other EU member states and the evolution of domestic policy in Britain.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000006"></a>We have conducted a full public consultation on removing the restriction, both for established pharmacists-those fully registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council in part 1 of the register-and for visiting pharmacists-those temporarily practising in the UK and registered in part 4 of the register. However, the restriction has not affected any visiting pharmacists as, to date, none has been registered.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000007"></a>The response to the public consultation has been very much in favour of removing the restriction. The proposal has support from the General Pharmaceutical Council, the pharmacy regulator, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, the professional body for pharmacists, as well as all the main pharmacy representative organisations, including the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, Community Pharmacy Scotland, the Company Chemists Association and the devolved Administrations.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000008"></a>The proposal will encourage flexibility, efficiency and continuity of care within pharmacy. It will end the situation where a responsible pharmacist, registered here by virtue of the mutual recognition arrangements, can no longer continue in that role if their pharmacy relocates, even if it only moves next door, and therefore becomes a newly registered pharmacy. Removing this restriction will mean that patients can enjoy greater continuity of care in such circumstances; that all registered pharmacists will be placed on a level footing in terms of their employment prospects; and that employers will have a deeper pool of potential employees to draw upon and less bureaucracy to deal with when filling vacancies.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000009"></a>I should now explain the revision of the draft Explanatory Memorandum laid before your Lordships today and the change required to the final version of the Explanatory Note on the order. In undertaking preparatory work for this debate on the draft order, officials in the Department of Health realised that, contrary to previous understanding, "visiting pharmacists", a sub-category of registrants from relevant European states who do not go through the full registration procedure, are covered by the removal of restrictions that the draft order would achieve. It will not, therefore, require a  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC12"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC12</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>separate legal instrument to remove the restriction upon their acting as "responsible pharmacist" at new pharmacies. Up to this point, it had been thought that a separate legislative instrument would be required to achieve this. The confusion appears to have arisen in the understanding of the differences between the restrictions applying to those who either may own, or carry on, a pharmacy business or act as superintendent, on the one hand, and the provisions relating to the responsible pharmacist on the other. A superintendent manages a pharmacy on behalf of a company. A responsible pharmacist is in charge of a pharmacy at a given time, and takes on responsibility for the effective management of pharmacy law and practice within a single branch at a particular time. If the draft order is approved, it will still not be possible for a visiting pharmacist to carry on-that is, to own a new pharmacy-or act as a superintendent in relation to a new pharmacy.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000010"></a>However, a visiting pharmacist, and any other pharmacist registered by virtue of the mutual recognition arrangements, would, upon the coming into force of the order, be entitled to be the responsible pharmacist in charge of a newly registered pharmacy in Britain. It is the similarity between the different concepts of control that appears to have led to the confusion. The intention has always been to remove the restriction on responsible pharmacists for all those registered to practise in Great Britain under the EU mutual recognition arrangements, whether visiting or not. The consultation reflected this and the order as currently drafted would achieve this.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000011"></a>Because of the misunderstanding, the earlier version of the accompanying draft Explanatory Memorandum, and the Explanatory Note on the order itself, suggested that the order did not remove the restriction in relation to visiting pharmacists. In fact, the substantive provisions of the order achieve the intention and a further instrument is not, therefore, required. However, the text in the Explanatory Note that refers to the register was incorrect, and the reference to part 1 of the register will not appear in the final version. I apologise for any confusion caused by this late change. I commend this order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="11101722000012"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="11101722000067"></a>Lord Collins of Highbury:</b> As the noble Earl stated, a lot has changed since the derogation in the directive was put in place. Much has changed in pharmacy arrangements in other EU member states and in the evolution of domestic policy. The reasons, as the Minister stated, were commercial.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000013"></a>In England, for example, there has been a welcome change over the past few years making it easier for people to get to a chemist, given that there are new pharmacies with longer opening hours. Clearly, such market restrictions are not appropriate today, and their removal will assist by increasing the pool of available pharmacists and ensure improved continuity of service delivery. I note that the change has also been welcomed by the key representative bodies of pharmacies.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000014"></a>I of course recognise that the restriction affects a relatively small number of pharmacies-just over 10 per cent, and just over 5 per cent of all pharmacists registered to practice in Great Britain. I also understand and accept the reasons for the change in the Explanatory Memorandum. However, these changes in the legislation  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC13"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC13</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>raise broader issues relating to the competencies of the pharmacist and the person's ability to manage a pharmacy. For example, the report on the consultation noted that concerns were expressed by respondents on competency in English. The Department of Health in its response stated that in the UK a check on the language knowledge of a pharmacist from outside the UK who is seeking work within the NHS is applied by the prospective employer, but that there is no check made at the point of registration.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000015"></a>This leads to three specific questions to the Minister. First, are there plans to introduce a standardised competency test to ensure that any pharmacists from the countries mentioned in the order who are in charge of a new pharmacy have all the required skills and competences? Secondly, are there plans to ensure that those in charge of a pharmacy will have a sufficiently high standard of English to avoid all risk of a patient misunderstanding any advice given? Thirdly, how can an employer determine whether the pharmacist in question is qualified in their own country and has no pending fitness-to-practise cases to answer?</p>

<p><a name="11101722000016"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="11101722000068"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> My Lords, I declare an interest as chairman of the council of the School of Pharmacy of the University of London. I thank the noble Earl, Lord Howe, for a crystal clear explanation. I suppose, perforce, it had to be crystal clear to clear up some confusion arising from the Explanatory Memorandum. This is precisely the kind of uncontroversial deregulation that is important in the context. From both professional and consumer perspectives one could say that it is a perfectly formed small regulation. It affects a limited number of people who could not be responsible pharmacists in certain circumstances, but will now be able to be so where there are no significant safety implications from deregulating in the way that this order does.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000017"></a>I want to raise the issue of reciprocity. The noble Earl mentioned that the reason for deregulation is that circumstances have changed. The noble Lord, Lord Collins, also referred to that. I am sure that in broad terms that is the case, but I should be extremely grateful to hear what the noble Earl believes the level of that deregulation would be. I remember doing a study of several EU countries, looking into what was permissible in pharmacy ownership and the level of regulation. That was about five years ago, when the level of regulation was extremely high-not just pharmacy regulation but the kind of licensing required to run a retail outlet, and so on. We have some extremely well run chains in this country, which would like to expand their offer in the EU more broadly. They have been largely frustrated from doing so by some of the regulation that applies. Therefore, reciprocity in these circumstances is extremely important. I am interested to hear just what the Minister believes to be the level of significant deregulation that has taken place.</p>

<p><a name="11101722000018"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="11101722000069"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to both noble Lords for their support for the order. The noble Lord, Lord Collins, asked me three questions. The first was about whether there are any plans to introduce a standardised competency test to make sure that pharmacists from the various countries mentioned have all the required skills to do their job. Under  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC14"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications, which I mentioned, a pharmacist who holds a recognised qualification issued by one member state is entitled to recognition of that qualification in another member state, and would therefore be entitled to registration with a competent authority, such as the General Pharmaceutical Council.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000019"></a>However, employers of pharmacists should ensure that anybody they employ has the skills required to undertake the specific post. The General Pharmaceutical Council's standards of conduct, ethics and performance, among other things, require the pharmacist to recognise the limits of their professional competence and practise in only those areas in which they are competent. Their continued registration is subject to adherence to the council's requirement for continuing professional development-CPD-and standards of conduct, ethics and performance.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000020"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord asked whether there are plans to make sure that those in charge of a pharmacy have a high enough standard of English. The UK Government's response to the European Commission's consultation on the review of the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications clearly sets out the view that in the healthcare professions the ability to communicate with patients and service users is vital.</p>
<h5><a name="11101722000058"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000021"></a>The Government also said in their response that it is vital that employers and organisations contracting with healthcare professionals undertake effective checks on language and communication competence. The management of the NHS is devolved, but in England I can say that there are statutory requirements relating to applicants wishing to provide NHS services as a pharmacy contractor; that means that their applications must be refused if they do not satisfy the local primary care trust that they have the knowledge of English necessary for the provision of pharmaceutical services in their area.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000022"></a>We expect and encourage those carrying on pharmacy businesses to engage staff, including those who may serve as responsible pharmacists, with a knowledge of English which is appropriate for the role that they will be undertaking. In addition, the General Pharmaceutical Council-the regulator for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in Great Britain-requires as part of its standards of conduct, ethics and performance, that pharmacy professionals must be able to communicate effectively with patients and the public, and take reasonable steps to meet their communication needs.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000023"></a>The noble Lord's third question was how an employer is supposed to determine whether a pharmacist from overseas is qualified in their own country and has no pending fitness-to-practise cases to answer. Any pharmacist wishing to register in Great Britain with the regulator, including those wishing to register under the EC mutual recognition provisions, must at the point of registration make declarations about any criminal convictions as well as ongoing criminal investigations.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000024"></a>In addition, the General Pharmaceutical Council also requires what is called a "letter of good standing", or a certificate from the relevant competent authority-  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC15"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC15</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that is, the relevant regulatory or government body responsible in the country concerned, which is equivalent to the General Pharmaceutical Council. This is the mechanism by which any fitness-to-practise issues in the home member state are brought to the attention of the General Pharmaceutical Council.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, asked a broader question about deregulation and reciprocity in our partner countries. At the time when the directive was made, most member states had greater restrictions on pharmacy ownership than the UK. That point in particular caught the attention of UK MEPs at the time. The UK has had the least restricted system for many years, with pharmacies owned by pharmacists and non-pharmacists-for instance pharmacy chains-but in some other member states, pharmacies have to be owned by pharmacists and they can only own one pharmacy, and not a chain of pharmacies.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000026"></a>That was the situation as it used to obtain. It is now a number of years since the directive was first cast, and some other European states allow ownership of pharmacies by non-pharmacists, enabling ownership by UK pharmacy chains. The level of reciprocity on pharmacy ownership, including for pharmacy chains, is very much improved.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000027"></a>As regards any restrictions which may apply to pharmacists who have qualified in Great Britain practising in other EU member states-which I think is part of the question my noble friend asked-our information is that only one other member state apart from Great Britain now operates a restriction under the derogation permitted by directive 2005/36.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000030"></a>This Government are committed to ensuring greater openness and transparency in order to enable the public to hold to account those who deliver the services affecting their day-to-day lives. The coalition agreement set out this intention, stating that the Government would,</p>
<ul><a name="11101722000056"></a>"extend the scope of the Freedom of Information Act to provide greater transparency".</ul>
<p><a name="11101722000031"></a>This order is part of our work to meet this commitment.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000032"></a>The Freedom of Information Act gives any person the legal right to request access to recorded information held by a public authority. It applies to more than 100,000 public authorities, including central government, schools, the NHS, local authorities and some publicly owned companies.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000033"></a>This order designates three additional bodies as public authorities for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act, using the powers contained in Section 5 of the Act. Section 5 enables the Secretary of State to designate a person as a public authority either if they appear to the Secretary of State to exercise functions of a public nature or if they provide, under contract made with a public authority, any service whose provision is a function of that authority. The order covers bodies falling within the first limb: bodies which appear to exercise functions of a public nature.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000034"></a>Where a body is designated as a public authority under this limb, it is also necessary, under Section 7(5) of the Act, for the order to specify each of the body's functions which appear to the Secretary of State to be of a public nature. Only those functions specified in the order will be subject to the Act. So an order under Section 5 can bring all or just some of a body's functions within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act. Therefore, to understand how the order extends the Freedom of Information Act, it is important to look not just at which bodies the order designates but at which of their functions the order specifies.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000035"></a>With that background in mind, I turn to the detail of the order before us today. The order designates both ACPO and the Financial Ombudsman Service for all of their functions, and UCAS for its main functions, as public authorities for the purposes of the FOI Act. Before making the order, all three bodies were consulted and their functions analysed to determine which of them appeared to be of a public nature.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000036"></a>I turn first to ACPO, which provides leadership for the police force, aims to improve policing, acts as a voice for the force and provides the strategic police response in times of national need. By way of background, it is worth noting that the individual chief police officers who comprise ACPO are already subject to the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000037"></a>The draft order lists each of ACPO's functions. These functions are derived from ACPO's objects as listed in its memorandum and articles of association. Each function makes a fundamental contribution to the policing of the state, both individually and collectively. On this basis, the Secretary of State has concluded that all of ACPO's functions appear to be functions of a public nature and this order will bring them all within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC17"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC17</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000038"></a>The Financial Ombudsman Service administers an ombudsman scheme in the financial services sector under which certain disputes can be resolved quickly and informally by an independent person. The Financial Ombudsman Service's functions are set out in statute. It provides an alternative, impartial dispute resolution process to the courts. There is a strong public interest and benefit in the provision of impartial, non-profit-making regulation of financial services. As all of the Financial Ombudsman Service's functions are directed towards the provision of this service, this order will bring them all within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000039"></a>UCAS's main function is to provide and maintain a central application and admissions services for higher education and certain further education establishments. It also provides other, more commercially based functions, such as the provision of marketing services. The majority of bodies for which UCAS provides and maintains a central applications and admissions service are already subject to freedom of information legislation. There is clearly a strong public interest and benefit in the provision of an efficient and fair means of applying for entry to such bodies. Indeed, if these services were not provided by UCAS, it would fall to those educational bodies that are already subject to the Freedom of Information Act to provide them instead. This provides a clear basis for concluding that the applications and admissions function appears to be public in nature. However, UCAS's other commercial functions can be seen as distinct from the central applications services that it provides and are not considered to be functions of a public nature. This order therefore includes only UCAS within the scope of the FOI Act for the purposes of providing a central applications and admissions service to bodies already subject to Freedom of Information legislation.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000040"></a>As I have outlined, the Secretary of State concluded that the three bodies subject to the order appear to varying degrees to exercise functions of a public nature. As a result, it is appropriate that these bodies be subject to the same scrutiny as other public authorities, so that they become more open, transparent and accountable. This order will achieve that aim for three bodies, but this is just the start. The Government are currently consulting more than 200 further bodies about their inclusion in future orders, alongside pursing primary legislation to extend the scope of the Freedom of Information Act to more publicly owned companies.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000041"></a>I hope noble Lords will agree with me that this order is an important step towards greater transparency, and I commend it to the Committee.</p>

I used to have some relationship with the police service. It is not at all unusual for police services from time to time to get caught up in security matters. It follows from that equally that the subject occasionally occurs in ACPO matters. The Minister said that all activities would be subject to the Freedom of Information Act. How will we resolve that particular dilemma if ACPO finds itself discussing security concerns?</p>

He also mentioned that there was an intention further to widen the scope of the Freedom of Information Act. Under one of those headings, could he tell us why there is an official at Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs who claims that he cannot give information as to why he signed off a particular deal, which resulted in a big financial company being excused millions of pounds in disputed tax? He has pleaded confidentiality and I understand that he is appearing before the Public Accounts Committee in the other place to answer for that. The Minister, knows that I do not like springing things on him, but will he answer two questions? First, why was it not brought forward or was it considered? Secondly, will he, in future, look into the scope of the so-called confidentiality clauses quoted by this officer to justify not giving the full details of why he allowed the appeal from that financial company?</p>

<p><a name="11101722000044"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="11101722000074"></a>Lord Maclennan of Rogart:</b> The order before us is welcome, in general terms. As the extension of the operation of the Freedom of Information Act to the three bodies concerned was first raised as long ago as 2007, there has been plenty of time for grave, or even limited, concerns to be raised about the matter. There are, consequently, only some quite small matters that spring to my mind as being worthy of inquiry. These arise not so much from the propositions themselves as from the impact assessment, which was published in June of this year, and the very helpful Explanatory Memorandum.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000045"></a>This memorandum describes ACPO as being a professional body, not a staff association. I find that concept a little hard to come to terms with because there seem to be occasions when ACPO does, to some extent, consider matters that are peculiar to the police and may not have a direct public impact. I am thinking, for example, of whether it would be desirable for their reactions to a proposed restructuring of the police to be identified as the views of individuals participating in a debate on the subject. It is clear that the views of ACPO as a whole on such a restructuring should be engaged, but it cannot be entirely desirable for the way that debate took place to be made public. I know that individual members of ACPO are already subject to inquiry under the Freedom of Information Act, so perhaps I am splitting hairs. However, there must be matters that it is appropriate for professional associations not to disclose because they apply to them and not necessarily to the public.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000046"></a>The more important issue arises from the indication that the Government are continuing the process of scrutiny of the consequences of the Freedom of Information Act, although this may be just a failure of understanding on my part. The Explanatory Memorandum that we have been given indicates that that is an ongoing process, but that the results might be known by the end of this month. That is referred to in paragraph 12, "Monitoring &amp; review". It states that any changes to be made to the FOI Act as a whole will  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC19"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC19</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be contained in a memorandum to be submitted to Justice Committee later this calendar year. How extensive and deep will the inquiry be? Are all the departments and all the many bodies covered being asked to make a submission? That must create a very considerable body of work.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000047"></a>That should be viewed in conjunction with what was stated in the impact assessment of the policy review; namely, that there will be no arrangements in place that will allow a systematic collection of monitoring information for future policy review. To invite all the bodies covered by FOI to make submissions once as a kind of big research exercise is perfectly sensible and reasonable, and was envisaged when the Act was brought forward. However, if we are to maintain proper parliamentary oversight of the effectiveness of this scrutiny, this openness and the purposes of the Act, it would make sense if problems that arose in the administration of the Act were noted and tabulated so that it was relatively easy for the bodies, where there is a conflict, to produce that information without going into the difficult process of historical digging, which would take far longer and require more public funding. I rather question the wisdom of not having a systematic collection of monitoring information for future policy reviews if that is the case.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000048"></a>Apart from that relatively minor matter, I endorse the intentions of the Government and am glad that these provisions have been brought forward.</p>

<p><a name="11101722000049"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="11101722000075"></a>Lord Bach:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the order so clearly and other noble Lords who have asked questions of some importance, particularly the final question, which the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, majored on, which was around the Government's plans for reviewing the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000050"></a>I know that the Minister is giving what they nowadays describe as a keynote address this Thursday at the Westminster Legal Policy Forum on the very topical subject of:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11101722000055"></a>"The future of Freedom of Information-challenges for expansion".</p>

<p><a name="11101722000054"></a>I, alas, cannot be present because of duties in the House. If this sounds like an advertisement to go and hear the noble Lord, that is exactly what it is. However, I hope that he may be able to say something both this afternoon, in response to his noble friend Lord Maclennan, and on Thursday, because I know that he has particular duties in ministerial terms as far as this Act is concerned. I hope that he can perhaps unveil slightly today what he may say to his other audience on Thursday.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000051"></a>We support the order. The Freedom of Information Act was one of the substantial achievements of the previous Government. It will be long-standing and of substantial value to our freedoms. It does not always seem that way if you are sitting in a ministerial chair or even in a senior civil servant's chair. It can be awkward, difficult and seem sometimes almost impossible, but that is precisely why it is in existence. So we support both the Act and this minor order-minor not for the three bodies involved but in the great scheme of things. It was in March 2010, as paragraph 8.4  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC20"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the Explanatory Memorandum tells us, that the decision to bring these bodies within the Act under Section 5 was made and communicated to each body. We are delighted to see the order before the Committee today.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000052"></a>My only question to the Minister is one that I mentioned to him briefly earlier. We read in paragraph 8.4 that two of the bodies "welcomed publicly" the fact that an order such as this one was to be made, bringing them within the scope of the Act. It does not say anything about the response of the third body, UCAS. Can the Minister help the Committee with how UCAS responded?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="11101722000053"></a>As I said at the start of my few remarks, we support what the Government are doing on this occasion.</p>

<p><a name="11101724000001"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew24"></a><a name="11101724000026"></a>Lord Martin of Springburn:</b> My Lords, first, I apologise for being slightly late. I was listening to the debate on the Floor of the House and noticed that this subject had come up. I thought that I would come up and listen to the Minister.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000002"></a>I can well understand that we are talking about the chief police officers of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Of course, we have a devolved Parliament for Scotland, and there are several police forces in Scotland. Will the Minister consult the Scottish Parliament to see that freedom of information will be available in this respect for police authorities north of the border?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000003"></a>The Minister has said that he, on behalf of his party, welcomes freedom of information. It did not stop those who were in an executive position complaining about freedom of information after it was pushed through Parliament. Many officials and Cabinet Ministers sleepwalked through that particular incident. I make no complaint about the legislation; I simply ask the Minister a question. Many journalists use freedom of information so that they can get what is best described as an angle for their particular story. When they ask the question and there follows a period of, let us say, 27 days-although I may be contradicted on that-I have known it to be the case with matters of the House that they have complained bitterly that the freedom of information was given to them and to the general public. They have complained bitterly that it spoiled their story that everybody else should get the information. Freedom of information is about everybody getting that information. They are on record as complaining; they are using it as a device to get a scoop, or whatever they call it.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000004"></a>I feel strongly that once the information is issued to the applicant for that freedom of information, it should be put in the public domain immediately afterwards. In other words, if the information is given to the applicant at 2 o'clock on a given day, by one minute past two everyone should be able to get that information. I know that some people say that the identity of an applicant should not matter and that you should not know who they are. However, it is a bit rich if an application is made by someone sitting in garret in Toronto, asking for information, which takes a considerable amount of public funding. We should at least know whether a taxpayer of this country is making that application. Can the Minister mention that? It is not fair that someone who has nothing else  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC21"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC21</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to do with their time in another country can make an application and no one has to say where they come from. That is very important.</p>
<h5><a name="11101724000025"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000005"></a>I understand that in the Republic of Ireland, where an applicant seeks information from every local authority in that country and submits an identical question to each of them, the legislation of the Republic says, "Wait a minute. Let's hold it there. This means that an official is working on it in every local authority". Time is time. If an official is drawing this information together, it can cost a substantial amount. I hope that we look out for such situations when someone is seeking information just for the sake of gathering it and having officials in an authority running around.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000006"></a>In the same way, if a ministerial Question is submitted by a Member of this House or the other place and an identical Question is tabled by another noble Lord or elected Member, the Minister would say, "I refer to the reply I have given to the noble Lord on such and such a date". That means that there is no duplication. I hope that due concern is given to the fact that we should not have duplication.</p>

<p><a name="11101724000007"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="11101724000027"></a>Lord McNally:</b> My Lords, I am very grateful for all the contributions, which have been extremely helpful in putting this order in perspective.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000008"></a>Let me deal first with the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. If it was thought that a matter discussed by ACPO was should properly be protected for reasons of national security, the Act contains the capacity to claim exemptions for that information. That can, of course, be challenged through the Information Commissioner, The noble Lord is right to say that ACPO could sometimes discuss security matters but the Act makes provisions for the protection of national security in those circumstances.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, raised a specific case in relation to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. I cannot comment on individual cases. HMRC can protect commercial confidentiality in its dealings. I will be as interested as the noble Lord is to discover what the Public Accounts Committee finds out but it is a matter for that committee, rather than for us.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000010"></a>My noble friend Lord Maclennan, pointed out that the matter of those three bodies was first raised in 2007 and 2009. I am surprised not to see the noble Lord, Lord Wills, here, who turns up at these debates like Banquo's ghost to point out that he was about to do X or Y on freedom of information, or that the noble Lord, Lord Bach, was. I acknowledge that this is part of a process started under the previous Administration. Indeed, I consider the Freedom of Information Act to be one of their great successes. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, is quite right: the fact that Ministers and public officials are sometimes discomfited by the Act has always been proof positive that it was a good piece of legislation.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000011"></a>My noble friend Lord Maclennan, asked how ACPO can have free and open discussions before ACPO policy is decided. We understand that bodies need a space in which to work out their policy but, as I recall, that was the great argument about Cabinet discussions  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC22"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC22</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as well. There is always a tension between having the right to know what has gone on in an organisation and protecting free discussion before a collective decision is made. ACPO welcomed its inclusion, and I am quite sure that it will manage to work out how to operate under the Act.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000012"></a>I understand the concern of my noble friend Lord Maclennan that we seem to be engaging in a one-off exercise, but that is not true; we will continue to monitor the working of the Act. I am very pleased that we have moved more quickly than we needed to post-legislative scrutiny; that is entirely healthy. The document to which the noble Lord referred is being prepared by my department as part of the process of post-legislative scrutiny. It will be an assessment of the working of the Act, which will provide a basic working document to the Justice Committee to allow it to start its work of post-legislative scrutiny.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000013"></a>That process will go in parallel with the exercise being carried out by my right honourable friend Francis Maude on the right to data, in which we will also try to push the boundaries of the citizen's right to know about information. I understand where my noble friend is coming from in asking where all this fits. We are perhaps not moving in straight order on this, but we are getting the job done. By the end of this process many more organisations will be covered by freedom of information. We will have a lot more information proactively coming from government through the right to data process. As a result, we will have much more open government, with all the benefits that come from it.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000014"></a>I turn to points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Martin, a number of which I thoroughly agree with. There have been journalists who have turned freedom of information into a kind of cottage industry. I again hope that the transparency agenda will make this less necessary, and that people will get the information that they want. I take his point about immediate publication. In pushing forward the agenda we press organisations to publish immediately or as soon as possible. In certain circumstances there may be a reason to consult and delay, but in the main I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Martin, said. This is not information for an individual journalist; this is public information, and should be made public as quickly as possible.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000015"></a>I was interested in his points about the Republic of Ireland. I was on the pre-legislative committee that looked at freedom of information. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, is nodding; he will recall that one of the most enthusiastic pieces of evidence we received about freedom of information was from the Irish freedom of information director.</p>

<p><a name="11101724000016"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew26"></a><a name="11101724000028"></a>Lord Bach:</b> It was the Minister, I think.</p>

The interesting thing about that was that the Irish have had post-legislative scrutiny of their own legislation and have brought in a number of restrictions, such as the one that the noble Lord, Lord Martin, referred to. They have brought in charges for some aspects of freedom of information.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000018"></a>The critics of freedom of information say that it puts unfair burdens and great costs on departments, as referred to before by the noble Lord, Lord Martin. I hope that the Justice Committee will take a good look at how the Act is working, take evidence from its critics and supporters, and then take us forward as we have indicated.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000019"></a>On the question that the noble Lord, Lord Martin, raised about ACPO Scotland, freedom of information is a devolved matter, and the inclusion of ACPO Scotland is a matter for the Scottish Government. I hope I have covered the issues raised-</p>

<p><a name="11101724000020"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew28"></a><a name="11101724000030"></a>Lord Bach:</b> What about UCAS?</p>

<p><a name="11101724000021"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew29"></a><a name="11101724000031"></a>Lord McNally:</b> I do apologise. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, raised that and I found the answer, which is twofold. Of the three, it was UCAS which raised some concerns when discussions began. Its concerns were the costs it would face in complying with the FOI Act, how it would protect sensitive information, and other costs outlined in the impact assessment. During consultation it was satisfied that the FOI Act exemptions could protect this information, and since those consultations it has been happy to see itself included within the ambit of the Act. I apologise that I got carried away with the questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Martin. Does he have another?</p>

<p><a name="11101724000022"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew30"></a><a name="11101724000032"></a>Lord Martin of Springburn:</b> If the Minister is getting carried away, I will perhaps push my luck. I noted that the Minister stated in his reply that he would encourage these organisations to put the information out to the applicant and the general public almost simultaneously. Encourage is not quite the word I was looking for. There should be a commitment to do this. For example, if an applicant asked a police authority for a piece of information then it could, by all means, give that information out at 2 pm on a specific day, but by 2.01 pm the rest of the world should know about it.</p>

<p><a name="11101724000023"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew31"></a><a name="11101724000033"></a>Lord McNally:</b> So far as I understand at the moment, what we can do is urge best practice by the wide range of bodies that deal with a very wide range of requests. I recently went to Northampton to congratulate the local authority on setting standards for devolving freedom of information which we thought were best practice. It is very difficult to have a single diktat for such a wide range of bodies, but the Justice Committee, when it does its post-legislative scrutiny, can perhaps look at this, and consider whether the Act should be given more teeth to have a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="11101724000024"></a>There would be counterarguments that small bodies have more difficulty in managing freedom of information. However, the point that the noble Lord, Lord Martin, is pressing is very valid. Except in matters of national security, or if there are specific matters that argue against immediate publication, freedom of information is not in the ownership of the requester but in the ownership of the public at large. Freedom of information is the right to know of the public at large. I also take the point-if it is not already doing so I urge the Justice Committee to look at this-that it seems a bit rum for someone to be in favour of freedom of

I would be very interested to see what is considered best practice here. I would have thought there was considerable argument to say that if somebody asks for freedom of information they should not be worried that somebody else knows they have asked for it. That is another matter which will be given thorough consideration. In the mean time, I commend this order.</p>

The European Union-which represents the world's largest provider of official development assistance, the largest single market and the main trading partner for most developing countries-can potentially make a huge contribution.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000002"></a>The Cotonou agreement is the guiding framework for the EU's engagement with some 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific-ACP-states. Signed in 2000, it has evolved to reflect the changing relationships between the EU and ACP countries, while retaining its overall objective of poverty eradication, sustainable development and the integration of ACP states into the world economy. Cotonou provides the framework for programming the European Development Fund and channelling money to some of the poorest countries in the world-importantly including countries where UK bilateral programmes are not present and where DfID does not have a presence on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000003"></a>The Government's review of multilateral aid judged the EDF to be among the most effective, flexible and poverty-focused of all our multilateral aid instruments. It is closely aligned to UK priorities and provides significant assistance to Commonwealth countries and several of the UK's overseas territories.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000004"></a>Negotiations on the second revision to the Cotonou agreement were completed in June 2010 in Burkina Faso. All parties have signed the agreement and the changes are being implemented under transitional arrangements until ratification procedures are complete. The revisions aim to improve the implementation of the agreement and to ensure that it reflects changes in the international environment. The revisions fall into three categories-political, trade and development-and I shall highlight several of the important changes.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000005"></a>On political relations, the revised text provides for greater coherence between regional initiatives, such as the Africa-EU strategy and Cotonou. The role of ACP Parliaments and non-state actors has gained enhanced recognition and the African Union is confirmed as a key interlocutor in peace and stability matters. The importance of tackling changing security threats, ranging from piracy to exogenous shocks, is stressed. The provisions concerning political dialogue have been updated with new language on non-discrimination and the inclusion of regional and continental integration, and global and sectoral policies impacting development objectives among the issues that can be discussed. Improved exchange of information between the ACP secretariat and the EU in Article 96 processes, concerned with remedying breaches of Cotonou's essential elements, are now envisaged.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000006"></a>There are important new references to key global challenges such as climate change, HIV/AIDS, and recognition of the 2008 food crisis through stronger provisions on food security and agriculture. The key role played by fisheries and aquaculture in ACP countries is included, reflecting a desire to enhance coherence between fisheries policies and development.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000007"></a>Cotonou's trade provisions have been updated to reflect the introduction of economic partnership agreements supporting deeper trade relations between the ACP and the EU, and bringing these into line with the rules of the World Trade Organisation. Language on regional co-operation and integration has been strengthened in recognition of the increased regional differentiation among ACP states.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000008"></a>Changes aimed at improving the programming and implementation of EDF assistance have been included with, for example, the creation of a role for ACP national Parliaments and the introduction of increased flexibility in responding to unforeseen needs and crises.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000009"></a>Her Majesty's Government fully support all these changes. We firmly believe that they will help to enhance and strengthen the long-standing partnership between the EU and ACP states. I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000010"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew34"></a><a name="11101732000185"></a>Lord Chidgey:</b> My Lords, there is no doubt that the Cotonou agreement is a valuable instrument, aimed at preserving the relevance and character of the partnership between the ACP and EU states. As the Minister has mentioned, the order adapts the agreement to reflect the major changes in international and ACP-EU relationships by further clarifying the political dimension and creating space for a more productive political dialogue and clearer, more effective action. Here, I refer particularly to Article 8.7. The revision seeks to strengthen economic co-operation, regional integration and trade. Particularly important is the move towards extending humanitarian and emergency assistance, and providing new thinking on aid programming and management. This assistance and support is vitally important to many ACP states.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000011"></a>Equally important are the provisions that point to the interdependence between development, poverty reduction and peace and security. We should acknowledge that, increasingly, security threats-both man-made   


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC26"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and from natural disasters-must be addressed in a co-ordinated manner, engaging not only the European Union but other regional organisations, including the African Union. With the AU acknowledged, as it is in the order, as a key interlocutor in matters related to peace and security, we can expect increased consistency and convergence of the Cotonou agreement with the strategic Africa-EU partnership. We should look forward to that.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000012"></a>The need for regional co-operation and integration has been recognised in amendments set out in the revised agreement to Articles 11, 23, 23a, 28, 29 and 30. Regional co-operation and integration are key to combating the threats of climate change and food security, and to promoting advancement and sustainability in agriculture and fisheries. I am glad to see that the Government welcome that.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000013"></a>The ACP states face major challenges if they are to meet the millennium development goals, and deal with food security, HIV/AIDS and sustainable agriculture and fisheries. The importance of each of these areas for effective development, growth and poverty reduction is underlined in these amendments, together with the joint approaches over which to co-operate.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000014"></a>The proposed revisions also recognise the impact of the fragility of and lack of security in some states, and the negative effect of that on development. A comprehensive approach, which combines diplomacy, security and development co-operation, encompassing political, developmental, human rights and security dimensions, is enshrined in this second revision of the Cotonou agreement, which can only be welcomed. Therefore, we welcome the revision and the attention that it gives to political dialogue in Article 8 and to climate change, human rights, gender, migration, discrimination and the resolution of violent conflicts. We particularly welcome the emphasis on good governance.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000015"></a>However, the order raises several comments and questions that I should like to put to the Minister. Article 8 refers to dialogue on issues such as "discrimination of any kind". I understand that this formula was intended to embrace sexual orientation. How will this be pursued? Article 8 rightly emphasises the need for civil society organisations and national Parliaments to be associated with the dialogue. What efforts are being made to bolster the capacity of civil society organisations so that they can make a significant contribution?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000016"></a>The new Article 32a recognises climate change as a serious global and environmental challenge. How will co-operation in that area be taken forward? Are any further initiatives planned?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000017"></a>Article 33 recognises the importance of domestic revenue management and international tax co-operation. Maximising domestic revenue plays an important role in ensuring financial stability and reducing dependence on aid. What steps is DfID taking to support these efforts?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000018"></a>Article 34 refers to the need for ACP countries to participate actively in international trade negotiations. How can we best encourage the ACP countries to push for a successful conclusion to the Doha round?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000019"></a>Finally, Article 36 includes reference to the economic partnership agreements being negotiated between the EU and ACP countries. How will the Government assess their progress and the possible benefits?</p>
<h5><a name="11101732000168"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="11101732000020"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew35"></a><a name="11101732000186"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> My Lords, I should like to raise a couple of issues that have arisen from this. First, fishing has been mentioned a couple of times. One of the worst things to be inflicted on the developing world, particularly littoral states, has been the taking out of their fish stocks through EU agreements. Although this has improved over the years, given the complete lack of coastal protection for these nations and the voracious appetite of certain European fleets for those stocks, I wonder whether the Government will make sure through this agreement that the attempt to improve the situation continues.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000021"></a>Secondly, on aid, I am sure that the Minister will be well aware that there is a major aid effectiveness conference taking place in Busan, in Korea, next month. Are the Government encouraging parliamentarians to be present at the conference? There is a lot to be learnt not only by governments but by parliamentarians. Does she have any expectation for outcomes from that conference?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000022"></a>Lastly, it always seemed to me that the Cotonou agreement and its predecessors were made on a very imperialist-based system in terms of how the EU looks at the rest of the world. There is a division between those nation states who were the French and British empires and those who are not. I would like to think that at some point we can end that discrimination and look at the rest of the world in terms of its needs rather than in its imperial past. Do the Government share that view?</p>

<p><a name="11101732000023"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew36"></a><a name="11101732000187"></a>Lord Triesman:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the order. I should say at the outset that we support it. The changes and the coherence to be added are welcome; trade arrangements will improve; all of that is positive territory.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000024"></a>The Cotonou agreement as a whole has proved, as it was always intended to, an essential framework, fostering development, co-operation, economic and trade integration and security of political institutions in the ACP countries. It makes complete sense for the EU to have embarked on this course, not only because of our long-term economic and political interests in the ACP countries but also because it reflects the colonial past, the legacy of that past and the obligations that we plainly face in dealing with it.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000025"></a>It is encouraging that when the predecessors of the EU in the European Coal and Steel Community forged those institutions in 1951, many of them were still colonial powers in the very countries in which these arrangements are now in place as a result of the Cotonou agreement. That is positive in many ways.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000026"></a>The continued mutual obligations plainly mean that we continue to have a shared EU-ACP interest in co-operation. In many respects, this has matured from   


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC28"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>simple co-operation into interdependency. Those interdependencies are created for pragmatic, economic and moral considerations. It is encouraging to be able to talk about the work of the EU in such a positive way; we do not always seem to do that in our House; so I am a little encouraged to have had the opportunity to look at that without people snarling about it.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000027"></a>The renewal of Cotonou comes at a critical juncture. Last year, the World Bank estimated that 64 million people had been pushed into extreme poverty by the financial crisis. Of course, most of those were in countries in the developing world. Noble Lords have already mentioned the impact of climate change and famine, which have had an amplified effect because of the financial challenges in the international community, especially in those countries where we are still slipping backwards on the millennium development goals. Those tasks demand a multifaceted response, and that is what the Cotonou agreement and the changes and revisions now help us to produce.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000028"></a>There is a good deal of independent research in Australian universities and universities across Europe that demonstrates that it is the interpenetration of democracy and institution-building with economic progress which gives economic progress the greatest prospect of success. Much of that research also shows that in those countries where you do not have those institutional and democratic opportunities, economic development is tried to the greatest extent.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000029"></a>It is not a perfect agreement. The point has already been made that, even with the new language on non-discriminatory practices, one area has still not been resolved in any way that I think we would regard as satisfactory in Europe. The democratic, economic and civil rights that have been extended in so many ways seem still to exclude those who are in same-sex relationships. That is a great pity. I know that people in the EU have attempted to see these issues raised in the European Parliament and elsewhere but have not perhaps made the progress with the countries on the other side of the agreement that they would have wished for. I just hope that we will not say, "Well, we are where we are", but take every opportunity that we have in all the revisions that still lie ahead over the 20 years that the agreement will be in place to see whether greater progress can be made.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000030"></a>The Cotonou agreement has carried forward the EU's 1992 human rights and democratisation policy. We supported it at that time; we have supported it on all occasions since, from its inauguration through its revisions; and we support it today.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000031"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew37"></a><a name="11101732000188"></a>Baroness Northover:</b> My Lords, I thank noble Lords for the all points that have been raised and for the general welcome for this move forward. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, is quite right that the agreement came about as a result of countries moving into the EU wanting to make sure that what had been part of their former empire was not disadvantaged. So it is a historic agreement looking after those countries and does not necessarily make best sense as we move forward. Looking at the current revisions to the Cotonou agreement, one is struck by the fact that it is moving towards looking at the regional dimension that may be more relevant for some ACP countries in the future. In  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC29"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the mean time, it is extremely important that those countries have access to the EU markets, which has benefited them enormously.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000032"></a>A number of points have been raised in the debate, and I welcome the Committee's continued interest in the EU's relationship with ACP countries and the Cotonou agreement. Europe is playing a major role in supporting developing countries, particularly in Africa, to meet the many challenges that they face. The second amendment to the Cotonou agreement is an important development in this regard.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000033"></a>Europe is not only a significant provider of development assistance but also an important global actor. The impact on poor countries of its policies in areas such as trade and the environment can be significant. We will continue to work with the Commission and other EU member states to call for further improvements in the effectiveness, results focus and transparency of EU aid, including the EDF.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, is absolutely right that regional co-operation will be extremely important. It is excellent to see the emphasis being put on the African Union and its further development. He noted the fragility of some of these states; others are less fragile. Therefore, we agree that the emphasis on good governance is extremely important.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000035"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Chidgey and Lord Triesman, asked about discrimination. As we know, discrimination over sexual preferences remains a serious problem in many African states-there have been various pointers towards that recently. In effect, noble Lords are asking why we do not insist on the inclusion of a clause on non-discrimination. Article 8 clearly gives the EU a mandate to raise issues of discrimination of any kind in ACP countries, and the ability to have a dialogue to make progress on all issues of discrimination. It is a very important factor. The Cotonou revision gives the EU that mandate, but we realise that that is not, perhaps, as far as some might wish to go. However, this is a collective agreement, and at least it has that mandate in it. I expect we will find that that is taken further forward in the future.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000036"></a>My noble friend Lord Chidgey mentioned climate change, and its significance. We welcome the stronger statement on the global challenge of climate change in the agreement. The references give the EDF a clearer mandate to spend on these priorities. It is clearly recognised now that the mitigation of climate change-ensuring that we are not making things even worse, because it hits the poorest hardest and first-is extremely important to factor in when we look at development policy. The agreement acknowledges that that has to be integrated with development strategies.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000037"></a>My noble friend Lord Chidgey also emphasised the importance of civil society organisations, as well as governance. The EU certainly attaches great importance to the role of civil society organisations, and provides significant support to help them engage effectively on issues such as governance, democracy and human rights, across the ACP.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000038"></a>Looking at taxation, the importance of domestic revenue management is rightly something people are very concerned about. Many DfID country offices work with partner governments to strengthen tax policy  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC30"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and tax administration. That is certainly seen as important. For example, TradeMark East Africa, funded by DfID, has helped the newly established Burundi Revenue Authority to increase the country's tax income by 30 per cent-which I am sure would be welcome in this country-from the first quarter of 2010 to the same period in 2011.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000039"></a>Then there is the question about Busan and whether parliamentarians will be present at the conference on aid effectiveness. I know that my noble friend Lord Chidgey is attending.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000040"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew38"></a><a name="11101732000189"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> My noble friend Lord Chidgey is actually going to Busan as a parliamentarian, and I was delighted to hear that.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000041"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew39"></a><a name="11101732000190"></a>Baroness Northover:</b> I know that he is going, and am extremely pleased. There will be other parliamentarians present, and I understand that the Secretary of State for International Development will be there.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000042"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew40"></a><a name="11101732000191"></a>Lord Chidgey:</b> Could the Minister clarify an issue regarding Busan? I am delighted that noble Lords are all pleased that I am going to the farthest part of the world.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000043"></a>One of the problems we have faced in attempts to improve aid effectiveness by better scrutiny and better involvement and engagement of parliamentarians in the process of holding their Executives to account, is that while the parliamentarians from the recipient countries are getting quite a lot of help from the OECD, to get as many of them as possible to  attend Busan, there is very little support for parliamentarians from the donor countries. I suggest to the Minister-and she may agree-that scrutiny and aid effectiveness is a two-way thing. Not just the recipients but also the donor countries should have a say in how well taxpayers' money is being used to provide aid to developing countries.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000044"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew41"></a><a name="11101732000192"></a>Baroness Northover:</b> My noble friend Lord Chidgey knows that very well from his experience serving on various boards of AWEPA, which tries to link European parliamentarians with those in Africa. From my own experience it does a very good job. I am glad that my noble friend is going, though not because he will therefore be unable to put questions to me.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000045"></a>I hope that I have covered most issues. I believe my noble friend Lord Teverson wanted some answers on fisheries. Article 23 and new Article 23a recognise the importance of fisheries and agriculture, as I mentioned in my introduction to ACP countries. Depletion of stock is clearly a key issue, and we are hoping that some of these issues will be addressed, presumably at the Busan meeting on aid effectiveness. No, I am told that that is not right. I am afraid that I cannot quite make out what it is that came from the sky, but I should like to write, if necessary, to the noble Lord to clarify where Cotonou stands on this.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000046"></a>I hope that I have covered most issues that noble Lords have raised-and if I have not I will write to them. I conclude by assuring noble Lords that the Government believe that Europe has a significant role

Perhaps I may provide a brief explanation of what the order seeks to achieve.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000048"></a>The order is made under Section 104 of the Scotland Act 1998-with which Members of the Grand Committee have become familiar-and allows for necessary or expedient changes to UK legislation in consequence of an Act of the Scottish Parliament. This order is made in consequence of the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010-which I shall refer to as the 2010 Act-and secondary legislation made under it.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000049"></a>The Merits Committee of your Lordships' House reviewed this order and has not noted it as being of special interest. The 2010 Act made provision for the reduction and simplification of public bodies in Scotland. The overarching purpose of the Act was to simplify and streamline the public bodies landscape in Scotland with the aim of delivering improved public services and better outcomes for the people of Scotland.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000050"></a>The 2010 Act dissolved the Deer Commission for Scotland and transferred its functions to Scottish Natural Heritage. It also dissolved the Scottish Arts Council, transferring its functions, and those of Scottish Screen, to a new public body called Creative Scotland. The Act dissolved the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care. Its functions in care service scrutiny, the functions of the Social Work Inspection Agency, and the child protection functions of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education in Scotland were transferred to a new public body called Social Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para125"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000051"></a>The functions of the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care concerning independent health care scrutiny and NHS scrutiny functions that were previously exercised by the special health board, Quality Improvement Scotland, were transferred to a new public body called Healthcare Improvement Scotland.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000052"></a>The 2010 Act also made provision to dissolve the water customer consultation panels and abolish the position of convener of those panels. This order will ensure that United Kingdom legislation is updated to reflect the changes made in the 2010 Act. It will ensure that United Kingdom legislation can continue to operate when it interacts with the new devolved legislation and makes provision, as necessary, in relative enactments for the newly established bodies and procedures. For example, the order ensures that the Health and Social Care Act 2008 is updated to ensure that obligations on care home providers to comply with certain provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998 continue to apply where the care home is in Scotland. The order also ensures that the Representation of the People (Scotland) Regulations 2001 are updated so that a care home manager who is providing care to a resident in respect of that resident's disability can continue to attest to and sign that resident's application to vote by proxy.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000053"></a>The modifications made to existing legislation by the order are of a technical nature. However, by the very fact that they are United Kingdom pieces of legislation, it is not within the competence of the Scottish Parliament to amend them. The modifications are required to ensure that existing legislation continues to operate effectively, by recognising the modifications that have been made to various pieces of legislation by the 2010 Act and subordinate legislation made under it. The order demonstrates this Government's commitment to working with the Scottish Government to make the devolution settlement work. I hope the Grand Committee will agree that this order is a sensible use of the  powers in the Scotland Act and that the practical result is to be welcomed. I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

The only question I wish to ask is whether in the case of orders of this kind, which are not designed to amend the legislation, save-as my noble friend, the Minister, has said-to reflect, in a technical sense, the consequences of legislation by the Scottish Parliament, it might make sense, for reasons of expedition, to amend the Scotland Act to enable the measures to be incorporated in negative resolutions rather than affirmative resolutions. The Minister clearly explained that there is no issue of policy at stake here other than the maintenance of the status quo. As the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has not raised any matter about drafting or anything else, there is every reason to believe that this is an acceptable instrument. We now frequently see consequential legislation brought forward for extensive debates and this does not seem to be strictly necessary, bearing in mind the pressures on the United Kingdom Parliament.</p>

This will save some time. I will start by disagreeing totally with the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, about helping Governments to be expeditious in getting legislation through. There is always somebody paranoid, suspicious and hostile to government-probably me-and I like to see things

I also thank the office staff of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, for offering assistance and guidance, as usual. This is extremely helpful for those such as me who are still adjusting to this place. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, also says that the measure is uncontroversial. I  take the view that very little is uncontroversial in Scottish politics at the moment that cannot be made controversial by the behaviour of the First Minister, Alex Salmond.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000056"></a>On the extension of the Scottish Executive over those bodies included in the order, I wonder whether they will be exhorted by the leader of the Civil Service in Scotland to go to watch "Braveheart" so that the Scottish public can see how Scotland lived under English occupation 700 or 800 years ago. That is the sort of nonsense we are getting in Scotland at the moment, so I do not accept that there is anything uncontroversial in Scotland. Everything will be seized on as we lead up at some point to a Scottish independence referendum.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000057"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew45"></a><a name="11101732000197"></a>Lord Maclennan of Rogart:</b> For the avoidance of doubt, I would not say that there was nothing uncontroversial in the Scottish legislation of 2010. What I see as uncontroversial is the response of the United Kingdom Government, which is that this is a devolved matter and not a matter over which we have control. Nothing that has been done has, as I see it, required the United Kingdom Government to do more than preserve those things that have not been affected by the Scottish legislation.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000058"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew46"></a><a name="11101732000198"></a>Lord McAvoy:</b> My response to that would be: not yet, because you never know what will happen. I am not called Thomas for nothing. What raises my suspicion is reading the words Representation of the People Act-although I know that this order is about care homes and such things.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000059"></a>The serious question I have for the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, in agreeing to these bodies understandably and logically coming under the remit of the Scottish Executive, is: are any of them in any way involved with elections or referendums? I know that this might seem wild, but you never know. In the order is a whole host of regulations, so I want to clarify just to make sure. Are any of them involved in the staffing of stations, administration or anything to do with the practical running of referendums? I should like to know to be sure that that is not the case.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000060"></a>In addition, the memorandum states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11101732000162"></a>"Part 1 makes provision for the purpose of simplifying public bodies",</p>

<p><a name="11101732000155"></a>but ends up by stating,</p>
<ul><a name="11101732000165"></a>"and provision in relation to the regulation of officers of court".</ul>
<p><a name="11101732000156"></a>Again, would any of those officers of the court be involved in ruling on disputes about referendums or voting in any way?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000061"></a>I have no intention of repeating the explanation of the order by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, which was absolutely fine. I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart,  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC34"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for getting involved. Those are my only serious questions. I know that folk may dismiss them as scaremongering or fantasising, but in Scotland at the moment we need to keep a very firm check on everything that comes through.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000062"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spmin6"></a><a name="11101732000199"></a>The Duke of Montrose:</b> My Lords, can my noble friend clarify a couple of points? I listened to him but did not catch the fact that a couple of Welsh measures have wondered into the Bill. It is very interesting to see them in there. Can he reassure us that the Welsh paragraphs are an exact translation of the previous ones, because my Welsh is not up to understanding them? How many times has this Parliament passed measures in Welsh?</p>

<p><a name="11101732000063"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew47"></a><a name="11101732000200"></a>Lord Wallace of Tankerness:</b> My Lords, I thank my noble friends Lord Maclennan of Rogart and the Duke of Montrose, and the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, for their contributions to this debate. Although technical, the points they raised are important. Perhaps I may say to my noble friend Lord Maclennan that a similar thought crossed my mind as to the necessity for this. The truth of the matter is that it is specified by the Scotland Act that some orders under it can be approved by way of negative procedure, but when dealing with amendments to primary legislation, Parliament in its wisdom in 1998 thought that that should be done by affirmative order. Indeed, it would be invidious to decide which ones were or were not controversial. On the previous order we considered there was agreement on all sides that it nevertheless related to changing the powers of officers of the UK Border Agency and HMRC with regard to periods of detention, which is a substantive matter. It might be invidious to try to make judgments as to which orders are controversial and which are not when they all come under the same Section 104.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000064"></a>On the points made by the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, it is perfectly proper that he should be aware and alert-as he said, he was not called Thomas for nothing. I can assure him that as far as I am aware, and as far as we could trace, no body involved in this order would be involved in elections or referendums. One could perhaps use one's imagination as to how Creative Scotland could be creative. However, strictly speaking, no body would have responsibility for the running of a referendum or election-subject to the example I gave in respect of care home managers. However, the important point is that the order updates the situation that already existed. The noble Lord's other point was about court officers. I am advised that under the  order, none of them would have a role to play in election work.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para133"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000065"></a>My noble friend the Duke of Montrose raised a question about Welsh measures. I am assured that it is an exact translation-although I have to say that I have to take it on assurance because I do not speak Welsh. It is probably a Measure of the Welsh National Assembly that is referred to here. Regarding some of the reciprocal arrangements between Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland, what has been done in Scotland has implications in Wales. If the Welsh legislation is in Welsh, the amendment to it has to be in Welsh

That is the explanation. As I said, I take that on trust because, regrettably, although I speak in this House for the Wales Office, I do not have Welsh.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para134"></a>

<p><a name="11101732000067"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spmin7"></a><a name="11101732000202"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Taylor of Holbeach):</b> My Lords, Sections 38 and 39 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 allow the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards to carry out works to manage flooding; coastal erosion or water levels for the benefit of nature conservation, including the conservation of the landscape); and the preservation of cultural heritage or peoples' enjoyment of the environment or cultural heritage.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000068"></a>These powers were required because the definition of flood and coastal erosion risk management in Part 1 of the Act empowers authorities only to undertake measures to reduce the harmful effects of flooding or erosion; whereas some of the work that is required for environmental and recreational purposes involves the management of flooding, water levels and erosion to gain the beneficial effects of those processes.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para136"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000069"></a>Sections 38(8) and 39(12), commenced on 18 January this year, require the Minister to make an order applying the provisions of compensation, powers of entry and compulsory purchase in the Water Resources Act 1991 to Sections 38 and 39 of the Flood and Water Management Act, with or without modifications.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para137"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000070"></a>The purpose of the order is twofold: first, to protect the rights of occupiers and property owners who could be affected; and, secondly, to ensure that authorities have the necessary ancillary provisions. The order works by applying relevant provisions in the Water Resources Act 1991 with appropriate textual modifications to Sections 38 and 39 of the Flood and Water Management Act. However, it is important to understand that the provisions of the Water Resources Act are not amended by this order. I will now outline how each of the provisions will work and why they are necessary.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para138"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000071"></a>First, the order applies the compensation provisions in the Water Resources Act so that if any loss is suffered as a result of the use of powers under Sections 38 or 39, the relevant authority would be liable fully to compensate the injured party. This is necessary to protect the interests of landowners and occupiers.  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC36"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Before any work was undertaken, all necessary permissions and consents, such as planning permission, would need to be secured. Compensation would then be paid for any loss caused in the course of carrying out the work. Sums would be calculated on a case-by-case basis. If the person affected was not satisfied with the compensation offered, they could appeal to the Upper Tribunal.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para139"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000072"></a>Secondly, powers of entry are necessary to provide safeguards for landowners and occupier as well as for the authority, when an operator needs to undertake work on a third party's land. The local authority or Environment Agency would write to the landowner or occupier notifying him of its intention to enter land. The notification would explain the nature and timing of the works and the entitlement to compensation in the event that any loss is suffered. The order requires a minimum notice period of seven days before entering agricultural land. This is a modification of how provisions in the Water Resources Act apply to the Sections 38 and 39 of the Flood and Water Management Act. It makes the minimum notice period for agricultural land the same as that required for residential  premises.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para140"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000073"></a>Compulsory purchase powers are needed so that an authority can, when necessary, obtain proprietary interests in land when in order to protect its investment and ensure that works can be maintained. Powers of compulsory purchase can be exercised only with the express authority of the Minister. In all cases, the authority or agency would try to purchase by agreement before seeking ministerial authority to exercise its powers. The Environment Agency's powers of compulsory purchase are limited in this order to purchases necessary for the purpose of enabling the United Kingdom to comply with its obligations under specified European directives-the water framework directive, the habitats directive or the wild birds directive.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para141"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000074"></a>Landowners and occupiers have rights under the Acquisition of Land Act 1981 to oppose the compulsory purchase. This includes provision for a public local inquiry, which may decide whether or not to allow the purchase or modify any particulars. If a landowner is still not satisfied, he may challenge the decision in the High Court.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para142"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000075"></a>I commend the draft regulations to the Grand Committee.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000076"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew49"></a><a name="11101732000203"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> My Lords, I congratulate the Minister on his appointment. I know that that has been done on the Floor of the House by the various Benches, but I wanted to add my personal congratulations. It was an excellent appointment. I am sure that the good work that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, has done will continue.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para143"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000077"></a>The Explanatory Memorandum refers to the Pitt review. Given that this is a short session, it would be useful to hear just of couple of headlines on how the Government view the Pitt review and whether they foresee any primary legislation coming forward in that area in due course.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para144"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000078"></a>The order makes a lot of sense, because it is clear that certain flooding is good for the environment. If flooding was prevented, there would be environmental

Given that Sections 38 and 39 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 can be implemented only in relation to the powers of compensation, access and compulsory purchase, is the Minister satisfied that the right balance has been struck between there being a heavy responsibility on the authorities to undertake this work and the power of the landowner?</p>

<p><a name="11101732000079"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew50"></a><a name="11101732000204"></a>Lord Knight of Weymouth:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, for the clarity with which he set out the order. That was most helpful given that it is very difficult to get any clarity from reading it. That is why we have an Explanatory Memorandum-I thank the Minister's officials for the clarity with which that has been set out. I also congratulate the Government on listening to the concerns expressed by the National Farmers Union and the Country Landowners Association in bringing forward the order, which I certainly support.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para145"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000080"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, I was interested in paragraph 7.6, on consolidation, in the Explanatory Memorandum. I would be interested in any news on when that consolidation of the Act might happen in response to the Pitt review.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para146"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000081"></a>I tried to work out the taxpayer liability from the impact assessment. I understand that a notional 100 hectares is being discussed in the Explanatory Memorandum because it is difficult to predict how much land will be affected by erosion. Am I right in calculating that 100 hectares-the equivalent of one square kilometre-would generate a cost of £2,000 per annum, or have I misread the way the sums work? With that question, I am very happy for the order to go forward.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000082"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew51"></a><a name="11101732000205"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> I thank noble Lords for their comments. I thank in particular the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, for his pleasant greetings. He asked how the legislation related to the Pitt review. He and I were both around when the Act on which the statutory instrument is based went through this House. He will know that it was a foreshortened Bill; the water provisions were relatively limited within it. The Government, however, have made it quite clear that there will be a water White Paper shortly-it is likely to be published within the next six months. We will bring forward a Bill, probably within this Parliament, to legislate in the whole area of water and water management. It is important not just for issues raised by Pitt but also for the consumer interest in water.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para147"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000083"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Knight, asked me about the cost of the provision. I can assure him that his estimate of £2,500 per annum is about right. He also asked whether the whole business of consolidation might be considered. The Government are still committed to this, but he will know how difficult it is to get legislative time. However, this is something the Government will seek to do, if at all possible, within this Parliament.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para148"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000084"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked me if the balance was about right. He would expect me to say, and I do, that I think the balance is about right. This is a question of a balance of differing interests, and the statutory instrument has got it about right. It does contains the necessary provisions to protect the interests

<p><a name="11101732000087"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change (Lord Marland):</b> My Lords, the regulations under consideration implement the EU third energy package in Britain. This is a significant tranche of EU legislation, consisting of two directives on gas and electricity and three regulations. This legislation makes progress in enhancing consumer protection, promoting competitive energy markets, and increasing security of supply. It is a welcome step for the EU and the UK, where we will see many benefits for consumers and businesses alike. The regulations introduce new consumer protection measures to ensure that British consumers get the most out of a competitive market. Furthermore, the regulations focus on breaking down barriers to entry and enhancing competition in our energy markets. Northern Ireland has introduced its own regulations, and will be consulting on further implementation measures to complete UK transposition.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para152"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000088"></a>In July of last year the Government issued a consultation on proposals to implement the third package's requirements. This was followed, in the autumn, by two more detailed consultations on areas of particular interest to industry: the amended licence modification process and the need for owners to license exempt networks to provide third-party access. In our approach to implementation we have tried to take on industry concerns and minimise uncertainty as far as possible. However, it has been important to try to strike the right balance between the interests of consumers and industry, while ensuring that we fully implement the requirements of the third package.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para153"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000089"></a>The implementing regulations before us today cover four main areas: consumer protection measures; measures which encourage competition by imposing minimum separation and independence requirements when companies or their associates have control of key infrastructure and carry out certain energy activities, such as supply; the extension of third-party access  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC39"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>requirements to licence-exempt undertakings; and changes to the duties and powers of the regulatory authority, including a new licence modification procedure.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para154"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000090"></a>I shall give a brief summary of some of the key measures included under each of these headings. Consumer protection is covered in part 2 of the regulations and in the changes to supply licences made by Schedules 7 and 8, introduced by part 10. Primary changes include a requirement for customers to be switched within three weeks of expressing a wish to do so, from the end of any cooling-off period. Suppliers will also have a new obligation to improve the switching process. In addition, there are new requirements for energy suppliers to provide customers with more information, to ensure that customers are aware of their rights and enable them to make informed decisions. A consumer checklist of information is to be provided and will be produced by Consumer Focus to this end.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para155"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000091"></a>Changes are being made to ensure that certain activities are carried out independently of other energy activities; such separation is referred to as unbundling. This will increase security of supply by promoting fair access to infrastructure, with resulting benefits to competition. Furthermore, these measures promote unbiased investment decisions by large players in the market, and create a fairer playing field for smaller companies and new entrants.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para156"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000092"></a>Part 3 of the regulations requires the ownership of transmission systems and interconnectors to be completely separated from interests in those of supply and production, unless an exemption is held or the operator satisfies the requirements of one of the alternative models being made available. It will be for Ofgem to decide whether companies qualify for these alternatives when individual applications are made. The alternative models to ownership unbundling have been made available to provide British businesses with as much flexibility as possible.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para157"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000093"></a>Part 4 of the regulations prevents owners of gas storage facilities producing or supplying gas, and requires facilities to be operated independently of such interests, unless the storage facility is not considered to be technically or economically necessary for the operation of an efficient gas market. Part 5 prevents distribution system operators producing gas or generating electricity, though an exception is being made for businesses with less than 100,000 customers. This is to avoid conflicts of interest in investment decisions and promote transparency.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para158"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000094"></a>Another significant change introduced by the regulations is the requirement for licence-exempt owners of distribution networks to grant unrelated-that is, third-party suppliers-access to their systems, as established in part 6 of the regulations. This will benefit consumers connected to these networks, who as a result of this change will be able to choose their energy supplier and receive the advantages of competition.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para159"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000095"></a>Some industry parties have expressed concerns regarding the burdens that this will place on small businesses. As a result, we have tried to impose the lowest burden possible on these networks within the EU requirements, and will produce guidance to provide as much clarity as possible for affected businesses.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para160"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000096"></a>Of the changes relating to Ofgem, which part 7 of the regulations designates as the regulatory authority for Great Britain, the most noteworthy is the alteration to the licence modification procedure, as set out in part 9 of the regulations. Under the third package, the regulatory authority must be able to take autonomous decisions and implement binding decisions by the European Commission and the Agency for the Co-operation of European Regulators. In parallel, parties affected by those decisions must have access to suitable mechanisms of appeal.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para161"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000097"></a>Under the current system Ofgem's proposals for licence modifications can be blocked by 20 per cent of relevant licence holders based on market share or number of licence holders. Besides disadvantaging small players in the market, this can hardly be described as autonomous decision-making. We are therefore introducing a new licence modification process that allows Ofgem to make decisions and act on them autonomously, but gives those affected by the decision the right to appeal.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para162"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000098"></a>I am aware that some market participants do not welcome these changes and believe that by applying this system to all licence modifications, rather than simply those resulting directly from European obligations, we have gone further than is strictly necessary in our implementation. However, in many instances modifications may relate to both an EU obligation and a domestic matter, rendering a dual system impractical, if not impossible, to operate. Instead, we are proposing a robust, transparent and coherent decision-making framework, with an appropriate appeals mechanism.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para163"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000099"></a>I hope that the Committee will agree that these regulations represent a sensible transposition of the third package requirements. They will improve the functioning of our energy markets and bring real benefits to consumers while improving our long-term security of supply. I therefore commend them to the Committee.</p>

I found it infinitely depressing when I went to the Printed Paper Office and suddenly found myself presented with 197 pages of regulation and 184 pages of Explanatory Notes. If anybody in this Room is familiar with the content of all of them, I would be very surprised. I do not doubt that there are plenty of people who know how to reference every little last word, but do not think that it is possible for anybody to put their hand on their heart and say that they are familiar with it all.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para164"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000101"></a>I am really interested only in part 9. I will admit that I had representations made to me by one of the electricity companies, which was concerned about it for two or three reasons. First, although some might argue that the previous arrangements were a bit cosy, the licensees have to work very closely with Ofgem in forming any regulation. The result is that on the whole there is a great degree of agreement between the two when the regulations come out. Of course, the right to appeal to the Competition Commission is always there in the background.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para165"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000102"></a>Part 9 introduces this new body, the European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators. I really wonder how that was written into the European treaty. I assume that it must be a treaty matter; otherwise, how do we come to have a European body that can tell national Governments what to do. However, the Northern Irish can apparently get away with it, because they are only a devolved authority, but they have the power to say that this provision does not apply to them, as I understand it. The Minister may be able to explain that.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para166"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000103"></a>What concerns me is that we still have the appeals process to the Competition Commission, which is fine-but what is the relationship between the commission and ACER? If there is an appeal, which is upheld and is against what might be described as a binding decision of the new regulatory body, what happens? Do we have a power over it? I find a bit of confusion in the first paragraph, where it says why DECC is proposing these regulations, stating:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11101732000163"></a>"The Third Package requires Member States to ensure that national regulatory authorities are able to take autonomous decisions"-</p>

<p><a name="11101732000159"></a>that is fine-</p>
<ul><a name="11101732000166"></a>"and implement any binding decisions".</ul>
<p><a name="11101732000160"></a>Okay, but binding decisions are certainly not autonomous. Then we have an appeal mechanism, which can set the whole lot aside. I would be very grateful if the Minister could explain to me rather better how that relationship will actually work in practice. At the moment it  looks a bit like a recipe for finishing up in the divorce courts.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000104"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew53"></a><a name="11101732000207"></a>Lord Berkeley:</b> My Lords, I apologise to the Committee for not getting here at the start of these proceedings. It is a terrible thing to say, but I went to the wrong room and got lost.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para167"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000105"></a>My interest in this issue stems from talking to many ports and airports around the country. I recall having correspondence with Ministers a few years ago on one issue in particular. Ports and airports which already had a network might have tendered out the supply of electricity to get the best deal for their various tenants, but if one tenant decided to go to another supplier then, in order to comply with the directive and the Citiworks judgment, the port could not stop them. This may be fair enough but the port might then be saddled with the very high cost of upgrading its internal electricity network to grid standards. I know that Ministers at the time-I think it was before the election-understood the problem, but it has not gone away. It seems that there is something of a rush about getting this through, which I cannot believe is happening in any other member state. Can the noble Lord tell me whether any other member states are implementing these regulations at the same speed as we are?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para168"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000106"></a>The costs of doing this, whether capital cost or anything else, and the pricing methodology for assessing the charges, worry me and this needs further discussion. It is good that, at the seminar on 9 May, Ofgem announced a helpful concession to allow a higher capital cost figure to be taken into account in assessing the charges. However, these additional costs cannot be  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC42"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>taken into account in the case of the input of the opt-out on existing bulk purchase contracts, where the local network provider has committed to a minimum threshold. This seems rather unfair. If a port has put in a network and negotiated a bulk electricity deal, then half its tenants decide to go somewhere else-which they can do-it is left holding the baby with quite a big loss. One port told me that if all this went ahead and it was forced to implement it, it could lose in the region of £10 million a year. That seems a very high figure. There is clearly no way to stop this and it is probably right that tenants should be able to choose to buy power where they want. However, the cost of such a change should be borne by the tenant who wants to make the change, rather than by the landlord losing out.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para169"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000107"></a>Ports and the port businesses are also being hit by the carbon reduction commitment, which, as we know, is a tax on energy used by businesses. CRC is currently payable in respect of all business electricity users on port estates, even when they are below the minimum usage threshold for paying it. This may encourage more tenants to opt for third-party suppliers, which also puts more pressure on the port. Could the Minister see whether these effects can be mitigated, either through further discussion with Ofgem or further meetings with airports and port operators, to try to redress some of the adverse effects that are perceived at the moment?</p>

<p><a name="1110181000001"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew54"></a><a name="1110181000032"></a>Lord Whitty:</b> My Lords, I broadly support the second package and the transposition of it. However, it leaves a few loose ends, and I want to raise three points, one of which relates very much to what my noble friend Lord Berkeley just mentioned: inclusion in the need to provide access for consumers and businesses those who are licensed for local networks.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para170"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000002"></a>I am in a dilemma here-no doubt, so are the Government-in that if you are locked into a local network and there is no alternative supplier, choice does not apply. On the other hand, if you open it up to choice, as the noble Lord explained in relation to ports, the economics of the local network change. There is a real problem here. I ask whether that would apply, for example, to a relatively small CHP system on an industrial estate where all the other units on the estate had agreed to sign up and the economics had been worked out on that basis; or indeed a residential district heating system-I am very much in favour of both such developments of localised and decentralised energy. Opening that up to competition or to the secondary user's choice of supplier makes the economics much more difficult. That is a dilemma. Two principles clash here: one of encouraging decentralised energy and the other of consumer choice. Simply including them under the same obligation as the big network suppliers does not resolve that. I am no closer than the regulations-or, probably, the department-to supplying a solution, but it is not supplied by the regulations.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para171"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000003"></a>My second point relates to the reference to consumer protection and Consumer Focus. I declare my past allegiance as former chair of Consumer Focus and-although this applies more to my third point-as currently undertaking some work for the Consumer  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC43"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Council for Northern Ireland. The requirement for Consumer Focus in paragraph 2.2 to provide a consumer checklist is an extension to what is provided in the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007. It is a more prescriptive requirement on Consumer Focus-the National Consumer Council, in legal terms-than exists under that Act. Even in its current form, one could say that it is an incursion on its independence. The organisation already supplies significant guidance and information available to consumers. However, on balance, I do not object to the current setup.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para172"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000004"></a>As the Minister will be aware, under the Public Bodies Bill it is intended to move the role of Consumer Focus on energy either to a third-sector organisation, Citizens Advice or-another proposition currently in play-to Which?, which is, for these purposes, a private sector non-profit-making organisation. Is not the requirement for it to do the job in a certain way an even greater imposition on an independent organisation than it is on a quango? Is the Minister clear that such a requirement would survive a transfer of those functions to organisations that have not been in this game before and that have their own charitable and, in the case of Which?, slightly different structure of obligations and priorities?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para173"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000005"></a>Clearly, it is a bit of a problem to get the current powers of what was Energywatch and then Consumer Focus into a completely non-governmental organisation in the first place, but the more prescriptive that that becomes the more difficult it is to ensure that the provision in these regulations survives such a transfer.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para174"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000006"></a>My final point relates to Northern Ireland, to which the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, already referred. He seems to think that this lets Northern Ireland and the separate system of regulation off the hook. I am sure that in Northern Ireland he would be relatively happy for that to be the case, but my understanding is that there is concern about this over there because Northern Ireland organisations are not party to the ACER set-up. There can be only one regulator there, and the energy market there is very different to ours. The gas side is on an all-Ireland basis or is pretty much moving towards that. The Irish regulator would be there but not the Northern Ireland regulator. There are different structures of competition and supply. The regulations are not necessarily appropriate to a very different sort of market with a different sort of fuel supply. I should like the situation on Northern Ireland to be clarified-if not today, then at some point in the near future-because there seems to be a bit of a lacuna in the set-up.</p>

I hope that the Official Opposition Front Bench do not take half an hour on the various provisions relating to competition and energy. However, that is entirely up to them.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para175"></a>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para176"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000009"></a>The niche area that interested me is the one that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, mentioned at some length-the energy consumer checklist. On page 19 of the annexe to the Explanatory Memorandum it is stated that the European legislation:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1110181000030"></a>"Requires Member States to ensure consumers are provided with the Energy Consumer Checklist and that it is made publicly available".</p>

<p><a name="1110181000029"></a>I understand how that started to work from reading the third column on that page. However, I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that I tried to find out from a European Committee website and the DECC website what the energy consumer checklist was-particularly as the proposal is to have it printed on all bills. There nothing definitive whatever on the European Commission's website. It was completely vague and the Commission had obviously decided that this was a good idea, had delegated and had then done not a lot else. On the DECC website there was a copy of a letter from the Directorate-General Energy and Transport to Kim Darroch, the UK's permanent representative. Some 78 questions were listed on all the things that consumers ought to be able to ask about. My understanding from this-I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, already knows the answers, but forgive me if I pursue the issue-is that the National Consumer Council boils those down and makes them work. I am interested in how we make that obligation relate in a useful way to consumers, so that they can actually make real decisions. That is obviously tied up with all the issues around the swapping of accounts and everything else that has been high on the agenda in recent times. However, I should like to understand how the energy consumer checklist will be effective.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para177"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000010"></a>Perhaps the Minister can give us an insight into how other European member states are approaching this. I am particularly interested in the auctioning activity and whether the Government feel that other EU member states are starting to move out of the ice age and into global warming in terms of making sure that some of this deregulation and more market competition in terms of unbundling, or whatever, actually happens as regards those other European markets where, historically, we have been well ahead of the rest of the pack.</p>

When I first picked up the package of papers I saw that it was, as he said, nearly 200 pages on the order itself, and the Explanatory Memorandum.

<p><a name="1110181000012"></a>It is long, detailed and fairly complex. I am grateful to the Minister for trying to bring some order to it in the comments he made, and I think there is much in here with which we are quite happy. There are some

I was struck by one comment he made when he said that on licensing the Government felt able to go further than was in the directives, which I understand and am not unhappy about.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para179"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000013"></a>However, it seems to me that the area in which the Government might have wanted to go further is consumer protection and the issue around switching and information for customers. I cannot see why, or how, switching can be effective for the consumer or the customer unless they have the information and are able to understand it and make use of it. The noble Lord will recall the noble Baroness, Lady Oppenheim-Barnes, who spoke for many of us last week when her frustrations boiled over into anger as she spoke of her experience in trying to switch energy companies.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para180"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000014"></a>Certainly, what is here today can make it easier. But, again, at the summit today at Downing Street, Chris Huhne made a comment about making switching easier. If we are going to put so much emphasis on the ability of the consumer to save money by switching energy companies, there is far more we need to do than what is in this order. Therefore, I welcome them, as far as they go.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para181"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000015"></a>I have some questions that might help me assuage my disappointment and help me understand some of the issues. I am sure the noble Lord shares my disappointment at the response to the consultation from the energy industry. I would have liked it to be a bit more positive.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para182"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000016"></a>We have heard comments from the energy industry that it wants to help people reduce their bills, but its response to the consultation was a bit disappointing. On the issue of switching within three weeks-which is exactly the right thing to do in that area-while their IT companies were saying it could be done, the companies themselves were expressing concern and were, I think it is fair to say, less than enthusiastic.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para183"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000017"></a>I would like to ask the noble Lord a few questions on consumer protection, as I am not entirely clear about the effects of implementation. Is the three-week period from the end of the cooling-off period for the customer, or from when the customer first signs the documentation required to say that they want to switch? We have had two conflicting responses on that, so it would be helpful if the noble Lord could clarify that.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para184"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000018"></a>Also, I noted in the consultation document that the energy companies raised concerns about making it a legal right for customers to expect their supplier to be changed within three weeks. What was the outcome of that? I have been through the Explanatory Memorandum and the order itself. I may be missing something, but if an energy company fails to meet the 21 days for switching the customer, what action can the customer or the regulator take? What are the practical implications of it?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para185"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000019"></a>If the only action open to the consumer is to take action against the supplier then the company will have nothing to fear. I am also unsure as to how the customer will know which is at fault: the company they are switching to or the one they are switching from. Could the Minister outline the consequences  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC46"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of a company failing to meet the 21 days,  particularly if it is a regular fail, rather than an occasional mistake?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para186"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000020"></a>The ability to switch depends on having the time, the capacity, ability and information to do so. The Select Committee in the other place has drawn attention to this issue. I have seen the new regulations and I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, about the checklist. What will be in it and will it be in a format that is clear, understandable and concise? A list of 58 questions and answers will not be satisfactory for any consumer. The Explanatory Memorandum states that the information will be put on the internet. If consumers have to go to the internet and wade through 58 questions and answers, it might be a week or so before they decide that they want to switch. Are the Government satisfied that the information available to the consumer will allow them to make an informed decision about their bills and supplier?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para187"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000021"></a>In a recent survey, <I>Which</I><I>? </I>called the six major energy suppliers 12 times in a week and asked about the cheapest deal for the consumer. In most cases, the energy company got it wrong and failed to offer the cheapest deal. I think that EDF performed best, offering the cheapest deal in five of the 12 calls. One company said that the cheapest tariffs were available only online. Exit fees were not mentioned in a third of all cases. If the energy companies themselves are unable to give to the customer correct and accurate information about the cheapest deal, how can the consumer, who is not an expert, be expected to find them out for themselves?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para188"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000022"></a>It would also be helpful if the consumer was advised to not to switch on the doorstep. Forty per cent of those who switch as a result of doorstep selling find that they have got not a better deal but something that is worse or no better than they have already. I would like energy companies to offer every customer the best deal available-I have never understood why there are so many different tariffs anyway.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para189"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000023"></a>Annex 1 to the Explanatory Memorandum outlines directive 2-the electricity directive. I am not sure why directive 1 is not there. It sets out the articles of the directive and what has to be done to comply with them. Why under Article 3(7), which requires member states to introduce a number of measures to protect vulnerable customers, is Warm Front listed as something that the Government are doing, when that programme is being phased out, indeed abolished? I am unclear why that is still in the transposition notes on action being taken by the Government. It seems unusual to refer to something that is being phased out. I appreciate that, when the consultation was undertaken, there was no intention on the part of the previous Government to get rid of Warm Front, but now that it has gone, I do not understand why it is still in the document. Since that programme is being phased out, do we have to go back to the EU and say what else we are doing?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para190"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000024"></a>The document also mentions the Green Deal as helping vulnerable customers. It does not say that it is a very limited measure that does not help those in the private rented sector as Warm Front did. There is a gap, because that help will take some time to come in. Can the Minister explain why that information is being given?</p>

<p><a name="1110181000026"></a>The Minister mentioned networks, access and storage facilities. All those are referred to in the impact assessment as ensuring greater competition and falling bills. Does the Minister understand a slight scepticism being felt about that? Very few customers see their bills coming down; they may see a smaller increase. Can he give us more information on how this will impact on the consumer and assure us that the cost savings will return to the customer and not just mean larger profits for the energy companies?</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para193"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000027"></a>The final part is on the regulatory framework. There has been a reprieve for Ofgem in the Public Bodies Bill. Is the Minister satisfied that it has the resources to undertake the additional regulatory functions it is taking on? I endorse the comments made by my noble friends, Lord Berkeley and Lord Whitty. The local estate heating system is a bit of a minefield. There are estates in my former constituency where people feel their bills are too high and want the opportunity to switch companies, but this would have the effect of increasing bills for others. This is a dilemma and more work is required.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para194"></a>
<p><a name="1110181000028"></a>In relation to the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, the impact assessment does not refer to the impact this would have on airports or ports. It talked instead about the costs to Ofgem. If there are associated costs that are not referred to in the impact assessment, or that I have missed, then there is an issue. We need to find a way of not imposing costs that would make businesses unprofitable and put them in jeopardy, particularly in times of recession. The impact assessment states that further legislation would be required. Does that mean we will have another opportunity to look at this before it is implemented? I hope that the Minister can address some of the points and concerns that have been raised.</p>

I am afraid that I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, about its size. Let us not forget that this regulation was agreed by the previous Government in 2009, at a negotiation in Europe. So I share the noble Lord's complaint: I have inherited this vast document of noble exchanges at a very high level-beyond my pay grade-in Europe. The net result is that we have a broad regulation which we have attempted to modify and improve, taking on board what a number of noble Lords have said. We have largely accepted everything that is here, because it has been imposed upon us by the EU, through previous negotiation. We have taken four issues which we have tried to mitigate and improve on. Those are: loosening the private network owners' situation-about which the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley,  


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC48"></a><b>17 Oct 2011 : Column GC48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is concerned-small generation interests, gas storage, which we have tried to find a more transparent way of managing, and switching licences. These are four areas which we, as a department, have decided it would not be in the best interests of the consumer to adopt wholeheartedly.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para195"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000137"></a>It comes as no surprise that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has heard from one or two of the major energy companies, because they, quite naturally, do not like everything that is going on. We in Government-and I think that we would all in this Room agree about this-want, largely, to protect the consumer, not the provider. It therefore comes as no huge surprise that, in this particular instance, one or two of the companies are disappointed. That does not mean that we do not have to work with these big six, because they are fundamental to delivering supply and we must congratulate them on much of their work.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para196"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000138"></a>The noble Lord asked me a specific question in relation to ACER. The point about ACER is that it deals with cross-border issues, whereas Ofgem deals with issues in relation to the UK. ACER has, of course, a broader remit than Ofgem. My noble friend, Lord Teverson, asked about the views of the other European states. I am afraid that is way above my pay grade. Who would be able to navigate the minefield of the views of some of the European states? My concern is what goes on in this country and I know that is his primary concern despite his great knowledge of Europe.</p>
<h5><a name="11101732000174"></a><I></I>7 pm</h5>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para197"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000139"></a>This brings us, happily, to the issue of Northern Ireland, which a number of noble Lords have mentioned. It has taken a decision to wait and see what actually happens. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland makes it clear that it will consult on these licences, and the appeals progress, but I suspect that it will largely be onside with these excellent things negotiated by the British Government.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para198"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000140"></a>I turn briefly to the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, who always speaks on the issue of transport, of which he has great knowledge-I have enjoyed sharing experiences with him on that front. There was a notable train journey that we took along the coast of Cumbria on the reopening of that line. It was a magnificent moment and a very enjoyable experience.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para199"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000141"></a>The issue of ports has been raised by the noble Lord and other noble Lords on a number of occasions. In this negotiation process, we have tried to push it as far as we could within the confines of the EU regulation that has been imposed on us. The short answer is that ports do not have to upgrade their network to those of a public network, which I hope the noble Lord will be pleased about. On a specific question that I was unable to answer, existing bulk contracts can stand but customers must be able to switch if they wish before deals are agreed. I hope that that answers the noble Lord's question.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para200"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000142"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, comes at these things from the perspective of Consumer Focus, where people tell me that he was a brilliant chairman. It was not the noble Lord who told me, but I am sure that he would not disagree. The noble Baroness asked how the functions will be transferred. They will transfer to Citizens

The short answer to the question of whether CHP is provided for is yes. I hope that the noble Lord will therefore support these provisions.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para201"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000143"></a>My noble friend Lord Teverson mentions the business of checking. I am very pleased to be able to tell him that today the Prime Minister and our Secretary of State, Chris Huhne, opened something called "Check, Switch and Insulate to Save". I know that he is going to leave this place and go to the website, on directgov.uk under home energy. It ensures the publication of cheaper tariffs. There will be a consumer checklist and a concise version will be summarised and the relevant information given.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para202"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000144"></a>The noble Baroness is quite right that it is a minefield going into the issues of where the cheapest price is and how people can get to it. She rightly raised very valuable points, which I have written down, about the interrelationship between the consumer and these new regulations. She asked whether there was a cooling-off period and when it starts. It starts from the end of the three-week period that we talked about. She asked what penalty could be imposed if the supplier did not supply in time. In fact, the penalty can be as much as 10 per cent of the turnover, so it is a very significant figure. Of course, it will be imposed on them, because it is very important that we represent the desires of the consumer.</p>

<p><a name="11101732000145"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew58"></a><a name="11101732000212"></a>Baroness Smith of Basildon:</b> That is really helpful, but just for clarification could he tell me how that would fall into place and whether it would be the consumer who had to take action to ensure that happened, or whether it would be a matter for the regulator to deal with?</p>

<p><a name="11101732000146"></a><b><a name="111017-gc0001.htm_spnew59"></a><a name="11101732000213"></a>Lord Marland:</b> I guess that it would be both, because the consumer will apply to the regulator, which would be the normal way for the regulator to impose that on the supplier.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para203"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000147"></a>I dealt with the question on checklists. Warm Front still exists, of course, and will do so for another year, so it is reasonable to use it. Of course, we brought in a whole load of other measures, which the noble Baroness knows. For the sake of clarity, from December 2011, 4 million of the most vulnerable energy customers in Britain will receive letters to tell them that they are eligible for free or heavily discounted insulation of their loft or cavity walls, which is the Green Deal that we were talking about earlier.</p>

A whole amount of measures was issued at the energy summit today, with which I will be very happy to furnish the noble Baroness. As for the issue of PRS and Green Deal, I think that we have debated that quite extensively and I really do not want to go over the old ground. We share a significant problem and concern, and in the end I think that we were all singing off the same hymn sheet in that debate.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para204"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000150"></a>Lastly, on the question of whether Ofgem has the right resources, it is important that it has. It has a task to manage this enormous amount of legislation in front of us, and we will watch very carefully to ensure that it is up to the task. The noble Baroness was quite right to raise that issue now, because it is important that customers at all levels are protected. I believe that the legislation goes a long way to doing that. As I said earlier, it is legislation that we have inherited, but there is a lot of good stuff in it. Would we have done everything to the letter of the word? Perhaps not. Are you pleased with everything that we have done to the letter of the word? Perhaps not. But it is legislation, and good legislation with the consumer in mind, and I think that we would all applaud that.</p>

My question applies equally to some of the examples from my noble friend Lord Whitty on the bulk suppliers of power to tenants, as we could call them, who opt to go to another supplier. As a result, the bulk supplier may lose the level of discount that he would have got if he had been selling to the whole lot. My impression from the Minister's answer was: "Well, tough on the bulk supplier". It could be a not-for-profit organisation; it does not have to be a commercial port. Is my interpretation of that correct and, if so, is there anything that Ofgem could do to mitigate the effect with a little bit more discussion? I would be grateful for his response.</p>

I do not know the answer, and it is an important question.</p>

<a name="111017-gc0001.htm_para205"></a>
<p><a name="11101732000153"></a>I should clarify one point about the switch to Citizens Advice. The detail is being worked out and no decision has therefore been made, but that is the likely intention of the transfer. With that in mind, I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

<p><i><a name="11101732000222"></a>Motion agreed.</i></p>

<a name="111017-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="1110175000004"></a>The Economic and Financial Affairs Council was held in Luxembourg on 4 October 2011. The Financial Secretary and I represented the UK. The following items were discussed.</p>

<a name="111017-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="1110175000005"></a><I>Regulation on over-the-counter derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR)</I></p>

<a name="111017-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="1110175000006"></a>Prior to the meeting, the Government were clear that the regulation as it stood was unacceptable. In line with concerns raised previously by the European Union Committee, I therefore made clear that a number of changes to the text were needed, including:</p>
 in order for the college to block an authorisation of a central counterparty (CCP), all members of the college, excluding the relevant National Competent Authority (NCA), must vote against it; wording in an article that would forbid any decisions on CCPs being made on a basis that would discriminate against any member state as a venue for clearing services in any currency; in order to foster competition, provisions requiring open access to CCPs and trading venues for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, as well as a public statement from the Commission that full, fair and open access would be dealt with properly in forthcoming legislation; a public declaration that the issue of scope and adequate coverage to meet the G20 agreement would be dealt with in upcoming legislation; and a clear statement that the drafting of third-country provisions required further work, which will be completed in the context of negotiations with the European Parliament.
<a name="111017-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="1110175000007"></a>With these conditions met, the council agreed a general approach. The presidency, on behalf of the council, will now start negotiations with the European Parliament, with a view to reaching agreement at first reading.</p>

<a name="111017-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="1110175000009"></a>The council agreed to a compromise text on the package of six legislative proposals. The Government are content with the package, which will strengthen economic governance in the EU whilst respecting the UK's fiscal sovereignty. The council will formally adopt the proposals without further discussion once the texts have been finalised in all official languages.</p>

<a name="111017-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="1110175000013"></a>The presidency gave a de-brief of the September informal ECOFIN, and presented a proposal for the ECOFIN council to assess the impact of new EU legislation on growth and jobs. This was then discussed over lunch, with the Government offering support. Officials will now produce a formal proposal, which will be discussed at a future ECOFIN.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="1110175000015"></a>Finance Ministers agreed council conclusions on the implications of lower growth on excessive deficit procedure and stability and growth pact targets. The Government support these conclusions, which are in line with domestic fiscal policy and the emerging international debate on differentiating fiscal strategies between countries. The conclusions will feed into the European Council debate on EU growth on 23 October.</p>

The Government are content with the terms of reference, which emphasise the need for determined action to maintain financial stability, restore confidence and support growth. The G20 meeting is expected to cover the following issues: responding effectively to the current challenges in the global economy through the G20 framework for growth; financial regulation; commodities; reform of the international monetary system; and climate change financing and development.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1110175000087"></a>"The conviction of the Ukrainian opposition politician, Yuliya Tymoshenko, by a court in Kyiv is deeply concerning. Independent legal experts including the Danish Helsinki Committee have concluded that Ms Tymoshenko's trial was subject to numerous and serious violations of fundamental legal principles, in direct contradiction of common European values.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1110175000088"></a>"Ukraine says it wants to join the EU one day. The UK supports that objective.

There was an appeal for both parties to resume negotiations under the terms set out in the quartet statement of 23 September.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="1110175000049"></a>Ministers expressed their disappointment with the recent settlement expansion in the east Jerusalem settlement of Gilo. Baroness Ashton briefed Ministers on the quartet envoys' meeting of 9 October in Brussels and plans to invite the parties to meet in the coming days. The Foreign Secretary emphasised the need for continued EU unity in response to any resolutions proposed at the United Nations in New York.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="1110175000051"></a>The discussion on Iran focused on two areas: the EU's growing concern over human rights, and Iran's nuclear programme. On human rights, Ministers agreed to add 29 names to its sanctions list, in addition to the 32 officials previously agreed in April. On the nuclear issue, Baroness Ashton briefed Ministers on E3+3 talks in New York in the margin of the UN General Assembly and her meeting with the Iranian Foreign Minister. She also outlined plans for taking forward talks with Iran. The Foreign Secretary made the following statement:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1110175000089"></a>"I welcome the EU's agreement today to impose restrictive measures on a further 29 Iranians responsible for grave human rights abuses. Those targeted include Government Ministers, members of the security forces, prison staff and judiciary responsible for serious human rights violations.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1110175000090"></a>"In recent months the human rights situation in Iran has continued to deteriorate. As we mark World Day against the Death Penalty we should recall that Iran has now executed over 500 people this year, including a 17 year-old boy. The Government have violently suppressed protests over the mismanagement of a lake in north-west Iran, and families of a number of journalists have been arrested and harassed. We will continue to identify and list those who seriously violate the human rights of the Iranian people.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1110175000091"></a>"Today's decision sends a clear message to every individual on this list, and others in the Iranian regime, that we will not stand by. They will be held to account for their actions and should not involve themselves in the appalling abuses we continue to witness".</p>

The Foreign Secretary said that we supported effective external action by the EU, in accordance with the treaties, but that we needed to ensure that this did not affect the balance of competences between the EU and member states; and that member states remained free to act where they had the right to do so. He agreed that the EAS should propose effective arrangements in line with these principles.</p>

The Commissioner set out proposed EU priorities: the eurozone and the global economic recovery; the resilience of the international monetary system; tackling commodity prices; providing a way forward for Doha and the WTO; development; food security; a strong message on climate change and Durban; and the proposed financial transaction tax (FTT).

He explained that the council had been pushed back to Sunday 23 October to allow heads of state and government to consider issues relating to Greece, the European banks and the eurozone governance more comprehensively as a package. I argued that any future institutional changes to governance in the eurozone had to protect fully the interests of all 27 member states, and there had to be clear language to that effect in the European Council conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="1110175000069"></a>The Government recognise that volunteers already make a tremendous contribution towards the health and care services and support within their communities, improving the quality and choice of services available in our country. We want to ensure that this wealth of activity is recognised, celebrated and strengthened and that we nurture and release the capability and capacity that exists within our communities.</p>

<a name="111017-wms0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="1110175000071"></a>The vision highlights the valuable contribution volunteering and wider social action makes to every sphere of health, public health and social care, including prevention, the creation of people-centred and relationship-based services and improved patient and service user experience. It demonstrates how greater involvement of members of the public can help to develop support mechanisms and services that genuinely meet people's needs, are more personal, strength-based and community-owned.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="1110175000072"></a>The strategic vision aims to:</p>
embed a deeper understanding, genuine appreciation and awareness of volunteering and its benefits across all of health, public health and social care;recognise the enormous voluntary effort that contributes to health and well-being and to health, public health and care services in this country, and ensure that this is recognised, celebrated and strengthened in the process of system and service reform;ensure that services are built around the strengths and assets that people (including those with health and care needs, carers and communities) can bring to them, through volunteering as well as co-production and shared decision making; andencourage the various parts of the health, public health and social care systems to recognise the value of volunteering in relation to their respective priorities and consider, from a more informed stance, where a more strategic approach and coherent investment in volunteering would lead to improved quality, equity and outcomes

<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="1110175000078"></a>Today, I am advising the House that on 22 September we announced the launch of an enhanced Crimestoppers initiative in prisons. Crimestoppers will now report direct to the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) all prison-related matters, enabling a faster response. The launch was accompanied by  a poster and leaflet campaign advertising the new arrangements, and this will be followed by other campaigns on key issues that affect security in prisons. All printing is being undertaken through a contract with prison industries, providing useful employment for prisoners.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a><a name="1110175000079"></a>NOMS is determined to disrupt the criminal behaviour of prisoners.

<a name="11101711000003"></a><b><a name="111017w0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="11101711000659"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord Hill of Oareford):</b> The Government want to see more children in care adopted, where this is in their best interests, particularly those who in the past may have been overlooked-children who are older or have disabilities or very complex needs. We want local authorities to look very critically at their practice in respect of children who wait longest, such as black children, disabled children, older children and larger sibling groups.</p>

<a name="111017w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="11101711000004"></a>To help drive change and steer a programme of reform, the Government set up last year a ministerial advisory group on adoption. We have already published revised statutory adoption guidance, which makes clear that the primary consideration for local authorities must be whether the prospective adopters can meet all or most of the child's needs. It is plainly unacceptable for a child to be denied loving adoptive parents solely on the grounds that the child and prospective adopters do not share the same background.</p>

<a name="111017w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="11101711000005"></a>We also published, in March, an adoption data pack to help local authorities challenge and review their practices and outcomes, and to highlight the variations in outcomes between local authorities. In July the Government appointed Martin Narey, former chief executive of Barnardo's, as ministerial adviser on adoption. He is now visiting individual local authorities to identify and share good practice, and to challenge poorer practices. His remit specifically includes offering advice on how to reduce waiting times for black children in need of adoption.</p>

<a name="111017w0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="11101711000006"></a>Special guardianship orders were introduced in 2005 to provide another form of permanence for children who cannot live with their birth parents but for whom adoption may not be appropriate. This is particularly relevant for older children and children from some ethnic and minority communities who may have cultural and religious difficulties with adoption. The number of special guardianship orders has increased from 1,290 in 2010 to 1,740 this year.</p>

<a name="11101711000010"></a><b><a name="111017w0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="11101711000665"></a>The Commercial Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Sassoon):</b> The Independent Commission on Banking (ICB) proposed that UK banks, defined as globally systemically important (G-SIBs) and large ring-fenced banks, should be required to have primary loss absorbing capacity (PLAC)-made up of capital and long-term unsecured debt that is subject to a bail-in power recommended by the ICB-to be applied on a sliding scale and in the following way.<sup>1</sup></p>

<a name="111017w0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a><a name="11101711000011"></a>UK G-SIBs with a 2.5 per cent G-SIB surcharge, and ring-fenced banks with a ratio of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) to UK GDP of 3 per cent or more, should be required to have a PLAC equal to at least 17 per cent of risk-weighted assets (RWAs).</p>

<a name="111017w0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a><a name="11101711000012"></a>UK G-SIBS with a G-SIB surcharge below 2.5 per cent, and ring-fenced banks with a ratio of RWAs to UK GDP of 1 to 3 per cent, should be required to have a primary loss absorbing capacity set by a sliding scale from 10.5 to 17 per cent of RWAs.</p>

<a name="111017w0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a><a name="11101711000013"></a>Under the ICB's recommendations, the PLAC requirements would be applied at group level, meaning that subordinated and senior unsecured debt issued by overseas subsidiaries would count towards this requirement if it is capital or can be bailed in under the power recommended by the ICB. However, the ICB also recommended that PLAC requirements be applied to UK-domiciled banks that are part of UK G-SIBs at a solo level, meaning that a ring-fenced bank that is part of a UK G-SIB would need to meet its own PLAC requirements on a standalone basis (though these could count towards the bank's group PLAC requirement).</p>

<a name="111017w0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"></a><a name="11101711000014"></a>The Government have welcomed, in principle, the recommendations brought forward by the ICB and will provide a full response by the end of this year. As part of this, the Government will consider the appropriate division of responsibilities within the proposed new regulatory architecture.</p>

<a name="111017w0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_8"></a><a name="11101711000015"></a>The European Commission consulted in January on proposals for an EU crisis management framework, covering a range of preventive powers, early intervention and resolution tools (including an EU-wide bail-in regime). The Government expect the Commission to publish a draft directive proposal on crisis management later this year. The Government will consider the relevant interactions between the ICB's recommendations and any contained within the EU crisis management framework once it is adopted by the European Commission.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_9"></a><a name="11101711000016"></a>A list of G-SIBs, and recommendations for additional regulatory capital above the Basel III baseline that they should be required to hold (the G-SIB surcharge referred to above), is currently being developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. These recommendations are due to be presented to the G20 for agreement later this year.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_12"></a><a name="11101711000022"></a>The call for evidence found that there have been significant developments in the market in recent years. As part of the Office of Fair Trading's work, banks have committed to introduce measures to improve the transparency of unarranged overdraft charges and many have also revised their charging structures in the last two years. This has already led to some reductions-the average unpaid item charge has fallen by more than half from £35 in 2007 to £14 in 2010. However, responses to the call for evidence showed that there are still serious concerns about how charges, including the new charging structure, affect consumers, particularly where charges may be not be clear or transparent enough.</p>

Indicators of progress include: the establishment of a study panel in the Japanese Ministry of Justice to consider the death penalty; the media being given access to the execution chamber; and no executions in Japan for over a year. Furthermore, the recent statement by the new Justice Minister Hideo Hiraoka that he does not intend to approve any executions for the time being while discussions on the issue are ongoing is particularly welcome.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_38"></a><a name="11101711000077"></a>Where a borrower moves abroad, repayments are made direct to the SLC. From 2009 the SLC began to take action against those borrowers who moved overseas and did not provide the SLC with adequate information to allow the processing of repayments. Those borrowers who have moved abroad and fail to respond to the SLC will have default repayments automatically scheduled. This enables borrowers to be placed in arrears so that legal action may be brought against them to enforce the debt. This necessary change in the process has led to an increase in the number of borrowers residing overseas who are in arrears. It should be noted that the figures include UK borrowers who have moved overseas after completing their studies.</p>

Borrowers can apply to defer for 12-month periods if their income is below this threshold. Unless a borrower is either repaying or deferring, they are in arrears and therefore in default of their credit agreement. The SLC takes a number of steps to trace borrowers who are not repaying and to bring their accounts into order, and-as a last resort-will take cases to court. Exceptions are made for some vulnerable borrowers.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_134"></a><a name="11101711000204"></a>The revision of £1,233 million to central government net borrowing was driven by a £1.640 million revision to income tax data. This revision was due to the inclusion of an accrual adjustment between 2010-11 and earlier years, which related to repayments and recoveries identified through the introduction of HMRC's National Insurance and PAYE service (NPS). There was an offsetting downward revision of £450 million to central government net investment. About half of this revision related to revised data on capital grants to the private sector and half to revised data on the acquisition and disposal of fixed capital assets.</p>

<a name="111017w0001.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_135"></a><a name="11101711000205"></a>The revision of £4.156 million to local government net borrowing was driven by the replacement of budget forecast data by provisional outturn data. The largest revisions within these data were a downward revision of £1,963 million to current expenditure on goods and services and a £1,417 million downward revision to the net acquisition of fixed capital assets.</p>

<a name="111017w0001.htm_para136"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_136"></a><a name="11101711000206"></a>The Department for Communities and Local Government has recently introduced the Quarterly Revenue Outturn (QRO) data collection for English local authorities. The first quarterly dataset from this collection was published on 28 September 2011, and these and future QRO data will be used by ONS to inform the calculation of local government net borrowing. It is anticipated that the availability of this new data source will reduce the size of revisions to local government net borrowing at the point that provisional outturn data for the full financial year become available.</p>

I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking how public accounts will treat the government, through quantitative easing, owning as an asset a public sector liability (HL12289)</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_140"></a><a name="11101711000211"></a>The public accounts are published monthly in the Public Sector Finances statistical bulletin, produced jointly by ONS and HMT. This publication is based upon National Accounts principles set out in the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95).</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_141"></a><a name="11101711000212"></a>Quantitative Easing is the term commonly used to describe the purchase of gilts from the market by the Bank of England's Asset Purchase Facility Fund, financed by the creation of central bank reserves. (see http//<a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/apf/index.htm">www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/apf/index.htm</a> for more information).</p>

<a name="111017w0001.htm_para142"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_142"></a><a name="11101711000213"></a>In National Accounts the Bank of England is classified as a public financial corporation, and is in the public sector but it is not part of general government.</p>

<a name="111017w0001.htm_para143"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_143"></a><a name="11101711000214"></a>The gilts purchased are treated as assets of the Bank of England and the central bank reserves that are created to pay for them as its liabilities. The gilts purchased remain as government liabilities For technical reasons, there is a small (in the context of the overall total) effect on public sector net debt, even though the value of assets purchased are matched by the liabilities created to pay for them. First, the gilts are purchased by the Bank of England at the prevailing market price, but by convention are recorded in the public sector finances at their nominal price. Secondly, interest payments flow from Government to the Bank and are therefore transfers within the public sector (whereas previously they left the public sector altogether). These interest flows also serve to reduce public sector net borrowing</p>
