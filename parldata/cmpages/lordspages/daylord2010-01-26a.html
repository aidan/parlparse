To underpin this improvement in confidence, regulatory reform is also necessary. The Government, in conjunction with the FSA and the Bank of England, have already made progress in improving financial institutions' corporate governance, remuneration practices and risk management, and are working with international partners significantly to strengthen capital and liquidity requirements.</p>

I greatly appreciate the time that he has spent in recent days on this very important issue, but-there always has to be a "but"-does he agree that there is a strong sense of frustration that, after 18 months of talk, nothing has really changed? Goldman Sachs is back making huge profits and is having difficulty restraining its bonuses from being too large. I have two quick points on this very difficult issue. Will the noble Lord follow up the proposition that there must be a fundamental divorce between retail deposit banking and what is politely called investment banking, but in fact has often simply meant taking large and obscure risks in derivatives whose profit was based on the growth in house prices? Secondly, will the Minister persuade his colleagues to declare, as President Obama has done, that never again will the British taxpayer be held to ransom by a bank that is too big to fail?</p>

The support we have given to the banking system is evident in the fact that the economy is now coming out of recession and has done so with much less damage in terms of unemployment, business failure or people losing their homes than was the case in previous Tory recessions. The support we have provided to the banking system has undoubtedly helped to support the extension of credit to achieve that goal. We continue to use the pressures of the FSA, other legislation and international engagement to bear down on bonus costs in banks, but ultimately these questions must be determined by the shareholders of those banks.</p>

The failures that we have seen in the banking system have not come through the co-joining of utility banks and investment or casino banks. Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns were pure investment banks. Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, IndyMac, Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley were pure retail banks. It is not the conflation of the two that was the source of the error. I have spent a lot of time looking at this and I have concluded that the answers lie not in architecture but in behaviour. The reason why these banks failed was because they were atrociously managed.</p>

It is a very challenging question that the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, puts to me. When I say atrociously managed I mean atrocious management of risk as that is what lies at the heart of banks. It was the failure through traditional bad lending that lay at the heart of the collapse of the Bank of Scotland, part of HBOS, and of Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>

There is no guarantee that they will not still be there on any changes that will be made later. May I clarify my noble friend's policy on this? Unlike the President of the United States, is he saying that because those bankers are still going to be there, whether they are running small or large banks, the only way to get round the problem is by having some kind of compulsory insurance fund so that it cannot happen again and taxpayers and others are protected?</p>

That is a real sign of improved confidence, as are lower interest rates, a lower OIS spread, the fact that a bank such as Lloyds Banking Group can launch the largest-ever rights issue in this country, and the decline in the credit default swap rates. This is real evidence of returning confidence.

In December 2009, 1,606,500 people were claiming jobseeker's allowance, which is down 15,000 on the month.</p>

Does the noble Lord agree that there is still real cause for concern about the fall in the employment rate to 72.4 per cent, the lowest since the winter of 1996-97, and the increase to November 1997 levels in the number of those unemployed for more than 12 months? Does the noble Lord agree that today's announcement of 0.1 per cent growth in the last quarter of last year hardly holds out much hope to the record number of 8 million economically inactive people in this country?</p>

As regards today's news on the economy, the Chancellor has always said that it would return to growth by the end of the year. The estimate makes clear that the Government are right to be confident but cautious about the prospects for the economy. There are now clear signs that the impact of the recession on the labour market is easing. The level of redundancies has fallen significantly since the spring. As regards jobseeker's allowance, the December on-flow figure of 328,000 was the lowest for a year, but more than 350,000 people left JSA, which is the highest figure for 15 years. On the inactivity figures, I suggest that you need to unpick the raw data, because you need to take account of the fact that the population has increased. If you extract the number of full-time students in that data, you will see that the proportion of the working-age population that is inactive is actually 2.3 per cent lower even than in 1997, let alone previous Tory recessions.</p>

The noble Lord is correct to raise issues around full-time and part-time employment. If the import of his question is that there has been an increase in part-time employment, he is right.

When the Traffic Director for London arrives, could he be invited to undertake a review of the PPG13 planning guidance from the Minister's department, which requires councils to increase parking charges and reduce the number of parking spaces? Will the Minister confirm that his noble friend the Secretary of State for Transport, in a Written Answer on 7 December 2009, said that government chauffeurs had incurred £17,000 in parking fines last year? He added that parking restrictions in London make it impossible to avoid fines. Is this not precisely what councils and businesses have been telling the Minister and will he now act to review this damaging measure?</p>

The Traffic Director for London was set up as a corporate sole in 1991. It ceased to exist about eight years ago. Some of the individuals who were employed by the Traffic Director for London-it was not a post but an organisation-have gone back to local councils. That is what this order and issue are all about. Therefore, it no longer exists as a body and has no responsibility for the areas that the noble Lord is probing.</p>

Is it clear to him and to the House that the Traffic Director for London was not just one person but something called a "corporate sole"? I understand that the Clerk of the Parliaments is a corporate sole, which is both an individual and a body of people. The number of staff members working for the Traffic Director for London whose rights might have been affected by this if they had been made redundant was 26.</p>

The United Kingdom courts have found the exercise of the powers pursuant to Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 to be ECHR-compatible. That is a view with which the Government concur. The Home Secretary is giving careful consideration to the judgment and will request a referral to the Grand Chamber.</p>

It caused a great problem to this country. In reintroducing the measure under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act, the Government gave some interesting reasons. Perhaps my noble and learned friend can tell the House whether any of those reasons have been satisfied. Could she say how many acts of terrorism and criminal activity have been thwarted in the past 12 months by the Act and whether it has reassured the public?</p>

Noble Lords will know that part of the reason why stop and search was used was to act as a deterrent. It has been an effective tool and it has been honed. I say to my noble friend that the criticisms made by the community about Section 44 and the way in which it was operated have been taken very seriously. As a result of the work done with the community and the Metropolitan Police, which has responded to the community's concern, from mid-2009 we have seen a drop in its use in the capital of about 40 per cent.</p>

If that is the case, rather than appealing, why do the Government not amend the Terrorism Act immediately to reflect that change in the use of the powers?</p>

I am sure that she will have seen the erudite judgment made by the House of Lords about the structure of Section 44 and the way in which it can be used proportionately. What she has described is the proportionate and appropriate use of the law as it currently stands. As I said, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary is looking at the judgment carefully and considering whether to refer this matter to the Grand Chamber.

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="10012662000071"></a>I will speak also to Amendment 160. The intention there is to ensure that people who are representative of subscribers are consulted too. All that is presently proposed is that they are a possible group of consultees. Those, who, at the end of the day, will bear the impact of the Bill and the sanctions under this part of it, should be consulted ahead of, and certainly as well as, those who are merely conduits for the punishment which the Government intend.</p>

It would be quite wrong to proceed with an assessment of a technical measure without consultation on an assessment or how effective it would be. I must admit that I do not understand why paragraph (c) is there at all. The power to take initial steps is already in subsection (1), so it is not clear why it needs to be repeated in subsection (4).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="10012662000073"></a>Turning to the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and my noble friend Lord Lucas, we on these Benches agree with a requirement to consult groups representing subscribers and consumers. However, I am unclear on the value of consulting the judiciary. I worry about the provisions becoming a pseudo-penalty, which certainly would require the involvement of the judiciary. However, there would be an appeal, so presumably the body administering the code will be able to handle complaints about wrongful imposition of measures up to a certain point. The measures should not be used to punish. If the noble Lord intends the provisions to allow the imposition of a penalty, or the withdrawal of a service to such an extent that it would be seen as one under the law, the Government need to go back to square one and draft in the proper protections that such a step would require.</p>

I can see a possible point in consulting the judiciary, despite what the noble Lord just said, because copyright law is extremely complex, and it could well be that inadvertently the code is not realistic in terms of the actual law of copyright, particularly when we are dealing with it internationally. Some people who are serving up files for unlawful download will be using foreign-based servers within areas which come under the Berne convention. There may be a legal level to this which should be consulted. To ignore that could be unwise, so I can see good purpose in that. In general, I support the amendments; they are eminently sensible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="10012662000076"></a>It may well be desirable for those powers to be used one at a time rather than in parallel. The Secretary of State might want an assessment of whether any measure is needed and, if so, which is the right one before asking for a code to be drawn up. This would make sense since the detail of the code is likely to be heavily influenced by the nature of the measure. This suggests that it is not sensible to make all of paragraphs (a) to (c) a requirement in relation to every direction that the Secretary of State might make under new subsection (1) of new Section 124G of the Communications Act 2003 in Clause 10.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="10012662000212"></a>Imposing technical obligations is something a Secretary of State would decide only if he were sure it was the only way to deal with the problem of online copyright infringement and if the initial obligations have failed to deliver the expected results.

An assessment of whether technical obligations should be imposed will be informed by consultation of relevant groups, including consumers-there is an explicit assurance on that-which in this context includes subscribers. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, for example, expressed concern about that. Adding the phrase "consumer groups" does not add anything.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="10012662000213"></a>The amendment also calls for the addition of "the judiciary" to the list of those to be consulted.

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="10012662000077"></a>Finally, on Amendment 160, I explained in relation to the previous amendment why I think this is unnecessary. I accept entirely the need for consultation with consumers and consumer groups before any technical obligations are imposed, but the Bill already provides for that. I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Howard, who asked why we need paragraph (c). We believe that paragraph 4 provides the necessary detail.</p>

Amendment 161 tries to beef up paragraph (b). It looks at not just the efficacy of the technical measure-in other words whether it will bite-but also the proportionality and objective justification for it. It introduces something of the subscriber's point of view as well as considering the copyright owner's point of view that is in the current wording, to make sure that we are treating our citizens in a justified way. That is echoed in Amendment 166, which asks us to make sure that,</p>
<ul><a name="10012662000237"></a>"measures that OFCOM recommends are compatible with the Human Rights Act 1998, show due respect for the principle of presumption of innocence and the right to privacy, and guarantee a prior fair and impartial procedure".</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="10012662000081"></a>We have been over this track a bit and I hope that each time we revisit it we get closer to understanding what will really happen. I had a very helpful letter this morning from ACS:Law Solicitors which, combined with what the Ministers were saying on the last occasion we discussed this, leads me to a greater understanding of their reluctance to deal with the practices that  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1304"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ACS:Law Solicitors is pursuing. They expect these practices to become standard. They expect this to be the way that our citizens will be treated. If people fall foul of this Bill, they will have a couple of warning letters, but after that they will get a typical ACS:Law Solicitors standard letter saying, "Pay us £500 or we will take you to court". If they do not pay the £500, they will end up in court, there will be technical evidence against them, and they will have no ability to provide a technical defence. That is the difficulty that people faced with ACS:Law Solicitors have at the moment. There is this inequality of arms. They are in a civil court, with a 50:50 balance-of-probability judgment, and must contemplate risking thousands of pounds in mounting a defence when it is not easy to do that.</p>

<a name="100126-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="10012662000082"></a>We should think extremely carefully before we make it acceptable for mainstream copyright owners to pursue this sort of course because we have talked it through carefully and have sanctioned it in the Bill. This is not a comfortable or pleasant procedure for people. Thousands of people feel that they have been done in by ACS:Law Solicitors. They have been unjustly accused and are finding it extremely difficult to satisfy ACS:Law Solicitors that they are innocent. These things rarely seem to come to court. None the less, the process appears to be entirely within the recognised arrangements of the law, and there is as yet no sanction or judgment against the practice from the SRA or any other organisation. We must accept that tens of thousands of citizens are going through this experience at the moment, and that hundreds of thousands or a million or more citizens will do so once the Bill is passed. This is producing extreme worry and unhappiness because of the lack of ease in dealing with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="10012662000083"></a>As the Bill goes through Parliament, we really must decide what is proportionate and reasonable and how we balance the interests of copyright owners with our duty to our citizens to ensure that they are not put in fear and made to worry over something that they find extremely difficult to comprehend or defend themselves against. They have a deep feeling that they have been wronged because they know that they have not done what they are accused of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="10012662000084"></a>The Government have not got the balance right, and the amendments suggest how we might start to tackle this. Somewhere in the Bill there must be a real understanding of the need for balance between copyright owners and citizens and that this is not a matter of heinous and absolute liability, such as sticking a knife into a person. This can be done unawares and can be extremely difficult to tackle in court. I beg to move.</p>

We debated this at some length on the previous day in Committee, but I should point out to the Minister that, having put various statements on the record on that day, I was inundated with correspondence. The impression was that the Solicitors Regulation Authority had received no complaints about the activities of ACS:Law Solicitors, and, it now transpires, of Davenport Lyons. In fact, there has been a torrent of complaints to the SRA, and I sent the Minister an e-mail, which I hope he has received, setting out at some length the material that I have received.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="10012662000086"></a>This is clearly a matter of great importance. Just as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has said, some of these firms are using some extremely unjustified and unpleasant ways against perfectly innocent people. I hesitate to use the word "innocent", but in a sense they are because they have not breached copyright. What that makes them, I do not know, but certainly they have not been acting illegally or are guilty of any criminal offence. The SRA is apprised of the matter, although perhaps it is not moving fast enough. The Minister and his colleagues in the business department and the DCMS should be fully aware that this is a hot topic and that there have been complaints of professional misconduct against the firms involved.</p>

I speak as someone who, for the first time, has received a letter about ACS:Law Solicitors, which I found pretty disturbing, as I do the fact that ACS:Law Solicitors has up to six years to keep this correspondence hanging around. Even though the SRA has been contacted again, the matter does not seem to have moved on particularly fast. Of course, one is hearing only one side of the story, so I cannot say more than that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="10012662000088"></a>It is worrying and I assume that the Minister will address this issue seriously in his reply. I gather from the shaking of his head that he is aware of at least some of the complaints that have been coming in his direction.</p>

I have already mentioned briefly the cost of any measure and I should like to emphasise how important it is that proper scrutiny is given to the cost that will fall on internet service providers forced to implement the technology necessary to impose a technical measure.</p>

<a name="100126-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="10012662000090"></a>Amendment 163 touches on a point raised much earlier in these debates. If technical measures are imposed crudely and in large numbers, perfectly legitimate internet companies might suffer. I can easily imagine a company setting up a lawful file-sharing site, notwithstanding the implementation of Clauses 4 to 9. If a technical measure is imposed on large numbers of subscribers that bans access to any file-sharing sites, rather than just those that provide unlawful material, a promising alternative could be strangled at birth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="10012662000091"></a>Amendment 164 is self-explanatory. It seeks to tie the assessment under Clause 10 specifically to the progress reports under Clause 9. At the moment, one of the greatest weaknesses of these clauses is the lack of read-across from Clause 9 to Clause 10. This amendment would improve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="10012662000092"></a>Amendment 167 is essentially a summary of the points that have already been raised. I am sure that the Minister will be pleased to see that it is only a guideline for Ofcom to follow and not a prescriptive list. However, all the matters outlined in it are fundamental to whether a measure will be successful. The possibility that one

They must be there to guide Ofcom in its deliberations. My noble friend said that the copyright resides with the originators, but usually it does not. It is owned by six large rights holders-copyright holding companies-because they have the originators under contract from day one. Only a very small amount of money filters out to the creators the work. Most of it is rental on the back catalogue owned by large rights holders. We have to keep that in the back of our minds when we are told that this will kill creativity-it is not necessarily so.</p>

<a name="100126-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="10012662000095"></a>The main point I want to make is about the unintended consequences that may arise when we implement the technical measures and why Ofcom must take into account wider considerations The sort of thing that could happen is that a company sets up and sensibly wishes to deliver most of its stuff over the internet. It is selling into a market that also happens to coincide with people who have an age profile in the group that tends to download music-music being the easy one to catch as it is the most popular in this area. You could stop their market and bankrupt them overnight. It is a bit like secondary picketing by the trades unions: the same principle of trying to prevent one evil while actually creating another. The same applies to the Government in their delivery of services electronically to reduce costs to taxpayers. If we end up having to intervene to make this effective, by cutting off a tiny proportion of infringers, say 100,000, it could have an impact. If we tackled just 10 per cent of the infringers, which is not an enormous proportion, 700,000 people would be unable to use the internet properly. That is a significant part of the market.</p>

<a name="100126-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="10012662000096"></a>Funnily enough, it would probably also penalise those with good, innovative methods of distributing music and film. At the other end of these connections will be subscribers who both download to sample stuff unlawfully and buy stuff lawfully. So it may have an effect on the market that we should be developing. This needs to be considered incredibly carefully. A final thing is proportionality and the EU. The European Parliament, in saying that people's internet could be cut off only by going through judicial procedure, recognised that these days it is almost a basic human right to have access to the internet. Our legislation must be proportionate or it will fall foul of EU legislation. On those grounds alone, proportionality must be put in it somewhere.</p>

We in the copyright world call them investors. They supply the capital that makes the production of intellectual copyright possible. I have been following this Committee for several days, and for me, the elephant in the Chamber is the requirement to have capital markets with sufficient incentives and a clear, visible marketplace in which they can invest to ensure that the creative people can make products that we want and that we can circulate in the marketplace. I am afraid that it is nonsense to assume that we can allow the well to dry up by doing nothing or taking insufficient action on copyright abuse. Should we do so, investment will withdraw and eventually the entire creative process will dry up.</p>

Amendment 161 would add "proportionality" and "objective justification" to the assessment. While I have sympathy with the view that these are important criteria, I do not think it is necessary for Ofcom to do this because they are points that the Secretary of State will have to consider as part of the decision whether to make the order to impose technical obligations, and on what terms.</p>

<a name="100126-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="10012662000099"></a>On the other amendments in the group, new subsection (4) in Clause 10 sets out the steps that the Secretary of State might particularly direct Ofcom to carry out as part of conducting an assessment of whether technical obligations should be introduced, or taking steps to prepare for them. As such, it identifies the main things we consider it will be important should be done: proper consultation, an assessment of measures which would work and early preparation of a code. We are not suggesting that these are the only things that the Secretary of State might ask Ofcom to do as part of making an assessment, nor yet all the things that Ofcom would expect to include in an assessment in order to do it properly. I do not think it would be helpful to try to do that.</p>

<a name="100126-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="10012662000100"></a>There is also a risk of duplication here. For example, the issues raised in Amendments 162 and 163 are likely in any case to be captured under the existing reference to an assessment of efficacy. So while there might be much benefit in the Secretary of State asking Ofcom to consider these and other issues, I do not think that they need to appear in the legislation.

I am not sure whether I have fully understood the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. I thought he was welcoming the Bill in that our process might well be described as taking a graduated approach. In the first instance, people will be sent a letter saying, "It appears that there has been an infringement. If it has been done unwittingly or by someone else, here is what you can do to remedy the situation". We are laying down what I think is a proportionate, reasonable and fair procedure. We have to ensure that it is all reflected in the code and that we build in all the rights of appeal and so forth, as we have discussed in our debates here

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="10012662000102"></a>I stress that so far as we are aware, firms are operating within the existing legal framework, a point which to a certain extent was confirmed by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. It may not be a procedure that everybody likes, and in some cases I presume that people have been guilty of the offence, but we are saying that this Bill cannot be the vehicle to deal with it. As we have said, it provides a graduated response that seeks to change the culture and the behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="10012662000103"></a>I am glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, is with us at least in principle and thus is in favour of proper compensation-that is what we are trying to achieve. The noble Lord, Lord Howard, asked about the costs to internet service providers. We share his concern because this has to be something that they are capable of dealing with and does not undermine their normal operating procedures. The costs associated with any technical measure will therefore be the subject of a separate statutory instrument and a new or revised code. All this will be subject to scrutiny and I take entirely the noble Lord's point that we keep control of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="10012662000104"></a>The noble Lord also talked about a rush to implement necessary steps. We are not going to rush this, and I hope that a future amendment will demonstrate our response to concerns that sufficient time is provided to see whether the first set of technical measures has had an effect before contemplating the need for further ones. We shall come back to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="10012662000105"></a>I listened carefully to what the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, said about the law of unintended consequences, but I do not think that we are in any way likely to stop legal markets operating overnight. There was a presumption that, assuming we did catch 700,000 people in our first attempt, all of them will carry on with their misbehaviour-assuming that they are misbehaving. I do not take that view; I think that we will be able to change them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="10012662000106"></a>If we want to introduce some balance into this debate and an overall assessment about what we are trying to do, then I thank my noble friend Lord Puttnam for doing just that. These are not just minor infringements, and they apply not only to music, and as my noble friend Lord Puttnam knows, because films are also very much affected by them. I quoted a case the other day in which the film "Avatar", on the very day that it was released, was downloaded, including the 3D version. We should not kid ourselves that these are just minor downloads of the odd piece of music.</p>

I must say that it does matter. It does not matter that they managed to gross a profit on "Avatar": if we are serious about the principle of rewarding copyright owners for their investment, then we have to treat infringements seriously and we cannot dismiss them. I am afraid that we are never going to reach agreement on that perspective on copyright.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="10012662000109"></a>On the question of the telecom framework directive raised by the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, we believe that the provisions in the Bill are consistent with the final outcome of Amendment 138. That requires a fair and transparent prior process that allows the consumer the right to be heard. I have dealt with this issue on many occasions so I shall not take any more time. I hope that, in the light of the explanation and assurances that I have given, that the amendment can be withdrawn.</p>

It seems to me that the industry is being peculiarly stupid about it-it got 300,000 free advertisements. "Avatar" is something that you cannot consume sensibly on a small screen: you need the big-screen experience to appreciate all the work that they have put into it. The immediate consumption of it created an enormous demand for going to the cinema, which has benefited the film enormously. That is the fundament of this-we must get the industry to see this as an opportunity and not as a threat.</p>

<a name="100126-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="10012662000111"></a>We must get the industry to be in there selling these downloads. If the industry had been in there selling at a dollar a time, it would be better off for it and it would still get the advertising. Its refusal to deal with the way that the world has moved on and with what technology makes possible, and its attempt to stick to old ways of doing things and to the idea that you can release a film in the United States today and wait six months to release it in the UK, is a looking-backwards attitude which we should not support through legislation. Yes, we should support copyright, but we should direct ourselves at real losses and not imagined losses. I do not believe that the makers of "Avatar" have lost a dollar; in fact, I think that they have gained a great deal from the piracy. We should not seek to punish people for losses that have not occurred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="10012662000112"></a>When we come back to the question of what is going to happen on the Bill, after what I agree are shaping up to be quite reasonable preliminary procedures, we must have something to make sure that Norwich Pharmacal orders are not given, willy-nilly, to people who have not gone through this procedure. We have produced some comfort for the citizen in the Bill; we must at least make sure that judges consider whether or not this procedure should be used before Norwich Pharmacal orders are granted.</p>

<a name="100126-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="10012662000113"></a>We must also do something about the quantum of damages that is being sought. In a civil procedure on a technical matter, it amounts to blackmail; the cost of defending one of these things is reckoned to be £10,000. You can get away with asking for £500 or £1,000 and be paid on most occasions without any effort having to be made to really establish guilt. It is straightforward legal blackmail, and we should do

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="10012662000119"></a>In the course of our debates, the Minister has reassured us that the technical measures will not be imposed without demonstrable failure of the initial obligations and that there will be a graded response. The question is: what will be the empirical evidence that the initial steps have failed to cure what is clearly an issue? I am not at all at odds with what the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, had to say in that respect. We wish to see the proper upholding of copyright, but it has to be done-to use the word that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has almost but not quite resiled from-in a "proportionate" way.</p>

It should be done on the basis of a proper report by Ofcom, whether a regular report or a special report. That applies to both Clause 10 and Clause 11.</p>

<a name="100126-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="10012662000121"></a>I hope that the Government will look again at this aspect because, in order to create confidence, technical measures are an important step. As we know, and to repeat what I said earlier, they have caused a great deal of controversy, but if they are to be introduced then that must be on the basis of proper evidence that the steps taken to date have been a failure. The only institution that will carry confidence and will be regarded as being sufficiently objective in those circumstances is Ofcom. That is the reason for Amendments 168 and 174. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="100126-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="10012662000123"></a>Amendment 172 is intended to make sure that the industry has looked after its side of the bargain. In return for passing this Bill, we should be requiring that the industry moves ahead and makes product easily available on the internet in proper volume, at a proper price. Its failure to do this is the reason for the whole problem. This market developed and the industry refused to address it-it turned its back on it. People, particularly young people, said, "We are not having that. If they will not give us this stuff in the way that we want it we are going to get it". I have an enormous amount of sympathy with that. I agree that we must tackle the problem and deal with the piracy that has developed, but we should not allow the industry to continue to create the conditions where piracy flourishes. We should not allow it to continue to encourage people into piracy because it will not provide its product in the way and at the time that people want it.</p>

<a name="100126-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="10012662000124"></a>Certainly, people ought to be able to hold product back: I am not at all saying that someone who comes up with something which is not public should be protected in some way. But at the moment the industry is refusing to license additional outlets for the internet availability of music, and although the wholesale price of a music track is somewhere around 20p-not the retail price, of course, the wholesale price-it is trying to run vastly inflated prices on new entrants trying to come into the market and compete with iTunes. That is pure monopoly behaviour and we are creating the monopoly for the industry in this Bill. We are giving it additional defences. We must require that the industry, as well as ourselves, address the problem, or else it will merely occur in another and more difficult form.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="10012662000125"></a>We already know that there are technical ways around this Bill-that is why Clause 17 is sitting in there, not that I think it is satisfactory. We already know that people will use cyberlockers or encryption. The only answer to this is to make sure that the industry keeps its side of the bargain and makes product easily available at a sensible price so that people do not have to go down the piracy route, and so that they do not go down this route because they cannot get at the stuff that they want, but because they do not want to pay the proper price for it. Under those circumstances the sanctions we have in this Bill

However, if the industry refuses to make product available-"Avatar" is a very good example of a refusal to make product available when customers want it-why should we defend it? It does not seem to be part of the copyright bargain that we should allow that.</p>

<a name="100126-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="10012662000127"></a>I am not entirely comfortable with Amendment 168 and its suggestion of giving Ofcom such an explicit advisory role. I agree entirely that Ofcom is well-placed to make an accurate assessment as to the efficacy of any, or a particular, measure, and I agree with my noble friend's Amendment 172 that the wider market should be taken into account. However, there is an important difference between setting out the pros and cons of a step in an impartial manner, and actively seeking to influence government policy. Ofcom should participate enthusiastically in the former but stay well away from the latter.</p>

<a name="100126-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="10012662000128"></a>My Amendment 171 would impose a level of parliamentary scrutiny on the process. The Minister has accepted the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee's report on the standard of parliamentary scrutiny that would be appropriate for a Clause 11 order. My amendment seeks to ensure that Parliament will be properly informed when debating the order.</p>

<a name="100126-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="10012662000129"></a>It is unavoidable that there will be considerable controversy over the imposition of technical measures. We have all received arguments and counterarguments over the past few weeks from internet service providers, copyright owners, other online companies and subscriber groups in relation to Clauses 4 to 9. It will be no different if Clauses 10 to 16 are ever implemented.</p>

<a name="100126-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="10012662000130"></a>An impartial assessment of the measures being discussed will be an invaluable tool for weighing up these arguments. The Minister will surely appreciate how continuing uncertainty over the actual cost of implementing the earlier provisions has complicated debates on the apportionment of costs. In just the same way, ensuring that Parliament is fully informed with the best available data will help to ensure that scrutiny is effective.</p>

<a name="100126-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="10012662000133"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, about the need for empirical evidence. However, his language was a little hyperbolic when he talked about the Secretary of State making a decision on a whim. We will not allow that. We have made it clear that this matter will require an affirmative resolution. We understand the importance of ensuring that we have the right evidence and of giving ourselves the opportunity to see whether the obligations change the climate sufficiently as to remove the need for the technical measure. There is no debate between us on this. I keep reiterating these assurances, mainly because I understand the concern that has been expressed, and because I hope that they will be accepted. The noble Lord, Lord Howard, expressed a similar concern in relation to the Secretary of State. I again point out that we are talking about an affirmative resolution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="10012662000134"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, talked about product availability. Of course, there are products out there. We will certainly not create a monopoly. Again, that is hyperbole. ITunes is not the only provider; there is Spotify and plenty of other examples. I am sure that the market will continue to expand. However, I am still puzzled by the fact that the noble Lord and the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, seem to believe that somehow it is perfectly okay for illegal downloads to take place. I do not share that view. I shall not mention the A-word again because we have had far too much debate on that, but I do not understand why we should be happy for people to go into cinemas with camcorders and illicitly download material, and why we should wish to protect that.

<a name="100126-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="10012662000137"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Howard, that I have a lot of sympathy with Amendment 171. The assessments that Ofcom carries out will clearly be of significance in the Secretary of State's decision whether technical obligations should be imposed on internet service providers. They will be of interest to both Houses of Parliament and more widely. I also take the point that he makes about the apportionment of costs. We gave an indication of that, but it is not set in stone. We understand the importance of this.</p>

<a name="100126-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="10012662000138"></a>On Amendment 168, there may be a need to ensure that confidential or other sensitive information is protected. I suggest that this is something that we should take away and consider.</p>

<a name="100126-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="10012662000139"></a>On Amendment 173, I do not think that this is a responsibility that Ofcom should take on. Imposing technical obligations would be a serious matter and likely to be controversial. I again agree with the assessment made by the noble Lord, Lord Howard-I am fearful of this concurrence, but when it is right, it is right-that such a decision should be taken by a Minister rather than delegated to the regulator, as the decision is one for which the Minister can be held to account. It is significantly quicker for a Secretary of State to reach a decision and act through an order subject to the affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="100126-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="10012662000140"></a>As for Amendments 174 and 174A, there is no doubt that the report produced by Ofcom will be highly relevant to the decision on whether to impose technical obligations. However, I do not think that we should allow the Secretary of State to consider only Ofcom's assessment. He must have the ability to consider other factors, such as initiatives emerging at a European level. I also understand the wish for the decision to be taken on the basis of assessments from Ofcom. However, Amendment 174A might weaken the wording, as "following" merely suggests a sequence of events.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="10012662000141"></a>I understand what noble Lords are seeking to achieve, but on balance there is more to be said for keeping a degree of freedom for the Secretary of State-at the same as he is accountable to Parliament through affirmative resolution-to take the full range of considerations into account when recommending an important decision, which should remain his responsibility. On the basis of that explanation, I trust that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We are all trying to produce a system that gets copyright owners, of whom I am one, a proper return for the product that is sold over the internet, of which I do a good deal.

If we support the industry in its backwards-facing approach, we will merely get the illegal downloaders adopting methods to which the only solution is deep packet inspection. That essentially means that we will allow officialdom to see our entire internet traffic. I do not think that that is what the Government intend or what any of us would find acceptable, particularly as a measure just to protect copyright. Protecting copyright to the extent that the law requires it must be in the context that the industry is doing its bit, too.</p>

<a name="100126-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="10012662000144"></a>I shall take the approach that protecting my own copyrights is best done by enhancing the user's experience, whereby cheating and copying will result in a less fulfilling experience than paying the price that I am asking. It is perfectly possible for the industry to do that; indeed, parts of it are doing that. Regarding those who need only copyright protection, we should not continue to refuse to make material available. I return to the example that the noble Lord gave about "Avatar". As soon as there is a buzz out there about a film, people want to see what it is about, have something to satisfy that curiosity, know what they should be going to and be part of this great experience-although they have not yet been to the cinema. We should require the industry to deal properly with its customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="10012662000147"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, mentioned the report of the Communications Committee of this House. It was a very good report, which was given considerable coverage, but none of us is unaware of the need for better copyright protection. The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, made a perfectly apposite point that further amendments to protect copyright need to be made. Many of them relate not to codes or the civil law but to the criminal law. The recent OiNK case is probably an illustration of that. The use of camcorders is another area where the criminal law could be brought to bear. However, the Government have shied away from inserting such provisions in the Bill. It will be interesting to see whether they will introduce them in the future, or whether any future Government will do so. Such provisions will be the real heavy artillery for the protection of copyright.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="10012662000222"></a>"Internet service providers must give OFCOM any assistance that OFCOM reasonably require for the purposes of complying with any direction under this section".</p>

<p><a name="10012662000214"></a>That seems to impose a very broad duty. It would be useful to hear how the Minister believes that will operate and the kinds of duties and liabilities that it will impose on ISPs in the circumstances. I beg to move.</p>

Although ISPs have the major role to play, copyright owners have a crucial role to play, too. It is they who generate the evidence on which the whole process is based. How they do that, the methods and technicalities of the systems that they are using and the quality of the evidence that they are generating are an enormously important part of moving to a system where the justice is more summary than that which is available through the civil courts. It seems to me that they cannot black-box this stuff; they cannot say, "This evidence is true but we aren't going to tell you how we got it". They have to disclose to Ofcom the exact methods that they are using and they have to expose those methods to a critical analysis, so that Ofcom can be sure that that part of the process is working well enough to justify the rest of the process. I think, therefore, that they should be included in this clause.</p>

We have to be balanced. If we are going to require certain things of the ISPs, then the other side-or the other party involved-must also have the duty to provide them, otherwise the process is hugely imbalanced. I take this opportunity to say to the Minister that this is not a "them and us" situation. One is not trying to be against the copyright holders.

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="10012662000152"></a>These last three groups of amendments have been about trying to ensure that Ofcom and the Secretary of State have sufficient information to make a properly balanced decision. The challenge on the first group was that the Minister said, "You don't need Ofcom to have this information because the Secretary of State will take it into consideration after he sees the report". On the second group, we heard that Ofcom was going

<a name="100126-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="10012662000153"></a>The Minister should take all this back and think about what will inform the decision of the Secretary of State to go further into the technical measures. It is when the technical measures start getting implemented that whichever Government are in charge will have a huge outcry from the general populous. If widespread technical measures are put in place, businesses will react and possibly relocate out of the UK and there will be huge effects on the market. If that does not happen, then all well and good, but I would rather look on the gloomy side than say, "We just hope people will respond".</p>

<a name="100126-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="10012662000154"></a>We have to work out whether Ofcom will produce a complete report, in which case we need the provisions of the earlier amendments, or whether it will be the Secretary of State, in which case we can downplay the importance of the Ofcom report. Either way, Amendment 170 is essential for us at least to get balance at this stage in this requirement.</p>

For example, as we have discussed, one measure that a subscriber might take to prevent another person from breaching copyright on his account would be to block sites known to provide unlawful material. It would not be inconceivable that a technical obligation might consist of a list of similar sites that the internet service providers must block to certain subscribers. If this is the case, the copyright owners would be a useful resource to keep an up-to-date list of websites that qualify for blocking.</p>

We have already discussed a wide range of issues that the Secretary of State might want Ofcom to look at in any assessment under Clause 10. It seems self-evident that on a great number of them, in particular those involving the cost of operating technical measures and the ability of the ISPs to impose specific obligations, Ofcom will require help and information from ISPs. We therefore believe that new subsection (5) in Clause 10 is a very important provision. I disagree with the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that it could be deleted. If Ofcom were not able call on ISPs to provide information in this context, there is a risk that any Ofcom assessment under Clause 10 would be lacking in vital information and could lead to the wrong conclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="10012662000158"></a>From the perspective of Amendment 170, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, nothing on the long list of things that noble Lords have drawn to our attention as needing consideration in these assessments would require technical or commercial information from copyright owners. If we are wrong and it transpires that some do, Ofcom will have the power to require it under Section 135 of the Communications Act by virtue of the amendment to the Act in Clause 16(2).</p>

Certainly in his response he did not list anything. I asked what kind of assistance would be required and what kinds of liabilities would be undertaken by the ISPs, but I did not receive any answer.

They raise a number of points so, while being as brief as I can, I shall try to set out my concerns as clearly as possible.</p>

<a name="100126-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="10012662000171"></a>Amendment 175 was intended to highlight the fact that by allowing paragraph (a) or (b) to provide justification for the imposition of technical obligations, the Bill in fact allows the Secretary of State to avoid any assessment by Ofcom. This is clearly not desirable. I hope that the Minister will agree with me that it would be irresponsible to impose such potentially drastic demands on ISPs without a proper assessment. No order should be made under this section without Ofcom being asked to undertake that necessary preparation. Unfortunately, Amendment 175 is not sufficient as currently drafted and I apologise for this. Since putting it down, I have realised that the phrasing,</p>
<ul><a name="10012662000238"></a>"assessment carried out or steps taken",</ul>
<p><a name="10012662000215"></a>would allow once again for no assessment to be undertaken. Indeed it seems possible for the Secretary of State to direct Ofcom to start the necessary steps under new Section 124G and then to use that direction as the reason why an order needs to be made under new 124H. Surely this is not the Government's intention, so we look forward to the Minister's explanation.</p>

<a name="100126-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="10012662000172"></a>Amendment 176 is very much a probing amendment, I hope that the Minister will be able to give us rather more detail about the intention behind paragraph (b). By putting down this amendment I do not mean that I am entirely opposed to the inclusion of a similar paragraph. After all, the Secretary of State should be able to take into consideration any relevant circumstances that might not be covered by an assessment. However, as drafted, this paragraph makes the entire section completely meaningless. At the very least, the section surely needs to be tightened up to ensure that an assessment is not merely an option but must be undertaken before an order is made. Furthermore, I think it would be extremely helpful if the possible circumstances that might be considered relevant, but which would fall outside an assessment, were made clear. I beg to move.</p>

On the face of it, this is not an unreasonable thing to require the Secretary of State to do. It would ensure that an assessment of steps by Ofcom would have to be taken into account by the Secretary of State, as well as whatever else seems most pertinent to him when deciding on the appropriateness of requiring technical obligations to be imposed. In practice, the Secretary of State is always likely to want to have had a report from Ofcom before making such an order, and therefore we are willing to agree to consider this change.</p>

I do not think that it would be at all sensible to circumscribe the Secretary of State in this way. Inevitably-I think the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, acknowledged this in his contribution-there are going to be wider societal or macro-economic factors or, for example, developments in Europe, that a Secretary of State is going to want to take into account.

I do not know how much the context inside the Communications Act matters to the interpretation in the courts. New Section 124H(1) states:</p>

<p><a name="10012662000216"></a>because the provision contains an "or". We must be very careful that we do not leave it as "any consideration" -I do not see that it is related to anything to do with copyright, even. I have no idea whether the context of new Section 124G means that it must be restricted to issues of copyright and copyright infringement, or whether the Secretary of State could use it for any purpose he liked-because he did not like someone's face, or whatever. I am being ridiculous and extreme there. I am very worried that we might inadvertently give a huge power to the Secretary of State. I know that it is very easy to make mistakes like that in law.</p>

The Government have already made certain concessions on the process to be adopted for technical measures in their response to the Delegated Powers Committee, but I do not think that they have done so on the matter covered by my Amendment 177. We believe that a chance must be given for the initial obligations code to bed down before any new measures are adopted. Earlier, we tabled an amendment about waiting until Ofcom had issued its first annual report. This is very similar in import. I should be interested to hear what assurances the Minister can give. We certainly do not believe that it would be appropriate to act hastily in this respect. It would be an extraordinary set of circumstances for the situation to have got so bad that the Government felt that they had to introduce technical measures within a year. A year and then an assessment seems about right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="10012662000184"></a>As regards Amendment 180, one of the key issues is how such a code should be introduced. This is simply an attempt to ensure that consultation takes place and that the affirmative process is used in those circumstances. We have not put on all the knobs, bells and whistles that the Government have put on to Clause 17, which forms a useful precedent for anybody wishing to make sure that an order is virtually unpassable. This is a rather modest amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="10012662000187"></a>I will start with Amendment 177. I listened with interest to the concerns of the Committee last week that this part of the Bill is unclear about the order in which actions should happen and the timescales involved. I recognise that there are genuine concerns in this area. I have always made it clear that the Government intend to introduce technical obligations only if the initial obligations do not work. I agree, however, that it would be helpful to provide more clarity on the face of the Bill about the intention that technical obligations should not be introduced unless or until the initial obligations have been tried and found not to be sufficiently effective. For this reason it is our intention to propose, on Report, an amendment to Clause 11 to require a minimum period of 12 months following the coming into force of an initial obligations code before an order imposing technical obligations may be made. I hope that this will meet the concerns of the noble Lord and others with similar concerns that this will not be a rush to judgment. There will be a decent period of time; as I have said, our proposal is to have a period of 12 months following the coming into force of an initial obligations code on which there will be a consultative process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="10012662000189"></a>Turning finally to Amendment 180, we discussed last week an amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Mandelson to ensure that an order under this section is to be made by the affirmative procedure.

It is short, simple and to the point, as opposed to Amendment 182, which is rather tortuous. We do not know what the effect of the powers will be. The pressure on parliamentary time can be incredible, and the three-year point is the stage at which Governments think of the next election and busily try to bolster their credibility with the public, so it may not be the best time to revisit something that is not working terribly well. The amendment would be a very good way of forcing the Government to revisit this. I think that the power is more draconian than the Minister does, but let us think of the worst picture. A sunset clause would be a good idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="10012662000196"></a>My noble friend's amendment is rather more detailed. It has the advantage of allowing the rapid renewal of an order to ensure that there is no break in its effect, while still ensuring proper ongoing assessment and scrutiny. I am sure noble Lords will also have noted the inconsistency between the detailed and almost excessive assessment of the impact of Clauses 4 to 8, as laid out in Clause 9, and the complete lack of any such reporting duty on the technical measures. We would not want to insist on three-monthly reports in perpetuity, as Clause 9 does, but some level of reporting is essential.</p>

I am very happy to speak to Amendment 182, which is very interesting, and we can see the logic of what it proposes. However, while I suspect that in practice we will look at time limits, or at least review the continuing relevance and necessity of the measures, we do not think that it would be a good idea to set this in stone in the legislation. A shorter period may be preferable, and, while that would not be precluded by the amendment, it is inevitable that a time limit that is set in legislation becomes the default setting.</p>

In the same way that we do not think it is right to restrict the initial decision to an assessment by Ofcom, we do not think that it should apply here. In practice, the view of the regulator will have force, but it should not be the sole arbiter of whether technical measures are needed, and I doubt very much whether Ofcom would wish to be put in that position.

A similar argument holds for the division of costs. If the Minister disagrees, I should be interested in his reasoning: infringement reports and technical measures are imposed on a subscriber on the basis of allegations made by a copyright holder and are implemented by an internet service provider. If anything, the appeal process should be tilted more in favour of the subscriber because of the more serious consequences of having technical measures imposed.</p>

But if he does not accept this amendment, I hope that he will give us an example of when it would not be absolutely necessary to include these measures in a code.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="10012662000204"></a>My amendment probes a little further the question of whether a technical measure stands while an appeal is ongoing. It is our view that a technical measure should not be imposed until all avenues for appeal and objection have been exhausted. After all, a technical measure will have a significant impact on a subscriber and, if the measure is proved not to have been justified, it will be time-consuming, and possibly expensive, to compensate for the unjustified impact.</p>

<a name="100126-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="10012662000205"></a>Of course, there is the view that delaying the technical measure while a protracted appeal case is concluded merely allows for more copyright infringement, but if ever there was an incentive to establish a low-cost, effective and, above all, rapid appeal system, this is it. By postponing technical measures until the appeal system is over, an efficient system is to everyone's benefit.</p>

There could be a huge knock-on effect and it could bankrupt a small business. People are compensated for wrongful arrest and I would treat this situation in the same way.

I appreciate the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and other noble Lords, have expressed concern in previous Committee sittings that the Bill does not contain enough detail on the appeals mechanism and the protection that the subscriber should have. It is our intention to think hard about providing greater clarity on how the appeals mechanisms will work in relation both to the technical measures and the initial measures, the defences that the subscribers may rely on and how they can bring evidence to defend themselves. Those points have justifiably been raised previously. I cannot promise changes to the Bill, although they may be necessary, but I very much take the noble Lord's point that we need to think further about this, so we will be returning to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="10012662000210"></a>I am not so happy to agree to Amendment 191, but I can bring good news on Amendment 193, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Howard. We are prepared to consider it and I am happy to confirm here in Committee that it is the Government's intention that the full appeals process should be completed before any technical measure is imposed. Since it goes with the grain of the Government's thinking, perhaps we can take the amendment away and consider it further. I hope in the light of these explanations the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

In another part of the Bill we discussed the whole area of wi-fi and library services. The Minister was very clear, eventually, in saying which side of the line libraries and wi-fi providers fell. I do not wish to prolong the agony of that debate unduly because we have dealt with the principles involved to a large extent, but there is considerable dismay particularly among cultural and educational institutions that they will fall on that side of the line. Many of them feel that they will have to rethink on whether they can continue to provide these kinds of services to students and so on. The Minister has been saying pretty consistently that they will have to take responsibility for all illegal downloading of those who use their service. That is a heavy responsibility for those institutions.</p>

<a name="100126-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="10012671000002"></a>The two amendments have a similar purpose, as did the previous amendments relating to the initial obligations code. I do not know whether the Minister has had time to reflect on these matters, but it seems extraordinary that we will be placing such a burden on these institutions. I heard what the Minister said about the kinds of things they could do in terms of installing software and so on, but this is not the family home. We are talking about university colleges and the young people who use the services are free agents. I hope that the Minister will think again about this. Certainly the correspondence that I have received since these debates began has been considerable. The cultural and educational sectors are very concerned about these matters.</p>

What is not in this amendment, but probably should be, is the position of local authorities providing free wi-fi as a public service, which is extremely useful in the modern digital world. The Minister might want to consider that before the next stage-indeed, I am sure that he will do so.</p>

It is quite right that libraries and educational establishments might have particular conflicts between their founding principles of allowing users access to as broad a selection of material as possible and the Government's desire that none of those users should ever abuse the service. It is only common sense to require the Secretary of State to have regard to these difficulties when imposing a technical measure.</p>

<a name="100126-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="10012671000007"></a>Indeed, having regard to the feasibility of an order should be a concern across the board. Educational establishments might have difficulties with their principles, but other organisations might have difficulties on purely practical grounds. If a local shop is providing free wireless access, something that is of great benefit to the public, there is a limit to how effective any preventive measures they take will be, and there are some very technically expert people out there. It would be quite unreasonable to expect every service provider to counter every attempt to infringe copyright through their service.</p>

As I have said, but it bears repeating, we value highly the service that such bodies provide in the community, but we think that so long as they take pragmatic and proportionate measures to protect their systems and deter copyright infringement, they have nothing to worry about. I do not agree that we should make them a special case within the legislation, or that their position makes them particularly deserving of special treatment within the technical obligations code over and above more commercial networks or, indeed, the position of the general public. I simply do not believe that a university or a library either should or would want to give people free rein to act unlawfully simply because the institution serves a cultural or educational purpose. That must be wrong.</p>

<a name="100126-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="10012671000009"></a>I also cannot accept the point about young people made by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. I do not want to paraphrase him, but I think he referred to young people as "free agents". They might be free agents in many respects, but not when they enter the library and not when they participate in the university system. There are codes of behaviour that they have to accept. What we are discussing, in ensuring that they do so, is how libraries and universities can take what we would consider to be reasonable and proportionate measures.</p>

<a name="100126-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="10012671000010"></a>Amendment 196 goes further and would allow anyone using anyone else's connection with or without their permission to infringe copyright with impunity. That does not stand up to scrutiny. It is only right that people should be expected to take responsibility for what happens via the connection they pay for, which almost invariably would be provided under contract with a prohibition on using the service or allowing it to be used for unlawful purposes.</p>

<a name="100126-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="10012671000011"></a>I want to try to address the question of libraries and universities, so I shall read certain points into the record. We should consider how libraries currently

Where library internet access is offered on fixed machines, those machines would not have peer-to-peer software and are set up to block attempted downloads and installation of the software. For fixed library terminals, it is therefore unlikely that they would or could be used for peer-to-peer copyright infringement. Furthermore, library networks have firewalls which do not allow access to a number of sites, such as those containing Flash technology. These firewalls are generally for security rather than file-sharing reasons. In addition, libraries will have a filter system which should block access to known illegal sites. Obviously this is not a foolproof option since it would depend on the sites blocked.</p>

<a name="100126-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="10012671000012"></a>In common with commercial services, all library services should have a conditions-of-use policy which users have to agree to before getting access to the network. This will state that, for example, no unlawful activity including copyright infringement is permitted. Policy usually stipulates that legal liability for unlawful activities sits with the individual, not the library service.</p>

The situation in universities is more complex than in libraries, not least because, generally speaking, they need and operate networks with much higher bandwidth. In principle, we do not see any problem in adopting the same approach as outlined for libraries, but we are currently involved in discussions with JANET, the UK's education and research network, and some educational establishments on how their networks operate and the actions they currently take.</p>

As the Minister has said that he does not think that universities merit an entirely different approach, have he and his department explored whether there is a way of framing the clause so that a different approach could be taken, or will he explore that before Report? I did not hear him say either of those things.</p>

Unless there is an answer to this, it might clash with the Government's commitment to provide broadband internet to all areas. There may very well be rural areas where the only way to provide broadband is to provide a wireless point and then have the rest of the community picking up that free wireless

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="10012671000018"></a>There are reasonable steps that institutions such as libraries can take on wireless connection to make it harder for people to access and use peer-to-peer sites and software. We do not pretend that such measures are 100 per cent effective and we do not require this. It is more a case of ensuring that the would-be infringer has to make a conscious decision and some effort to continue to infringe. We have written a letter in which we set out the types of measures that we would deem "reasonable". I do not know whether everybody has seen that letter, but we have made it available.</p>

We are making some progress. The Minister's reply was a deal more informative than it was last time. There is still a problem with the boundary being set where it has been placed, but if the Minister is saying that duties are going to be different depending on the ability of the subscriber to control the activities of the individuals using the service, then we are making some progress.

It will be so ad hoc that it will be impossible for the administrators of these services to gauge whether what they are doing is reasonable in those circumstances. That is what worries me; this will be a precautionary block on the expansion of these services, particularly the kind of municipal service that the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, talked about.

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="10012671000026"></a>I declare my chairmanship of Consumer Focus. My concern here is for the consumers of digital services and the process that this whole part of the Bill will put them through. My noble friend will know that I fundamentally disagree with the approach that the Government are taking in this respect. If the issue of the user abusing the system were classified as theft under the criminal law, the user would have to be taken to court and normal court procedures would apply. If it were a civil wrong, as indeed this is under copyright law, the proper process of righting that wrong against the abuse by a user would be through the civil courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="10012671000027"></a>My main reason for tabling these amendments is that they would effectively delete the right of the system administrator to require ISPs to impose technical measures, subject to an appeals process, and substitute something that is closer to the normal process when a wrong is alleged through our legal system. That is to say that technical measures-sanctions-would not be applied until the courts system had agreed that they should be applied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="10012671000028"></a>I have never denied that there are rights accruing to the rights holders and that some process is needed in order that those rights are recognised.

<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="10012671000029"></a>What I really want on record from the Government, and what I still do not understand about the attitude of the Government and the industry, is why the normal rule of law cannot apply to this form of copyright infringement, whereas it does apply to all other forms of copyright infringement. If somebody is complaining about a breach of patent, for example, they go to the courts. I want a clearer explanation from the Government of why that should not apply in this case. If we are to take this forward, we need that on the record and we need to know whether public opinion is prepared to accept it. There are serious problems at the point where this comes to be imposed, particularly if it is imposed against individuals rather than, as I would accept was necessary, against people who are making serious commercial money out of this process. I think that the Government will be faced with a serious backlash. I say to the opposition Bench that that may be an alternative Government, so all three Front Benches should take note of the politics of this. Part of the backlash will be about the fact that due or normal process has not been observed.</p>

He has eloquently explained it and asked the Minister why there is not due process in the case of the digital economy approach that this Bill sets out. Everything that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has said underlines the glaring omission from this Bill of any rights given to users of the digital economy-the citizens. The Government could have chosen to draft a clause setting out the rights of internet users, because the digital economy should bring lots of rights to those who use it. Among those would be the right to have all the ways that fraud can take place on the internet explained. We have discussed that issue in the context of cybersecurity: people are not given good guidance about online security. Starting from that, there should be a whole hierarchy of rights that people should be given in this Bill but which are missing from it. It would be helpful if the Government were able to draft a clause like that, ready for Report, to insert the rights of citizens using the internet. Some of that would encapsulate the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty.</p>

<a name="10012671000033"></a><b><a name="100126-0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10012671000125"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> These amendments essentially propose that there should be a judicial ruling before any action under the technical obligations is taken. We of course accept the need to ensure that people's rights are protected, but we believe that the appeals arrangements in the Bill do this. In practice, this means ensuring that the process is based on very firm evidence-I have previously stressed the point about having a clear audit trail-and that there is a clear and accessible way for subscribers to appeal, should they feel that they have been identified wrongly.</p>

<a name="100126-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="10012671000034"></a>I stress for the benefit of my noble friend Lord Whitty, whom I am pleased to see back in the Chamber, that I have already confirmed that it is our intention that the full appeals process should be exhausted before any technical measures are imposed on a subscriber-that was one of his major concerns, and I give him an explicit assurance on it. That means that, if a subscriber considers that the measure should not be applied and chooses to appeal, they will have the opportunity to have the appeal heard by a First-tier Tribunal, which is a judicial body, before a technical measure is imposed. Given those rights that we have identified, the fact that the appeals process has to be exhausted before any measure is applied and the fact that the appeal will be heard by a First-tier Tribunal, which is a judicial body, I do not believe that there will be a backlash. I say to my noble friend that the whole process is about ensuring that we educate and change behaviour before we arrive at that point. We have talked about the initial letters bringing people's attention to obligations of which they may not be aware.</p>

<a name="100126-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="10012671000035"></a>I shall see what I can do to assuage the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, in relation to explaining online security measures to subscribers. I do not think that that is captured in the code at present, but it is clear that we want it to be part of what accompanies the initial obligations in the first letter. As regards the point that my noble friend Lord Whitty made about a court hearing, there is a real danger of moving more people into the courts system than we need to if we take that road. We want a fair, open and transparent process. We do not want to impose any technical measures until we know whether the initial obligations about which we have talked will succeed or fail. In the event that they fail, we want to ensure that, as I said, we exhaust the appeals procedure and keep people out of the courts.</p>

<a name="100126-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="10012671000036"></a>I know that this is a measure that my noble friend Lord Whitty considers to be fundamental, but I do not think that it is appropriate or practical. On the surface, requiring a court to make the decision whether or not to apply technical measures may seem a reasonable safeguard for consumer interests; certainly we have a duty to ensure that the position of the ordinary subscriber is properly protected. However, in practice, we believe that this would be slow, cumbersome and expensive,  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1335"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1335</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>causing unacceptable delay when speed is needed, and probably causing additional stress to subscribers-after all, a court ruling is no small thing. It would also risk putting a burden on the courts. We believe that we have established a procedure that is open, transparent and fair. It ensures that the full appeals process is exhausted before any technical measures are imposed on a subscriber and that, when they make their appeal, it is heard by a First-tier Tribunal, which is a judicial body, before any technical measure is imposed. Although we may not agree on this, I trust that, in the light of my explanation, my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

He referred to the costs of going to a court of law being expensive, which I would have thought is a very accurate comment. Are we right to assume that, before that point is reached, the Bill provides for an adequate place where a defendant, if you like, can raise the whole issue and have what he has to say taken into consideration without having to pay vast amounts? That is important at that stage.</p>

We have been down this road before but it is worthy of a quick repetition. We have said that we do not want to deter people from making an appeal. There should be a fee but it should not be a deterrent fee. It should deter frivolous appeals. If appeals are successful, the fee should be refundable. It would be a lot less in our view than involving the courts in the process.</p>

My understanding is that we will still have the first stage of the old regime. In other words, when a subscriber first trips over the threshold, they will receive the explanatory warning letter, which is contained in the first sections. It is only when they commit a subsequent infringement that they will be into the technical measures section. Technical measures are not part of the first notice that a subscriber receives.</p>

<a name="100126-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="10012671000040"></a>The noble Lords talks about the appeal process being exhausted. Does that mean that, if the appeal has failed, technical measures will be imposed or that, from that point on, technical measures can be imposed? As I understand it, it is the first of those. I also want to ask whether the Minister has thought any further about what assistance will be given to citizens in terms of the technical aspects of their defence in front of a tribunal. How will they be assisted to show that their computer contains no infringing material or that their network has not been used in ways that are inappropriate? I will understand if the Minister has nothing further to say, but if he has something further to say, it would be helpful.</p>

We are clear about that. In those initial letters, we will be advising people of the security measures that they can take. We have debated whether it would be a reasonable defence in an appeal if they validate that they have taken those measures. In our view it would be. I do not think that I can give a more detailed explanation at this juncture. I hope that, in the light of my explanation, the amendment can be withdrawn.</p>

There are some principles involved here. The Government have to take on board the fact that the users have no rights under this Bill. If the Government were prepared to engage and alter copyright law, possibly even using Clause 17, which we shall be debating in a minute, to create a fair-use clause in copyright law in this country-such a defence exists, albeit not in an entirely satisfactory form, in United States law-the consumer would clearly have some protection. At the moment, all the rights are on the part of the copyright holder. The obligations are on the ISP, with some protections, and there are no rights for the user. Normally, those rights would have been protected by the courts, but instead we are inventing a new tribunal system, which my noble friend says is judicial. In almost all other circumstances, the court would be used for that process; enforcers go to a court to obtain a sanction for their moves to be imposed. I still do not believe that there is a clear case for having a judicial process separate to what applies in all other forms of copyright law.</p>

<a name="100126-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="10012671000043"></a>I accept where the Government are, but essentially the balance in the Bill does not give any rights to the user. As the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, said, the Bill does not even indicate how subscribers can protect themselves with what would be regarded as a reasonable defence. The balance is almost entirely on the side of the copyright holder. I am not convinced that this is the right approach, as my noble friend knows. If the Government persist in their approach, they need to explain it better and much more clearly.</p>

<a name="100126-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="10012671000044"></a>My noble friend denies that there would be a backlash. Without a more balanced Bill, there will be a backlash. I remind leaders of political parties, so far as they are represented in this House, that in the Swedish elections after the piracy case nearly a quarter of all voters under 25 voted for the Pirate Party. Their votes were completely wasted, but the mainstream parties had alienated those voters. There are bigger social and political issues involved in this than the Government are facing up to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="10012671000045"></a>We want to alter behaviour. The aim must be to get the majority of people on to legal systems, but to do that will require time and investment in developing those systems, making them more appropriate and getting rights holders to work through them, rather than resorting to an abnormal method of imposing sanctions.</p>

<a name="100126-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="10012671000046"></a>I shall return to this issue at a later stage, perhaps in a more comprehensive way, taking on board some of what my noble friend the Minister said about the Government's determination to set up a separate tribunal system. At the moment, even with that tribunal system

It would be appropriate to return to this matter at a later stage. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="10012671000088"></a>This greater injustice would need to be rectified. The technical measures would have been more drastic than anything envisaged in the initial obligations code. This is more vital in the technical measures code than it would have been in the initial obligations code. I hope that the Minister will consider this very carefully because it seems to us to be something which would prevent trigger-happy behaviour by copyright owners. They would have to think quite carefully in those circumstances as fairly drastic action-particularly temporary account suspension-would be available to them through the technical measures code.

We understand and share the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, in relation to this. I would suggest, however, that this is already properly catered for within the Bill, and indeed within the preceding text. This allows the code to provide for indemnification for an internet service provider for loss or damage from a breach or error by the copyright owner in relation to the code or the Bill's provisions. In my view this would cover an error in relation to the identity of an infringer. To reinforce this further, the code allows for copyright owners to be made to indemnify ISPs in the event that the ISPs suffer loss as a result of a failure by the copyright owner. In producing the code it would be an option for stakeholders to require other undertakings by copyright owners if it was deemed appropriate.</p>

The wording of the Bill appears to be based on the enforcement regime currently in place for regulation of premium rate services. This is not a relevant or appropriate basis for enforcement in relation to Clauses 4 to 17. The initial penalties provided in the Communications Act for premium rate services regulation were much lower and have been changed following evidence-based consultation justifying the rationale for increasing the amount. It is wrong to set penalties relating to this entirely new and different purpose by reference to what may now be appropriate for premium rate services regulation following bedding in and operation of that regulation over many years.</p>

The market has some very big players and I am quite sure that £250,000 will be neither here nor there to them. They will just pass it on to their people. However, there are some very small people in this market who are very dedicated and who provide very select services and this will just wipe them out. The Minister may say that Ofcom would not dream of levying that scale of fine, in which case we should make it conditional that fines must be proportionate to turnover. Given the power, people end up bullying people and that would be very dangerous. If we leave this enormous sum in the Bill, it will be misused.</p>

As has been said, £250,000 is a great deal of money. It is hard to imagine that this sum will not be a sufficient deterrent against an internet service provider breaching the obligations of the code. If such a sum turns out to be inadequate in enforcing compliance, the priority should be to examine what is so hard to follow in the code. For an internet service provider to take a £250,000 hit rather than implement technical measures or send notification letters suggests there is something very wrong with the process. That is where the Government should seek a solution.</p>

We do not think that Amendment 197A would be regarded by anyone as one which reinforces the seriousness of what this legislation is trying to achieve including, I suspect, most internet service suppliers if they were being frank. We must take into account the sheer scale of the companies involved. They will range from medium-sized companies to some multinational corporate giants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10012671000058"></a>A point to be borne in mind is that this is the maximum penalty. We would not expect it to be applied too often-perhaps not at all-to any smaller bodies which find themselves in contravention. The text makes it clear that this has to be both appropriate and proportionate to the contravention. However, it must be right to retain the deterrent effect of a significant sum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="10012671000059"></a>Amendment 198 would effectively set the maximum penalty in stone for all time. We do not believe that it would be appropriate to do that either. The maximum penalty is a significant one of £250,000, but against that must be set the huge scale of the bodies being regulated and the need to provide a route through which such maximum penalties will remain an appropriate deterrent into the future. What is certainly a hefty figure now may not seem so in 10 or 20 years and we should take care when a specific sum is mentioned to allow that sum to be changed as circumstances change.</p>

It is true that there are other penalty levels in the Communications Act, including the £10,000 suggested by the amendment. There is also in the Act the much steeper maximum penalty for breach of a Section 45 condition-these are conditions of entitlement to provide networks or services-of 10 per cent of annual turnover. We agree that such a penalty would not be appropriate here. However, I am satisfied that we have got it just about right.

However, rights holders are the trigger for this process, while Ofcom is the regulator. One can conceive of situations where rights holders would abuse their position by putting responsibility for behaviour either on the ISP or on the subscriber who is the target of intervention. If Ofcom has no power over them, who does? We are talking about changing behaviour, but where in the Bill is the control over the behaviour of the rights holders?</p>

It is interesting that we had his velvet glove when he talked of a graded response, but now we get the mailed fist of the £250,000 maximum penalty. It reminded me of a Home Office debate about the deterrent effect of a £250,000 fine. To my ears, it sounds wholly disproportionate. We will take away the Minister's hard-line rhetoric and consider it carefully.

Most noble Lords agree that costs should not fall unnecessarily on internet service providers. It is the copyright owners who seek these provisions and it is right that they should pay the bulk of the costs. That is doubly true because of the likelihood that any costs falling on internet service providers will be passed directly to their customers. I hope that, when deciding on the cost division, either initially or when any future orders are made, the Secretary of State will have regard to any evidence suggesting that subscription rates are rising as a result of the regulatory burden falling on the internet service providers. I also hope that the Minister will be able to tell us whether the cost division eventually decided on in the statutory instrument for the initial obligations code will be the same as for the technical obligations code. Are there any considerations that make him think that internet service providers or rights holders should pay a higher or lower percentage in any cases? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="10012671000089"></a>It was tabled by the Conservative Front Bench and I can quite see why. Someone has to pay for this. We have an interesting situation where the rights holders will benefit and hope to receive more money, but the internet service providers, who will have to do much of the enforcement, including sending out letters, and who will carry the costs, will receive no benefit. There is no suggestion that the rights holders should divvy up the benefits that will come from the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10012671000070"></a>The ISPs will have to recoup the extra cost. They are in the business of business and are not making hugely disproportionate profits. It is a competitive market, so costs have been kept down. Therefore, we will see the monthly cost of internet service provision going up. That will be broadcast in bright lights to subscribers. If the Opposition hope to come to power, they do not want this happening on their watch. They do not want it said that they supported the passing on of these costs. It will be an unpopular measure. I would not quite liken it to the poll tax, but it is amazing what can bring people down-there is nothing like being dramatic about these things. My point is that the cost will be passed on to subscribers: one cannot expect the ISPs to absorb it. I entirely agree that we must protect copyright; I am not against copyright and rights holders. However, this is not the right way to proceed, because the unintended consequences are far more wide-reaching than people have allowed for.</p>

<a name="10012671000071"></a><b><a name="100126-0008.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="10012671000149"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> My Lords, it is worth setting out why Clause 15 is part of the Bill. The apportionment of costs is, not surprisingly, one of the most contentious parts of the process for industry; it is an area where it is not realistic to expect the different industry parties to agree. Both copyright owners and internet service providers are adamant that their view of who should pay is the right one and there is little common ground between them. That is why we decided to include the sharing of costs as part of the Bill, rather than leave it as a matter for the code, which might have made reaching agreement on the code an intractable problem.</p>

<a name="100126-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10012671000072"></a>We have already discussed in Committee Amendments 200 to 206 and the principle of cost sharing. The draft statutory instrument with which we provided your Lordships set out our working assumption that copyright owners should meet 75 per cent of the costs-both those incurred by ISPs in complying with the initial obligations and the other costs that will arise for Ofcom and in relation to the appeals processes. We are quite clear that the bulk of the cost should apply to the copyright owners. Before the Horsemen of the Apocalypse ride in with somewhat melodramatic comparisons with the poll tax, I stress that in this working assumption ISPs would meet the remaining 25 per cent of those costs. We have been clear that in our view the bulk of the cost should be met by the copyright owners as the main beneficiaries of the process, while leaving internet service providers-I stress this-with a strong incentive to ensure that they keep their costs to the lowest effective level.</p>

<a name="100126-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10012671000073"></a>Finally, let me address the point about seeking to prevent internet service providers from passing costs on to their subscribers. This just is not practical. It is not appropriate for the Government to dictate how any of the industry parties should cover their costs or to prohibit any particular route. I suggest that the amendment would, in practice, be virtually impossible to police and could lead to endless disputes.</p>

<a name="100126-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="10012671000074"></a>I shall spend some time on how this will be paid for. It will be paid for by industry through a flat-rate fee that copyright owners will pay, which will be set in a way that incentivises both copyright owners and ISPs to keep the process efficient and cost-effective. It is  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1343"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1343</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>only right that copyright owners should bear the cost of infringement identification and any court action that they choose to take. They will also have to pay a flat fee to an ISP for each notification that the ISP has to process. However, the fee will be set at such a level that it will not cover all the ISP's costs. Placing part of the costs on ISPs should ensure that the systems that they put in place to comply with these obligations are both effective-in other words, delivered rapidly-and cost-efficient. It will also provide ISPs with incentives to minimise the number of notifications that they receive either through commercial content deals or by taking voluntary action to limit file-sharing on their network. In light of that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.</p>

File-sharing is a very good technology for offloading load from certain servers. It is only when it unlawfully breaches copyright that it matters. The concept that file-sharing should be limited on your network-given, for instance, that Skype traffic can look like file-sharing traffic-is a very dangerous one to have in this Bill.</p>

I am not sure that we would have demonstrations in Trafalgar Square about this, with people being thrown into fountains, but who can tell? The Minister said that he did not think that costs would be passed on to the public by internet service providers. I think that that is unrealistic. If you increase a business's overheads, sooner or later they will be passed on. Of course, a business might decide to absorb them initially, but over the longer term that cost will be paid by someone and it will not be the business; it will be paid by those paying for the service. I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind and perhaps comment on it briefly before I withdraw the amendment.</p>

I stress that internet service provision a highly competitive environment. We are not dismissing the fact that copyright owners should bear the bulk of this. We are saying that there should be an incentive on internet service providers to ensure that their part of the bargain should be to have the most efficient and cost-effective process. Which way this will go is an even bet. It is reasonable to say that we do not think that these costs will be passed on, although we do not think that we could find a way of prohibiting that. Our view is that, in a competitive environment, ISPs are capable of absorbing those costs, although I confess that in reality only time will tell. In return, I ask that the noble Lord, Lord Howard, reflects on the fact that this is a very competitive market.</p>

The drafting of the definition of "internet access service" has led to concern that mobile operators might be excluded permanently from these provisions. Limiting the provisions to impact only on those "entirely or mainly" providing internet access will surely discount mobile providers which primarily provide telephone services.

Although it appears to be a simplification, it could have the effect of excluding organisations that offer such a service as the main part of their business as opposed to their entire business. We do not think that we should facilitate that situation. The current wording is designed deliberately to apply only to electronic communication services whose business is wholly or predominantly the provision of internet access-in effect, ISPs. The amendment would make the obligations apply only to an electronic communications service that provides a service to subscribers that involves only access to the internet and the allocation of an IP address. That risks exempting ISPs from the obligations if acting as an ISP is not the sole activity in which they engage. We do not think that that is right. We have no intention of catching organisations or businesses that happen, as part of their normal operations, to allocate IP addresses to their staff, for instance, but we think that it is right that those organisations that, as a business, provide internet access and allocate IP addresses should be covered by this legislation. I suggest that we should focus on where the problem is likely to reside on those networks operated by internet service providers whose business either wholly or mainly consists of access to the internet.

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="10012684000002"></a>Illegal peer-to-peer file sharing is-I say this for the benefit of the noble Earl, Lord Erroll-the biggest problem facing our creative industry today, but it may not be the biggest problem tomorrow. We need to be able to respond quickly and flexibly if new methods of infringement grow in significance and start to damage those industries. Clause 17 aims to provide this important flexibility. As with any delegated power, Clause 17 has attracted significant interest from parliamentarians and committees of this House. As I will explain, however, the Government have listened to the concerns that have been raised by noble Lords and committees, and we have proposed some substantial amendments to address these. These government amendments clarify the scope of the power, and strengthen the safeguards that surround its use. I shall explain these by moving onto the detail of the amendment laid in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="10012684000003"></a>First, we propose the introduction of a clear threshold that must be met before the power in Clause 17 may be used. This threshold requires that the power may be used only if the infringement in question is of a sufficiently damaging nature as to warrant intervention. That intervention must be proportionate to the threat

This assessment must form part of an explanatory report which will be laid before Parliament for 60 days under the so-called super-affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10012684000004"></a>Secondly, the amendment will make it crystal clear that all persons likely to be affected by an order under this power should be consulted. The results of that consultation and an assessment of why proposed action is proportionate will also form part of the explanatory report which will be put before Parliament.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="10012684000005"></a>Finally, the super-affirmative resolution procedure requires that the Government cannot continue with any proposed use of the power if a committee of either House recommends that they do not. Such a recommendation would have to be overturned by a vote of the House before-and I stress before-the order could progress any further. These amendments will ensure that Parliament has sufficient time to consider the implications of any order made under this power, while still enabling the Government to respond quickly and flexibly to developments that affect our valuable creative industries.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="10012684000006"></a>In conclusion, I would like again to reassure the House that we have listened to the points raised, including those by a committee of this House. I hope your Lordships will agree that the amendments we propose here address their concerns in a very serious way. I beg to move.</p>

Some while ago, my noble friend Lord Bragg and I looked very carefully at what was originally proposed by the Government, and considered that we were perpetually trying to sail between Scylla and Charybdis. Scylla is, frankly, turning a blind eye to file sharing and letting it continue much as it is, with all the damage that is consequent; and Charybdis is the original proposal from the Government that we did not feel we could happily go along with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="10012684000008"></a>The utilisation of the super-affirmative resolution procedure is not that usual, but I would commend it to the House. It is a very effective piece of legislation. We used it during the passage of the Communications Bill 2003. It offers significantly greater safeguards than the normal affirmative resolution procedure and has other advantages. The purpose of the amendments that my noble friend Lord Bragg and I put down is to increase the period of time for consultation from 60 to 90 days, which we feel is appropriate. These are complex issues in a difficult and diverse industry and we feel that a 90-day period is more suited. Amendment 212 is in the same spirit.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="10012684000009"></a>I could speak at some length about this. A lot of work has gone into it. I think that the industry for the most part sees this as an acceptable resolution to what has been a very vexed problem. I hope only that my noble friend Lord Whitty, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and others I respect in this House will see this as a genuine attempt to come up with an answer to an almost implacable problem.</p>

It is understandable that the Government seek powers to future-proof, and that these will necessarily be vague given that the purpose of this clause is to deal with unknown problems and to cope with future technology. However, the power being demanded is quite out of proportion to the potential problems.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="10012684000011"></a>At various moments during our debate, Ministers have pleaded with the House to keep things in perspective. I urge Her Majesty's Government to do the same. We are dealing in this clause with the prevention or reduction of online infringement of copyright. To give the Secretary of State such huge powers as are being demanded in order to deal with copyright infringement would be unreasonable and, as I have already said, totally out of proportion.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="10012684000012"></a>Effectively, entirely at the discretion of the Secretary of State, a large amount of law can be amended-the whole of Part I of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act. One can take hypothetical examples too far, but I do not think that I am doing so when suggesting that a future Secretary of State might decide to amend significantly existing rights to copy or broadcast works because of an unfortunate rise in infringements. Other sections, such as those covering the terms of licences, could be materially amended in order to address copyright infringement.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="10012684000013"></a>Should some unimaginable situation arise, or there be infringements beyond what could reasonably be expected, there is nothing to stop the Secretary of State returning to Parliament and seeking primary legislation to deal with the problem. To expect Parliament to give the Secretary of State the discretion at will to make laws as far-reaching as the amendment makes possible-I will come to procedure in a minute-to cope with online infringement is expecting Parliament quite unjustifiably to surrender its role of holding the Government to account. It demonstrates a contempt for Parliament which has been demonstrated all too often by this Government.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="10012684000014"></a>There are protections in Clause 17 against improper use, but they are not as strong as might at first appear, and would not provide the restraint necessary for such wide-ranging powers. The new threshold test that the measure must be proportionate is nothing but reassuring flannel, as everything that the Secretary of State does should anyway be proportionate. The restriction on amending or creating criminal offences is necessary, but presumably does not cover creating or modifying provisions allowing for an injunction, which is a civil issue, but which can still impose significant restrictions on both companies and individuals.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="10012684000015"></a>The Government's justification for asking for those dictatorial powers is that the procedure for putting them into effect would act as a restriction and give Parliament the opportunity to hold Ministers to account, as the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, pointed out, but the super-affirmative procedure suggested by the Government in no way answers the concerns felt by many, despite the noble Lord's comments. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did its usual sterling job and called attention to Clause 17 in its original report on the Bill. It is difficult to argue with its recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="10012684000016"></a>In its most recent report, the committee states unambiguously that,</p>
<ul><a name="10012684000044"></a>"the insertion of a super-affirmative procedure cannot bring a misconceived delegated power within the bounds of acceptability".</ul>
<p><a name="10012684000039"></a>The committee leaves the final decision to the House, but I continue to hold that the Government have not met the legitimate concerns held by many in this House and that the procedures offered by the Government do not give adequate protection against the huge powers for which they are asking. The super-affirmative procedure is not a compromise between secondary and primary legislation. The DPRRC notes that it is,</p>
<ul><a name="10012684000045"></a>"entirely exceptional, justified only by unusual circumstances".</ul>
<p><a name="10012684000040"></a>With the best will in the world, I cannot see how online copyright infringement is in any way exceptional. It may be undesirable; it may be something that this House should be trying to do its best to stop; but I do not think that it is exceptional.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="10012684000017"></a>With the super-affirmative process, all the flaws of secondary legislation remain. There is no chance to insist on amendments. Although there is no formal bar against throwing out a super-affirmative in its entirety, I am sure that I do not need to remind your Lordships how very rarely this House chooses to take such a drastic step. Statutory instruments have been thrown out of this House only three times since the war-one of which was at the instigation of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. Some may say, "It is all right, we have the House of Commons", but in fact, only eight statutory instruments subject to the negative procedure have been annulled in the House of Commons since World War Two. It is very rare for affirmative statutory instruments to be defeated in the House of Commons, the last occasion being in 1978.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="10012684000018"></a>I end my comments on the procedural mishmash that the Government seek to insert into the Bill by again citing the committee's report, which expressed things perfectly when it stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="10012684000043"></a>"The super-affirmative procedure is not an adequate substitute for Parliament's established procedures for dealing with matters of complexity and importance, through primary legislation".</p>

<p><a name="10012684000041"></a>I therefore entirely reject Amendment 211B. If the Government are unable to define the purpose of Clause 17 in such a way as to make a normal affirmative procedure acceptable to this House and to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee-and I do not consider that Amendment 211A does that-they should remove Clause 17 entirely and proceed against future online copyright infringement by primary legislation.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="10012684000019"></a>The amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, although entirely praiseworthy in their attempt to further parliamentary scrutiny, do not really answer the problem.</p>

Having sat in this Chamber for 13 years, I know the simple reality of how long it takes to bring primary legislation before this House. We have to find some means of ensuring that primary legislation can reach the House at such a time as to deal with the problem. Recently, a complaint against Microsoft has

Those 10 years could be the end of the intellectual copyright business in the UK if primary legislation cannot deal with massive infringement. We do not have 10 years. The noble Lord will hope-he may possibly even expect-to find himself in government, possibly this year. I promise him that this type of solution to this type of problem will be something that a future Conservative Government may well find themselves seeking. I hope very much that, in rejecting it, he has taken that thought on board.</p>

I also think that it is always possible to fast-track primary legislation. It does not need to take 10 years. Indeed, I believe that the Government want to see this Bill through fairly quickly, and that that will be achieved.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="10012684000022"></a>I shall comment briefly on my amendment in this group, which was tabled several weeks ago, and a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then. We were willing to consider the possibility that Clause 17 could be used to implement some steps that the Government were developing that had nearly been completed but were not quite ready to be included in the Bill. The amendment was to give the Government a period of grace to complete any formal stages that such provisions might have been going through, such as a compulsory period of examination at the European level.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="10012684000023"></a>It has become clear during the past weeks that there are in fact no such provisions. The Government do not know what Clause 17 would be used for, and they have no plans for addressing any other type of online infringement than those set out in Clauses 4 to 16. We are now inclined to the view that Amendment 213 would not be helpful to copyright holders, internet service providers or any other person involved in the industry. It would be actively prejudicial to the interests of Parliament. I shall therefore not be moving it when we reach that point in our proceedings.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="10012684000024"></a>We sympathise with the ambition behind Clause 17. If the Government could find a way of saying the same thing that did not show quite such contempt for Parliament-we would need to see considerable movement before Clause 17 was in an acceptable form-we might take a different view.</p>

I promise the Minister that I will not say it twice.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="10012684000026"></a>I deeply appreciate the efforts that my noble friends Lord Puttnam and Lord Bragg have put into this and the Government's acceptance of it. I would unequivocally say that if something like Clause 17 remains part of this Bill, the super-affirmative resolution set out in these provisions would give significant protection and significant retention of the scrutiny of Parliament in relation to the implications of Clause 17. I would therefore be more welcoming of these amendments than is the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1351"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1351</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="10012684000027"></a>The fact remains that Clause 17 raises anxieties that are well beyond the areas we have already discussed. One of the original justifications from the Minister's department for Clause 17 having the wide range that it did was that Clauses 4 to 16 only dealt with unlawful peer-to-peer file sharing. As a result of the post-consultation amendments to the legislation put forward by the Government, those clauses potentially apply to all forms of copyright infringement. I queried that at an earlier stage and I still think it would be better, since the procedure relates to unlawful peer-to-peer file sharing, if it were more narrowly defined in those earlier clauses. However, if it is not to be, one of the main justifications for the wide range of Clause 17 disappears.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="10012684000028"></a>I re-declare my interest as chair of Consumer Focus. We know worldwide that there are always pressures from different forms of copyright owners to extend the powers and rights of copyright holders. There are international and European negotiations current in those fields. In the European context, there are proposals for extending certain forms of copyright which, unless they were attached to a fair-use provision, the consumer organisations nationally and at European level by and large oppose. Could Clause 17 be used to bring those into national law? In a more sinister way, there are also discussions on a world-trade basis under the ACTA provisions about changes in copyright protection in the trade context. By definition, those trade negotiations are not transparent or open. We do not know what will come out of them and what might need to be transposed into national law.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="10012684000029"></a>If Clause 17 were used for all sorts of copyright protection in that context, it would undoubtedly be a Henry VIII use of powers. It is not connected to other purposes of this Bill and it would undoubtedly mean that the powers implied in Clause 17 could be used for very wide purposes. I would like the Government to place on the record a denial that Clause 17 could be used for those purposes or for the purposes of extending copyright protection and patent protection more generally. It did not relate to the main purposes of this Bill or the main strategy of <I>Digital Britain</I>. I hope that the fears that are being raised by the wide-ranging nature of Clause 17 could be allayed to some degree. I also agree with the noble Lord, Lord Howard, that, in relation to aspects of Clause 17 and the need to keep up with technology, the Government are justified in having easier and wider-ranging powers but they need to define them significantly more narrowly than is done in Clause 17.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="10012684000030"></a>The view of the Delegated Powers Committee would normally be taken very seriously by the Government. When I was on the Front Bench, every time such a castigation came from the Delegated Powers Committee we automatically rolled over. I hope that the Minister and his colleagues will do the same on this occasion and come up with a more acceptable form of Clause 17.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="10012684000031"></a>I am not clear whether, had the super-affirmative procedure existed in the 1530s, His Late Majesty Henry VIII would have been inhibited by it or indeed whether it would have inhibited his Minister Thomas Cromwell, who more or less occupies the same position as the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, does at present.

This cannot be cast to one side-it involves not just the film industry but many other areas as well. There is legitimate concern out there. The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, asked me to state that.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="10012684000033"></a>Our attitude is that, because of that concern, we supported the Government's decision to introduce regulatory measures to combat unlawful peer-to-peer file sharing. We also went on to say-this was raised earlier this afternoon by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, in one of his many interventions-that we welcomed the decision of some companies in the audio-visual industries to change their business models in order to meet the legitimate demands of their customers while generating returns on their investment in content. Those two things went side by side; I reiterate that today. The music industry, for example, has taken those words to heart.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="10012684000034"></a>This House has to face the fact that threats change and develop and that new threats come along. We cannot simply close our eyes to that and say that there is no way of combating that. The UK music industry supports Clause 17; we cannot ignore that either.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="10012684000035"></a>I heard about the ability we might have to introduce new primary legislation. We need to be careful about that. Camcording crime is a new threat-the threat of illegal camcording. There is no question about the illegality of that. There is no question that people are exercising their freedom in some peculiar way. It is organised crime. People are going into cinemas, making recordings and selling those recordings. They even have tripods and are highly organised. I have not yet, though I undoubtedly will, heard any serious defence in this debate of that practice.</p>

<a name="100126-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="10012684000036"></a>At the moment, however, the legal position is anything but clear. I asked the Minister what the Government's attitude was. He said they were taking advice but I shall tell him. The Government's attitude is that they are waiting for a test case on the Fraud Act 2006. This questions the argument that new primary legislation can be brought in quickly and be put into effect. Certainly no new primary legislation has been put into effect here. Perhaps the Government do not consider that to be very important, but again I have to say that the film industry regards it as extraordinarily important.</p>

I rather doubt whether swift new primary legislation at every stage will be the answer, but we must find a sensible practical solution that will satisfy not only the public and public rights but the industries. I say again that the film industry and the music industry-and television, for that matter-are vital for this country, and we should support them. If we find defects in the clause, okay, let us look at them, but we also need to find a solution or we will let those industries down.</p>

I hear what the noble Lord says about pushing through legislation quickly, but in my experience it is very difficult to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="100126100000002"></a>I know that the super-affirmative procedure is clumsy-we do not pretend otherwise; it was the only means that we could find to raise the issue-but Parliament has a duty to itself to look at the nature of the threats, the problems, the pace of change, and its own processes, and to try to pull these things together. I think that that is what the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, is referring to. It would be good if the House as a whole could come to that conclusion. We may not be able to crack this problem, but pretending that it will not come back and haunt us time and again is not doing ourselves justice. I hope that those on the Liberal Democrat Front Bench will agree and bend their very fertile minds to possible solutions. The present situation is a mess, and it is foolish to pretend that, somehow or other, primary legislation is the way through. It is not.</p>

This is an area in which there is an advantage in being able to be flexible and move fast. I like the super-affirmative system; it allows for outside contributions and proper consideration, which we should allow for in our own legislative processes on occasions. The House of Commons took it up recently in Committee on the Education Bill when it took outside evidence as the first part of that process. We are lagging behind on that, and ought to make up the distance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="100126100000004"></a>My objection is to Clause 17's underlying breadth, which the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, outlined extremely well. Yes, there is a purpose subsection at the beginning, but noble Lords who have read the <I>Evening Standard</I> for the past few days will have discovered that Westminster has decided to extend paid-for parking until midnight from about a month's time to deal with problems that it anticipates during the Olympics-as if people will park in central London to get to the Olympics. Fortunately, we also have the background document, which says that this is actually entirely to do with raising money. None the less, it shows the extent to which a purpose subsection can be used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="100126100000005"></a>Clause 17 goes to the heart of copyright legislation and exposes the whole of that construct to the affirmative procedure. I would like a clause that was clearer and narrower. We are not totally in the dark; we know what steps people will take if they wish to continue to file-share illegally. They will use cyberlockers, encryption and proxy, and the Government, as my noble friend on the Front Bench has said, have no clue what to do about these things. Nor do I; these are very hard things to deal with. The only clear, technical way of dealing with them is to intrude extremely heavily into what people are doing on the net.</p>

<a name="100126-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="100126100000006"></a>I am not at all clear that the solution lies in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, but I suppose that once the Government have the power to amend an Act they can put anything they want into it to deal with a particular problem. We might find something in there that does not have anything particularly to do with copyright, but the Government have given no illustration of the sorts of things that they need to do to deal with the particular threats that they see coming. If we could focus on that, we might have an idea of how we can make Clause 17 acceptable. I would not be against something along those lines.</p>

<a name="100126-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="100126100000007"></a>My attention has been drawn to paragraph 136 in my noble friend Lord Fowler's report, which I have been reading with interest, and to the quotation above it from an industry executive on the attitude that he would like his industry to have:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="100126100000105"></a>"You can have whatever you want when you want but it is going to cost you more or less".</p>

<p><a name="100126100000102"></a>That is the right attitude; we give customers what they want, charge them for it, and get tough if they do not pay. We need that transformation. Given how shaky the Government's ability to deal with piracy is going to be, the industry really ought to be moving to giving customers what they want, how they want it, and when they want it. Then we will reduce this problem substantially. That is the right way in which to protect our copyright. Technology has outflanked us. Speaking as someone who has his own copyright interests, I do not think it defensible to stick with legislation and be tough with customers who misbehave. You give them something extra. You give them incentives to behave properly, and by and large they will.</p>

I do not like the clause at all. If we are to retain it, it must include the super-affirmative provisions and I therefore would vote for that. But at the next stage, I would vote to get rid of the clause altogether. That is my stance. I will explain exactly why I do not think that this clause should stand part when we get to the clause stand part debate. I should like to respond to a couple of remarks made by the noble Lords, Lord Fowler and Lord Puttnam, because I am not against protecting the rights of copyright holders. This is about effectiveness, which is why the other remarks are more apposite.</p>

I lived through the experience of the passage of the Communications Act 2003 and know very well the importance of getting the right parts of the Bill enacted. Even then, against considerable pressure at times, that Bill was out of date fairly quickly. As to the need to have the power to update quickly, there is an urgency which perhaps we need to address, but which has not been addressed satisfactorily so far.</p>

<a name="100126-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="100126100000014"></a>I rather agree with the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, who said that, if nothing else could be agreed, the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, should be agreed. Certainly, there should be 90 days, as opposed to 60 days, to gather evidence to refute what was going on. I would again stress that when this Bill is passed, we will need legislation that will be able to react quickly. Like the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, I do not think that primary legislation should be brought in fast. Certainly, after what has happened in the past few years of this Government's reign, there is no way in which primary legislation can be achieved quickly. There is a huge backlog waiting to go through Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="100126100000015"></a>I have considerable reservations about the government amendment, but I see the need to redraft and to have something. The Government may draw up something which will satisfy us. I certainly hope so.</p>

<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1356"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1356</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I hope that he will forgive me for hiding behind the Delegated Powers Committee, which seems to have more authority than me. I very much sympathise with what the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, and my noble friend Lord Fowler have said. This matter needs to be addressed. The problem nowadays is that the Executive take more and more power away from Parliament, which as a point of principle should be opposed at all times, if it is not a matter of national survival. I realise the importance of our creative industries, which are enormous contributors to the wealth and prosperity of this country and must be looked after. But there is still the idea that the supremacy of Parliament must be maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="100126100000017"></a>As usual, the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, made interesting and pertinent comments. I hope that the Minister will listen to what the noble Lord said when he exhorted him to roll over. The noble Lord and my noble friend Lord Lucas urged Her Majesty's Government to look at the possibility of narrowing Clause 17, which might provide an answer to what everyone wants. I am somewhat disappointed that no one took real note of my comments on the complete ineffectiveness of statutory instruments in terms of controlling government. Eight times since the war in the House of Commons and three times in this House does not seem to be a very effective brake on anyone or anything. But if I was on the other side and wanting to do things, it would be a very effective way of getting absolute power while pretending not to have it.</p>

Because of the nature of the debate, I apologise for the extent of my reply. I will try to keep it short, but if I do not cover the waterfront, I will not have been a contender-if noble Lords will pardon the pun, which those in the cinematic area will recognise.</p>

<a name="100126-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="100126100000020"></a>I thank my noble friend Lord Puttnam for his contribution to the debate and for the thought that has clearly gone into the amendment. As noble Lords will see, the proposal under Amendment 212 that the power should be subject to super-affirmative procedure is included in the government amendment laid in the name of my noble friend Lord Mandelson. As such, I hope that this amendment can be withdrawn.</p>

<a name="100126-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="100126100000021"></a>Amendment 211C also raises an important point that any use of this power should take place only after a full consultation with all those who are likely to be affected. I agree with that sentiment, but the existing wording of the amendment laid in the name of my noble friend Lord Mandelson already specifies that consultation must include the persons who the Secretary of State thinks are likely to be affected, including those who represent such persons. I believe that this wording already includes the bodies which noble Lords wish to be consulted. I therefore suggest that Amendment 211C should be withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="100126100000022"></a>Amendments 211D to 211J would change the period specified to be part of the super-affirmative procedure from 60 days to 90 days. As with so many things, a balance has to be struck between the competing needs

I was disappointed that the noble Lord, Lord Howard, felt that the super-affirmative procedure was a form of prestidigitation on the part of the Government-or, if he prefers, a sleight of hand. We see it as a serious protection, which has to go through the hurdle of both Houses. It is true that it has not been successful on many occasions, but that may have been given the considerations that were taking place.</p>

<a name="100126-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="100126100000023"></a>On our part, there is no attempt to have any contempt for parliamentary procedure. It is a serious amendment. We believe that a balance has to be struck between the competing needs for careful and measured consideration of any action and the need to be able to act quickly when the occasion demands. It is absolutely right that Parliament should have enough time to consider properly any proposed use of this power. The use of a super-affirmative procedure will provide for this.</p>

<a name="100126-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="100126100000024"></a>I regret to inform my noble friend that we are not convinced about the need to extend the period to 90 days instead of 60 days. We feel that that would tip the balance too far and would prevent us acting in a timely fashion when so required. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Howard, for his reasoning behind not moving Amendment 213, which means that I do not have to respond to it.</p>

<a name="100126-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="100126100000025"></a>As I have explained, Clause 17 is required to future-proof our legislation and to provide a means for regulation to keep pace with the relentless march of technology. As the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, rightly reminded us, threats change. To limit the power in that way would not allow this aim to be achieved.</p>

<a name="100126-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="100126100000026"></a>I shall try to address the questions that were raised, provided I do not lose my place. Certainly we would not in any way ignore the comments of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, but its new report concludes that the amendments are an improvement and it is now for the Committee to decide whether the changes make the clause acceptable. We have moved from being unacceptable to at least an improvement-that is progress. We are not saying that we have reached perfection but at least we have taken away the complete objection by the Delegated Powers Committee and I reassure the Committee that we would not ignore that important body.</p>

<a name="100126-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="100126100000027"></a>Reference was made to fast-track legislation. The Constitution Committee expressed concern about the breadth of the power in Clause 17 and suggested that it may be better to rely on fast-track legislation instead. We are unconvinced that the fast-track procedure would provide a better alternative to Clause 17. We believe that the requirement under super-affirmative procedure to lay a draft order and explanatory materials in front of Parliament for a minimum of 60 days provides more time for consultation and consideration of proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="100126100000028"></a>My noble friend Lord Whitty asked whether the powers could be used to extend copyright protection. The power cannot alter the definition of copyright protection so in this case we are happy to give the assurance asked for by my noble friend. He also asked  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1358"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1358</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>why we need Clause 17 if previous clauses cover copyright infringement. Clauses 4 to 16 address online infringement using the tools provided, which are designed to tackle the many-to-many infringement based on detection by copyright holders. We recognise that that does not cover the whole waterfront. Clause 17 will enable us to respond if the case is made where these tools will not help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="100126100000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, asked whether we need primary legislation to tackle camcording of films in cinemas. After a bit of research and the wondrous powers of the Box to deliver on time-just in time, in this case-I am pleased to tell the Committee that there has been a successful prosecution for this offence under the Fraud Act, showing that existing remedies are effective against this threat. No doubt we can provide more detail for the noble Lord, and I undertake to make it more widely available.</p>

<a name="100126-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="100126100000030"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, asked what the power would be used for. The essence of the clause is that it allows us to respond to future threats. By their very nature, such threats cannot be confidently predicted today. We have already said that illegal file-sharing is the biggest problem facing creative industries today, but they may not be the biggest problem tomorrow. We need to be able to respond quickly and flexibly to new methods of infringement. There have been some potential threats, which I identified. We debated previously the question of cyberlockers which again could have a legal as well as an illegal use. The noble Lord said that we do not have a clue how to respond to this. I am not sure that we have not been focusing on it, but he is right to say that that will present another challenge. At this stage, we cannot necessarily concur with him whether the only way of solving it is as he portrayed. There are other threats such as streamed content, which is another problem area.</p>

<a name="100126-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="100126100000031"></a>I think that I have covered most of the questions raised. A number of comments were made about the need to define the clause more narrowly, and that it is too wide-ranging. I understand and recognise that concern as genuine, and we will reflect on it. Obviously we are looking to find as much of a consensus as we can on the clause. The noble Lord, Lord Howard, was not the only one to raise that. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, made the same comment. I do not think I need say any more on the super-affirmative procedure. We have tried to build in safeguards. Concern has been expressed that that is not sufficient, especially taking into account the range of the clause. In my assurance to my noble friend Lord Whitty, I made it clear that it is not as wide-ranging as he thought. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, suggested that it was draconian. I cannot concur with that, although I understand her concern.</p>

<a name="100126-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="100126100000032"></a>We believe that there is a need to address what the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, expressed best when he talked about the capacity for threats to change over time. That is the purpose of Clause 17 We do not believe that primary legislation, given the time that it takes to introduce, is the way forward. A number of noble Lords share that view. The assurance that I give generally is that we will reflect on the nature of the debate, on the concern expressed about the wide range of Clause 17 as it is currently drafted. We will try to address that.</p>

<p><i><a name="100126100000164"></a>Debate on whether Clause 17 should stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

<p><a name="st_220"></a>
<a name="100126100000037"></a><b><a name="100126-0011.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="100126100000149"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> My Lords, I hope that the Committee will bear with me as I was very forbearing and did not make a speech in the debate on the last group of amendments. The view on these Benches, and I suspect on several other Benches, is that this clause should not stand part of the Bill. Members on these Benches bow to no one in terms of being keen to see that our creative industries flourish and that their intellectual property rights are properly protected, but we do not believe that this clause should be part of that scheme.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="100126100000038"></a>Let us look at some aspects of Clause 17. We must recognise the anomaly here. Clauses 4 to 16, along with all the amendments proposed to those clauses that we have discussed throughout our consideration of the Bill, have concerned the Communications Act 2003, not the Copyright Act 1988. A moment ago the Minister justified this on the basis that it is all a matter of the tools being available. That is a strange justification and no doubt he will expand on it. The Government also claim that the clause itself has been improved by the amendments that are now to be made to it, but essentially its scope, as opposed to the procedures, remains unchanged. In fact, the Constitution Committee believes that the new amendments now to be incorporated could extend its scope. So these amendments and the Minister's arguments in their favour do not achieve this evening's silk purse award, I am afraid.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="100126100000039"></a>The purpose of Clause 17 is to amend the Copyright Act 1988 for the purpose of preventing or reducing the infringement of copyright by means of the internet. Why is this clause designed to allow changes to be made to the underlying intellectual property rights of creative copyright owners? No other part of the Bill deals with this aspect. Orphan rights are considered later, but Clauses 4 to 16 do not address this issue. Why is this clause not designed to provide more flexibility for the enforcement powers conferred by the Communications Act 2003? That is another conundrum.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="100126100000040"></a>This clause could make major changes to the underlying intellectual property rights available to copyright owners. Certain exemptions such as fair dealing could be deleted in certain circumstances. New rights could be asserted. It could redefine what is meant by and who essentially is infringing a copyright, particularly as regards the duties on ISPs. The Government claimed in their evidence to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee that they need to respond to technological change, and the Minister has today used the term "future-proofing". The industry, on the contrary, talks about particular threats: torrent sites, forums, blogs, streaming sites, aggregators and search engine sites. It also refers to video-to-audio conversion, stream ripping and hybrid sites. Many of these are hosted by cyberlockers, to which the noble Lord, Lord Lucas,  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1362"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1362</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>referred, which are based outside the UK. I believe that there is also the concept of the newsgroup facilitator which encompasses some of these types of activities. All these are very specific activities, but what further powers to assert copyright under the 1988 Act are needed that are not possible under the provisions of the Communications Act 2003 as it is shortly to be amended?</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="100126100000041"></a>The Government point to the defects in new Section 97A of the Broadcasting Act 1990 in tackling non-peer-to-peer infringement. That is all well and good, but where do the new provisions in the Communications Act 2003 actually fall down? Why has no specific clause amending the 1988 Act been suggested? The current threats are well known and the industry has enumerated them in considerable detail, but there is no clear evidence that underlying intellectual property rights are under threat and need to be changed.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="100126100000042"></a>Clause 17 explicitly does not create new criminal offences, but some would say that the gaps in the criminal law are far greater than those in the civil law. The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, referred to this earlier; I hope that the Minister has managed to give him some reassurance that the Fraud Act will cover camcorder use in cinemas, but there are other areas, and certainly some of the issues raised by the recent failed prosecution in the OiNK case beg questions about the criminal law. However, they will not be covered by Clause 17. Again, many would say that dealing with some of the criminal law aspects is a great deal more urgent than trying to deal with some speculative aspect of the civil law. The Government need to explain in what way Clauses 4 to 16 will be ineffective outside peer-to-peer infringement and they need to suggest a different process, probably as a way of amending the 2003 Act.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="100126100000043"></a>Over the years, copyright law has been shown to be reasonably flexible and adaptable. In our view it is the Government, despite reports such as the <I>Gowers Review of I</I><I>ntellectual </I><I>P</I><I>roperty</I>, which was excellent in many ways, who have failed to bring forward legislation to make the reforms that have been suggested-and after several years of labour into reviews such as Gowers. An example of this is that I believe the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has tabled an amendment later in the Bill to reflect one of the key recommendations made by Gowers, which is that consumers should be allowed to shift formats. That is not included in this Bill. Why is that issue regarded as a second order reform when it concerns consumers so closely? Yet we get a sledgehammer of a provision in the form of Clause 17.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="100126100000044"></a>The sub-committee of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee recognises the changes, as the Minister made clear, but goes on to make the point that primary legislation is more suitable for these kinds of changes. The super-affirmative procedure is not an adequate substitute for Parliament's established way of dealing with matters of complexity and importance-through primary legislation. With Clause 17 we could be placing draconian new duties on ISPs and preventing access to certain websites. "Tackling online infringement", to use the wording of the clause, is not a narrow purpose when in the future probably most of us will derive our entertainment over the internet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="100126100000045"></a>We must agree with the words of the Constitution Committee in the final paragraph of its report,</p>
<ul><a name="100126100000129"></a>"that Clause 17 is constitutionally inappropriate and should be omitted".</ul>
<p><a name="st_221"></a>
<a name="100126100000046"></a><b><a name="100126-0011.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="100126100000150"></a>Lord Triesman:</b> My Lords, I am among those in the Committee who did not know whether they should have spoken on the last group or on this group, but this is probably as good a time as any, because I hope to argue that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, is fundamentally wrong-he put the issue in the starkest terms-about whether this clause, or something very like it after the Minister and his team have given it further thought, which they have committed themselves to do, is needed.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="100126100000047"></a>I sense that there is a good deal of agreement, perhaps consensus, that if something is written that is effective in ensuring that what happens in the future can be safeguarded, there will be a great deal of support for it. It is very important that that should be said, because we are talking about a sector that is approximately 8 per cent of our economy. It is quite hard to measure; I know that some research teams in universities have been trying to measure it, but it is hard to know exactly how to define it. However, the figure is certainly of that order or greater. This is also the sector which is growing fastest, which shows the greatest capabilities in innovation and invention and which will be very important to us in the future. It is also a sector in which many new small firms, which are probably our economic future, will emerge.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="100126100000048"></a>I do not think that it would be wrong or-I say this with respect to the noble Lord, Lord Howard-contemptuous were Parliament to think hard about what it might do to protect those interests in the long run, since they are so fundamental to us, if we can get the right formula for doing it. I think, though, that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, wants to have his cake and eat it. He says that he is in complete sympathy with everybody in the Committee who has argued that these are very important parts of the economy, that we want to protect these properties and that we want to protect copyright, yet he wants to take a step that would destroy the possibility of doing that in future.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="100126100000049"></a>I take a simple view of this; it is an evidence-based view based on having been the Minister for Intellectual Property and having heard the arguments over quite a long period. It is not simply a matter of theory, although there are, of course, important issues, which I greatly respect, about the powers of Parliament and Parliament's scrutiny of legislation-one could not other than agree about that-but the evidence is pretty significant. I shall give two examples of why I so profoundly, but respectfully, disagree.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="100126100000050"></a>The first comes from a firm that is very large and has significant UK interests-BT. I have no interest in BT other than to use it as an example. In deciding how to allocate its research funds-which sorts of research might be beneficial in the future-and because its research funds were very large in an industry that was moving rapidly, it had what was, in effect, a research council inside the company. It looked at all the competing demands for research, both internally and in some cases externally, it evaluated them and it tried to work out what it had best do in the future.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1364"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1364</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100126-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="100126100000051"></a>What interested me a great deal was that, in doing that, BT tried to identify, over a period of a decade in advance each time it did it, what was likely to happen, not just in its industry, but in a number of industries where there might arguably be some sort of link between what it did and what others were doing. This was because the commercial interests and the capacity of that firm were dependent on having some sort of sense of the future. Occasionally, it identified things that would happen; occasionally, it identified them at the wrong time. However, it will come as no surprise to your Lordships that, broadly speaking, it missed a high proportion of the things that were going to happen, because these are very hard to predict.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="100126100000052"></a>I suggest to the Committee-before I come to my second example, which I hope your Lordships will feel is significant evidence-that the reason for that is straightforward. The reason why it is difficult is that, although it may not be easy to predict a major development when a paradigm has shifted, usually many of the things that have led to it in science and technology and engineering have been reasonably visible to a significant part of the research world as it was happening. However, once one of those events has happened, innovation within that paradigm happens incredibly fast and incredibly unpredictably. Anybody who tells me that they know that it is going to happen or can chart its characteristics-in the way that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, believes that, in listing the things that we know currently, we might be able to say what will happen in the future-misconceives that kind of development and how it happens.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="100126100000053"></a>That is why I want to illustrate the point with a second example-the example of Shawn Fanning, who will be known to at least some in the Committee by history. He was a freshman student at Northeastern University in Boston who was looking for a simple way to share the music that he liked, at the ripe old age of 18, with his friends. He was an affable sort of bloke and he liked to share the things that he liked. He decided, soon before he turned 19-he did it when he was 19-that staying at university was not the best way of spending your time and he set off, with the help of a friend and his uncle, to find a way of turning MP3 format, a really innovative code and innovative way of compression, into a means of sharing the music that he liked. In that way, Napster was born.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="100126100000054"></a>I know that Napster finally fell foul of the law and was suppressed and many other variants then came about, but the reason I mention the example is that the period from the first moment when he seemed to be thinking about this and nobody else knew to the moment at which he almost undermined the music industry in a fundamental way was nearly 18 months. In fact, the period from the time when anybody might have observed it happening to its happening was rather more than five months, but only just.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="100126100000055"></a>I make the proposition to the Committee that our method of legislating, of which we are rightly proud-it requires a great deal of detailed interrogation of information in order to ensure that we do it in the right way-is not really in a race with events of that  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1365"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1365</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>kind. It truly is not. We are a bullock cart going against a jet aeroplane, when you think of the speed and ability of that kind of innovation.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="100126100000056"></a>That is where I come to the point that I find so hard to understand about the argument that has just been put as to why this clause should be struck out. It is not hard to list all the things that have happened and say, "Have we covered them in legislation?". However, when you look at Napster, or at the efforts that were made by BT, which I have tried to illustrate at least briefly and I hope with enough detail for your Lordships to recognise the process, what you cannot do is say, "By the way, these are the next things that are going to happen and this is the speed at which they are going to happen and we have got a grip of all of them and will be able, by primary legislation, to deal with them". We will not be able to do that. That is a straightforward fact-we will not do it by primary legislation. If it is insisted on, then we have decided not to do it.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="100126100000057"></a>I am fully receptive to the powerful argument that there may be alternative economic models-we would want to see those-but the argument that we will do this through primary legislation is simply not credible in these circumstances. Therefore, we will have to have a clause of this kind and it will have to have the effect of this kind of clause. I do not personally have huge difficulties with the clause as it is.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="100126100000058"></a>Just in case anybody wishes to say to me, "You would say that", because, like the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, I have intellectual property rights, which are sold in the football industry-I declared that interest earlier in Committee-let me say that I know perfectly well that what we know about streaming now will be superseded. I do not know when or how fast it will happen, but I know that it will most certainly happen, just like every other innovation has happened. It will catch us by surprise and affect a number of the things that are fundamental. The way in which we fund grass-roots football is potentially eliminated in significant part. That will be true in other parts of the sports world as well, including the Premier League and a number of other sports.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="100126100000059"></a>I hope that the Committee will forgive me for the length of the intervention, but I ask noble Lords to ensure, if we are serious about these industries and their value to our economy, that either we have the current Clause 17 or something very like it or we stop pretending that we intend to protect these industries.</p>

I think that that has been misunderstood by several people who are very concerned about the economics of this-particularly, and I fully agree, the economics of producing things that require a lot of capital input, such as films, sports, games and music, which are expensive to put together and put on. I am not challenging the idea of trying to protect copyright. My challenge comes when someone says, "We've got to do something". The law is not here for PR purposes. It is not about sending a message. Laws have to be effective or they are pointless.

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="100126100000061"></a>It has always been realised that copyright is much weaker than other rights. Patents get only 30 years to recover because they are better protected and easier to enforce; the whole law is orientated that way. Copyright is a harder right to enforce, particularly because you can get copyright both in the original work and in derivative works. It is a much more complicated situation. That is why copyright now gets lifetime plus, I think, 70 years, which is probably excessive-a very long period in which to recover your initial investment. I worry, like the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, about effectiveness. Will this work or not?</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="100126100000062"></a>Unfortunately the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, is not here to hear my next point: camcorders are covered perfectly well. It is unlawful, it is a breach of copyright, to take a camcorder into a cinema and make a copy of a film. This Bill does not cover that at all; it is about communicating and distributing over the internet. If you put that camcorder copy out over the internet for free on whatever network, the Bill will cover it. If you sell that copy, it becomes a criminal offence and comes under the Fraud Act. The law is there already to deal with camcorders and I am delighted to hear that people who do these things have been prosecuted under it, as they should have been. The existing law is adequate.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="100126100000063"></a>I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, that the situation is a mess. That is our problem. I have said for a long time that we need to rewrite the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, which is not right for the digital age. It will be a complicated process; any new Act will have to balance a lot of rights and look at the international aspects, such as how other countries do it and what is effective, so that we are not just doing our own thing. That needs to be done at a parliamentary level, not just by a Minister in consultation with people whom he thinks should be consulted.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="100126100000064"></a>I come on to the wise words of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. What exactly is modifying that Act going to do? It is not going to cure technical points, because I do not think that the Act deals with such points-unless we want to put a whole technical section into it, which would be a very strange thing to do. The Act could in fact be used to loosen copyright, which might be a good idea, so that mashups, for instance, were no longer a grey area. I could take a short clip from one of the films of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, overlay it with a bit of music by one of the noble Lords here, put my own content underneath it and put it on YouTube, at which point I would have breached maybe three copyrights. This is going on the whole time. Because it is so general, at the moment the question is, "Where's the copyright?". Maybe the Minister has secret ambitions to do that behind the scenes; I do not know.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="100126100000065"></a>I cannot understand why the Act is modified in the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Triesman, talked about Napster, but Napster was always unlawful; it was always covered by the law. Trying to change the copyright Act would have made no difference to Napster at all. The 1988 Act predated Napster, so it was covered. We did not have to change any part of the law. If we had had to change it, Napster would be operating in Britain right now quite legally, because we have not  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1367"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1367</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>changed the law to cover it. It has always been unlawful to download stuff in that way. That is exactly what we are dealing with now.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="100126100000066"></a>The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 is adequate for dealing with these things. The challenge arises because rights holders could not keep up with the variety of material that was being transmitted over the internet. That is what the Bill is for: to try to introduce some measures whereby it is easier to offload some of the problems of trying to catch up with the people responsible on to those who can track them-that is, the ISPs-and then use some legal process in order to crack down on them, doing in a different way some of the things that are normally done through the civil courts as a breach of copyright. The Government have started to interfere in civil law by producing measures where they are going to mandate a crackdown. That is an interesting precedent because it can be used elsewhere for other things that the Government do not like, which is why I do not like the provisions between Clauses 4 and 16. Clause 17 is even more dangerous.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="100126100000067"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, has talked about Britain almost as if it were a sea of piracy in an otherwise law-abiding world: if we do not pass a law that lets us crack down on this, Britain will be isolated, all the creative people will abandon it and so on. But America is just as bad, as is the rest of the world. The French have failed to get a similar measure through. They still hope to, but it got knocked out by the French Parliament-Sarkozy did not get his way. I may have the right players in there, I may not, but it does not matter; I do not think that the French got the "three strikes and you're out" clause through, although they are hoping to bring it back and get it through. Sweden does not have such measures-it did not dare go that far. It sent some letters and there has been a bit of a crackdown, but levels are back up where they were. We are not an isolated case.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="100126100000068"></a>It will make zero difference where anyone locates themselves. Our creative people will still face the challenges that they do now: to get the right contract from day one with the people who will sponsor them or, if they do not get a nice contract or do not get someone to sponsor them, how to get out there into the wider world, get their stuff on to the internet and find other methods of distribution.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="100126100000069"></a>Now I come on to Clause 17. I wanted to put in context why the clause is totally unnecessary and may have all sorts of unintended consequences that will be very dangerous. Even the super-affirmative method of bringing statutory instruments is dangerous. Look at the Government's general dismissive attitude to 90 per cent of our suggested amendments. Will that be any different just because there is a super-affirmative statutory instrument? No, it will not, because they do not have to amend anything. We cannot force any amendments through; at the end of the day, we have to accept it.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="100126100000070"></a>The previous time when I ran into this business of trying to block statutory instruments, which was over the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act when we forced through an amendment that meant that the Government would have to come back within a year with a better statutory instrument, there were mutterings off that this was a constitutional crisis, this was not the way that things should be done, it was going  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1368"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1368</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>against the whole way that Parliament worked and so on. We were threatened behind the scenes and told that we should not be doing it; it would bring the place down. The Minister was so frightened that he spent 25 minutes trying to introduce a minor statutory instrument.</p>

<a name="100126-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="100126100000071"></a>Anyway, these powers are far too wide, they are quite unnecessary and I cannot see any purpose to them-except possibly to start putting mandatory charges on people because it allows us to impose charges, fees and so on, but that is not the sort of thing that the Act should be for. If we are worried about amending things, I note that we manage to have a criminal justice Bill every year to amend huge tranches of legislation and we seem to have an education Bill about every two years. Maybe the Home Office could give up some of its Bills and we could just sort out copyright.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="100126100000073"></a>I am sure that he did not mean to do it, but to my mind the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, argued strongly in favour of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, because if things move so quickly, the 90-day window asked for by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, will be meaningless. It will all have happened. If it is all going to happen anyway, why are we giving these extraordinary powers to the Secretary of State and not retaining Parliament as the ultimate arbiter of what happens?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="100126100000074"></a>We have had a lot of comment today on how the creative industries are being wrecked. The games industry grosses more than the cinema industry now. I said to the managing director of Nintendo, which after all is one of the biggest games things in the world, "What are your views on illegal activities?" I was privileged-I got number one interpreter, I could have had number one, two, three or five but I got number one for this important question. He said, "Could you do something about Spain and China?" I did not like to tell him that my influence in the United Kingdom is pretty abysmal, but when you get to China it is absolutely sub-zero. However, they said that because it is illegal in these countries and we are putting in provisions like these, they sell enough to make the whole thing work. Therefore, from his point of view-I am not saying whether he was right or wrong-he was not worried.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="100126100000075"></a>As my noble friend Lord Lucas said, ultimately the only thing that will stop all this is the right goods being supplied at the right price, so that there is no incentive to get hold of illegal copies and illegal things. I am told that it will not stop those who try to get the new movie out, because for them the game is to get it first. It is not commercial: the fun is to get it first. I am told that if you go to screenings-the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, will know this much better than I do-for previews of films for BAFTA or something like that, there are people standing in the room with infrared detectors to see whether anybody is filming and to try and stop this game from happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="100126100000076"></a>It may be that we are seeing an evolution. Far be it from me to say, but apparently young people now go and visit the same film four or five times. It is an outing, and that is what gives this impetus to films such as "Avatar" which are getting these huge grosses: people go and it is their form of fun.</p>

<a name="100126100000077"></a><b><a name="100126-0012.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="100126100000153"></a>Lord Lucas:</b> My Lords, I should be very grateful if the noble Lord could enlarge on why he thinks the solutions to this problem lie in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act. It seems that copyright is quite clear on this: somebody is either making copyright material available for purchase without payment or permission of the copyright owner, or they are acquiring material knowing that the copyright owner is not to be paid. Dealing with that effectively is all about the sort of mechanisms we are putting into the Communications Act, which seems a sensible place to have a power to vary what we can do by way of enforcement under the Act. Why are we meddling with copyright? What changes to copyright can be imagined that help the sort of things that might happen?</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="100126100000078"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, said, Napster came up and was a surprise to us all, but the principle was the same. We would not have needed to change copyright to deal with Napster or anything like it. We do not need to go at copyright in a big way, nor have we been, to deal with peer-to-peer. The fundamental human actions are the same. All we need to do is make them clearly illegal and find ways of preventing them in the world outside. The copyright remains the same.</p>

<a name="100126100000079"></a><b><a name="100126-0012.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="100126100000154"></a>Lord Triesman:</b> My Lords, I appreciate the noble Lord giving way just before sitting down. I think the point I have tried to make has been misconstrued. It is not that you cannot capture some of these activities using current copyright law; it is that the rate of technical advance produces circumstances which may make that very cloudy and difficult to enforce. They are also difficult to project.</p>

<p><a name="st_226"></a>
<a name="100126100000080"></a><b><a name="100126-0012.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="100126100000155"></a>Lord Whitty:</b> My Lords, I promise not to repeat what I said in the previous debate. There are two issues here.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="100126100000081"></a>First, if Clause 17 stays as it is, it is a matter of great controversy in this House. Whether the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, moves his amendment tonight or a debate is staged I would have to support it if the Bill stays the same. However, I was comforted by what the Minister said in response to the previous group of amendments. He said that he would look at the point again. I would suggest that he looks at it again in two forms and promises to do that at the end of this debate.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="100126100000082"></a>The first aspect is that the way in which Clause 17 is drafted in relation to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act is very wide. Part 1 of the Act itself is very wide and subsection (4) of this clause makes it even wider by referring to other enactments "whenever made". That needs to be narrowed down very significantly. Even if we accept that to some extent we have to future technology-proof the provisions we have here, the provision could be narrowed significantly and it would then be more acceptable to the House, particularly with a super-affirmative resolution.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1370"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1370</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100126-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="100126100000083"></a>The other aspect is the fundamental approach. I say to my noble friend Lord Triesman and to the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, who is no longer in his place, that the long-term health of the creative industries depends on us moving to a legal form of access to the copyright which they control. Clampdowns, crackdowns and prosecution through the civil courts or through the new system will not return a penny to the copyright holders.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="100126100000084"></a>The whole purpose of any change ought to be to move to legal systems and new, legal business models. If we could change the copyright law or any other law to enable that system to be slotted in more easily, perhaps we could use something like Clause 17 to do so. However, if Clause 17 is concerned only with extending crackdown provisions on unlawful file-sharing arrangements to other prospective and actual technologies, I still will not be able to support it. If it was more positive and narrower, then when the Minister comes back with a revised clause he might meet with less hostility. For the moment, I would have to support opposition to the clause were it pursued and the Minister did not give me the comfort I seek.</p>

<a name="100126100000085"></a><b><a name="100126-0012.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="100126100000156"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> My Lords, I rise briefly in support of what was said by my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="100126100000086"></a>I have listened with great interest to this debate on what we ought to do. I was waiting to hear from the experts we have in this Chamber exactly what perils they think could be dealt with by the technological developments that are going to be covered by the operation of Clause 17, if it is implemented. I was very interested that the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, both of whom are experts in this debate, came down on the side of my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones and do not think that this is necessary. If there were perils that we ought to look forward to in the future, I am sure that, having listened to the noble Earl and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, over the past three, four or five days of a lifetime, they would have brought them up, but they have not done so. They feel that such perils cannot be forecast.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="100126100000087"></a>I hesitate to go against-I almost said my noble friend Lord Triesman, having just placed money on England winning the World Cup. I hesitate to go against him, because if he was wrong about Napster-as of course he was, as the noble Earl demonstrated-perhaps he is wrong about England winning the World Cup. He was certainly wrong about Napster, because as everybody has indicated, Napster, as an example of such a peril, would have been caught by the existing law.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="100126100000088"></a>I want to make a very straightforward point. I do not have to declare an interest, but over the years I have been involved in advising media companies. For years those companies have wanted legislation to be passed to deal with the perils with which this Bill deals. What has happened? The Tory Government did nothing; the Labour Government did nothing. Now, right at the end and shortly before the election, the Government come up with a Bill to deal with a problem that has been there for years and years. Suddenly, surprise, surprise, they want to put a clause in that says, "By the way, if we have got it wrong, we want to be able to make a statutory instrument to amend it in  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1371"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1371</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the future". This is not a new problem. All these perils around technological developments and breaches of copyright have been going on for years. No Government have done anything about them, but suddenly the Government say, "We are going to do something about it now, but we want also to take the power to change it".</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="100126100000089"></a>I tell the Committee something else. The Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill has been going on for years and years. Why do the Government not put a clause in the Bill that says, "Oh, by the way, we are going to amend the constitution, but we might get it wrong so let us put in the power to amend it again by the affirmative resolution process?". Why do the Government not do that? That is the point of this Bill and that is why we oppose Clause 17.</p>

<p><a name="st_228"></a>
<a name="100126100000090"></a><b><a name="100126-0012.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="100126100000157"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> My Lords, we have had another interesting debate. Given the time, I will do my best to address the points that were made without going on for too long. I shall try not to repeat much of what we have covered on a previous occasion, but some repetition will be inevitable.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="100126100000091"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, suggested that the amendments we are proposing will not help at all and that the Constitution Committee's report said that the government amendments would widen the scope of Clause 17. We do not agree with that assertion. Clause 17 enables the Secretary of State to make provision to amend Part 1 of the 1988 Act,</p>
<ul><a name="100126100000130"></a>"for the purpose of preventing or reducing the infringement of copyright by means of the internet ... having regard to technological developments that have occurred or are likely to occur".</ul>
<p><a name="100126100000103"></a>Government Amendment 211A provides that the Secretary of State can act only if he is satisfied that the infringement in question is having a serious adverse effect and that making the amendment is a proportionate response. There would, of course, have to be evidence to validate and support that. It was further suggested that Clause 17 would allow the definition of "copyright" to be amended. I make it clear that this is not a power to make sweeping changes to the nature of copyright or to what constitutes copyright infringement. The limitation not to amend any criminal offence means that no change can be made to what constitutes infringement, but the measure could be used to help us to protect creators of all types from having their work unfairly exploited without their permission. This power will be used only where new technologies or new services are being used in such a way as to cause serious adverse effects to the rights of others which cannot be tackled under the existing legislation or by the mechanisms in Clauses 4 to 16. The power cannot be used to change what is and is not considered an infringement under copyright law. Therefore, consumers need not worry; behaviour which is considered reasonable and lawful now will not be restricted in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="100126100000092"></a>Recently, I read a biography of Samuel Johnson which contained a gem of information; namely, that the first copyright Act occurred in 1709, so just over 300 years have passed since then. Further, the journal of his <I>J</I><I>ourney to the Western Isles</I> was very popular and five editions were produced fairly quickly. However, noble Lords will be pleased to hear that it was pirated almost immediately in Ireland, so plus ça change in this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="100126100000093"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, took chunks out of the wonderful work of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. "Chariots of Erroll" is a frightening concept. My noble friend Lord Triesman gave some good examples. Noble Lords may not have liked the example that was given of the Napster case. However, it demonstrated that the passage from concept to mass usage-and mass usage on a global scale-was exceedingly fast. That is the point there. The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, said that this measure was not necessary because we cannot forecast what will happen. However, a number of potential threats have been forecast in this debate; for example, from cyberlockers, streaming or torrents. We know that such phenomena are developed very quickly.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="100126100000094"></a>My noble friend Lord Whitty asked me to consider the issue of narrowing. I have already given a commitment to look at that concern. Can we narrow this down significantly? Can we change the system to enable new legal business models to develop? Of course, we want to encourage that. However, I am not sure whether we can incorporate it in legislation. The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, said that we cannot use legislation to send messages. However, we do intend to send messages. I thought we were agreed on that. We said that we were trying to change behaviour and that we agreed on a graduated response. That graduated response means that, in the first instance, we will be sending messages and trying to change behaviour. If people do not respond to that, we shall move to the deterrent element. However, we do not want hundreds of thousands of people to go to the courts and become involved in an expensive and unnecessary procedure. Therefore, I am puzzled by the notion that we cannot send a message.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="100126100000095"></a>As I said, I am conscious of the time. I do not want to try to cover everything that we covered last time. However, the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, once again referred to draconian measures for internet service providers. The Secretary of State cannot just dream this up. First, we shall look to Ofcom to provide a report. We will look for a basis of evidence. Whether or not we think that the super-affirmative procedure is exactly right, if the Secretary of State wants that to go through both Houses, there will have to be evidence to sustain that.</p>

He used that phrase to inspire us all in thinking that this was the future, that things were changing at an incredible pace, that we could not keep up and that we needed firm guidance from No 10, DCMS, DBIS, or whatever government department was involved. We were given the impression that we were powerless in the face of this changing technology. The fact is that we have seen enormous changes in technology over the past 10 to 20 years. How much has copyright law changed in that period? The principles of copyright law are as applicable now as they were then. Frankly, this is an attempt to corral us into a constitutionally inappropriate way of changing the law. We have the fast track, which has now been validated by the Video Recordings Bill, and was referred to by the Constitution Committee. Why can we not use that? I did not feel that the Minister answered that properly.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="100126100000099"></a>Throughout our discussions on the Bill, I have heard very clearly what the noble Lords, Lord Triesman and Lord Puttnam, had to say. Of course, we cannot tell what the future will hold in terms of technological changes. The point is that it is much more about enforcement than it is about actual infringement and underlying copyright. We may have talked at length about the precise form of Clauses 4 to 16 but they will give copyright owners and creative industries far more leverage over internet infringement than they have ever had before. Changing copyright is not necessary. Until the Minister can demonstrate why cyberlockers are not covered, why all the other technological changes and ways of delivering and infringing are not covered by current copyright, I do not think that he has made the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="100126100000100"></a>I thought that what the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, said about Clauses 4 to 16 effectively being a new substitute for the civil courts was entirely right. It is pioneering stuff and that is why we have spent so long over it. That is the essence of this Bill. Clause 17 is quite irrelevant to all that. The point was made that we can argue about orders; we can have debates about them; we can have the super-affirmative; we can have 60 days consultation or 90 days consultation. When I tabled my Motion of Regret, which made sure that the casino in east Manchester was not built, the Conservative Front Bench-I give credit to the Conservative Back Benches-was advised that it was constitutionally inappropriate for it to support my Motion. I understood that and I luckily was able-with the aid of the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury whose assistance does not come very often, at least not to me-to persuade a large number of Back Benchers in the cause. That was highly unusual. I do not believe that the position would change in the future. It is one of those things. The Front Benches are very reluctant to put their weight against a properly consulted over order. They cannot amend it, but nevertheless those are the constitutional proprieties. I am afraid that this nowhere matches primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="100126110000001"></a><b>Baroness Crawley:</b> My Lords, the two statutory instruments before us today form part of a package of changes to the regulation of exempt charities, following on from the Charities Act 2006. While the general law of charity applies to exempt charities, they, unlike other charities, are exempt from many provisions of the Charities Act 1993. Notably, they cannot register with the Charity Commission and are outside the scope of its supervisory powers. There is currently no specific regulatory mechanism in force to promote or ensure their compliance with charity law.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="100126110000002"></a>The 2002 Strategy Unit Review on charities and not-for-profits found that the position of exempt charities was anomalous, confusing for the public and a threat to the integrity of charitable status. It made recommendations for improving the regulation of exempt charities as charities-including the proposal that existing "main regulators" should be sought where possible to take on a charity oversight role in addition to their existing regulatory role.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="100126110000003"></a>On public consultation, the majority of respondents agreed with the principle that exempt charities should be regulated as charities. The Government considered it appropriate that in return for the significant benefits of charitable status all charities should be regulated as charities. The key issue was how to achieve this while recognising that many exempt charities were already sufficiently regulated in one way or another-albeit not as charities.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="100126110000004"></a>In accepting the Strategy Unit's recommendation, the Government set out their aim of establishing arrangements that would impose the minimum of extra bureaucracy, but at the same time secure greater accountability of, and charity law compliance by, exempt charities. We sought, in line with the Strategy Unit's  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1375"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1375</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>recommendation, to do this by identifying for each group of exempt charities an existing main regulator that could become principal regulator. The principal regulator would be under a new duty to promote charity law compliance by those charities.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="100126110000005"></a>Some have questioned the principal regulator approach, suggesting instead that all exempt charities should lose exempt status and come directly under the Charity Commission's regulation. However, we need to balance this view against the additional regulatory burden that would result-many consultation responses were from exempt charities which were concerned about being over-burdened by regulation, or answering to multiple regulators. Most of the concerns raised during debate on the exempt charities provisions of the Charities Bill were seeking to minimise the burden of regulation of exempt charities. The principal regulator approach was well supported as a means of doing this. That is why we have pursued the principal regulator approach.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="100126110000006"></a>Where a suitable principal regulator could not be identified, exempt status would be removed from the relevant charities. These charities would be required to register with the commission if their gross annual income exceeded a specified financial threshold-currently £100,000. Parliament agreed to the making of these changes by passing the Charities Act 2006.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="100126110000007"></a>In the 2006 Act, Parliament also agreed to increase the Charity Commission's powers in respect of exempt charities. Importantly, the Charity Commission must consult the relevant principal regulator before exercising any regulatory powers in relation to an exempt charity.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="100126110000008"></a>These provisions of the 2006 Act will be implemented and changes made under them in several tranches. The two SIs being debated tonight form part of the first of those tranches. The provisions are being implemented in tranches to recognise the readiness of different groups of exempt charities and principal regulators, and to help the Charity Commission manage the registration of charities ceasing to be exempt.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="100126110000009"></a>The draft Charities Act 2006 (Changes in Exempt Charities) Order will remove exempt status from certain groups of exempt charity. The groups affected are: the colleges and halls in the Universities of Cambridge and Durham; the colleges in the University of Oxford; higher education institutions in Wales which are currently exempt charities; charitable institutions connected with the institutions that I have just mentioned which are currently exempt charities; and the Board of Governors of the Museum of London. These changes are made because a suitable principal regulator could not been identified. The changes do not affect the charitable status of these institutions. Separate regulations will be made to ensure that, subject to the £100,000 threshold, they are exempted from the requirement to register with the Charity Commission.</p>

<a name="100126-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="100126110000010"></a>The order will also confer exempt status on certain charities connected with the British Library Board. This change is considered desirable to ensure that they are appropriately regulated for charity law compliance. It will mean that their charity law compliance will be promoted by the same person who promotes it for the British Library Board; namely, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="100126110000011"></a>I hope that we have already been able to provide the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, with some reassurances about the impact of these instruments on the Eccles Centre for American Studies in the British Library. In 2003, at the request of several charities closely associated with the British Library, the Charity Commission made a uniting direction to help simplify their administration and regulation. The result of this direction is that they are treated as part of the British Library Board and thus within the scope of its exempt status. The charities are, as a result, currently out of scope of the Charity Commission's regulation. As far as the charities covered by the uniting direction are concerned, we would expect some or all of them to become exempt charities in their own right as a result of the amendment to paragraph (za) of Schedule 2 to the 1993 Act proposed in Article 2(7) of the draft order. We do not expect this change to have any significant practical effect for the charities concerned.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="100126110000012"></a>We cannot provide such a cast-iron guarantee that other charities apparently connected to the British Library Board will not be affected by this provision. However, the Charity Commission has said that charities governed independently from the British Library Board and able to make their own decisions about what projects or activities they will fund or support will not be considered by it to be exempt and will still be required to register with the commission.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="100126110000013"></a>The draft order also makes a number of minor provisions to ensure a smooth transition from one status to another. They deal for example with the preparation of accounts for the current financial year and ongoing charity proceedings and land transactions.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="100126110000014"></a>The draft Charities Act 2006 (Principal Regulators of Exempt Charities) Regulations prescribe principal regulators for three groups of exempt charities: the Higher Education Funding Council for England for higher education institutions in England and their connected institutions; the Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport for the boards of trustees of the museums and galleries and their connected institutions; and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for the board of trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and its connected institutions.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="100126110000015"></a>The regulations do not give the principal regulators any new powers to intervene in the affairs of the charities for which they are responsible. If charity law problems arise, it will be for the Charity Commission to exercise its regulatory powers at the invitation of the principal regulator. Some have questioned whether proposed principal regulators that are also funders may be too conflicted to take on the principal regulator role. We have considered this carefully with the proposed principal regulators. These bodies have existing oversight roles alongside their funding roles. The fact that these bodies already have this oversight role complements the role of principal regulator. We do not believe there is an inherent conflict between the two roles. However, if a conflict of interest were to arise, it could be effectively identified and managed by the relevant principal regulator, with advice from the Charity Commission.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="100126110000016"></a>The duty of the principal regulators will be forward-looking. They will be required only to promote compliance  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1377"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1377</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with the charity trustees' charity law obligations arising on, after, or ongoing at, the commencement date. The Charity Commission will be in a similar position.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="100126110000017"></a>The Office of the Third Sector, the Home Office and the Charity Commission have been closely engaged with stakeholders on these issues since 2003, when discussions began with the various groups of exempt charities and their existing regulators to identify potential principal regulators. This resulted in a list of proposed principal regulators being published alongside the draft Charities Bill in May 2004. Since then, discussions have continued and, for the purposes of this tranche, the Office of the Third Sector and the commission have consulted with the proposed principal regulators and bodies representing the groups of charities that will be affected by the SIs and, in many cases, the individual charities themselves. Early drafts of the SIs were shared with these bodies for comment last year.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="100126110000018"></a>There is expected to be little, if any, noticeable impact on those exempt charities for which a principal regulator is appointed. Their existing regulatory regime will continue, but with their regulator also promoting charity law compliance. For example, they will account and report as now without any duplication of reporting to the Charity Commission. An impact is likely to be felt only if something seriously goes wrong and the principal regulator needs to call on the Charity Commission to intervene. However, charities under the principal regulator regime are likely to benefit from guidance on charity law issues, including guidance tailored for sector-specific issues.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="100126110000019"></a>There will, however, be some costs for charities that cease to be exempt and have to register with the Charity Commission. We and the commission have worked to minimise any additional burden of regulation. The commission does not charge fees for its services and, to make the registration process as straightforward as possible, has already started working with charities that will cease to be exempt. However, we accept that there could be some indirect one-off costs for the charities that have to register.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="100126110000020"></a>There will also be additional one-off costs for all charities that cease to be exempt and own registered land, or for which such land is held on trust. This is because they will need to pay for Land Registry records to be updated to reflect the restrictions on their ability to dispose of that land. These restrictions do not apply to exempt charities. These costs were not anticipated at the time of the original impact assessment and have come to our attention since the SIs were laid in draft. As a result, it is not possible to give an exact costing arising for each charity. I understand, however, that the fees currently payable to update the register are £50 for the first three registered titles affected, and £25 per subsequent title affected. We have discussed with the Land Registry the possibility of these fees being waived or reduced. However, the Land Registry depends upon the fees it charges customers to cover its costs and these applications will be treated in the normal way.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="100126110000021"></a>There will also be some annual costs for charities that cease to be exempt. Registered charities must submit an annual return to the Charity Commission. The cost of preparing this is estimated to be £32 in the  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1378"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1378</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>first year and up to £23 in subsequent years, or up to £124 for charities with incomes over £1 million which have to provide a more detailed summary information return. These can all be completed online. No extra costs are anticipated in relation to the preparation or scrutiny of accounts, but these will have to be sent to the commission each year-again something which can be done online to simplify the process.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="100126110000022"></a>Charities ceasing to be exempt will, like other non-exempt charities, have to prepare a trustees' annual report. The commission has estimated the annual cost to formerly exempt charities required to register as ranging from £287 to £534, depending on the size of the charity. No other costs are anticipated for charities which cease to be exempt.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="100126110000023"></a>The Charity Commission has developed memoranda of understanding with each of the principal regulators to be appointed in this tranche, and is also establishing a committee of principal regulators which will meet regularly to share best practice and ensure consistency. The commission also publishes guidance on its website about the forthcoming changes in relation to the regulation of the exempt charities, including guidance on registration for those charities that will be required to register.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="100126110000024"></a>The effectiveness of these provisions, and the impact of the changes on exempt charities, will be evaluated as part of the statutory review of the Charities Act, due to begin next year. These SIs will in part bring about changes that were initially approved by Parliament during the passage of the Charities Bill 2006. I believe they will achieve the balance of improving the accountability of, and charity law compliance by, exempt charities while keeping the regulatory burden to a minimum. I expect these measures will increase public confidence in exempt charities, and in the sector as a whole. I therefore strongly commend them to the House. I beg to move.</p>

In speaking to these and to my Motion I will concentrate on the major issues. I do not believe the House will be particularly interested, or indeed particularly troubled, by some of the minor issues to which the Minister referred.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="100126110000026"></a>First, I must declare interests. I was at Magdalen College, Oxford, which will willingly give up its exemption under the changes order, and until recently was a trustee of Magdalen's development foundation, which is a registered charity. I was, some years ago, the chairman of the trustees of Kew Gardens and on the board of Kew's foundation and friends. I am a founder friend of Kew. I am a member of the advisory council to the Eccles Centre for American Studies at the British Library, as was mentioned by the Minister, and a member of the British Library's friends. I have no particular problems with the consolidating arrangement that was made by, and with the approval of, the Charity Commission for those charities at the British Library. There are, however, issues which arise out of the friends of the British Library which I think are quite important. All of those charities are affected by one or other or both of these instruments, and I am also a member of the friends of several others of those affected institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="100126110000027"></a>I would say straight away that I fully accept that Parliament passed the 2006 Act and that it enabled Ministers to do the things they are proposing. However, Parliament did not agree to this particular solution. There were options and they remain in the 2006 Act and in my view, and I hope to develop this argument, there was a much more elegant solution or series of solutions. I would also say that although I am no longer a member of the Merits Committee, I was when these instruments were first laid in July. They were then withdrawn and we are now considering their replacements.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="100126110000028"></a>They need to be seen in context. The number of charities affected is quite small even though the Charity Commission is the regulator of 160,000 charities, in fact some estimates are even larger than that. Whatever is done with these instruments, we need to remember that the primary responsibility for the regulation of the sector rests with the Charity Commission. The issues raised by these instruments are complex and significant and it is their importance and complexity which makes me so critical of the decision recorded in the bald statement in paragraphs 8 of each explanatory memorandum. They state that the regulations,</p>
<ul><a name="100126110000186"></a>"have not been the subject of formal public consultation".</ul>
<a name="100126-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="100126110000029"></a>In her summary of the position, the Minister referred to the Strategy Unit and to the discussions and the recommendations that were made in the pre-legislative period up to 2004 and perhaps, in the final analysis, a revision of the documents in 2005. That is a long time ago, and I know of no precedent where the implementation of an Act through statutory instruments is dependent on the pre-legislative scrutiny and the processes that were undertaken at that time. It is this that makes me so critical of the decision not to hold a formal public consultation. At the time, the Cabinet Office had responsibility for the better regulation agenda. It is inexcusable that it broke its own rules. Public consultation was a necessity under those rules. Instead, the explanatory memoranda continue to rely on the work done between 2001 and 2004. This was incomplete, and at the time revealed sharply differing opinions among the 60 respondents, whose responses clearly showed that both exemption and the possibility that sponsoring departments could become charity law regulators were highly contentious issues. There was then, as there is now, a compelling case for further consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="100126110000030"></a>There is also a compelling case for an up-to-the-minute regulatory impact assessment, based on the data accumulated since the passing of the 2006 Act. Of course there are some registration costs that can be calculated; but if we are changing the regulatory responsibilities of significant bodies, it behoves us to have a sensitivity analysis. I doubt whether the Charity Commission has had any experience of dealing with charities such as the Oxford colleges, some of which have been going for rather a long time and have statutes and ways of doing things that are quite particular. I have heard that there are already issues between the Charity Commission and an Oxford college or two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="100126110000031"></a>The need for a regulatory impact assessment based on the data for the 2006 Act also leads to needing the data on the Companies Act 2006. I will return to this

Therefore, they come under two regimes and must satisfy both. Many institutions affected by these orders have related companies limited by guarantee. Any change in regime is likely to cost money, even if it is only fees for prudent legal and accounting advice. This is another matter that has gone unmentioned in the explanatory memoranda.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="100126110000032"></a>It has been equally clear for the past three years that there were bodies-for example, the NCVO, the Charity Law Association and leading firms of accountants and lawyers-with far greater knowledge of the voluntary and charitable sector than the newly formed Office of the Third Sector. It was forgotten that the issues that arise when changes are made to charity law are always complex. Well presented evidence needs to be explained, most notably evidence from the Charity Commission, which is the most involved and experienced adviser available. We lack that evidence. Instead, we have draft regulations, sketchily explained and unilaterally imposed by the Cabinet Office on behalf of the Office of the Third Sector, without public consultation or regulatory impact assessment.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="100126110000033"></a>It is not too late for the important issues that arise to be properly and publicly discussed, because two further steps are needed before the instruments come into effect. A 2006 commencement order is needed, as is a further set of regulations under Section 3A of the 1993 Act, as set out in paragraph 4.6 of the explanatory memorandum. There is time for further consideration.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="100126110000034"></a>The first important issue to consider is that of regulation itself. The 2006 Act makes it possible to opt for more than one way forward. While it enables the appointment of regulators other than the Charity Commission, it is equally possible to make the commission the sole regulator. The sole regulator option was preferred, for example, by national museums directors-who are pretty directly involved in what is happening with these instruments-by the Museums Association and by the Charity Law Association. One strong argument that they made was that since the public well understood the role of the Charity Commission, it would be confusing, and thus damaging to public confidence, were other regulators to become involved. I agree strongly with the proposition that bringing in Secretaries of State as regulators is not good for public confidence. These witnesses volunteered their views: there has never been public consultation, with targeted questions aimed at discovering the response either to Secretaries of State or to the Higher Education Funding Council for England becoming principal regulators. Nor has there been a formal response to the simplifying suggestion that all charities should be registered with the Charity Commission. The Minister has not given us an answer to that tonight either. It remains unclear why the Government have not followed up that suggestion and I shall return to that later when discussing Kew Gardens. Although I shall now note that simplification and a level playing field are the principle arguments made, and convincingly made, for removing exemption from university colleges and thus bringing them within regulation by the Charity Commission, to argue that something is good here but bad there smacks of cherry picking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="100126110000035"></a>The second issue is the complex one of friends' organisations. I shall be brief. They are most commonly companies limited by guarantee and registered charities. There is a question mark over their heads when the institution with which they are friends becomes exempt and is regulated by someone other than the Charity Commission. Given the combination of primary charity and company law with the secondary legislation which attaches to both, the question is whether a particular friends' organisation is legally exempt. If it were, it would be required to de-register from the Charity Commission under the terms of the 1993 Act, as amended by the 2006 Act. That loss of its charity number would raise all kinds of questions with the members of the friends. For example, what happens to gift aid? Again, public confidence will be damaged. I was hoping to be able to welcome the Minister's assurance that it is government policy that friends' organisations will, without doubt, remain registered charities. I would welcome a further assurance that if, by some unintended consequence, present legislation, including these orders, determines that a friends' organisation-for example, the Friends of the British Library-had no choice but to become exempt, will the Government agree to take steps to introduce measures which ensure that present policy prevails and registration with the Charity Commission is maintained?</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="100126110000036"></a>Thirdly, I shall refer to Kew in more detail. Kew is to be an exempt charity, with Defra as its principal regulator. Defra provides Kew with its annual grant from public funds under Treasury rules. Since way back in 2002-03, objections have been raised to the principal involved in a sponsoring department also being a Charities Act regulator. I really do not think that the Minister gave us an adequate justification for dealing with the argument that there will be a conflict of interest. These representations in any public sense have gone unanswered. Is there a better answer?</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="100126110000037"></a>Matters become more complicated if we move on to consider the Foundation and Friends of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew. As it is a registered charity-No. 803428-the Charity Commission is the regulator and will remain so. The foundation and friends organisation is incredibly important to Kew and I think it transferred £10 million to the Royal Botanic Gardens last year. The commission will also have rights and duties toward Defra, the other regulator, as the Minister mentioned under Schedule 5 to the 2006 Act. Furthermore, the board of Kew, members of which also serve on the foundation board, will be in a triangular relationship: Defra, the Charity Commission and themselves in two guises, which is likely to be a recipe for trouble. Those who favour the commission as the regulator of all charities certainly have a point. There are other institutions on the list in similar situations.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="100126110000038"></a>Consideration of this point leads to a question to Ministers. Under the provisions of Section 11(12) of the 2006 Act, the Minister can only-the "only" is there-make an order if she is satisfied that it is desirable in the interests of ensuring appropriate or effective regulation. No evidence has been included in the explanatory material to show how that test of appropriateness or effectiveness is met. If there were consultation, I guess that there would be a school of  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1382"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1382</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>thought saying "inappropriate", and surely there is effectiveness already. What is the case for saying that the test is met?</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="100126110000039"></a>Finally, I believe that the Office of the Third Sector has shown a fine disregard for Parliament's amendments to the Bill. The office's case for these orders depends on work done when the Home Office was responsible and its reliance on that work ignores Parliament's decision during the passage of the Bill to include Section 6(4) which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a><a name="100126110000147"></a>"In the exercise of its functions the Commission shall not be subject to the direction or control of any Minister of the Crown or other government department".</p>

<p><a name="100126110000145"></a>In laying these orders, which alter the Commission's responsibilities without securing the Commission's expressed agreement, the Government must be sailing close to the Section 6(4) wind and thus not meeting Parliament's decision that the Commission should be truly and unusually independent. Will the Minister assure us that due regard will be paid to Section 6(4)?</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="100126110000040"></a>However, there may be more to it than this. My impression is that in some version of turf war between the Office of the Third Sector and the Commission, it is no surprise that the Commission is in the middle of 5 per cent cuts in its annual expenditure. Its resources are already slim and it carries a heavy responsibility, and, as Jane Austen knew, it is hard to be independent if you have no money. It may well be convenient for the Office of the Third Sector to forge ahead with its transformation role in support of public services, urged on by the Prime Minister, while sidelining the Commission, despite Parliament. This would go a long way to explaining a preference for other regulators, however inexperienced or inappropriate. It would also explain the absence of a regulatory impact assessment.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="100126110000041"></a>A great deal has changed since the 2001 Strategy Unit started on this story. We have a different Prime Minister, the Home Office has given way to the Office of the Third Sector in the Cabinet Office, the Cabinet Office has lost its regulatory responsibilities to BIS, and the re-established Charity Commission has had three years' experience of the widely welcomed 2006 Act. Everything tells us that it is time for fully open and compliant orders. These two instruments have been withdrawn once. They need to be withdrawn once more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="100126110000043"></a>Overall we try to apply the following test to regulations. Are they focused on the protection of patients and the public? Are they concerned with their safety? That is the prime reason for their existence. Is regulation fair? It must be seen to be fair or it will be resisted. Is it proportionate? It must not be heavy-handed or

Is it transparent? It needs to be open in its operation and structures, and consultation plays a very important role in that. Is it agile and flexible? Can it adapt to changing circumstances? Finally, is it good value? We must be aware of pressures on the public purse, especially at times like these.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="100126110000044"></a>I feel that the proposals before us tonight for regulating the exempt charities meet these criteria. Moreover, the proposals were widely consulted on and approved by most of those affected, although of course, that consultation took place some time ago. I should emphasise that if any discrepancy or bad practice is found, the regulators will have the power to refer to the Charity Commission, as my noble friend has told us, which will take the matter up.</p>

<a name="100126-0013.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="100126110000045"></a>I remind your Lordships that regulators liaise on matters affecting their client groups. They share best practice to ensure that there is no duplication. Such co-operation does not depend on legislation or on statutory instruments, but on the common-sense approach taken by regulators who know very well that the last thing we need is to have any activity regulated twice over if we are to avoid the bureaucracy which has concerned so many of us. Far from their sidelining the Charity Commission, it seems to me that these are sensible proposals, accepted by the Charity Commission. It is the beneficiaries-the public who use the institutions-whom we should have in mind. In my view, the proposals meet their needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="100126110000047"></a>I reiterate things as I see them. Clearly, we are being presented with two different types of charity. There is the registered charity, which, as everyone knows, has the Charity Commission umbrella. That umbrella gives comfort to trustees of charities. They know year by year, or when they make any requests of the Charity Commission, that they are on the right lines-assuming that they are. It also gives comfort to everyone else in the land to know that that umbrella is there. We then have the exempt charities. The reason that we are here is that they have not had that umbrella. Under the regulations, they will be lent the Charity Commission umbrella. The Charity Commission will take it back unto itself only if there are severe problems that need real investigation.</p>

<a name="100126-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="100126110000048"></a>Movement between the regimes is clearly suggested in the instruments, but the result is that exempt charities will be regulated with only one relationship. It seems to me that having only the one relationship with the Secretary of State, rather than also having an additional relationship, ought to be helpful and simplifying.</p>

<a name="100126-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="100126110000049"></a>I have a specific question. Under the regulations is the role of the responsible person, who is the new regulator. Can the Minister confirm that the only new responsibilities of that responsible person are to cover  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1384"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1384</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Charity Commission-type responsibilities, and that they do not bring with them any further form of interference that the trustees may not welcome?</p>

<a name="100126-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="100126110000050"></a>I listened carefully to the noble Viscount talk about the organisations and friends he belonged to. I should have thought that they would be under the Charity Commission. It seems to me that no one would be in that position unless there was a present relationship with the department. They have no other business to be there. The reason is that the department has a relationship with them, and it is sensible to lend to them the Charity Commissioner's relationship so that there is not another set of relationships, further accounts to be sent in, and so on.</p>

<a name="100126-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="100126110000051"></a>It is important that the regulations are agreed, in the sense that it is always important for the public to understand that charities are properly and clearly regulated. We only need one hiccup with a charity to affect other charities which have nothing to do with it with regard to the confidence that people have when giving money to charities and having a real understanding as to what charitable activity is. I believe, therefore, that these regulations will give further comfort in that the charitable sector-both the exempt and the registered charities-has the formal backstop of the Charity Commission, and I am happy to support the measures that have been put forward today.</p>

I also pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Eccles for his efforts and research in this area and I support him in his forensic analysis of the instruments before the House. Indeed, I venture to suggest that his expertise in this field, not only in terms of parliamentary draftsmanship, regulation and operation but also in charities as a whole, has helped all sides of the House in understanding the true nature, impact and reach of the measures before us. We have explored already the need for better consultation and the Government would do well to consult with my noble friend in these matters as often as possible as he clearly has significant expertise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="100126110000054"></a>I, too, have some reservations in regard to the processes of the regulation and the potential conflict of interest. I will mention these briefly as they have already been expressed by other speakers. But before I do it would be remiss of me if I did not put on record the admiration we have on all sides of the House for the charitable sector in this country and the enormous contribution it makes to the social capital of this nation. The British public can always be counted on to respond generously to the needs of others. We are one of the most generous and giving countries in the world and that makes me very proud. Even in the depths of the recession last year, people gave £10 billion to charitable causes, down just £1 billion from the previous peak.</p>

It is part of who we are and everybody who is involved in it needs appropriate tribute paid to their efforts. It behoves us, therefore, as has already been said, that this extraordinary generosity is underpinned with robust regulation of the way in which these funds are managed and spent so that confidence can be retained by the British public in the charities they give to.</p>

Under the Government's own initiatives in the better regulation proposals, legislation has to pass a 12-week consultation period. This has not taken place in this case. The consultation can sometimes be used by this Government as a kind of warm, inclusive phrase devoid of any real meaning and which has little or no influence on the eventual regulation itself. We can produce better regulation only if we engage substantively and meaningfully with those who have a better understanding, better experience and better knowledge of the legislation under consideration.</p>

It is the public whom we should seek to protect, and many stakeholders will be affected by this decision. I therefore wonder why the formal public consultation has been rejected in this context. Will the Minister explain that when she responds? This is especially important as there have been murmurs from those in the field that these government proposals are not wholly agreed with, despite evidence to the contrary.

I happen to be a passionate believer that the moment cannot come soon enough when the Lindisfarne Gospels, which were stolen from Durham Cathedral during the dissolution of the monasteries-by the Clerk of the Parliaments-and then sold for pecuniary gain to the British Library, are returned forthwith to their home with the great St Cuthbert in Durham Cathedral. That passionate belief is shared by a number of Members of this House. The noble Baroness, Lady Quin, has been very involved in this campaign, as has the noble Lord, Lord Foster. Should one of us at some stage in the future happen to become Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and still hold passionately that that egregious error should be corrected at the earliest possible opportunity, as the principal regulator of the British Library, could not pressure be brought to bear on the situation? That might be a hopeful scenario.</p>

I would like to provide further assurances to the noble Viscount. I know that he has concerns about the impact of the instruments on charities which are connected to exempt charities. With the exemption of charities connected to the British Library, these statutory instruments will not change the exempt or registered status of any charities connected to or associated with other exempt charities. For example, the Foundation and Friends of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, a registered charity, will be unaffected by these instruments and will remain a registered charity under the Charity Commission's regulatory supervision. Charities which are exempt because they are connected to an exempt charity will remain exempt. Like their parent exempt charities, they will come under the relevant principal regulator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="100126110000063"></a>Regulation 2 of the principal regulator regulations in no way extends the scope of the definition of a connected charity. That definition is in paragraph (w) of Schedule 2 of the Charities Act 1993 and remains unchanged. Whether a charity falls within that definition is entirely a matter of charity law and company law is not relevant in this context. For connected charities that are currently exempt by virtue of paragraph (w) of Schedule 2, Regulation 2 of the principal regulations simply ensures that they come under the same principal regulator as their parent exempt charities.</p>

It is not clear which of any of the British Library Board's associated charities would be caught by the connected charity definition. The Charity Commission has said that it would be prepared to

<a name="100126-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="100126110000065"></a>If a charity associated with the board would become exempt by virtue of the order in front of us and the charity's trustees felt that this should not be the case, the commission could consider the circumstances further and advise the trustees and, if appropriate, the board about what steps they might take to clarify the independence of the charity concerned. Tonight, I want to go further and say that in order to allow more time for this consideration to take place, we would put commencement of these provisions back from 1 April-the planned commencement date-to 1 June 2010, so that further consideration can take place. I hope that that has given some comfort to the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="100126110000066"></a>I turn to some of the points raised by the noble Viscount and other noble Lords. The noble Viscount asked about advice and comment from the Charity Commission on these orders and about infringing the commission's independence. The commission and the Government have worked together to develop the Charities Act and subsequent secondary legislation. The commission has shaped and informed this legislation and fully supports the draft SIs being considered, as it has indicated to several noble Lords present with its briefing.</p>

<a name="100126-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="100126110000067"></a>The noble Viscount and the noble Lord, Lord Bates, referred to what they consider to be insufficient consultation. They asked why there has been no public consultation on who the principal regulators will be. The strategy unit first proposed the principal regulatory regime, or main regulator, as it was put then, in its 2002 report, <I>Private Action, Public Benefit </I>following public consultation. The Government accepted the recommendation and set about discussions with the various groups of charities likely to be affected. The aim of the discussions was to identify whether a suitable principal regulator existed for those relevant exempt charities.</p>

<a name="100126-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="100126110000068"></a>The outcome of these discussions was published in May 2004 in the regulatory impact assessment that accompanied the draft Charities Bill. The Bill itself had pre-legislative scrutiny and it was then subject to parliamentary scrutiny during its passage through Parliament. During that time there were discussions about the exempt charities provision. Most of the concerns raised in the debate about the exempt charities provisions were seeking to minimise the burden of regulation of exempt charities. Discussions still continue right through from before the passage of the Act in 2006 until now, with the proposed principal regulators and representative bodies of the exempt charities. I take the point made by the noble Viscount that some of this has been private discussion, not necessarily in the public domain, but I am trying to give a linear example of the public discussion in 2002 right through to continuing discussion with those charities that may be affected by these orders.</p>

<a name="100126-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="100126110000069"></a>There is no statutory requirement for requirement for consultation. We have, as I said, consulted the relevant charities directly and the proposed principal

The bodies representing these charities and the principal regulators have said that they are content with the proposals.</p>

<a name="100126-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="100126110000070"></a>The noble Viscount asked why there was no impact assessment specifically on the orders before the House today. An impact assessment was published alongside the draft Charities Bill in May 2004 and updated as necessary when the Bill was introduced into Parliament. That impact assessment considered the costs and benefits of appointing principal regulators and listed the proposed principal regulators for each group of exempt charities where one had been identified, including for example, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport for that department's sponsored exempt charities. We accept that the original impact assessment could not provide the detailed costs of all aspects of the proposals, and therefore included in the Explanatory Memorandum to these statutory instruments is more information about the likely costs that will apply. We did not consider that there will be any significant costs for charities that remain exempt subject to a principal regulator. There will be additional costs for those charities that cease to be exempt and, where possible, we have set out those costs and the costs that we expect.</p>

<a name="100126-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="100126110000071"></a>The noble Viscount also asked whether the commission has experience of regulating colleges as in Oxford and Cambridge. I take his point about the intricate, detailed and complex systems that can be set up in colleges of great history, as those are. The commission regulates 180,000 registered charities that are hugely diverse in terms of size, legal framework and purpose. We have more than 40 years' experience of this and we are in dialogue with these colleges to enable a smooth transition to being registered, providing advice and support when needed.</p>

<a name="100126-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="100126110000072"></a>The noble Viscount and the noble Lord, Lord Bates-with special reference in the case of the noble Lord to St Cuthbert-talked about the inherent conflict of interest between the role of the department and the Secretary of State as a funder, and that of principal regulator, and asked whether there be a circumstance when the duty of promoting charitable law compliance could tip over if the Secretary of State was passionate enough. We considered this carefully with the proposed principal regulators and concluded that the principal regulator role can coexist with the funding role. We do not believe that there is an inherent conflict of interest between the role of funder and that of promoting compliance with charity law. If a conflict were to arise, we consider that it could be identified and managed within the department, and a fallback position would be to call upon the Charity Commission for its input.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="100126110000073"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, talked about the independence of the Charity Commission. It was an independent non-ministerial department before the Charities Act 2006, which reinforced its independence. It has been involved in the development of both the Charities Act and its secondary legislation and fully supports them. My noble friend Lady Pitkeathley, whom I thank for her contribution, asked some important  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1389"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1389</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>questions about "right touch" legislation and gave us the benefit of her experience. I agree strongly with her conclusions.</p>

<a name="100126-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="100126110000074"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, for his support for these statutory instruments. He spoke of how important it is to simplify the procedures for charities as much as possible so that they do not have to complete two sets of accounts and write two annual reports. He asked whether Ministers who act as principal regulators would be able to interfere with the running of their exempt charities. I reassure him that these instruments do not confer any powers on principal regulators that would enable them to interfere with the administration of the exempt charities for which they are responsible. The only duty imposed on a principal regulator is to promote its exempt charity's compliance with charity law.</p>

<a name="100126-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="100126110000075"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Bates, who rightly spoke of the wonderful and extraordinary generosity of the British public and the tremendous work of the charity sector. He made the point quite movingly that, in a time of deep recession and when people's backs are against the wall, there has still been an enormous outpouring of charitable giving. The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, and the noble Lord, Lord Bates, talked about conflict of interest. I hope that I have covered that.</p>

<a name="100126-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="100126110000076"></a>With those remarks, perhaps I may say in conclusion that it has been over six years since the Government accepted the Strategy Unit's recommendations relating to exempt charities. We now need to make progress with the implementation of these provisions of the Charities Act 2006 on which there has been much debate over several years. The Charity Commission is ready, the principal regulators are ready and the exempt charities that will be affected by these instruments are ready. We have committed to further work with the British Library Board and the charities connected with it before these instruments come into force. I hope that this gives the noble Viscount the assurances that he is looking for. I am confident that these changes will improve the regulation of exempt charities as charities in a way that meets the criteria of best regulatory practice and avoids excessive regulation.</p>

I am grateful for the contributions made to this debate and I am sure that we shall return to the matter of process and the question of a more elegant solution to some of these issues. I thank the noble Baroness for her assurance that time will be given for the friends' organisations connected to these institutions to make sure that they have no problems between now and 1 June.

The only slight disagreement that I have with her is that I think that the Charity Commission fulfils every one of them excellently. This is why, as the House will recognise, I am a supporter of the removal of exemption and of the regulation of all charities moving to the Charity Commission so that there is no doubt left. My noble friend is entirely right on that point. It may be said that there will be no further intervention or interference by Secretaries of State, but all my past experience tells me that they cannot resist it.</p>

The first part I leave as a suggestion to the Minister as to one way in which he might seek to deal with the problem, which we have discussed before, of how libraries, internet cafes, Swindon and other such places might deal with the liability that the Bill potentially imposes on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="100126110000084"></a>The third part clarifies the application of safe harbours in the e-commerce regulations to information services provided not for direct consideration-that is, search engines, social networking sites and public wi-fi services. Currently these qualify for protection only if normally provided for remuneration, which has caused a great deal of uncertainty. I do not see why such institutions should be discriminated against in favour of commercial business.</p>

<a name="100126-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="100126110000085"></a>Lastly, the fourth part of the amendment is intended to ensure that the safe harbour regulations in Regulations 17 to 19 apply to new criminal offences created after the regulations came into force. This would be an umbrella provision that would catch all future such criminal offences rather than their having to be provided for each time such a criminal offence was created. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="100126-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="100126110000087"></a>The amendment attempts to do a number of things. First, by the amendment to Regulation 17 of the e-commerce regulations that implement the directive, the regulations would specify that limitations of liability currently available to mere conduits should apply specifically to wireless networks-the noble Lord's new definition. I believe that the current term encompasses the noble Lord's new definition and that therefore this new provision is unnecessary and, indeed, would confuse the intention to deliver a wide interpretation of the networks to be covered.</p>

<a name="100126-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="100126110000088"></a>Secondly, the amendment would specify that the limitations on liability should apply to search engines, hyperlinkers and aggregators. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, in an earlier incarnation, consulted on the possibility of amending the regulations to make it clear that these activities were subject to the limitations of liability granted by the directive. The result of that consultation was that there was not a strong case that we should do so. We believe that it would be wrong to make these changes now without further consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p>

<a name="100126-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="100126110000089"></a>Thirdly, I note that the next proposed amendment is designed to clarify the scope of the regulations to cover non-commercial services. While the main thrust of the directive is to harmonise the regulation of those services provided for remuneration, it is clear from the recitals to the directive that the scope of the directive covers a wide range of economic activities extending to services for which the recipient does not pay, such as online information. I refer noble Lords to Recitals 17 and 18 of the directive. I understand that there are cases before the European Court that will help to refine the scope of the directive. It would be rash to consider such amendments while such cases are in train and before the court has reached its conclusion.</p>

<a name="100126-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="100126110000090"></a>Lastly, the amendment would give prospective effect to the limitation of liability in the directive. That means that the limitation should be applied to all future legislation, not simply to legislation that had been enacted before the regulations came into force in 2002. This aspect of the implementation of the electronic commerce directive has been the subject of much discussion with the industry. There are attractions to the idea of prospective effect but also merits to the industry of the approach that we have adopted of creating bespoke implementation of the limitation of liability, which is specific to the legislation in question. Moreover, we have serious concerns about the danger of unintended consequences and the potential uncertainty of prospective effect. I hope that the noble Lord will consider withdrawing his amendment in the light of that explanation.</p>

These provisions should certainly not be taken to prejudice the right to bring legal action.

<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="100126110000095"></a>The answer to the amendment is that I can give assurances. We understand the concern and it is right for us to be reminded that in the part of the Bill that deals with copyright owners, internet service providers and subscribers, we should not forget the people who create material in the first place, whether they be photographers, musicians or film-makers. Of course these creative people have rights and may be copyright owners. It would be fair to say that the focus of the provisions in these clauses is on the investors in copyright, the creative industries, rather than on the creators themselves. I am sure, though, that we recognise that the whole structure of the creative economy is founded in large part on individual creativity.</p>

If an author or performer is also a copyright owner, their ability to protect their copyright will be enhanced, not restricted, by these provisions. They will not affect any contractual arrangements that they may have with their publishers. On moral rights, I assure the noble Lord that their current status and position will not be affected by these clauses, and we would in any case be constrained from doing so by European and international agreement. I hope that those reassurances will prove satisfactory.</p>

The Government decided to seek these reserve powers because the domain names system is a crucial element of the internet economy. Domain name registries themselves have a key role in making sure that the system runs smoothly. Any disruptions could have adverse effects on business, consumers and internet users as a whole.</p>

<a name="100126-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="100126110000099"></a>For most people, the sort of disruption we have in mind manifests itself in the misuse of domain names. The domain names sector in the UK is self-regulated and it has worked well for many years. The Government's intention is that self-regulation by domain name registries should continue: we want to be absolutely clear about that. The reserve powers we are seeking in the Bill will enable the Government to intervene if things start to go wrong, with self-regulation clearly failing.</p>

<a name="100126-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="100126110000100"></a>The Government recently published a factsheet which I hope provided your Lordships with a bit more clarity on the circumstances in which the powers might be exercised. I know we will be covering the enforcement aspects of these powers when we examine Clauses 19 and 20, so for now I will not say anything more about this.</p>

<a name="100126-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="100126110000101"></a>I turn to the amendments in question. Following representations made by the industry, the Government realised that the scope of the domain name provisions in the Bill could have unintended consequences. Specifically, the definitions in Clause 18 as currently drafted would bring any organisation or company in the UK that runs its own name server within the scope of the powers-that was not intended. Similarly, the UK-based domain name registry operations of some third countries are also caught. Again, that is not what the Government had in mind when they proposed this draft legislation.</p>

<a name="100126-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="100126110000102"></a>The effect of the amendments tabled by the Government is to restrict the scope of the powers to cover just those top-level domain registries where the domain is clearly UK-related. That is where, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, the last element of the domain name will cause internet users to believe there is a connection with the UK or part of the UK. In practice, this will include the existing ".uk" and ".gb" domains, and indeed any future proposals ICANN receives for new domains which it approves-such as ".london", or even ".britfishshops". I am sure noble  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1395"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1395</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lords will well appreciate that the Government will certainly be concerned about any phishing activities, if you will pardon the pun, associated with this domain. I see that joke went down really well. You can't win them all, as someone once said.</p>

<a name="100126-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="100126110000103"></a>Finally, the Government have tabled a minor amendment, Amendment 223C, to the definition of an internet domain registry so that the text correctly refers to "internet protocol addresses". This is definitely one for the cognoscenti. I do not think this requires further explanation. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_249"></a>
<a name="100126110000104"></a><b><a name="100126-0015.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="100126110000222"></a>The Earl of Erroll:</b> I am quite involved in this world and I probably ought to redeclare something I declared earlier in the Committee stage. I have been sitting on the Nominet policy advisory body for a number of years. I do not receive any remuneration for it so I have no financial interest in this at all, but I have been involved in many of the discussions around this area. I can see exactly what the Government are getting at. Just as they made a general comment at the start, I should like to make the following general comment. I can see exactly why the Government want to take these reserve powers. I, too, regard the .UK domain name as a UKplc asset. I am not sure that we would have ended up with the governance structure that we have if we had realised way back, when this was all set up under an exchange of letters with ICANN, that the internet would become so important. I welcome the Government's provisions in this area. The amendments that I have tabled seek to make them either more flexible or to tweak them very slightly. They do not seek to alter the Government's basic intention. Therefore, I welcome this set of amendments. I was concerned that someone who was with a registry that had nothing to do with the UK might be caught up by this. Therefore, I think that this is a very sensible set of amendments.</p>

<a name="100126-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="100126110000105"></a>It is probably worth flagging up that certain issues may arise. For instance, I believe that proposals have been floated to have a .Scot top-level domain. The question arises whether that concerns Scotland or the worldwide Scottish diaspora. We can have a hefty argument about which it concerns. However, .Scotland would clearly relate to a part of the UK. The same would apply to .Cymru, .Wales and .Welsh. Therefore, arguments could arise in the future about the finer points of this. I like the idea of .fishshops. Would "sh" appear twice in the middle, or not? There is a phishing opportunity there.</p>

Certain domain registries-I think particularly of Telnic-expressed in correspondence their concern about the width of Clause 18. I want to tease out from the Minister information about the .tel domain, which is a London-based registry operator but provides a global service to citizens and businesses of all nations under the .tel domain name. I suspect that that is exactly what the government amendments are designed to exclude, so that the measure will deal just with .UK and .GB. However, it is extremely important that that is clarified. By the same token, it is interesting to ask, what control or influence do the Government have in other respects? There is what is called a geo domain,  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1396"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column 1396</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>.tv suffix, which causes some frustration among those who would like to see it being a much more effective way for localities to signpost what they have in their areas. However, it is a much abused domain name. I suspect that the Minister will almost reassure me that the Government have no control over those .tv domains because a different registry deals with those geo domains. The Minister looks somewhat puzzled, but some clarity in all this would be enormously helpful.</p>

<a name="100126110000107"></a><b><a name="100126-0015.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="100126110000224"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for tabling these amendments. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, concern has been expressed to us, and no doubt to other noble Lords, about the potential for these powers to be applied to all domains, not just the t.UK domain, and perhaps some of the other domains to which the Minister has referred, for which they were intended. The purpose of our Amendment 225BA is rather in line with that of the noble Earl, Lord Erroll; namely, to probe the Government to establish just how wide the new drafting could be taken to be read. There is still concern that the words "UK-related", as used at line 13 of government Amendment 225B, could be understood by some intent on stretching these provisions to their maximum, as meaning any registry, with however loose a connection with the UK. The government amendment uses the words,</p>
<ul><a name="100126110000187"></a>"connected with the United Kingdom".</ul>
<p><a name="100126110000146"></a>I suspect that this goes rather wider than the Minister intends. Will he consider improving the drafting to make the measure clearer? I see the difficulty, but spreading the jurisdiction too wide, either intentionally or, indeed, unintentionally, could, we suggest, create some unforeseen problems. He, of course, has at his disposal officials with formidable drafting skills.</p>

We know what he says about .scotland. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, sought confirmation about whether we would be covering .tel. The answer is no. The domain .tv is not covered either.</p>

<a name="100126-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="100126110000109"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, for tabling the amendment. As I understand it, the intention behind the amendment is to remove the definition of what is meant by a UK-related domain. As I have just explained, this wording has been proposed so that it is clear-UK-based registries of other country code domains are not covered by the powers.</p>

<a name="100126-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="100126110000110"></a>The definition will provide necessary common-sense clarity to the industry as to what might be considered UK-related and will ensure that the powers will only be available to the Secretary of State if internet users are likely to believe that a domain has a connection to the UK.</p>

Its purpose is to ensure that if a notice has been received by a registry it will have a reasonable length of time to prepare and make representations to the Secretary of State.

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="100126110000113"></a>In practice, a registry will have been well aware that the Government were concerned about a serious failure of that registry long before receipt of formal notification by the Secretary of State. Informal approaches to the registry will have been attempted and exhausted before any decision to exercise these powers. Furthermore, before the Secretary of State can notify a registry of a serious failure he must have prescribed the specific practice or requirement that constitutes a failure. In the normal course of events, a full consultation will have taken place prior to prescribing practices or requirements under Section 124N(3). Therefore the registry should be well aware of the serious failure long before it receives a notification from the Secretary of State.</p>

I thoroughly support the Government's proposals in general, but I wanted to make sure that what the domain name registry is being asked to do lies within its powers. Many companies would like to acquire other people's internet property. I do not know why one should give them the scope to lobby the Government to try to bully other people out of stuff that they legitimately own. Trying to make the domain name registry a creature of government would be a first step in that. Big commercial interests could then continue the pressure on the Government to try to get their way with internet domain name property. It seems to be plain sense that the Government should be able to require the registry only to do things that it has the power and resources to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="100126110000117"></a>Having looked at this issue and the impact assessment, I think that the Government are missing a trick. Why have they not thought of taxation as a means of controlling some of these abuses? If they are worried about people hoarding domain names, why not tax them? There are 8 million of them out there. The Government could get a tidy sum and would make life inconvenient for people who hoard domain names on the ground that they think that they could make a profit out of selling names to people with a commercial use for them. Like the number plates business, there is a pretty good business in prestigious domain names. This Government have proved to be very inventive in that sphere. Two of the three ills that the Government complain of could easily be dealt with by constructive taxation which would have added benefits for them. I beg to move.</p>

It tries to achieve exactly the same purpose for exactly the same reasons. I do not mind which amendment is supported. Such a measure may be useful because it has to be remembered that the purpose of Clause 18 is to enable the Government to put in a manager under Clause 19; that is a drastic step to take. These are the trigger arrangements, and it is only reasonable that the registry has some control over what has gone wrong, because one could put in a manager who might do no better. It does not really matter, because if you do not have the power to do anything about whatever the issue is, you will need fast-track legislation to cure the problem-as we discussed previously. It might have been better to us a Henry VIII power here, rather than something else. Inserting an amendment with the word "reasonable" would ensure proportionality and reassure people. The effect would be exactly the same in the end. If the registry is misbehaving or not being competent, and a manager could do the job better, the Government would still have a reserve power to put in a manager under Clause 19.</p>

That country has been sensible because it spotted a huge opportunity and has a deal with VeriSign which markets the code for other purposes. The country gets a large slice of money, because it receives the royalties. This is an idea for the Government if they could grab the right domain. On top of that, Tuvalu

<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="100126110000121"></a>It would be quite unfair to punish a registry for failing to undertake something it is unable, rather than unwilling, to do. There is already considerable disquiet among many at the idea that these provisions will nationalise the internet. I would welcome the reassurance which will be provided by these amendments that the Government will not be using this clause as a pretext for unnecessarily taking over a registry.</p>

The effect of both amendments is that a registry might be able to delay or avoid taking action by claiming it could do nothing about the prescribed unfair practices or misuse of domain names because it did not have the power, responsibility or resources. The amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, would leave the Secretary of State powerless to act where a registry had taken reasonable steps, even when those steps had entirely failed to sort things out.</p>

<a name="100126-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="100126110000123"></a>Let me reassure both the noble Earl and the noble Lord that the Government would not expect a registry to act beyond its powers to correct any failure that it could not reasonably address; for example, where that failure results from the actions of a third party over which it has no control. However, in our view, it is unlikely that a domain name registry would not have the authority and capability to suspend a domain name or take down a site using a domain name used by that registry if it was requested to do so by the relevant authorities because of the adverse effects on the interests of consumers. In practice, however, the Government will have attempted to have a discussion with the relevant registry about the problem that has caused concern long before the powers in this clause are exercised. Any real compliance difficulties faced by the registry will have to come to light during these discussions and, it is to be hoped, a way forward found to the satisfaction of both parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="100126110000124"></a>I turn to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. The absence of adequate arrangements for dealing with complaints by an internet domain registry is one of the two tests that decide whether there has been a relevant failure by that registry. While we regard it as important that such arrangements exist, we realise the form they take will depend on the registry concerned. As I have already explained, if we were concerned there might be a serious failure the Government would have had discussions with the registry to determine whether its arrangements for handling complaints were adequate before-and I stress before-exercising powers in this clause. These discussions

Using the powers really will be a last resort. However, if abuses are damaging our internet economy, the Government should not be prevented from using these powers because the registry does not have the resources or powers to comply with prescribed requirements.</p>

<a name="100126-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="100126110000125"></a>I was as shocked as the noble Lord, Lord Howard, at the idea of taxing domain names. The idea of the Opposition Benches proposing more taxes for the Government is an interesting one that we will take away and raise with the Chancellor. I was reassured that it was not described as a "stealth tax". As for Henry VIII powers, we have dabbled enough in that already-I see the Lib Dem Benches concur. In the light of my explanation, I trust that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I will read it carefully along with the noble Lord's replies to the few groups that follow. It is important that there should be a real disincentive to the Government deciding to trip this trigger and take over a domain name registry. I will look at this as a whole to understand whether I think the Government have achieved that. As for a tax, it is a tax only as a secondary effect. The real purpose is to improve the fluidity of the domain name market; the Government will just happen to earn some revenue from it. It might also help to reduce my noble friend's tax bill in compensation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Deciding whether the failure of the domain registry is serious enough to warrant further action would not be an exception; and as we have said, neither is it a decision that would be taken lightly. It would be the last resort. It must remain within the Secretary of State's reasonable judgment to decide, on the facts available, how serious the adverse effect is.

Therefore, I support Amendment 224, which is grouped with the next two amendments and states that a draft order should be brought before the House.

When we discussed Amendments 216, 217 and 218 a few minutes ago, my noble friend referred to disquiet at the possible overreaching powers of the Secretary of State.

The purpose of both amendments is to make it a requirement in the Bill for the Government to consult. The first amendment requires the Secretary of State to consult in order to establish whether the failure of a domain registry is serious such that he may have the power to take action against a registry, and to inform the decisions as to who is responsible for the failure, what action needs to be taken and by whom. The second amendment would impose a requirement in the Bill for the Secretary of State to consult before prescribing which practices are unfair or involve the misuse of domain names, and before prescribing the requirements to be placed on registries for dealing with domain name complaints.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="100126110000135"></a>I give an assurance that we are committed to consultation with the stakeholders. A government code on consultation prescribes the form that consultation should take. We are fully supportive of consultation and are aware of its importance in the decision-making process. The Secretary of State can consider using his powers against a registry only if he is satisfied that the particular registry to which he would address a notification is engaging in a serious relevant failure that could harm the reputation or availability of electronic communication network services and the interests of consumers or members of the public.</p>

The degree of consultation requirements suggested by the noble Lord risks delaying action to the detriment of the very things that we are all seeking to protect. We believe that the necessary safeguard is already built into the process that we have set out and to which we are committed, including the consultation and prescribed practices and the opportunity for the registry to make representations to the Secretary of State further to being served with a notice. I hope that that explanation and the commitment to consultation will be sufficient to enable the noble Earl to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<ul><a name="10012666000111"></a>
<p>That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Representation of the People (Northern Ireland) (Amendment) Regulations 2010.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="10012666000003"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10012666000115"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> My Lords, the Representation of the People (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2008 make provision relating to elections in Northern Ireland, including electoral registration, absent voting and accessing the electoral register. Last year, the Government conducted a full consultation exercise on improving electoral registration and absent voting procedures in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000004"></a>Although many of the changes proposed in the consultation will require primary legislation, other changes can be made by amending the 2008 regulations. Those changes are the subject of the draft regulations before us today. It may assist noble Lords if I summarise the key provisions of the draft regulations. I will first deal with those concerning absent voting procedures at parliamentary elections in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000005"></a>Noble Lords may be aware that, due to the perceived increased risk of electoral fraud in Northern Ireland, the law relating to absent voting in Northern Ireland differs from the rest of the United Kingdom. The Government remain committed to both preserving the integrity of the absent vote process in Northern Ireland and bringing legislation before this House where necessary to further protect against the risk of electoral fraud.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000006"></a>Regulation 5 accordingly requires those applying for an absent vote to provide reasons when requesting that their ballot paper be sent to an address other than the one at which they are registered. This will allow the Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland to monitor  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC288"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC288</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>any attempt to divert ballot papers to certain addresses without good reason and for potentially fraudulent purposes.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000007"></a>The chief electoral officer has recently expressed concern that some absent vote applications requiring attestation by healthcare professionals and others may have been falsely attested. For this reason, Regulations 6 and 7 require those attesting absent vote applications to be on the electoral register themselves. This will enable the chief electoral officer to verify whether an absent vote attestation corresponds with information that he already holds.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000008"></a>Protection against potential abuse of the absent voting procedure remains a key priority for the Government. But we will nevertheless also continue to seek ways to maximise the participation of those who rely on absent voting in the electoral process. Regulation 6 extends the list of those able to attest an absent vote application on the grounds of blindness or other disability to include registered social workers. At present, those able to attest such applications are primarily individuals providing medical or residential care. Adding registered social workers to the list allows those providing social care in the community to attest applications. Provision is also made in Regulation 6 to exempt those in receipt of the higher rate of attendance allowance or the highest rate care component of disability living allowance from the attestation requirement. This will further assist those with severe disabilities to exercise their right to vote.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000009"></a>As a means of protecting against electoral fraud, the 2008 regulations provide that an individual may attest only one absent vote application at any election. Regulation 7 of the draft regulations amends this provision to allow individuals to attest up to two applications per election. This will prevent otherwise valid applications being rejected where, for example, one person has attested the applications of a neighbouring couple. I hope that this summary of the absent voting provisions contained in the draft regulations has been helpful.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000010"></a>I turn now to the remaining provisions before us, which deal mainly with electoral registration. The 2008 regulations allow the chief electoral officer summarily to remove individuals from the electoral register when informed of their death by the registrar of births and deaths in Northern Ireland. However, if the chief electoral officer is informed by registrars of births and deaths elsewhere in the UK or Ireland of a person's death, he must conduct a formal review of their entitlement to be on the register. This, as noble Lords can imagine, can cause distress to the family of the deceased at an already difficult time. Regulation 3 therefore extends the chief electoral officer's ability summarily to remove a person from the register if he is notified of their death by a registrar of births and deaths in England, Wales, Scotland or Ireland.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000011"></a>Regulation 4 adds further education colleges to the list of authorities from whom the chief electoral officer may request information for the purposes of registration. Noble Lords may be aware that the chief electoral officer currently undertakes a very successful schools initiative, visiting post-primary schools throughout Northern Ireland to encourage young people to register  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC289"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC289</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to vote. Allowing the chief electoral officer to access information relating to the number of potential electors at FE colleges will assist him to extend this excellent initiative to students at FE colleges. This will, in turn, help him to further facilitate and encourage the registration of young people in Northern Ireland, which I am sure noble Lords will agree remains an important objective.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000012"></a>On that point, I was very taken with the figures that I was given and which have resulted from the efforts in Northern Ireland to increase the number of young people registering to vote. More than 18,000 young people under the age of 18 were on the register on 4 January 2010. That compares with only 244 following the annual canvass in 2006, which is an extraordinary increase.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000013"></a>The full Northern Ireland register has a high level of accuracy. Medical practitioners believe it would be very useful to have access to it in certain circumstances-for example, where an incorrect prescription or test result had been issued but the patient cannot be contacted because the address held by the medical authorities is out of date. Regulation 10 therefore extends the list of those able to access information contained in the full electoral register to include registered medical practitioners. They may, however, only receive information from the register that is necessary for medical purposes and in respect of one person.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000014"></a>Regulation 12 amends the parliamentary elections rules and extends the list of documentation which may be used as proof of identity at polling stations in Northern Ireland to include 60-plus SmartPasses, provisional driving licences and European Community driving licences. Both we and the chief electoral officer are satisfied that this extension will make it easier for individuals to meet the necessary identification requirements for voting, without increasing the risk of electoral fraud.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000015"></a>In summary, although the provisions contained in these draft regulations make relatively minor changes, they nevertheless contribute to achieving the Government's key objectives of minimising electoral fraud and maximising electoral registration and participation in Northern Ireland. I hope that noble Lords will therefore support the changes proposed. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="10012666000016"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10012666000116"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that very clear explanation of what the statutory instrument is all about. I support it wholeheartedly. It is another step forward in the process of making the electoral process in Northern Ireland certainly the best in these islands and probably one of the best in the democratic world. We have had many debates in your Lordships' House as this has progressed; I remember one or two arguments well, but overall we have come out with an excellent result. This is a very good example of the Government looking into the detail of an important process and finding ways to improve it yet further. I support the order wholeheartedly.</p>

<p><a name="10012666000017"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10012666000117"></a>Baroness Harris of Richmond:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the regulations which we, too, support. It is important for the chief electoral officer to know if anyone has died, and so having a registrar in the UK or Ireland informing that office is  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC290"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC290</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>very sensible. It is also sensible to allow registered social workers to attest certain applications from people with disabilities to enable them to have an absent vote.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000018"></a>The regulations make improvements to access to the register, particularly for doctors, as the Minister advised us, and also widen the provision for polling station identification. We supported the provisions of the Electoral Fraud (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, which ensured that any photographic form of identification was recognised at polling stations. When any new forms of identification are issued, I hope that they will also be recognised as legitimate forms of ID for the purpose of voting. Can the noble Baroness assure me on that point?</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000019"></a>Finally, the integrity of the register, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said, is vitally important in combating electoral fraud in Northern Ireland. These provisions, as we have heard, strike the right balance between ensuring that the vote is properly secure and assisting those who genuinely need help to vote but are unable to get to a polling station. We wholeheartedly support these recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="10012666000020"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="10012666000118"></a>Lord Bew:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing these draft regulations which, for the most part, are benign and uncontroversial. I particularly thank her for her clarification of the circumstances in which medical practitioners will have access to the register. We have always been careful on the issue, but the circumstances she has outlined are sufficiently controlled as to give confidence to the general public.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000021"></a>I have two questions for the noble Baroness. The tightening of regulations on absent voting seems to have resulted from issues of fraud in the European elections in June. The Explanatory Memorandum that comes with the draft statutory instrument does not make clear whether we are talking about the European elections in the United Kingdom as a whole or simply in Northern Ireland, and I should like to probe the issue a little further. My colleague, Dr Sydney Elliott, of Queen's University Belfast, has suggested that the thinking on this subject derives from the Electoral Commission study published in 2010, <I>Analysis of Allegations of Electoral Malpractice at the June 2009 Elections</I>. That study records, but does not include, 10 cases involving 48 allegations reported in Northern Ireland; in Great Britain there were 48 cases involving 107 allegations. A glance at those figures would indicate that the allegations or concerns were significantly higher in Northern Ireland than they were in Great Britain as a whole. My question for the Minister is this: does the concern arise from the UK as a whole, or was there a particular pressing concern in Northern Ireland which has led to the tightening of these regulations?</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000022"></a>On my second question, in her introduction the noble Baroness said that there were a number of items in the consultation document which require primary legislation but for which we do not have a vehicle at the moment. We live in a context where, even if there is devolution of policing and justice, responsibility for electoral matters will remain at Westminster for some considerable time-indeed, the Minister in the other place, Mr Paul Goggins, said for all time-and it is an issue for this Parliament whether the Government  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC291"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC291</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have any intention of bringing forward primary legislation to deal with some of questions and items which arose in the consultation document. If it is possible for the Minister to give any clue regarding the Government's future intentions, I should be very grateful.</p>
<h5><a name="10012666000107"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="10012666000023"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="10012666000119"></a>Lord Kilclooney:</b> I join colleagues in thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, for the presentation of this order. It is obvious that with the improvement of the electoral and registration systems in Northern Ireland in recent years, Northern Ireland has the best organised elections in the United Kingdom and the old joke about voting early and often in Northern Ireland is no longer topical, although it should apply to electoral practices in some other parts of the United Kingdom. We now set the best standards of electoral practice in the United Kingdom and should not hesitate to say that. Any English colleagues who try to make jokes about Northern Ireland electoral procedures should think twice.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000024"></a>My first question relates to consultation, which I raised a few months ago on a similar subject. The consultation <I>Improving Electoral Registration Procedures in Northern Ireland</I> was advertised and there were responses from political parties and organisations. How many responses were there from individuals? What was their reaction to the document? Secondly, in relation to the registrar of births and deaths in Ireland, under United Kingdom law, the term "Ireland" means the Republic of Ireland. We should not get away from that.</p>

<p><a name="10012666000025"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="10012666000120"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> I should like to make that point clearer and support the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney. Ireland is the 26 counties and Northern Ireland is the six counties.</p>

<p><a name="10012666000026"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="10012666000121"></a>Lord Kilclooney:</b> The Republic of Ireland is defined in the law of the United Kingdom as the 26 countries, but that is by the way. The authorities in Northern Ireland will get advice from the registrar of births and deaths in the Republic of Ireland. How will that information be made available? Is every birth and death in the Republic of Ireland going to be advised to the Northern Ireland authorities on a daily basis, or will they have to ask Dublin how many people were born or died yesterday? How will it work in practice?</p>

<p><a name="10012666000027"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="10012666000122"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I thank all noble Lords who have spoken for their support for these regulations, for which I am most grateful. They are a step forward in clamping down on the remaining fraud. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, that the anti-fraud system in the electoral system in Northern Ireland is the model for the rest of the United Kingdom to follow. We say that without any reservation.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000028"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, supported the regulations and asked whether new forms of identification could be used in future. As long as the chief electoral officer is content, that will be the case.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC292"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC292</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bew, asked about allegations around the European elections in Northern Ireland and compared two sets of figures about cases. The checking is very strict in Northern Ireland, as he knows, and when we talk about the 49 incidents-I am looking to the Box-those were indeed in Northern Ireland during the European elections. The noble Lord, Lord Bew, also asked about the remaining issues needing primary legislation that are not being dealt with today, and when they would be brought forward. We plan to bring legislation forward as soon as an opportunity arrives.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000030"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, asked about individuals responding to the consultation. I am now looking at the list of respondents to the consultation, and the individuals on it are the Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland and Margaret Ritchie, MLA, the Minister for Social Development. Those individuals responded, as did Disability Action, the Electoral Commission, the Green Party of Northern Ireland, Include Youth and many organisations.</p>

<p><a name="10012666000031"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="10012666000123"></a>Lord Kilclooney:</b> I am afraid that the Minister's reply is exactly as I feared and underlines the point that I made several months ago. It is important that the people in Northern Ireland know what is happening in the electoral procedures, and the way in which they are being advertised means that the people generally have no clue what has happened. The Minister has not been able to name or identify any individual who responded; Margaret Ritchie is a politician, but I was talking about ordinary individuals in Northern Ireland. It is astounding that there has not been one response from the general public in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000032"></a>I fear that the whole advertising of electoral procedures is disastrous; I declare an interest yet again in being involved in the media in Northern Ireland. Following the last debate in Grand Committee, I got a reply from the chief electoral officer saying that they advertised in the <I>News of the World</I>, the <I>Sunday Mirror</I> and the <I>Sunday World</I>, or some papers like that. Those papers are not widely read in Northern Ireland. He also mentioned the <I>News Letter</I>, which sells 25,000 papers. One paper, the <I>Impartial Reporte</I><I>r</I>-with which I have no connection-sells 14,000 in Fermanagh alone. Likewise, they advertised on classic radio in Northern Ireland, which is not widely listened to, but ignored the Northern Media Group, which has a much larger listenership in Northern Ireland. The advertising of the electoral procedures in Northern Ireland is abysmal at the moment. The people have no idea, and the fact that there has been no response from any individuals makes my point.</p>

<p><a name="10012666000033"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="10012666000124"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I take the noble Lord's point; I remember that we had quite a discussion on this, well before Christmas, in this very Room. During that meeting of your Lordships, I think that I said it was very important to get as much information out as possible prior to consultations and to get a reflection of the population back in consultations. To be fair, there is the work being done by the chief electoral officer and his team, which I mentioned in the introduction, of going out to schools, FE colleges and  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC293"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>universities. There is a lot of outreach work going on in the community, as well as wanting the optimum return to consultations. However, I am aware of the point that the noble Lord makes.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, also asked about the sharing of information on deaths. I had better write to him on that, because I think that he will probably need a little more detail. This is an operational matter for the chief electoral officer; I am not aware of the detail, but of course the chief electoral officer has arrangements with his counterpart in the Republic of Ireland. I am happy to pass on the noble Lord's request for information.</p>

<p><a name="10012666000035"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="10012666000126"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government &amp; Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My Lords, the regulations will enable us to bring into being the energy rebate scheme, which both delivers real help this year to pensioners and acts as a pilot for the future scheme announced in the Department of Energy and Climate Change's White Paper, <I>The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan</I>. This represents a new way of working with energy suppliers, bringing together the information that we hold to deliver help with fuel bills to the poorest of pensioners.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000036"></a>Fuel costs can have a big impact on household budgets, particularly in cold winters such as this, which is why we want to be able to identify, and target support effectively to, those households which need most help. The energy rebate scheme builds on the current voluntary agreement between government and energy suppliers. Under this agreement, made in 2008, energy suppliers agreed to increase the assistance offered to vulnerable customers through social programmes. The energy rebate scheme will be an important part of this programme.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000037"></a>The voluntary agreement with energy suppliers comes to an end in March 2011. The Government have proposed that a mandated social price support scheme should follow. As I have just mentioned, this was first proposed in DECC's White Paper. Legislation to facilitate this has been brought forward in the Energy Bill currently before Parliament.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC294"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000038"></a>The regulations before your Lordships are made under Section 142 of the Pensions Act 2008. They facilitate data-sharing between the Government and energy suppliers.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000039"></a>The energy rebate scheme will be funded by the electricity suppliers under the voluntary agreement with the Government. It will provide pensioners aged 70 years and over who receive only the guarantee credit element of pension credit a one-off rebate worth £80 on their electricity bill. This represents a significant additional contribution towards fuel costs for recipients, and it will be paid in addition to the winter fuel payment and cold weather payments in periods of very cold weather.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000040"></a>To determine who will receive the rebate, certain data will be shared between the DWP and the energy suppliers. This will be done through a data-matching exercise carried out by a third party, HP Enterprise Services, the DWP's recognised and authorised IT provider. The draft regulations specify the information that can be shared, the purposes for which that information can be used and an offences regime for unlawful disclosure of information.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000041"></a>First, on the information that can be shared, the draft regulations permit the DWP to share the names and addresses of people who on 26 March 2010 are aged 70 and over. In the case of couples, the regulations also allow DWP to share the same details of any spouse or partner where one of them is in receipt of the guarantee credit element only of pension credit on the qualifying date of 26 March 2010.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000042"></a>Secondly, the regulations cover the purposes for which the shared data can be used. The main purpose is to establish whether a person qualifies for the rebate. The draft regulations allow energy suppliers to share details of their domestic electricity customers, indicating whether they are on a discounted tariff. Energy suppliers may also contact customers who have received the rebate to offer energy efficiency measures and offer to place them on the priority register.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000043"></a>Finally, the draft regulations set out an offences regime for unlawful disclosure of information. They set out offences for improper use as well as the penalties. This is aimed at strengthening the security of data handled and transferred. We have ensured that the regime complies with the Data Protection Act.</p>

<p><a name="10012666000092"></a>Details about the scheme and how it will work in practice can be found in the scheme policy document, which is available in the Library. We will publish a final version of this document before the scheme comes into operation.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000044"></a>It may be helpful if I give a quick summary of how the scheme will operate. The DWP and the energy suppliers will pass the relevant data to the data-matching organisation to perform the match. Where there is a match between the two sets of information, the energy supplier will be notified and will automatically award a rebate of £80 to that customer's electricity account. We expect most people to receive the rebate without needing to do anything. The rebate will appear as a credit on their electricity bill.</p>

<p><a name="10012666000045"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="10012666000127"></a>Lord Jones:</b> Is the Minister able to give an estimate of the number of people that we are looking at regarding the guarantee credit element of the state pension credit?</p>

<p><a name="10012666000046"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10012666000128"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I shall be very happy to supply that information but perhaps I may formally complete my introduction to the regulations and deal with my noble friend's question in my winding-up speech. However, it is a very pertinent question and one with which I hope I can help.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000047"></a>There will be cases where we believe that people should qualify but their data have not matched. This might be because they do not have an electricity account, or because of weaknesses in either the data presented for matching or the matching process itself. In these cases, we will do our best to ensure that those who qualify still receive the rebate. We will write to them advising what they need to do to get their rebate, and a dedicated helpline will be available to deal with those calls.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000048"></a>Matching and sharing data in this way is a new frontier for government and for energy suppliers; it has not been done before. Although we have done our best to estimate what the outcome will be, so far as concerns the number of people who might receive the rebate, for example, we cannot be precise.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000049"></a>Before the full data-matching exercise is conducted, we will undertake a test phase using live data. This will enable us to test the data-matching process and make any technical adjustments that might improve the match rate. The test phase will also help us to make decisions on who exactly should qualify for the rebate. We want to reach people who are responsible for paying their own fuel bills and who do not already receive help, through a discounted tariff, with their electricity bills. It is our intention therefore to exclude people who receive a discounted tariff from this scheme, but this may depend on the numbers involved.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000050"></a>The DWP and energy suppliers are working together to set up a communications strategy to ensure that people who might qualify are aware of the scheme and its benefits. After the matching exercise, the DWP will write to people whose details have automatically matched to tell them about the rebate and when they can expect the rebate to appear on their electricity bill. Information will be made available on the internet and to customer representative groups before the scheme comes into operation.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000051"></a>The energy rebate scheme will last for one year only. It is a pilot. The lessons that we learn from this scheme will be invaluable in helping us to design the mandated scheme from 2011.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000052"></a>My honourable friend the Minister of State for pensions and the ageing society has made a statement in the Explanatory Memorandum to the regulations that, in her view, the statutory instrument is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. I confirm that that is my view too. I commend the regulations to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="10012666000053"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10012666000129"></a>Lord Freud:</b> My Lords, we welcome these regulations. They set up what will helpfully be a small, cheap and effective scheme to target support towards those who need it most. I thank the Minister for his helpful draft  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC296"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC296</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>scheme policy document, which sets out the Government's intentions in considerably more detail than it is possible to glean from the regulations themselves.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000054"></a>We have all felt the cold in the past few weeks. This winter has been particularly harsh and it will add a significant amount to the energy bills of those least able to afford it. The Government have missed many opportunities on fuel poverty. They have missed all their targets and are likely to miss the next one, but this is a small step in the right direction, so that is something.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000055"></a>Despite the explanatory document, I still have a few questions about the scheme. Paragraph 16 of the draft scheme sets out that the Government's current intention is to exclude from the scheme those customers who are already receiving a discounted tariff for their electricity supply. This seems sensible and would avoid giving some people a double discount. However, the paragraph goes on to say that if the overlap is very large, the Government will ignore this policy intention and continue to offer a rebate in order to ensure,</p>
<ul><a name="10012666000101"></a>"that the number of people assisted by the scheme is not so small as to make the administrative cost and effort required disproportionate to the benefits".</ul>
<p><a name="10012666000056"></a>That seems a very strange way to offer support; to say that they have taken so much time and money to establish that you do not need help that they are going to give you some more money anyway does not seem the best use of public funds. Of course administrative costs should be kept as low as possible, but the way to achieve that should not be to expand the overall budget so that the proportion falls.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000057"></a>Speaking of costs, can the Minister confirm how much he expects this system to cost? Ignoring the final sum of the rebate offered by the energy suppliers, which will depend on the number of matches found, how much will HP Enterprise Services charge for this year's work? Who will bear the cost? Will it be the Government or the energy suppliers? The Minister in another place identified HP Enterprise Services as,</p>
<ul><a name="10012666000102"></a>"the recognised and authorised information technology provider for the Department for Work and Pensions".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Ninth Delegated Legislation Committee, 13/1/10; col. 4.]</ul>
<p><a name="10012666000093"></a>That unfortunately does not inspire as much confidence as it should. Can we be assured that we will not, once again, be presented with an example of the Civil Service's inability to negotiate rigorous contracts with the private sector? What measures of success are being demanded to deliver this system accurately and cheaply?</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000058"></a>I am glad to see the criminal offence around unlawfully disclosing data in these regulations, but I would like to confirm that at the end of the year HP Enterprise Services will also be required to wipe its systems of any data. At the moment, the explanatory document confirms only that energy suppliers and DWP have to purge their systems of the information shared between them.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000059"></a>I should like to address other areas that the Government should be looking at to help those suffering from fuel poverty. I do not expect the Minister to perform a U-turn today and accept the Conservative policy of providing a loan to home owners to upgrade the energy efficiency of their homes by simple means such as loft insulation and so on. However, does he  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC297"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC297</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not accept that many of those suffering from unaffordable fuel poverty would benefit enormously from such measures?</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000060"></a>Finally, I should like to push the Minister on what his department is doing to improve the worryingly low uptake rate of pension credits. In another place, the Minister claimed that the uptake rate was better at the lower levels of income, which is something, but unless the Minister thinks that pension credits are being offered to those who do not need them, it surely is not the point.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000061"></a>Despite my wider concerns about the Government's approach to fuel poverty, I welcome the regulations and I very much hope that they achieve the matching that they are intended to.</p>

<p><a name="10012666000062"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10012666000130"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> My Lords, we on these Benches share the general support that the noble Lord, Lord Freud, has given for these measures, as far as they go. Like him, I have a number of mainly factual questions.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000063"></a>Some 3.25 million households are estimated to be in fuel poverty and 2.25 million of them, according to Age Concern, are older households. How many pension credit recipients just of the guaranteed credit covered by the regulations do the Government believe are over 70? What is the total pool of people among whom help could be distributed? How many people are excluded-people over 70 who would otherwise be eligible-by the exclusion of people on the savings credit? There is obviously a problem of limited resources, but it seems very hard to give no help at all to a pensioner over 70 who is perhaps receiving only a few pence or a few pounds of savings credit or is benefiting from it.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000064"></a>Why does the scheme cover only electricity and not gas bills? The question is fairly obvious. How was the qualifying date of 26 March 2010 chosen and, given the considerable problems with take-up of pension credit and the delays in processing claims, will that lead to many pensioners who would otherwise be eligible missing out? Citizens Advice, which knows more about these matters than anyone, states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10012666000098"></a>"Problems in relation to Pension Credit are now a leading social policy issue ... The most common problem continues to be the length of time it takes to process claims, and in some cases this is being exacerbated by the loss of papers relating to individual claims";</p>

<p><a name="10012666000094"></a>with delays of more than a year in some cases. That is obviously shocking, not only in relation to this particular additional help but also in relation to qualifying for desperately needed pension credit generally.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000065"></a>Those are our main questions. However, even after the Minister's generally full and helpful introduction and studying the background papers, which I found helpful, I am still not sure of what is the best estimate of the number of people who will benefit. My honourable friend in the Commons, Steve Webb, said that he estimated that only about one-tenth of pensioners on pension credit would be helped. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000066"></a>We thank the Minister for the time and trouble he has taken to explain the regulations, and we would welcome detailed answers to our questions.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC298"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="10012666000067"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="10012666000131"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> My Lords, I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay, because I sought to intervene before I should have. I hope that he will recognise that it was an honest mistake.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000068"></a>The Minister has explained the purposes of this order very clearly and, like my noble friend Lord Freud, I welcome it. It is the first tangible, visible effort by the Government to solve a problem to which I drew the attention of the Grand Committee, and later that of the House, two years ago in January 2008-that is, the flaws in the CERT scheme, the carbon emissions reduction target scheme. I have alerted the noble Lord to the fact that I am going to refer back, very briefly, to those debates. I asked the Minister yesterday whether a DECC Minister would be supporting him, but he has got the best thing available with some extremely able DECC officials sitting behind him, whom I know well.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000069"></a>The point of my argument in 2008-which is entirely relevant to this order, as the Minister explained, under paragraph 5-is that 40 per cent of the savings under the carbon emissions reduction target have to come from what is called the "Priority Group"-which, essentially, is a large number of different categories of people claiming benefits-which, under that order, included for the first time all pensioners. I immediately declare an interest as a pensioner. However, nothing was done at that stage to help the energy suppliers to identify the households that would be eligible for the various benefits available, notably the insulation of their homes. At the time, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, who dealt with the order, firmly announced that if they did not meet their target of getting 40 per cent of their savings from the priority group, the suppliers would be liable to fines up to one-tenth of their total turnover. It was no small matter.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000070"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, freely acknowledged that the problem of identifying the priority group households was a serious one. He said that it was being addressed through what I have to say were extremely small pilot schemes, to which I shall come in a minute. But we are grateful for this order, because it is the first tangible expression of being able to allow the energy suppliers to identify the people who should benefit. I understand that most of this order is dealing with the energy rebate scheme, and I listened with interest to the Minister's remarks on that. Of course, we shall return to this issue on the Energy Bill, when we discuss what he called the social price support scheme. There are enabling provisions in that Bill to be supported later by regulations, which I am told are likely to be consulted on during the summer.</p>
<h5><a name="10012666000109"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000071"></a>I declared an interest a moment ago. I have had my house very recently insulated with loft insulation and cavity wall filling under the CERT scheme. It was perfectly clear that I was part of the priority group. I have to say that it has been a truly horrendous experience. The day when the firm turned up and did the work was not a problem, but I had to go through months of hassle to get this working at all. I tried to do it first through the Energy Saving Trust, having had a circular, which I was asked to fill in, on the nature of  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC299"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>my house and what the current insulation was. The trust wrote back and said that I needed more loft insulation and more cavity wall filling; then it referred me to another government body called "Coldbusters", which then referred me to a firm of insulation contractors. When I heard nothing more from the contractors, I rang them up and eventually a surveyor came. Then I heard nothing more after that and rang them up again, and they said that they were very sorry but they had run out of money and could not do any more.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000072"></a>At that point, I got in touch with the noble Baroness who deals with this in Defra. I asked her what was going on and how someone could run out of money for a scheme of this sort. She wrote me a very apologetic letter and said that it was perfectly clear that all the people that I dealt with in the Energy Saving Trust and Coldbusters did not understand the scheme. At that point, I washed my hands of it and started again and went back to my energy supplier, British Gas. Here, again, I had a very considerable problem, which I eventually had to resolve with the help of Ofgem, which was extremely helpful; it is responsible for administering the scheme.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000073"></a>Eventually we got the work done, but it took months-and it has totally vindicated my belief that the biggest single barrier that DECC faces in taking this scheme forward is the sheer hassle faced by householders. I was lucky, because I could write to a Minister and got the answer that the problem was total incompetence, and that the people in the government bodies running the scheme did not understand the scheme. I had to write to Ofgem to put a bomb under British Gas to get on with it. In the end, I got senior people involved. But, my Lords, that sort of thing is simply not open to the ordinary citizen, certainly not to the elderly people who are probably the most reluctant to embark on having their houses insulated. It has been a very sobering reflection on how one has to deal with officialdom in cases like this. I hope that perhaps DECC will take this back to see what can possibly be done to improve the ordinary citizen's experience.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000074"></a>Most of this instrument, as the Minister said, deals with the voluntary energy rebate scheme, the details of which he set out very clearly. As I said, I welcome it because it means that for the first time energy suppliers are to be given the names and addresses of the people to whom they need to give this credit.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000075"></a>The details of the eventual scheme will, as I said, be set out in secondary legislation and there will be a consultation in due course. We can of course return to this matter on the Energy Bill, but I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us when the consultation on the new social price support scheme is going to happen. It is sometimes referred to as a "mandated" scheme, but that actually means a "compulsory" scheme. It is all part of dressing up the scheme with the right words in the hope that that will make it more acceptable.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000076"></a>At this stage, I say only that I will require some persuading that it is right to expect the energy suppliers, who are in competition with each other and are facing having to supply electricity in a competitive market, to subsidise some of their customers who may be fuel-poor. I say that merely because I think that we will need to discuss this issue. It may be the most effective way forward but, as the Minister said, we already have the  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC300"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC300</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>winter fuel payment and the cold weather payment, which are social security benefits. They seem to be payable to everyone and mine goes straight to the Red Cross. It is a nice way of passing it on.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000077"></a>We come now to Regulation 5 of this statutory instrument, which deals with the CERT scheme. Paragraph (3)(d) of that regulation indicates that the purpose of this data-matching is,</p>
<ul><a name="10012666000103"></a>"to contact domestic customers who have received an automatic award with a view to ... offering energy efficiency measures ... delivering or helping to deliver energy efficiency measures",</ul>
<p><a name="10012666000095"></a>and, as the Minister said, to place their names on the priority list. That is all under the CERT order of 2008, which I do not think has always been immediately obvious. One person from whom I took advice on this said, "Oh no, you shouldn't raise CERT under these regulations; it has nothing whatever to do with them". So I wrote back to him saying that he was quite wrong; it does arise under these regulations, and there it is in Regulation 5(3)(d). Indeed, the Minister has explained why that should be so.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000078"></a>I, too, have some questions but, unlike, I think, the noble Lord, Lord Jones, I gave the Minister notice of them. My first question is similar to his: how many consumers, or perhaps consumer households, will be covered by the regulations? I appreciate that the DWP cannot yet say how many will receive the automatic energy rebate because, as the Minister explained, many of them may already be getting a discount from their supplier. The intention is that that should not be duplicated but, as the Minister said, it may turn out that there is such a big overlap that that has to be the case. However, I am not asking how many people will get the rebate; I am asking how many consumers or consumer households are entitled to the guarantee pension credit and so come within the purview of these regulations.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000079"></a>My second question derives from that and was, I think, asked by the noble Lord, Oakeshott: what proportion does that number represent of the 11.2 million priority households that are eligible for insulation help under the CERT scheme? The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, said that he had been advised by his colleague in another place that it might be 10 per cent. My guess is that the figure may be substantially lower than that but I shall await the Minister's answer.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000080"></a>I am sure the Minister will be briefed on my third question. Do the Government realise that electricity companies are still getting little or no help under any of these schemes to identify the rest of their consumers in the priority group who should be getting help with the insulation of their homes? What proposals do they have to deal with this problem? What progress has been made with the pilot schemes that I mentioned at the outset of my speech, which were referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker?</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000081"></a>I refer to a brief that I received from the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Like the rest of us, the commission rightly welcomes the scheme as a contribution to solving the problem but, under a heading "Use of Data", it states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10012666000099"></a>"The Commission notes that the Regulations have been amended following consultation to allow suppliers to contact matched customers to seek consent for them to be added to the list for priority services - as the result of suggestions in the consultation".</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC301"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC301</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="10012666000096"></a>I am not in the least surprised that those suggestions emerged from the consultation because it is a sensible thing to do. It goes on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10012666000100"></a>"Although we recognise and welcome longer-term measures such as increasing energy efficiency, we believe that the data in this scheme should only be used in order to process and apply the specific credit from the energy supplier. We are keen to ensure that data should not be used by energy suppliers for other purposes, such as direct marketing, without individuals pro-actively opting in".</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000082"></a>How does the commission think that energy suppliers are going to reach these 11.2 million households unless they are given some information about which they are? I can tell noble Lords how they reach them at the moment. They have a variety of methods, some of which may be more effective than others. A lot depends on identifying an area of a town or city in which they might expect to find a higher than average proportion of these customers. They then knock from door to door, finding out who these customers are and whether they have had any help under Warm Front or whether they qualify for help under the CERT scheme. They have told me that it is still a very expensive operation because it is like finding a needle in a haystack. They knock on a large number of homes and find that they are not eligible for help under the CERT scheme for a variety of reasons.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000083"></a>Two years after the original CERT order, and after we have complained bitterly about threatening the companies with fines if they do not reach their 40 per cent target, we are still not telling them who their target households are. All we have is this first-and I say again, very welcome-effort to try to tell them to whom they should be giving the rebate and whom they should be telling that they are entitled to help under the CERT scheme. What is happening to these pilot schemes? When can we hear something else coming out of that?</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000084"></a>Finally, I note that there has been a significant change in the scheme as a result of an amendment order passed last July. Among other things, the amendment order states that they were:</p>
<ul><a name="10012666000104"></a>"to remove direct mail high efficiency light bulbs (CFLs)".</ul>
<p><a name="10012666000097"></a>I had to ask what CFLs means: it means compact fluorescent lamps. Why can they not be called "high-efficiency light bulbs" or "low-energy light bulbs"? Why do they have to be given this fancy name? It is nothing to do with the Minister, but it is how these things sometimes get tangled up in jargon invented in Whitehall, which nobody understands. The main point I want to make about them is that in the last update of the carbon emissions programme, dated 6 November, very nearly 30 per cent of the savings achieved by then had come from lighting. Now those are illegal-they are not now allowed to be promoted by direct mail, as that has been banned, but can be through retail outlets.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000085"></a>There is a clear recognition that there will be a very substantial fall-off in the proportion of the savings coming from lighting-the CERT makes that clear-and that that will have to be made up by increasing the savings got from other sources. I do not expect an answer to this at the moment, and certainly not from the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, but how on earth are they to do that? They are working as hard as they can

This order will help them to a small extent with the credit pensioners, who get the guaranteed credit, but they are still left with that huge balance of the 11.2 million people from whom they have to try and get the savings.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000086"></a>This whole scheme, worthy though it is in intent-to judge by the figures produced by Ofgem, it is certainly making some progress-is still making relatively little progress compared with the need of trying to get millions of older houses properly insulated and protected against the cold. We will no doubt wish to explore this point further when the Energy Bill reaches this House but my question, which is the same as that put by other noble Lords, is: how many are covered by this scheme? It is not about who will get the automatic rebate, but about the individuals or households covered by it. Also, what proportion does that represent of the 11.2 million?</p>

Insofar as I miss any of those, I will be very happy to write to noble Lords. I think that all noble Lords focused on the numbers of those who will be helped here; the noble Lords, Lord Oakeshott, Lord Freud and Lord Jenkin of Roding, and my noble friend Lord Jones did that. I want to stress that people are eligible if they are on the guaranteed element of pension credit only and aged 70 or over. We believe that something like 0.6 million people are on savings credit only and that 2.7 million people are on some form of pension credit. Of those 2.7 million, we believe that something like 333,000 are eligible under this scheme.</p>

<p><a name="10012666000088"></a>When we go on to assess how many people will benefit from the scheme, we currently estimate that around 250,000 pensioner households will benefit from the rebate. The precise number will obviously depend on the quality that is achieved and the number in the target group already receiving a discounted tariff. Although that number is a relatively small proportion of the total of 11 million in the priority group-</p>

There is the prospect of that progressing once we come on to the mandated or compulsory scheme in due course. There is that benefit to flow from it as well, and I suggest that we should focus strongly on that.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10012666000091"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Oakeshott and Lord Freud, talked about take-up of pension credit. The Government have done much to make sure that there is full and improved take-up of pension credit. It is a challenge, but we know that take-up of the guarantee credit element of pension credit is higher. We think it is of the order of 72 to 81 per cent. It is the savings component of pension credit which tends to have less take-up.</p>

If the Minister is talking about 250,000 people who are expected to take it and the rebate is £80, we are looking at a budget of £20 million. So, when the Minister says that there is not much uptake, in practice there is a capped budget of £20 million and that is the amount the Government will put into this sector.

I apologise if I did not ask my question clearly enough, but what I was trying to ask about eligibility was: how many people aged over 70 do the Government estimate to be eligible for the guarantee element of pension credit? That is not the same as how many are getting it and are therefore eligible for this benefit. If the Minister does not have the figures specifically for people aged over 70 now, I would be delighted if he could write to me with the Government's best estimate.</p>

Everybody who is entitled to pension credit and has made a claim for it would get it. The gap is where people are theoretically entitled to pension credit but have not applied. Pension credit depends upon people's income and personal circumstances. The DWP or HMRC would not necessarily possess all those details to be able to make a judgment. There has to be a claim. A lot of work has been undertaken by the DWP in helping people to claim a combination of benefits, including council tax benefit and housing benefit, as well as pension credit. However, it does need to be claimed.</p>

If people have not made the claim, and are therefore not getting the benefit of the guaranteed pension credit, there is no way that they will have their details disclosed to the energy supplier, is there? Therefore, they will not get the energy rebate.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC304"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

Under these arrangements for sharing with the energy suppliers the data of people who are in receipt of certain components, or a component, of pension credit and are aged 70 or more, that matching has to be done. If somebody is entitled to pension credit, has not made a claim, has not been assessed and is in receipt of pension credit, they could not possibly feature in this match. That is right. In a sense, that is just a consequence of the broader challenge of trying to make sure that there is improved take-up of pension credit. This data-matching route will not be a perfect solution. The purpose of the pilot is to see how effective it can be for the cohort that we have identified and are seeking to apply it to.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000010"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freud, referred to data security and contractual arrangements. The department takes security of data very seriously and must deliver policies, procedures and controls to ensure that data are securely held, transferred and protected. Security is woven into everything that we do, driven in part by experience. We are deploying our existing IT service provider, HPES, to undertake the data-matching exercise, and it fully adheres to all departmental security protocols: creating contractual arrangements with the energy suppliers which specifically detail security arrangements and specify secure measures for handling, destroying and transferring data; encrypting all data in accordance with the DWP's encryption methodology prior to transfer to protect personal data; identifying named security officers from both the department and each energy supplier; and introducing a stringent monitoring and reporting system to ensure that security is at the forefront of the data-matching exercise. Creating these regulations-specifically Regulations 7 and 8-will strengthen the legal safeguards even further by creating an offence of unlawful disclosure, which is supported by the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000011"></a>The noble Lord asked what the scheme will cost. If, ultimately, it involves 250,000 people at £80 each, he is absolutely right that that will amount to £20 million, which will be met by the energy suppliers. The costs of setting up and running the data-matching exercise and the customer service follow-up action will also be met by the energy suppliers, and the total cost of that is not expected to exceed £1 million.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000012"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freud, talked about poverty targets and the need to do more. Our fuel poverty targets are challenging but the Government's policies in the UK fuel poverty strategy have centred on the three main drivers of fuel poverty: reducing the demand for energy through improving home energy efficiency; raising real incomes; and ensuring competitive energy prices through regulating the market and voluntary social pricing support schemes. Since 2000, we have spent £20 billion on benefits and programmes to tackle fuel poverty. This is a priority for the Government.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000013"></a>For example, this year we expect to spend around £2.7 billion on the winter fuel allowance, and we are currently committed to paying more than £250 million in cold weather payments. Warm Front has assisted more than 2 million households. The total funding for 2008-11 is £1.1 billion. Earlier this month, we launched the boiler scrappage scheme, which will provide a

This scheme will cost something like £50 million. I suggest that these measures have a real impact. We estimate that without them the number of fuel-poor households in England would be around 400,000 to 800,000 higher.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000014"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, asked about processing delays in pension credit and what that would mean. Unfortunately, someone whose claim is settled late will not qualify under this pilot. We recognise that some customers will obviously be disappointed, but, for reasons of simplicity and cost, we are not planning a further DWP scan to identify cases where a pension credit is subsequently awarded for the qualifying claim. Doing so would add enormously to the cost and the timeframe for delivery.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000015"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freud, asked how long the electricity suppliers will retain the shared data. We are expecting suppliers to be in a position to delete files sent to them shortly after they have received them. However, the exact timing will depend on how the data will be loaded on to supplier systems and when the payment will be made, and this is still under discussion.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000016"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freud, asked about success measures. We will be evaluating the scheme against a number of criteria, including how many pensioners are matched automatically, how many we reach through manual sweep-up through letters to those who do not match automatically and whether those who match get their credit with their next energy bill. Of course, we will learn lessons for the future as to the effectiveness of data-matching.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, asked how suppliers had found vulnerable households to date. It is a theme that he has spoken about previously. We believe that suppliers have been very successful in delivering against their CER targets, which is why we had the confidence to increase the level of the target by 20 per cent in 2009. For instance, by the end of the first 18 months of the three-year scheme, suppliers had achieved 63 per cent of their increased CER target. In the absence of any means of sharing government data with suppliers, they found it difficult to meet their priority group targets in the energy-efficient commitment that preceded CERT, which comprises households claiming particular benefits. In response, the Government took the opportunity to add all the over-70s to the group. So it is not all pensioners-it is those over 70, which increases the level of opportunities. Certainly, that helps suppliers make further progress on their priority group targets at the CERT halfway point, with less than one-third of savings left to be achieved.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000018"></a>The figures from April 2002 to September 2009 show that 3.4 million cavity wall insulations have been done, as well as 3.6 million professional loft insulations. Close to 2 million households have benefited from subsidised DIY loft insulation. In total, that means that around 7 million households have benefited from some form of insulation measures during this period. I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, that we

I shall share with DECC colleagues the lessons from that experience, to ensure that they are aware of it. As for monitoring the scheme, at the moment lead-times are monitored closely, although practically they tend to vary through the year. However, we recognise that in some cases the work is not done as quickly as the Government would like, let along the consumer.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000019"></a>The Energy Saving Trust recently commissioned a review of how its advice network refers into carbon emission reduction target schemes. The aim of the review is to improve the customer experience offered by the EST and the advice centres for customers wishing to install a CERT-funded measure. Most suppliers operate their own independent auditing procedures for insulation work and impose fines, suspensions and contract cancellations on installers who fail to meet standards of service and customer care. Suppliers work hard to ensure that customers do not have to wait longer than is reasonable and take action in cases in which that fails.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000020"></a>The noble Lord referred to the hassle factor and its impact on customer service and the success or potential success of the scheme. The primary aim is to deliver carbon reductions in households; the scheme has been very effective, and I have just outlined some of the achievements to date. This is about awarding the rebate, so people do not have to take action themselves. The noble Lord asked about the consultation on the mandated social price support scheme; we hope that that will take place in the summer of this year.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, talked, too, about the difficulty to date of suppliers finding vulnerable households. We believe that they have been successful in that; it has been helped in part by adding the over-70s to the group. One can understand the challenge-and I think that the noble Lord himself said that sometimes there was a process of focusing on particular areas. "Blitzing" is the term that might be applied to that. Part of the challenge is to reach these customers and to do it on a basis that has regard to costs. One can understand the challenges of that, which is why the data-matching-if we can make it work-provides a significant opportunity.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000022"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, asked what proportion of the priority group is represented by the 330,000 eligible people. It would be about 2 to 3 per cent. What we learn from the process is important. If we can make it work, the possibility of expanding it could be significant.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000023"></a>The noble Lord asked when payments would start. The Government will consider the success of the scheme and assess whether it provides a secure and effective means of targeting assistance to poorer pensioners. We expect payments to start from late spring, and evaluation will begin as soon as the first payments are made. The noble Lord asked about progress on the pilot schemes. I do not have much detail on that. Perhaps I might write to him.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000024"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freud, tempted me to comment on Conservative Party proposals. I am sure that he will forgive me if I do not stray into that. He referred to the discounted tariff and asked whether the overlap is large. The purpose of a trial run to evaluate the  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC307"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC307</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>overlap is to see whether the exercise is going to be meaningful. If we found that there was a 90 per cent overlap and that only 10 per cent of the potential customer base was going to be within a matching exercise, it would be doubtful whether such a small exercise could be justified on cost/benefit terms-hence the proposal that, if there is a large overlap, rowing back from the principle of excluding people if they get a discounted tariff would broaden the scope of people who would be within the exercise and make it potentially more meaningful. It is proposed, although I am not sure that it has been finally agreed yet, that for those who are in receipt of a discounted tariff the payment would not be £80 but £40, which would not be the full amount.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000025"></a>I fear that I have not covered all the points that noble Lords made. If anybody wishes to press me on a particular matter, I shall try again. If not, I shall look at the record and write to noble Lords further.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000026"></a>Fuel costs can have a big impact on household budgets. We want to be able to identify and target support effectively to those households which need most help. The regulations facilitate data-sharing between government and energy suppliers, and enable the Government to pilot their energy rebate scheme. The Government are proud of their record on reducing fuel poverty and our aim through this scheme is to provide pensioners over the age of 70 with a fuel rebate worth £80.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10012670000027"></a>Most people should receive the rebate this spring, without needing to do anything, in time to impact on the last quarter's energy bills. We are working with energy suppliers to set up a communications strategy to ensure that people who might be affected are aware of the scheme and its benefits. The energy rebate scheme will last for one year only. However, the lessons that we learn should be invaluable when it comes to designing the mandated scheme from 2011. I commend the regulations to noble Lords.</p>

It is incumbent on us to respond to those concerns to maintain confidence in the criminal justice system, and it is crucial that sentencing should properly reflect the seriousness with which this type of murder   


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC308"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC308</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is treated. I pay tribute to all those who have campaigned on this issue and I am sure that the Committee will join me in expressing my heartfelt sympathy to those bereaved relatives and friends who lost a loved one in such appalling circumstances.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000002"></a>Public concern has focused particularly on the disparity between the 30-year adult starting point for murder using a firearm and the 15-year starting point for murder using a knife. The Government responded to the concerns expressed last year by conducting a review over the summer of murder using a knife. We also consulted the Sentencing Guidelines Council, as required under statute. Guidance to the courts on determining the appropriate minimum term for murder cases is set out in statute, which ensures that there is an element of democratic accountability in the sentencing of this most serious of crimes. Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003, provides for three starting points for those offenders aged over 21: a whole life term, 30 years and 15 years. A court may adopt a 30-year or 15-year starting point for an offender who is aged 18, 19 or 20. There is a separate starting point of 12 years for all murders for offenders aged under 18 at the time the offence was committed. The legislation provides examples of the type of case which would attract the higher starting points, with all other cases attracting a 15-year starting point.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000003"></a>We propose to introduce a new adult starting point of 25 years for murder where an offender aged 18 or over takes a knife or other weapon to the scene of the crime with the intention of using it to commit any offence, or to use it as a weapon, and uses it in committing the murder. The emphasis is on the intention of the offender, since it is the circumstances surrounding the offence which reflect seriousness and distinguish between separate cases. It is these specific aggravating circumstances which would attract the proposed higher starting point. They have been framed to capture the type of case which gives rise to most concern in relation to knife crime. While the focus has, rightly, been on the use of knives, we have included any weapon carried to the scene because there should be no difference in the starting point if the weapon carried was a knife, a screwdriver, a baseball bat or any other weapon. It is not the method of killing that is most important but the intention to carry and use any weapon to kill.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000004"></a>Some issues were raised in the other place about the potential meaning of "knife or other weapon" and there was a discussion around various possible scenarios. I can clarify that under this draft order, "weapon" has its ordinary meaning. Other legislation provides various definitions of knives and offensive weapons for different purposes. However, here it is the intention of the offender which gives the character of the offence, not the character of the knife or other weapon. Ultimately, it will be for the court to determine what constitutes a weapon, as it does in other cases of assault. We predict that it would be unlikely to take the view that the use of hands and feet would be considered a weapon for these purposes unless, for example, a knuckle-duster was used, particularly as the order is drafted in terms of a weapon taken to the scene. However, these provisions may apply where the weapon is a folding pocket knife with a blade of less than three inches. Such a knife  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC309"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC309</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may be legitimately carried in public, but if the offender took such a knife to the scene with the intention of use and then used it to kill, the proposed new starting point would apply.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000005"></a>We think it is right that we have maintained the distinction between the starting points for murder using a firearm and murder using other weapons. Knives and many other weapons are legally available in every domestic setting and are most commonly used in the heat of the moment where they are readily to hand. Firearms are subject to much more restrictive legislation and there can never be a legitimate reason for carrying a loaded weapon in public. The reality is that firearms are most often used in serious and organised crime and they have much greater potential to give rise to multiple victims. We consider it right, therefore, to retain a higher starting point for murder using a firearm than that for use of a knife.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000006"></a>We must also bear in mind that the Court of Appeal has ruled that a 30-year starting point for murder using a firearm is usually merited only where there is premeditation. Our proposals considerably reduce the gap where there is premeditated use of a knife or other weapon. The proposed new starting point applies to adult offenders. We are making no change to the starting point for juveniles, which is 12 years for all murders. There are good reasons for this. Sentencing for juveniles is extremely complex and encompasses wider considerations than those which pertain in relation to adults, including considerations of the welfare of the child. If we were to amend the starting point for this kind of case for juveniles, we would have to consider the whole structure of Schedule 21 in relation to juveniles. This is because there is currently only one starting point for juveniles rather than the three for adults. If we were to differentiate for them, we would have to put in place a similar structure to that for adults, and consideration of any such change would take time to do properly and would need primary legislation. However, the court will reflect the age, emotional maturity and culpability of the offender when sentencing a juvenile. For these reasons, where the offender is a mature 17 year-old who committed a murder with a weapon taken to the scene with intent to use it, the minimum term imposed is likely to be closer to that applying to an adult in the same aggravating circumstances.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000007"></a>Our proposals are intended to provide for more transparency and a greater degree of consistency in sentencing; they are not intended to impose a straitjacket on the courts, nor do we wish to do so. The court must be free to impose the appropriate sentence in each case and reflect all aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Schedule 21 provides for that flexibility and the court may arrive at any final minimum term from any starting point; it will be what the court determines proper in the circumstances. Nevertheless, it is important that Parliament should establish what it considers should usually be the starting point in this type of case-public confidence demands no less. These proposals are based on proper reflection of the issues and are specifically targeted on murders where the offender deliberately arms himself with a weapon with every intention of using it to kill. The public have every right to expect  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC310"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC310</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that sentencing in such cases should reflect the severity of such a crime. That is why our proposals have been structured as I have just described.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000008"></a>I know there were concerns about the difference between the costs promulgated by the Government and those referred to by the Sentencing Guidelines Council. The council estimated that between 500 and 1,500 additional prison places would be required if a new starting point was set at either 20 or 30 years; we have estimated between 1,000 and 2,000 additional prison places based on the proposed new 25-year starting point. There will be no initial cost and the provision will have no cost for 15 years from the point of implementation, but will increase each subsequent year over a period of about 45 years, which is when the provision will have reached its maximum impact.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000009"></a>In its calculations, the council has simply estimated that the additional 500 places would cost £19 million each year. We have taken the average cost over the 45 years it takes for the numbers to build up to the maximum impact. We have also used the average discounted cost per year, whereas the council has estimated costs at today's prices. The average discounted cost per year over 45 years is estimated to be between £8.7 million and £13.2 million. On the face of it there appears to be a difference, but that is only because the figures are calculated in a slightly different way. I do not criticise the council for doing that, but we suggest that the Government have calculated the figures in an accurate way.</p>

<p><a name="10012679000010"></a>I hope I have covered all the issues which concerned Members in the other place. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="10012679000011"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="10012679000050"></a>Lord Henley:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Baroness the Attorney-General for introducing the order. I join with her comments about the public concern over knife crime, particularly following the murder of Ben Kinsella and many others over the past few years. It is a growing problem and it is right that we should look at it and address it. I, too, offer our condolences to the families who have lost relations as a result of this growing problem</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000012"></a>As the noble and learned Baroness is aware, my honourable friend David Burrowes in another place expressed his general support for this measure when it was debated there on 12 January. I therefore need not repeat everything he said on that occasion. However, I wish to deal with a number of concerns that have since arisen.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000013"></a>The first concern, which the noble and learned Baroness quite rightly addressed, is the question of the definition of a knife or other weapon. As she put it, it is the intention that makes an object a weapon rather than its intrinsic nature. We all know what a knife is; the other weapon becomes a weapon if there is an intention to use it as such. Therefore a baseball bat-even a cricket bat, dare I say it, in England-or a screwdriver could become a weapon if there was an intention to use it as such. Similarly, although a knife is quite obviously a weapon, there are many legitimate occasions when people can carry knives. As often as not there is a small Swiss Army knife in my briefcase. In the old days it would be there to take stones out of horses' shoes-we all had knives with a long implement  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC311"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to take stones out of horses' shoes-but nowadays there is not often that necessity. They normally also have a corkscrew attachment with which to open a bottle of wine, and a host of other things. However, if there is no intention to use such a knife as a weapon, again I take it that it is perfectly legitimate to carry it. I am now happy that I understand what knife or other weapon means. It would be a matter for the courts because they would have to consider the question of intention when a prosecution takes place.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000014"></a>I also accept that the position with firearms-which has a 30-year minimum rather than a 25-year minimum-is very different. Again, as the noble and learned Baroness put it, it is quite difficult to go out accidentally with a firearm. The noble and learned Baroness referred to the need for premeditation; one could argue that there is premeditation merely in having a firearm on one's presence, or there is at least a certain recklessness that gets quite close to premeditation in carrying a weapon. I am satisfied with what she has said about that.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000015"></a>My honourable friend's second question was about increasing the figure to 25 years for those aged 18 and upwards and leaving the figure for those under 18 at 12 years. We are beginning to get something of discrepancy: it was 12 years and 15 years; it is now 12 years and 25 years with the break at 18, whereas, if I understand the noble and learned Baroness correctly-she will tell me if I am wrong-it used to be at 21. I shall be grateful for her comments on that. That will create a big discrepancy and the Government might want to look in future at whether it might not be appropriate to raise that figure for the under-18s. There will be occasions when two people-one just under 18 and one just over 18-will offend together and very different sentences will be prescribed as a result of this discrepancy.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000016"></a>The third point on which I would like further comment relates to the concerns of the Lord Chief Justice. When he was speaking on behalf of the Sentencing Guidelines Council he thought that there were other ways in which this matter could be addressed rather than by simply increasing the minimum. Having said that, we on these Benches are satisfied that this is the right way ahead. I would be grateful if the noble and learned Baroness will address those points when she replies.</p>

<p><a name="10012679000017"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10012679000051"></a>Lord Wallace of Tankerness:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble and learned Baroness the Attorney-General for introducing the order and for indicating the underlying thinking behind the Government's intention. It is widely recognised that murder is one of the most heinous of crimes, and nothing I say in the debate will detract from that nor from the sympathy that is due to the families of victims. I concur with both the noble and learned Baroness and the noble Lord in expressing our deepest sympathy to them. This order can perhaps be traced back to the senseless and brutal murder of Ben Kinsella, whose family's loss continues, as does our sympathy for them.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000018"></a>I also share with the noble and learned Baroness her expression that the courts should ultimately be free to determine the minimum sentence by taking into account all the factors and that we are debating  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC312"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>today where the starting point is. Nevertheless, I wish to strike a note of scepticism in relation to the order. This is born out of a concern that what we have here has come from the school of thought of "something must be seen to be done", rather than from taking a step backwards and working out what is the right thing to do. To support that view I shall quote what the Justice Secretary said when he and the Home Secretary made the announcement that this order was to be brought forward. Mr Straw said in his press statement,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10012679000042"></a>"I am clear that we will not stop in our efforts to stop kids killing with knives".</p>

<p><a name="10012679000035"></a>However, as is clear from the order and as the noble and learned Baroness has said, the order does not affect kids because the starting point for those under 18 will still be 12 years even after the order comes into force. It will do nothing for kids.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000019"></a>If, as the Attorney-General said, a mature 17 year-old uses a knife with premeditation, the circumstances may be such that the end point could be the court determining a sentence which is not far distant from that for an adult. However, that could happen at the present time without the need for the order, which does not affect anyone who is 17 years of age.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000020"></a>I sometimes fear that there is a gulf between the kind of rhetoric that the Justice Secretary used in announcing this order and the reality-that it will not have the impact that he claimed-which may be what leads to public cynicism about our political process. I am also sceptical about whether it achieves what the Government claim that it will achieve. Will it indeed be effective in tackling knife crime or, more specifically, murders involving knives? As we have heard, the Government were required to consult both the Sentencing Guidelines Council and the senior judiciary. Responses from those two sources show that that scepticism is somewhat shared. In its response, the Sentencing Guidelines Council made the point that I have already made: that this measure will not deal with public concern about kids carrying knives and that the need to increase the severity of sentences is well recognised by the courts where the,</p>
<ul><a name="10012679000043"></a>"use of a knife appears already to be accepted as an aggravating factor when imposing sentence for murder".</ul>
<p><a name="10012679000036"></a>The use of a weapon to frighten or injure is already an aggravating factor in the council's guidelines and is deemed highly culpable when the weapon is taken with that intent.</p>
<h5><a name="10012679000046"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Henley, talked about the use of a knife and definition of a knife-a point raised specifically by the SGC-and the word "weapon". It may be too easy for the Government to say, as they do in the Explanatory Memorandum, that the ordinary English usage will determine it, because there could be circumstances when a screwdriver is not deemed to be a weapon. I think that carrying a baseball bat would certainly involve that, but what about a pair of nail scissors, which could be turned into a weapon? Then you get occasions, which by all accounts are relatively common in violent situations involving gangs of youths, when a bottle which has been used with the intention  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC313"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC313</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>primarily of drinking from it suddenly gets smashed and is then turned into a weapon. The bottle is not brought to the scene of the crime with the intention of using it as a weapon but, as so often happens in cases like this, drink is another factor that leads to the crime.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000022"></a>My concern would be that you could reach the stage, which the Sentencing Guidelines Council warns against, where there is inconsistency, with some cases being considered to fall within the ambit of this order and others not. It is the inconsistency and lack of clarity that the Government have said that they want to try to get away from, but it might actually be made worse or imported by this order.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000023"></a>Also, at paragraph 8.3 of the Explanatory Memorandum, we are advised that the,</p>
<ul><a name="10012679000044"></a>"Lord Chief Justice responded on behalf of the senior judiciary and representations were also received from the Judges of the Central Criminal Court".</ul>
<p><a name="10012679000037"></a>However, we are not given any indication as to what the Lord Chief Justice said in his response. As my colleague Paul Holmes said in Committee in another place, the office of the Lord Chief Justice was approached to try and ascertain what kind of response he made. It is only fair to say that that information that we got suggested that there was scepticism on his part and the part of the senior judiciary about the merit and efficacy of this measure. Gun and knife crime cannot be directly compared, because guns are often associated with multiple killings and serious organised crime, whereas knives can be available in many ordinary domestic settings. There is little deterrent effect from the proposed change-that was another view expressed-and judges already take the use of a knife into account as an aggravating factor when coming to a decision as to the appropriate starting point.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000024"></a>If both the Sentencing Guidelines Council and the Lord Chief Justice have cast doubt on whether the measure will have the effect intended and claimed by the Government, it might be useful for the noble and learned Baroness to indicate what the Government heard from the Lord Chief Justice and how they respond to the specific concerns that he appears to have raised.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000025"></a>I apologise for bringing up what may seem to be legal niceties, but that is what we are here to do. The Minister made things clear in her introduction, and the Explanatory Memorandum refers to an offender aged 18 or over who takes a knife or other weapon to the scene of the crime, with the intention of using it to commit any offence. However, sub-paragraph (2) of new paragraph 5A, which is to be added to Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003, states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10012679000039"></a>"The offence falls within this sub-paragraph if the offender took a knife or other weapon to the scene intending to ... commit any offence".</p>

<p><a name="10012679000038"></a>It does not state, "intending to commit any offence with that knife". As I interpret it-I may be totally wrong, and I welcome assurance that I have got it wrong-the offender could have taken a knife to the scene of a crime intending to commit a crime of a non-violent nature. At it stands, if something happened and the knife was used, that would bring the offender   


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC314"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC314</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>within the ambit of this provision. Is that what is intended? If the element of premeditation is essential, as I think the noble and learned Baroness said it is, that is not clear from the way in which the sub-paragraph is phrased. If that is not clear, we could get into a situation. The Court of Appeal has indicated that a 30-year starting point would not be appropriate in cases of gun crime where there was no premeditation. If premeditation is not a requirement, knife crime could end up with a higher starting point than unpremeditated use of a gun. I know that that is not what is intended, but I welcome reassurance that that is clear.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000026"></a>I thank the noble and learned Baroness for her explanation of the costs given by the Government's estimate and by the Sentencing Guidelines Council. It is helpful to have that on the record. The government figure used in the Explanatory Memorandum-about £11 million-is an annual average over a 45-year period, but we should be talking about a 30-year period, because none of it will kick in until the first 15 years have expired. The figure of £11 million will probably be closer to £16.5 million after the first 15 years.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000027"></a>Given the objective of this order, one of the most important points is that the Government accept that the important issue in trying to tackle knife crime and murders involving knifes is the fear of being caught. I believe that is the greater deterrent. Paragraph 3.9 of the evidence base attached to the Explanatory Memorandum states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10012679000040"></a>"A key factor for the prospective offender is the probability of detection. Knives are relatively easy to conceal and dispose of. Given the detection of gun crime is higher than knife crime, the incentive to use a knife rather than a firearm may be significant. Similarly, where the costs of acquiring weapons may have a significant impact, the ready availability of knives and other sharp objects means that acquiring these is relatively easy compared to other weapons e.g. guns".</p>

<p><a name="10012679000028"></a>I do not dispute the factual nature of that, but it indicates that the Government accept that the fear of being caught is a key factor. You cannot punish unless you catch, so perhaps the focus is wrong. The focus should be on detection because only then can punishment come into effect. I am somewhat sceptical that the young thugs who commit these crimes do the cost-benefit analysis suggested by the Explanatory Memorandum.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000029"></a>I have far more experience north of the border than south of it. Knife crime is a serious problem in Scotland and is usually combined with drink. The usual explanation, which by no means mitigates the crime, is that young people-young men in particular-take knives with them because they know that others are out with knives, and it might be that they will need a knife for self-defence. That is not a cost-benefit analysis; it is a culture that we have to tackle. The important thing is trying to find ways in which detection can be more effective.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10012679000030"></a>I conclude by drawing attention, as did my colleague Paul Holmes in another place, to the so-called Cardiff model, based on the work of Professor Jonathan Shepherd, who is chairman of the violent crime task group of the Cardiff Community Safety Partnership. He took casework from the accident and emergency unit in a hospital in Cardiff, because he found out that many of the cases that he  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC315"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC315</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was dealing with never came to the notice of the police. He regularly had to repair people who were the victims of knife crime. He succeeded in anonymising the data with regard to the location of the violence, the type of weapon used, the number of assailants, the day of the week that the incident occurred and the time of the incident. Engaging in intelligent policing then allowed the police to deal with that information. If X nightclub was a spot where there was regular violence on a Friday at 11.30 pm, that is where the police focused their attention. It might be outside another nightclub on a Saturday or in the early hours of Sunday morning. Getting that information was a rolling programme. It could be updated if there was some displacement of the crime because the police were effective in one area. Clearly, that information would come through as well.</p>

<p><a name="10012679000031"></a>Interestingly, in Cardiff since 2002, when I understand this project started, overall accident and emergency violence-related attendances have been reduced by 40 per cent. Cardiff moved from mid-table to being the safest city in a Home Office list of 15 similar cities. The Home Secretary, Mr Alan Johnson, asked for a report on this in October 2007. What has been done to disseminate what would appear, on the surface, to be the good and effective practice that was covered in that report? I acknowledge that the Government have deployed several measures, engaging with the police in more visible policing, but there would appear to be something worthwhile there.</p>

<p><a name="10012679000032"></a>My colleague Chris Huhne made several freedom of information requests to hospital trusts. In an article in the <I>Times</I> on 30 March 2009, Mr Huhne wrote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10012679000041"></a>"There are 150 hospital trusts with emergency departments in England. Of the 123 that have replied, just 20 per cent are co-operating with their local police force in providing Cardiff-style data. Nearly four out of five are not helping the police".</p>

<p><a name="10012679000033"></a>However, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 imposes a responsibility on health, local government and police authorities to work together.</p>

<p><a name="10012679000034"></a>My final plea to the Minister would be for some assurance that that kind of effective policing can be taken forward. It is a far more effective way of tackling the outrage of knife crime and murder by knives than the provisions that we have in this order.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10012683000002"></a>I regard the 2003 Act, brought about by the decision of the House of Lords in Anderson v Home Secretary, as one of the wisest developments of the past decade in the law of murder. I regard it as a failure that we have not somehow been able to partition the punishment for murder into those areas which require proper partitioning, rather than having a blanket overall punishment. This is not levelled at this Government alone. I am not the first nor, I am sure, the last to make those comments. It is entirely proper that one should set a high penalty, at a starting point of 25 years, for the use of a knife in bringing about murder.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10012683000003"></a>Having said that, I am somewhat intrigued by the wording-which is, I think, the same as that quoted by the noble and learned Baroness-that appears at paragraph 7.1 of the Explanatory Memorandum and explains the scope of this measure,</p>
<ul><a name="10012683000020"></a>"25 years for adults who murder using a knife or other weapon taken to the scene with the intention to commit an offence or of having it available for use as a weapon".</ul><h5><a name="10012683000022"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10012683000004"></a>The scope of that can be considerable. If the intention is to deal with a situation where a person uses a knife intending to cause grievous bodily harm or to kill, I can well understand it. Those are the two areas of mens rea relevant to murder. I could also well understand it if with "knife" one said ejusdem generis, that is, "or similar weapon". However, the trouble with using just the word "weapon" is that a person might have a relatively innocuous weapon that is intended to be used for a relatively innocuous purpose-for example, for no more than joining in an affray. If some of the wording is left as wide as that, it seems to me that there will be difficulties. Having said that, I have little doubt that the discretion of a wise and sensible judge would cure practically all these difficulties.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10012683000005"></a>I tender my apologies to the noble and learned Baroness and the Committee in that I am already late for an urgent appointment and will therefore beat a hasty retreat.</p>

In the context of this debate, are figures available for, say, 2008, if not for 2009, regarding the level of knife crime? If such figures are available, would it be possible to know how many people over the age of 21 committed such crimes, as well as those in the age brackets 18 to 20 and 12 to 18? That might help us better understand the context of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="10012683000007"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="10012683000027"></a>Baroness Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I shall deal with my noble friend's last point first. I do not have those figures with me today, and I am not sure whether we have the precise data. My noble friend asks for a breakdown according to age, but I am not confident that we have those figures. However, I certainly take his point and undertake to ensure that he receives them if they are available.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10012683000008"></a>I turn to the issue that the noble Lords, Lord Wallace and Lord Henley, raised in relation to the court's position. I understand that, on the face of it, there appears to be some minor difference, but I do not think that the views of the Sentencing Guidelines Council or, indeed, the judiciary depart very much from those of the Government. The council and the Government share the view that has been expressed in this Room; namely, that knife crime is a very serious offence and it needs to be dealt with robustly. As noble Lords will know, the courts have not hesitated to do so, particularly where it is clear that an individual has used a knife with the intention of causing harm. Therefore, agreement in relation to those matters appears to be solidly based.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC317"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC317</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10012683000009"></a>The Sentencing Guidelines Council's response highlighted a number of issues. With regard to the law on murder using a knife, it highlighted that seriousness is normally related to the circumstances of the offence; for example, premeditation rather than simply the method used is important. We listened very carefully to that point. We also took on board the view that the council expressed about intention. Your Lordships will see that the provision that we have brought forward is focused on the intent of the individual, because that is what will determine whether the higher starting point is merited. Someone may take a knife, a bat or a weapon of some sort with them to commit a burglary. If they took that weapon with them to commit a criminal offence-they did not find it there, they did not just come across it and it was not used in the heat of the moment-and they then used it to kill, then the judge, exercising his or her discretion would be entitled to start at the higher starting point. Your Lordships know that it does not stop there because the court is entitled to take into account mitigating features that might cause it to reduce it significantly or aggravating features that might cause it to go higher. We have created clarity that when you commit a premeditated offence and where there is the intention to take a weapon with you for use in the commission of a criminal offence, the court is entitled to make a judgment on whether that is appropriate.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10012683000010"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, and, I think, the noble Lord, Lord Henley, asked about the discrepancy between the 17 year-old and the 18 year-old. We come right back to intention, circumstances and consequence because the court can take into account the maturity of the 17 year-old and is entitled to take into account the maturity of the 18 year-old. Noble Lords will know that age is not always the determining factor of maturity. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Justice talked about "kids". Your Lordships will know that many of us who have reached a certain age still talk of anyone under 30 as a kid. One can be forgiven a certain looseness of tongue that may not necessarily detract from the maturity that some individuals have at 18.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10012683000011"></a>It is important for us to look at it in the round and say that Parliament is putting down a marker or a starting point, but no more. I absolutely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, about the wonderful work that has been done by Professor Shepherd in Cardiff. Not only has Professor Shepherd looked at knives, he has also done a huge amount of work on domestic violence and has been instrumental in helping us to collate information across health, so that we are now making an appreciable difference. I agree that one cannot look simply at this legislative provision. We must look at what we are doing on family intervention projects, safer school partnerships, neighbourhood policing teams, community prosecutors, the triaging that we are now-I hope-giving to victims and offenders to identify what risks there are for them and how we can intervene in their behaviour, and the work done on domestic violence. That work has made a significant impact. If we look at the causes why some of the young people that the noble Lord, Lord Wallace,  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC318"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC318</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>talked about take knives with them and the fears that they have, many of them come from dysfunctional families, so we are helping those families.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10012683000012"></a>The Committee should know that we have, together, done a great deal; I am talking about statutory, non-statutory and not-for-profit agencies and individuals. On domestic violence, Sylvia Walby's research, which was used in part by Professor Shepherd, said that it cost us £23 billion in 2003. Her most recent research shows a reduction of £7.5 billion, so I take on board everything that the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, said about that and assure him that Professor Shepherd's work is being used extensively. He has participated in the Tackling Knives Action Programme that encompasses a range of police forces across England and Wales. Fifteen force areas, plus the British Transport Police, are now targeting over £5 million this year on tackling teenage crime.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="10012683000013"></a>We are focusing very hard on prevention; we are working with retailers nationwide to prevent the sale of knives to under-18s and have given teachers new powers to search for knives at school. That goes hand in hand with educational work to convince teenagers that carrying a knife does not make them safer and actually puts them in more danger. South Wales is part of the Tackling Knives Action Programme and probably has the best practice. It has been identified by the Home Office under that programme. I hope that I have said enough to reassure the noble Lord that we are right alongside him when it comes to that issue.</p>

<p><a name="10012683000014"></a>Will this make a difference? We believe that it will, and that it will be one of the issues that contribute to long-term delivery. On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Henley, the Lord Chief Justice believes that murder in these aggravating circumstances should attract a severe sentence, as I have indicated. He has also recognised the public concern about it. I hope that I have said enough to reassure noble Lords that the provision is needed and that it can be safely left to the courts to apply it with the necessary sensitivity, differentiating in every case between the nature and quality of the act complained of, so that the sentence really fits the crime.</p>

<p><a name="10012683000019"></a>It does not necessarily mean intending to commit any offence using that knife. He might be using the knife to slash some tyres which, however reprehensible, is not on the same level as murder. Would that bring the accused or convicted person-we have come to the sentence-to the starting point of 25 years, albeit that after that some mitigating factors could possibly be taken into account? Is there not a concern that as it is drafted the measure may be too wide?</p>

I give the example of someone taking a knife with them to commit a burglary. Perhaps they take the knife with them to use it for a criminal offence. Let us say that the householder apprehends them and they then use that knife to kill that householder. They have taken the knife with them to the place where they are going to commit the offence in order to commit an offence, but then use the knife, which they took for the criminal offence of burglary, to kill. It was the fact that they took the knife with them to commit an offence that enabled them to use the knife to kill the householder.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10012683000017"></a>In those circumstances, it must be right that the court is given the opportunity to say that it will start at its starting point. That does not mean that that is where it will stay, because it can take all factors into account, but it sends a very clear message that if someone goes out from their home or where they live and take a weapon with them with the intent of using it to commit an offence, they are at risk of a 25-year starting point and will have to argue with the court about why in their particular circumstances is not fair and should not apply because the intention was something else. It changes the balance from where we start. If someone takes a knife with them to commit an offence-does not pick it up or, in the heat of the moment, find an implement or weapon and use it-that should be marked by a higher sentence. That is how we think that it will be used.</p>

The amendments relate to inspection and audit fees charged by the Auditor-General for Wales, and are consequential on the Local Government (Wales) Measure passed by the National Assembly for Wales last year. The amendments are needed to ensure that the measure operates as intended and that fees charged under the measure are treated in the same way as the fees that are charged under existing legislation.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000001"></a>The Local Government (Wales) Measure 2009 has several broad purposes. First, it replaced the system of "best value" in local government with a new "local government improvement" regime which introduces a broader set of duties and powers for service improvement by local authorities. Secondly, it reformed the process for producing community strategies and requires local  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC320"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC320</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>authorities and other local service providers to collaborate in developing and implementing a long-term strategy for enhancing local well-being. Thirdly, it joined these two processes together, requiring local authorities to reflect strategic objectives in service improvement.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000002"></a>Local government in Wales has long been devolved, and these changes are all within the legislative competence of the National Assembly. However, one small element of the package of changes is outside it. It is that element which is addressed by the order before the Committee today.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000003"></a>In replacing the "best value" regime, created by the Local Government Act 1999, the measure also replaced the inspection and audit regime under the 1999 Act. Independent audit is of course vital to public accountability and can stimulate improvement. The measure reflected that principle. It also streamlined and simplified the role of the Auditor-General for Wales and the Wales Audit Office in inspecting and auditing local authority performance. In particular, it gave the Auditor-General greater flexibility to support performance improvement and to report clear findings which enhance local and national accountability.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000004"></a>The measure also sought to preserve the principle that public audit and inspection takes place on a quasi-contractual basis between auditors and the bodies that they audit, and is funded by fees levied on audited bodies rather than from central government. This is a widely accepted practice across the United Kingdom, for two main reasons. First, it maintains audited bodies' responsibility for, and ownership of, the audits to which they are subjected and avoids a general charge on the public purse. Secondly, the extent and thus the cost of an audit generally reflect the level of risk within an organisation. Funding it via fees provides a further incentive to public bodies to improve their standards of corporate governance and performance management, leaving them liable to a lower fee.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000006"></a>The local government measure empowered the Auditor-General to levy fees for audits and inspections as previously, but it could not deal with the accounting treatment of those fees. Under Section 120(1)(c) of the Government of Wales Act 2006, the default position is that the Auditor-General must surrender any income that he or she receives to the Welsh Consolidated Fund. The Act also makes exceptions to that rule to allow the Auditor-General to retain income from specified sources, including fees charged under the Local Government Act 1999. This means that best-value audit and inspection is funded from fees and preserves the general principles which I described earlier.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000007"></a>The local government measure made no equivalent provision for fees charged under the new improvement regime because it had no power to do so. In general, the Assembly is prohibited from passing a measure which amends the Government of Wales Act 2006. There are obvious constitutional reasons for that general rule, but in this case it creates a problem. This order is designed to solve it. The Auditor-General would have to surrender fee income to the Welsh Consolidated Fund, and audit and inspection work under the measure would have to be financed centrally from that fund. That would be contrary to established practice across the United Kingdom, which I have already outlined,  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC321"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC321</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and would diminish the local ownership and effectiveness of such work. The draft order is designed to correct that situation and allow the Auditor-General to retain fees charged under the measure. It would also ensure that the Assembly's audit committee could not examine estimates of the Auditor-General's fee income under the measure, just as it cannot currently examine fee income under the Local Government Act 1999. This reflects the fact that the Committee's remit does not extend to the Auditor-General's work in relation to local government performance.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000008"></a>In making these changes, the draft order seeks to maintain long-established principles and practices which exist for sound reasons of public management and accountability. The Wales Audit Office strongly supports the draft order and, indeed, believes that it is vital to make the draft order before the start of the 2010-11 financial year, when audit work under the measure will begin. I commend the draft order to the House. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="10012686000009"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10012686000098"></a>Lord Roberts of Conwy:</b> My Lords, some Members of the Committee may be surprised to find me here-and, indeed, I am surprising myself. The reason for my presence is that my noble friend Lord Glentoran has been delayed in a meeting to deal with the somewhat fraught situation in Northern Ireland. He forewarned me that that might happen and asked me to stand in his place.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000010"></a>As the Explanatory Memorandum notes, this is the first order under Section 50 of the Government of Wales Act 2006, which provides for changes necessary in consequence of an Assembly measure being passed. This is yet another historic first in Welsh devolution, and a fairly significant one, because what is provided for here is a change in the content of Schedule 8 of the original 2006 Act as a result of an Assembly measure. It is a curious boomerang effect, which some of us may think more curious as we consider the possible unintended consequences.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000011"></a>Am I right in thinking-I believe that I am-that out goes the "best value" principle of the Local Government Act 1999 and that its place is taken by an "improvement" criterion, which is very much looser and is not confined to "economy, efficiency and effectiveness"? This is clearly the case, and it is confirmed by paragraph 7.1 of the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the order. I have not seen a copy of the Assembly measure, so I must ask whether improvement is defined there, and how. Without definition, improvement can mean all sorts of different things to different people and authorities. Definition is necessary to achieve a measure of consistency between authorities of the same kind. I would have thought that that was desirable.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000012"></a>I shall be very brief in my comments on article 2, amending the 2006 Act so that the Auditor-General retains income from fees and does not have to pay them into the Welsh Consolidated Fund. How will the use and expenditure of these fees be accounted for? It is a fair and an important question. Auditing systems are just as fallible as any other, and financial integrity and accountability must have a very high priority, at all times and in all organisations, especially those supported by taxpayers' money.</p>

<p><a name="10012686000013"></a>The same article 2 amends the Act,</p>

<p><a name="10012686000073"></a>to quote the Explanatory Memorandum. Why should this prohibition be required? I am mystified, and surprised that the Wales Audit Office appears to have agreed to this restriction on its powers because it is content that the order be made. We ought to have a clear answer about why the exclusion of the Wales Audit Office is included because unless we do, people will read between the lines with suspicion in their hearts, and I shall not blame them.</p>

<p><a name="10012686000014"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="10012686000099"></a>Lord Livsey of Talgarth:</b> I have looked at this measure and the consequential modifications that it addresses. This order is relatively simple, because the modifications are consequential upon changes made to the relationship between the Auditor-General for Wales and the local government improvement scheme, which allows fees charged under the previous best value scheme to be retained by the Auditor-General for Wales rather than being paid into the Welsh Consolidated Fund. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, asked some persistent questions with his usual incisiveness, and I shall be interested in the answers.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000015"></a>I have not looked into this document in the detail that the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, has, but on the surface, it seems to be an eminently sensible arrangement. It connects the accountability of the Auditor-General for Wales and local government in Wales. In evaluating the performance of local government, the fees going directly to the Auditor-General for Wales rather than into the Welsh Consolidated Fund should result in improved administration. The new scheme reflects community needs in Wales over a longer term. Communities in Wales are often small and isolated, so to secure long-term development, they require sustained schemes to secure success. A one-size-fits-all best value scheme may not provide conclusive, constructive solutions in local government in Wales. I have seen the downside of that on a number of occasions.</p>

<p><a name="10012686000016"></a>This order goes in the right direction and is necessary. The fact that the Wales Audit Office strongly supports it is a good reason for supporting it, albeit that the barriers to examining the detail, which were highlighted by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, require explanation.</p>

<p><a name="10012686000017"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="10012686000100"></a>Lord Rowlands:</b> I rise not to debate the content of the order but because, like the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, I am rather intrigued by the procedures and processes by which this order has arrived here. Am I right in believing that my noble friend told us that a legislative competence order for local government allowed the Welsh Assembly Government to create the Local Government (Wales) Measure 2009? Will he tell us when and how? I presume that, during the passage of that measure, someone discovered that the original order did not allow the provisions in this order to be put into the measure. I think my noble friend said that this was outside the original legislative competence order. We are being asked to repair an omission that occurred when the original LCO was brought forward to cover the situation.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000018"></a>I find that interesting and intriguing. Although the 2006 Act clearly anticipated that possibility, and the order is being proposed under that Act, would it not have been possible, and perhaps more consistent with the whole process, for a new LCO to have been brought forward empowering the Assembly to amend its legislation in the proper manner and therefore adopt what is included in this order? Am I right in believing that that option was available to the Assembly Government? It would have been more consistent with the way in which the original competence was achieved.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000019"></a>One consequence of this process is that the order has not been scrutinised by the Welsh Affairs Select Committee. As we will see when we come to the next order, the role of that Select Committee, and indeed of the Assembly committee, has been very important. Legislative competence orders have been drafted, and in many cases redrafted, as a result of very good scrutiny by both the Welsh Affairs Select Committee and the committee in the Assembly, and, as I know from having recently been a member of the Constitution Committee, by this House's Constitution Committee. There have been a number of examples where, as a result of our scrutiny, changes and amendments have been made, and in the next order we will be looking at where that clearly happened.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000020"></a>However, as I understand it, this order has not been the subject of any form of scrutiny by the Select Committee. I went to find out what it had said about the order because I have very much admired the work that it has done on legislative competence orders. I was informed that it had not done anything because this is a parliamentary statutory instrument and therefore does not fall within the committee's scrutiny remit in the context of LCOs.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000021"></a>If, in order to achieve the purpose of this order, the Assembly Government had come forward with an LCO to acquire such a power, they could have proceeded by amending their own measure in that way. I hope that I have not got hold of the wrong end of the stick.</p>

<p><a name="10012686000022"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="10012686000101"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> No.</p>

If it had been in the form of an LCO, proper scrutiny by the Welsh Affairs Select Committee would have taken place, but that has not happened. Therefore, I assume that the Statutory Instruments Committee has scrutinised it, although I have not had the chance to check the trail of events leading to the order. I am very grateful that my noble friend has assured me on that point. It was originally a draft order, which, I am glad to say, required affirmative approval. I hope that at least the Statutory Instruments Committee has scrutinised it but I rather regret that an order of this kind has not been the subject of Select Committee scrutiny. I certainly value such scrutiny and it has been invaluable to the deliberations of this House and the other place.</p>

I assure my noble friend Lord Rowlands that the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has scrutinised the order, so he can rest assured that the House has done its job in those terms.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, indicated that he thought that the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, had been pertinent in his questions. I did not. I thought he was extremely pertinent in one question but extremely impertinent in another. He said that we would be surprised to see him in his place but I am absolutely delighted to see him in that position. As we all know, he has graced that position for many years and has served in a ministerial role in the past.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000026"></a>However, the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, believes that today is the occasion when we can scrutinise and challenge the principles of the measure passed by the Assembly-not this order, but the principles of the measure. The legislative Assembly thinks that the narrow concept of best value ought to be replaced, as the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, indicated, by a concept more appropriate to a strategic approach to local government in Wales. If the Assembly reaches that judgment in the age of devolution, I am not going to have the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, come to this Committee and say, "But I disagree with the principles on which the legislative Assembly is working". That is its rightful power.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000027"></a>I described the order as being largely technical and I will come to the points that have been appropriately raised. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, raised some entirely appropriate points but his main point was not appropriate. It strays too far and I am not prepared to accept it.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000028"></a>My noble friend Lord Rowlands never strayed from accuracy in his analysis of the issue, save in one respect. This is not a mistake; there is no oversight; this is not covering up a slip. It covers up, over a minor and technical area, for the fact that the settlement does not include this minor, technical aspect but covers the broad issues. That is why I am in dispute with the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, on whether the broad issues should have been the subject of any controversy within the Committee.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000029"></a>It could have been dealt with in another way. We could have had a new legislative competence order to deal with this minor matter which involves no new principle. Everything to do with the order follows principles which obtain across the rest of the United Kingdom and have already been in practice over a long period. Nothing new is suggested here but it was outside the competence of the Assembly to establish this.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000030"></a>Consequently, the Assembly has this principle in its new make-up. I am not prepared to countenance the noble Lord's point except in general terms. I am always grateful for his views in general terms, but not if he is going to knock over the measure on an issue of principle of that kind. The Assembly does not have the competence for this technical aspect. It was not thought that a major legislative competence was necessary for this, but rather that it could be dealt with through a relatively minor order that was restrictive, specific and dealt with well established practice. I hope my noble friend Lord Rowlands will accept that answer.</p>

Is my noble friend saying that it would not have been possible to have included these rights and this content in the original legislative competence order? In other words, if the order had been drafted to include the provisions that are now in this order, could they have been included in the original LCO?</p>

I would not accept that what is being covered up here is an error or a mistake. It is, rather, that in dealing with the measure and the competence, the measure was concerned with the principles obtaining with regard to local government and this is an aspect of audit. My noble friend will appreciate that this is a distinct and small dimension which is separate from the process of government in the obvious sense. Audit is about scrutiny and holding to account. Within that framework, what is and was being done and obtained is exactly the same as in audits of all devolved Assemblies and of the United Kingdom Government as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="10012686000033"></a>If my noble friend will forgive me, I shall shy away on this occasion. I am more than prepared to own up to the very infrequent mistakes that Her Majesty's Government-this Administration-make; one or two over the past decade come to mind. This one is less an issue of mistake: it is a recognition that something needed to be done because the legislature said that it did not have the competence to do it without an order.</p>

It has had the advantage of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Constitution Committee of this House, by the Welsh Affairs Committee in the other place and by a committee of the National Assembly for Wales. Therefore, whatever anxieties were harboured about the previous order, I can certainly give this one a clean bill of health in terms of effective scrutiny. It deserved such scrutiny because it is an order of obvious importance, and the draft order has been improved as a result of that scrutiny. I shall return to the changes in a few moments when I have established a number of other matters.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC326"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC326</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100126-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000035"></a>In the debate in the other place, Members noted that although the order has been simplified to an extent as a result of scrutiny, it remains complex. Indeed, the Government are obliged to accept that the order is complex. This is not surprising given the wide-ranging nature of its subject. After all, it encompasses many aspects of environmental policy and touches on a large number of policy areas, including energy, transport and defence. I notice that, among the environmental policy, it touches upon aspects of the treatment of waste. The last time I appeared in this Committee Room to deal with a waste order-admittedly for England-I had an extremely difficult time. Such was the complexity of the order and the questions addressed to me, I can vouch that this area of environmental policy produces issues that are complex to deal with.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100126-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000036"></a>Environmental challenges such as air pollution, litter and waste management affect us all. The Welsh Ministers currently have a wide range of executive powers related to the environment but these powers are somewhat piecemeal, with gaps preventing the Assembly Government delivering specific policies and restricting reforms to particular areas of environmental regulation. For example, in the area of waste management, Welsh Ministers do not have the power to ensure that high priority waste materials are prioritised for collection, or to prevent key recyclable materials being sent to landfill. Every Member of the Committee will know about the drive across the whole of government to reduce the use of landfill and to ensure that that which can be recycled is recycled.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000037"></a>The order would give the National Assembly for Wales a power to make its own laws-assembly measures-to protect and improve the environment, and to legislate to help the Assembly Government implement its environmental strategies and create a more sustainable Wales. The democratic process would also be enhanced by enabling the Assembly to decide on legislation over the environment, an area where Welsh Ministers currently have powers and the Assembly none. The order will provide competence to legislate to protect and improve the environment in three main areas-waste, pollution and nuisances-which affect the quality of the local environment.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000038"></a>Matter 6.1 relates to:</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000039"></a>The order includes a number of fixed, or specific, exceptions to each of these matters, and general, or floating, exceptions which apply to all matters in Schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act 2006. These reflect the need to specify the often quite complex boundary between devolved and non-devolved areas  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC327"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC327</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of policy relating to the environment. Every Member of the Committee will be only too well aware of the difficulties attendant upon that.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000040"></a>The committees which scrutinised the proposed order made a number of recommendations which were largely concerned with making the order easier to understand, providing clarity about what is within and outside the Assembly's competence and avoiding unnecessary duplication. We made a number of changes to the order following that level of scrutiny, which was extremely helpful to us, and they are reflected in the final draft before the Committee today. The changes are the result of careful consideration of all the recommendations by both the Government and the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000041"></a>The first change is to create two matters dealing with waste, rather than having the single waste matter contained in the proposed LCO. Matter 6.1 now deals primarily with waste on land and Matter 6.2 deals with waste on land which is disposed of in the sea. The change has been made to help to clarify the scope of the Assembly's competence over waste. It has also enabled the definition of "Wales" to be rationalised so that it is the same as that which has applied in other LCOs. Scrutiny of the proposals both in the other place and in Cardiff Bay highlighted this as an area of concern. We think that we have now addressed it.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000042"></a>Secondly, a number of exceptions and definitions have been removed from the legislative competence order, and others have been clarified to sharpen up their meaning. This reflects the concern of the scrutiny committees that the order should not be so technical and complex as to become unintelligible and inaccessible to the lay reader. I am all too conscious of the fact that orders present a challenge to all noble Lords when they address them in debate; we must have even more sympathy for the lay reader who has an interest in these matters. If ever I saw a number of representations from members of the general public, they related to the difficulty of understanding regulations around waste management, and of course some of it reflected a clear interest on the part of those who earned their living from the field. If we are to engage the general public in constructive action on the environment, we must make absolutely certain that they understand just what we are driving at and what they are meant to do. No area is more important in these terms than waste management.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000043"></a>I assure the Committee that the legislative competence order includes only those exceptions and definitions that we consider to be absolutely necessary; that is, necessary to ensure that the legislative competence being conferred is accurately described and that the boundaries between devolved and non-devolved areas of competence are quite clear.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000044"></a>I am pleased to note that the Welsh Assembly Government have recently published a short guide to the order, which is available on its website. A key recommendation arising from the scrutiny of this LCO was that easily readable guidance be prepared for the lay reader to understand it better.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000045"></a>Concerns were also expressed during scrutiny about the general, or floating, exceptions that the LCO inserts into Schedule 5. The Government and the Welsh Assembly  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC328"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC328</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government believe that it is necessary to include the exceptions in the order. They would apply to all matters in Schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act 2006 but have a particularly strong relationship to environment policy, especially to pollution. Assembly measures which may be passed using the powers conferred by this LCO may have a direct bearing on electricity generation, nuclear power, road transport, shipping, aviation and water policy. Including these general exceptions clearly delineates the respective roles of the Government and the Welsh Assembly Government in areas of policy that impact on the environment. This will enable us to work together in a co-operative and co-ordinated way, as we take the work forward.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000046"></a>The majority of exceptions fall within three key areas of national policy interest-energy, transport and defence. The exceptions in a fourth policy area, the marine environment, reflect the fact that the legislative regime for managing the waters around the United Kingdom-including important new roles for Welsh Ministers, which we debated during the passage of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009-has been set out recently in that Act.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000047"></a>The Committee will appreciate that, although the order remains relatively complex, the changes that we have made simplify it and make it easier to understand. Importantly, none of the changes significantly affects the scope of the proposed competence being conferred on the National Assembly. Further detail on the rationale for the effect of each exception is provided by the Explanatory Memorandum. Pre-legislative scrutiny has helped us to refine and improve the draft order now before us. It is wholly appropriate that the National Assembly would be able to legislate on waste management and environmental protection improvement. Accordingly, I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="10012686000048"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="10012686000108"></a>Lord Roberts of Conwy:</b> My Lords, the Minister is absolutely right to say that this complex-looking order was thoroughly discussed and considered in a committee of the other place as recently as last Tuesday. It also featured as a case study in the Welsh Affairs Committee report of 15 January entitled, <I>Review of the LCO Process</I>. The order is closely related to the committee's key finding that LCOs must be more user-friendly and that a more straightforward approach to drafting is required. Those who have studied this document will readily agree. The Minister implied that he also agreed.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000049"></a>Incidentally, the chairman of the Welsh Affairs Committee, Dr Hywel Francis MP, and its Members are to be highly commended-if that is not out of place-for their scrutiny and development work to improve the quality of LCOs over recent years. Similarly, our own Constitution Committee, which until recently included the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, has done sterling work in the same field and we are all indebted to it.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000050"></a>On the content of the order, all I have to say is that the National Assembly and its Government must be aware of the havoc that the recession is causing to our industrial landscape in Wales. We can no longer take great companies and employers such as Bosch at Miskin and Rio Tinto at Holyhead as semi-permanent features of that landscape. Nor can they be replaced in a

Today's announcement of 0.1 per cent growth in GDP in the last quarter of last year does not give us much clearance from the recession, although technically we are out of it. However, even now and later this year unemployment may well rise and companies continue to fail.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000051"></a>Many of the Assembly's environmental policies and ambitions were formed in the decade of comparative prosperity and reflect those benign conditions which, alas, no longer prevail. For example, the Explanatory Memorandum talks about the environment strategy setting,</p>
<ul><a name="10012686000089"></a>"the direction for the next 20 years",</ul>
<p><a name="10012686000077"></a>and establishing a,</p>
<ul><a name="10012686000090"></a>"framework to achieve an environment which is clean, bio-diverse healthy, and valued by the people of Wales".</ul>
<p><a name="10012686000078"></a>I suggest that the havoc caused by the recession may well affect any such strategy with a 20-year perspective. In other words, much of the content of the environmental policies described in the policy background section of the Explanatory Memorandum attached to the order will almost certainly have to be adapted-and so will the mindsets behind these policies as the need to provide jobs, preferably in wealth-producing units, becomes ever more pressing. Those are my comments on this order. I shall not go into the detail of it; I accept the ample explanation that the Minister has given.</p>

<p><a name="10012686000052"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10012686000109"></a>Lord Livsey of Talgarth:</b> My Lords, this is an extremely complex LCO. Even after the massive scrutiny that has taken place on it, when contrasted with the previous LCO that we considered on modifications, this is a much more complex order. Witness the massive length of the Explanatory Memorandum document. It clearly affects the Welsh environment and waste disposal.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000053"></a>When looking at this LCO in the other place, my colleague the Member for Ceredigion said that,</p>
<ul><a name="10012686000091"></a>"it will enable the Welsh Assembly Government to pursue with coherence, and with an holistic approach, the areas of prevention, reduction, collection management, the disposal of waste and the protection and improvement of the environment in relation to pollution and nuisance".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/1/10; cols. 9-10.]</ul>
<p><a name="10012686000079"></a>If we look at what is in front of us-for example, in describing its legislative context-I note that it covers no fewer than 10 Acts of Parliament and eight European Union orders. In the UK context, I note that it stretches from the Clean Air Act to the Anti-social Behaviour Act. Much of the legislation covers waste management, and the overall context is that of the One Wales programme of government. It also incorporates sustainable development-a commendable objective-and specifically addresses climate change, including carbon reduction objectives.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000054"></a>The LCO adds to exceptions already contained in the Government of Wales Act 2006 and takes amendments on carve-outs from existing exceptions that relate to listed matters. Although I can see why it has become necessary to do this, largely because of new matters introduced by the Assembly that impact on existing legislation, it still seems overcomplicated to me. Indeed, I also commend the work of the Welsh Affairs Select  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC330"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC330</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Committee in doing much of the spadework to make this LCO more understandable. In fact, that demonstrates the value of close scrutiny and amendment.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000055"></a>Issues such as pollution and environmental harm are clearly important. The need to define the meaning of the implications for the environment in this LCO's contents is very detailed indeed. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, addressed the question of the downturn in the economy and its impact on Wales. All I can say is that there are not enough companies based in Wales with research and development capacity. We have an enormous mountain to climb in terms of entrepreneurial activity that is based in Wales. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, referred to the departure of Bosch and other important matters. I remember an occasion when LG was welcomed to Newport, but it never took off.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000056"></a>We have to work very hard to ensure that we have our own industry, our own basis and our own employment opportunities in Wales. I can see, however, that under this LCO lawyers and inspectors will be scanning this legislation and its detail with a great deal of interest. Let us hope that, in the environmental and public interests of Wales, they reach the right conclusions. This legislation is required and I hope it will be interpreted rather more simply than it appears to be in these documents.</p>
<h5><a name="10012686000095"></a>6.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="10012686000057"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10012686000110"></a>Lord Rowlands:</b> My Lords, anybody who reads the Explanatory Memorandum will realise-because it spells it out very well-that the transfer of environmental powers is long-standing, considerable and pre-dates the establishment of the Welsh Assembly by many years. Old Welsh Office Ministers started gaining such powers under the Control of Pollution Act 1974. Even before that, I had the privilege, in my ancient ministerial days of 1969 to 1970, and from 1974 to 1975, of leading the Derelict Land Unit. It was established in the wake of the terrible disaster at Aberfan to deal with both the justifiable fear of the dangers of tip waste and the scarring of the landscape. It was a remarkable success story of innovation and imagination, and pioneered much work in the technology of tip clearance and dealing with old coal waste.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000058"></a>We are not in new territory at all. First, Welsh Office Ministers before the establishment of the Assembly exercised considerable environmental powers, devolved to them by extensive legislation listed, as the noble Lord has explained, in the Explanatory Memorandum. Secondly, as the memorandum also explains, Welsh Office Ministers, and now the Welsh Assembly, have important roles in designating the designation orders under European Union law. Thirdly, Assembly Ministers have inherited an extensive range of powers in subordinate legislation to be able to use such legislation as a result of the earlier legislation. I utterly support and endorse the content of this LCO. All that the order will do is match the executive powers that have been transferred, and the transfer of functions of one kind or another over many years, giving a legislative competence that mirrors those executive orders and powers. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support the thrust and intention of the order.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC331"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC331</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000059"></a>Quite rightly, the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs and the Constitution Committee raised several concerns about the original draft order. If we can pass messages to those who will enjoy the power of legislation at the Assembly, I hope that when the Assembly Government come to draft a measure flowing from this order, they take particular note of paragraph 33 of the Select Committee's report about cross-border issues. The report says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10012686000086"></a>"There is some potential for Measures brought forward on the basis of this LCO to give rise to cross-border issues in relation to business and with regard to possible perverse effects of differences in regulations for environmental problems, such as fly-tipping".</p>

<p><a name="10012686000080"></a>Although it should not involve any amendment to the LCO, I hope that that particular concern will be expressed when the measure that flows from the order comes to be drafted. We do not want businesses worrying that the law across the border will be so different that they find it difficult to operate in any context, let alone that which the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, noticed.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000060"></a>While I am a passionate supporter of transferring the powers, I was surprised that, for the second time at least, the original LCO dealing with the environment contained a whole host-a clutch-of exceptions in fields totally unrelated to the environment. The Constitution Committee had previously expressed considerable concern in relation to the carers order about dumping into orders which have well defined purposes a list of exceptions totally unrelated to them. In the original draft environment order, there were fields for economic development, highways and water and flood defences, all of which it has now been accepted are not relevant to the point and purpose of the order and have thankfully been removed.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000061"></a>As my noble friend rightly said, it is not our duty to get involved in drafting measures, but let us send a gentle but stringent message to drafters of future LCOs that we will be vigilant and liverish if we see draft orders, such as the carers order and with the original draft of the environment order, including things that are totally or virtually unrelated to their specific subject and content. We do not want another set of unrelated exceptions pushed into a future order that have no bearing on the main purpose. I hope that that important message will go to the Assembly.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000062"></a>Otherwise, as the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, observed, and as the interesting review of the LCO process in the Select Committee's report reveals, an amazing convergence and consensus have developed around the way in which we scrutinise orders. I support the positive comment in that report about all the committees involved in the scrutiny-I suppose that I am being boastful, because I had a minor part in the process-that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10012686000087"></a>"It is a matter of record that on every occasion so far the observations of these committees have been constructive, complementary and consensual, and the Welsh Assembly Government has responded positively. There is no doubt that almost all the LCOs so far passed into law have been improved as a result of the scrutiny process".</p>

<p><a name="10012686000081"></a>That has been verified. I think back to the Welsh language competence order, which became a very different animal as a result of proper scrutiny. Here is another example of an order that has benefited considerably  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC332"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC332</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from the process of scrutiny that has been put in place. Therefore, I fully support the point and purpose of the order, but I also support the invaluable scrutiny that has amended the original order to make it much more palatable today.</p>

<p><a name="10012686000063"></a><b><a name="100126-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10012686000111"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords who have indicated their broad support for the order while identifying some criticisms which need to be taken on board. In some cases, I would think that they have been taken on board. I very much appreciate the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, about the contribution of others to the committee's deliberations to improve the order.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000064"></a>We owe the Welsh Affairs Committee a government response to its report, which we will provide in due course. I second the proposition put forward by the noble Lord that we should note the valuable work that it does, which is of great assistance as far as matters in Wales are concerned.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000065"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, was right to indicate that these are difficult economic times and that Wales, in the same way as the rest of the United Kingdom, must look towards to its enterprise laurels to ensure that it creates new jobs, new enterprises and new productive capacity, and recovers from what is after all the worst recession for more than a generation.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000066"></a>However, the environment and environmental challenges also produce opportunities. An awful lot of enterprises are going to be concerned with how we meet the challenges of climate change, and not least the whole question of how we generate energy. The important thing is that the United Kingdom, and Wales in particular in this case, should be at the forefront in grasping those opportunities, although I am only too conscious of the very serious effects of the withdrawal of a major employer such as Bosch from Wales, with a serious loss of jobs. The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, is right that it was a matter of regret that LG did not eventually invest in Newport. He has always been an extremely fair analyst of these situations. I was involved in politics in Newport at that time and he will know just how strenuously everyone concerned bent every sinew to try to land what would have been a very impressive investment in Newport and more widely in Wales. For a long time, we lived in serious expectation that we would be successful. I hasten to add that what caused LG to make a different decision had nothing to do with environmental considerations, or anything like that. However, it reflected the obvious fact that there is always some tension between investment and development and aspects of the environment.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000067"></a>I accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts: we have to be aware that there is no legislation without cost, and environmental legislation also involves some costs. Of course, we will also reap the ferocious costs of failure to tackle environmental issues successfully, which is why we should applaud the fact that Assembly Members are eager to take on board the powers that will give them the opportunity to do their best for Wales in these very challenging circumstances.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000068"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, went on to identify that it is necessary to have a holistic approach towards environmental issues, and of course that means that  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC333"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC333</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>matters become complex. The interrelationship between different factors can add to the complexity, and therefore the Government are bound to accept the anxieties expressed by every noble Lord who has spoken in the Committee about the complexity of this order and the challenges that it presents. We should be about ensuring that orders are eminently comprehensible by the ordinary man and woman in the street, as well as by those of us who spend a great deal of our time seeking to master the detail.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000069"></a>I was grateful to my noble friend Lord Rowlands for reminding us that 30 or 40 years ago, before the age of devolution, Ministers in Wales wrestled with these issues and had to meet these challenges. I think he would be the first to recognise that they are probably now more challenging. The whole environmental relationship to the age of climate change is more demanding. There is an impact on the economy and a necessity for change, and none of us pretends that change is easy. Change imposes burdens on people and presents difficulties. I very much bear in mind his vast experience of that period of time and thank him for reminding us that Welsh Ministers had to address these issues on behalf of the country, but these are particularly challenging times and it is good to see the Assembly seeking these powers to enable it to meet those challenges.</p>
<h5><a name="10012686000096"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000070"></a>My noble friend Lord Rowlands raised an important cross-border issue. Of course, certain environmental issues know no borders-least of all the one between England and Wales-but he is absolutely right about the pernicious and gruesome social offence of fly-tipping. You cannot go any distance from a serious farmer's farmhouse without him saying that one of the problems that he has got to face is people using his land for  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC334"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column GC334</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>illegal fly-tipping and that the cost of clearing it up after it has been dumped is considerable. I appreciate the point my noble friend raised and I have no doubt that the Assembly will have to address that dimension.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000071"></a>My noble friend Lord Rowlands has vast experience on the matter of exceptions because he served on committees which scrutinised a range of these issues. The exceptions were included because they are relevant to the matters which the Assembly is taking on board. The original proposed LCO applied transport exceptions to the environment matter. The exception does not have to be in the same field. Of course it is more appropriate if it is related to the same field because it is easier to justify, but it does not have to be directly in the same field, and issues such as transport, energy and water interrelate very closely with the environment. It is not surprising, therefore, that it should have proved necessary to include exceptions in those areas. However, I take on board the point that he made. I have no doubt that the work of the committee on which he used to serve, together with the scrutiny that we are involved in when dealing with legislation at this stage and the constant pressure that we should exert to make our legislation intelligible, will impact on those doing the work in the Assembly and the draft legislation with which they are concerned.</p>

<a name="100126-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="10012686000072"></a>We will not engage our communities unless our legislation is perceptive, comprehensible and fits the purpose for which it is intended. We all realise that in the real battle for the environment, education and understanding are almost the most important dimensions of all. We will not get conscious and effective public action unless the public are fully engaged, and getting the legislation right and comprehensible is very important in those terms. I thank noble Lords for their contributions.</p>

<p><i><a name="10012686000115"></a>Motion agreed.</i></p>

<p><i><a name="10012686000116"></a>Committee adjourned at 6.50 pm.</i></p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="10012654000003"></a><b><a name="100126-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="10012654000048"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> My right honourable friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office (Tessa Jowell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="10012654000004"></a>I hereby give notice of the Cabinet Office's intention to seek an advance from the Contingencies Fund to provide for a deficient net cash requirement.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="10012654000005"></a>The Cabinet Office requires an advance in the  amount of £99.248 million to meet an urgent cash requirement pending parliamentary approval of the Spring Supplementary Estimate 2009-10.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="10012654000006"></a>Of this total, £33 million is required to fund the cash settlement of its prior year creditors and £66.248 million is required to fund resources sought by the Office of the Third Sector in the Spring Supplementary Estimate.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="10012654000007"></a>In seeking this advance, it is not the intention of the Cabinet Office to consume resources additional to those sought in the Spring Supplementary Estimate 2009-10.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="10012654000008"></a>There are no reasonable grounds to doubt that Parliament is willing to approve the additional net resource and net cash requirements, since the Cabinet Office has received prior agreement from the Treasury.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="10012654000009"></a>The Cabinet Office has drawn down from the Treasury's Consolidated Fund the full amount of net cash requirement voted in the Winter Supplementary Estimate 2009-10 and has disbursed almost all of this funding.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="10012654000010"></a>This accelerated pattern of disbursement is caused by the Office of the Third Sector making grant payments to its delivery partners in cases where the funding for these commitments has been approved by the Treasury but the net cash requirement detailed in the Spring Supplementary Estimate will not be voted by Parliament until late March.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="10012654000011"></a>If the Office of the Third Sector is unable to make payments to these funds, it will be in breach of contract and, in turn, its delivery partners will be in breach of contract with their third sector partners.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="10012654000012"></a>The Cabinet Office will repay the advance to the Contingencies Fund as soon as it has access to  draw down additional supply sought in the Spring Supplementary Estimate.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="10012654000013"></a>Parliamentary approval for additional resources of £66,248,000 will be sought in a Supplementary Estimate for the Cabinet Office. Pending that approval, urgent expenditure estimated at £99,248,000 will be met by repayable cash advances from the Contingencies Fund.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="10012654000015"></a>On Friday, 22 January, the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) changed the UK threat level from international terrorism from substantial to severe. This means that a terrorist attack is a highly likely.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="10012654000016"></a>The change in the threat level to severe does not mean that a terrorist attack is imminent. It reinforces the message that the terrorist threat to the United Kingdom is real, serious and can change. Our first duty is always to protect the public and we view the appropriate threat level is a keystone for doing so.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="10012654000017"></a>The decision to change the threat level is taken by JTAC independently of Ministers and is based on the very latest intelligence, considering factors such as capability, intent and timescale. Severe means that an attack is highly likely and may occur without warning.</p>

Interventions fell into three broad categories-market transparency; the role of producer organisations; and the country of origin principle.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="10012654000026"></a>For market transparency (surveillance of price trends and margins for producers, processors and retailers) member states were divided between those that felt price monitoring should be carried out systematically at EU level, and those which, sceptical of creating additional costs and burdens, favoured national competence (including UK).</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="10012654000027"></a>Positions were also divided on the role of producer organisations. France called for changes to single market rules and competition law; and the adoption of model contracts. Germany and the UK, at the other end of the spectrum, insisted on the need to operate within the rules. The UK observed that the Government should support markets, where appropriate, describing its recent own initiative in the grocery supply chain.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="10012654000034"></a>On 15 December 2009 I announced the establishment of the Hillsborough Independent Panel under the chairmanship of the Right Reverend James Jones, Bishop of Liverpool. The panel will work in partnership with Government and other public agencies to oversee  


<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS82"></a><b>26 Jan 2010 : Column WS82</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the maximum possible public disclosure of governmental and other agency documentation relating to the Hillsborough tragedy and its aftermath. It will produce a report on its work, outlining the extent to which the information disclosed adds to the public understanding of the disaster, and will make recommendations as to a permanent Hillsborough archive. The panel will also consult with the families to ensure that their views are taken into account.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="10012654000035"></a>I can today announce the appointment of seven further members of the panel and that the panel will hold its first meeting in Liverpool in early February. This will begin the process of consideration of documents for release, initially to the Hillsborough families, together with the other purposes of the panel. The further panel members are:</p>
 Christine Gifford, member of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Council on National Records and Archives;Katy Jones, television producer; Paul Leighton QPM CBE, former deputy chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland; Dr Bill Kirkup CBE, formerly associate medical director, Department of Health; Phil Scraton, Professor of Criminology at Queen's University, Belfast;Peter Sissons, broadcaster; and Sarah Tyacke CB, former chief executive of the National Archives and Keeper of Public Records. 
<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="10012654000036"></a>I am making these appointments in view of the range of skills needed and the hundreds of thousands of documents within the panel's scope. With the scale of the task in mind, there may be a need for further panel members. In particular, I expect to announce in due course the appointment to the panel of a suitably experienced lawyer.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="10012654000037"></a>The panel members whose appointments I am announcing today are experts in their respective fields and I am grateful to each of them for agreeing to take on this important task. In addition to this Statement I am also placing in the Libraries of the House a document setting out the expertise each member will bring to the panel's work and their respective letters of appointment. All panel appointments are for a period of two years.</p>

<a name="100126-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="10012654000038"></a>Under the Bishop of Liverpool's leadership the panel will be independent and rigorous in its work, but will also act with sensitivity and understanding. That over 30,000 people attended the service marking the 20th anniversary of Hillsborough in April shows how deep the wound in Liverpool remains. I believe that the independent panel has an historic opportunity to bring healing to those affected by the tragedy, and that its establishment can help to begin to bring an end to the grievances strongly felt by many.</p>

This reflects around 15GW fossil fuel new build over that period, offset by a similar level of plant retirements.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_116"></a><a name="10012667000133"></a>Current evidence suggests wind generation in the UK generally faces lower capital costs and higher operating costs than solar photovoltaic generation.</p>

<a name="100126w0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_117"></a><a name="10012667000134"></a>Projections of future electricity generation costs are subject to considerable uncertainty. They require underlying assumptions to be made regarding technological learning rates, deployment trajectories, available resource types, supply chain capacity and so on. Technological learning and economies of scale tend to exert downward pressure on costs through time, while supply chain constraints and declining availability of the best resource may tend to exert upward pressure on costs.</p>

While action at the national level, such as that set out in the UK Low Carbon Transition Plan, will be fundamental to delivery of these objectives, there is also a useful role for the EU in supporting member states' efforts. We therefore welcome indications that the European Commission intends to focus on action to accelerate the green refurbishment of buildings as a key element of the review it is currently undertaking of the existing European Energy Efficiency Action Plan. We look forward to considering detailed proposals from the Commission as to how it intends to take forward its objective in due course.</p>

The delegations discussed the latest legal and policy developments relating to the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). Both delegations set out their respective positions on sovereignty and the UK also set out how the UK needed to bear in mind its treaty obligations with the US and our ongoing need of BIOT for defence purposes. There was mutual discussion of fishing rights, the environment, continental shelf and future visits to the territory by Chagossians.</p>

<a name="100126w0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_170"></a><a name="10012667000202"></a>We welcome the prospect of further bilateral discussions with the Mauritians on BIOT. However, Government policy remains that they have no doubt about the UK's sovereignty over BIOT but that they will cede the territory to Mauritius when it is no longer needed for defence purposes. And, following the judgment in the House of Lords in October 2008 in the Judicial Review of the 2004 BIOT Orders in Council which upheld the validity of the BIOT (Constitution) Order, the Government's policy remains that no one has a right of abode in BIOT and permission is needed for anyone visiting the territory. The Government are not, therefore, seeking to facilitate the resettlement of the Chagossians on BIOT.</p>
