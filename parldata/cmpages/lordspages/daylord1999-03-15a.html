<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew0"></A><B> The Countess of Mar </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "90315-01_para0"></a>When they consider their plans to rationalise primary meat production will be complete and what will be the level of meat production in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="90315-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Lord Donoughue): </B>  My Lords, the Government accept that some rationalisation of the primary meat production sector is desirable, but consider that such rationalisation should be achieved through the action of market forces. The Agenda 2000 reform of the European Union beef regime may eventually lead to reduced beef and lamb production. In that context, the Government will consider whether an early retirement scheme could be of use.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew1"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, before I ask my supplementary questions, perhaps I may declare an interest. My husband and I have a small farm and we take our animals to be killed at a small family-owned abattoir. Does the Minister realise that the new charges to be implemented by the Meat Hygiene Service on 1st April will kill off many small farmers and specialist producers? The Government always hide behind EC regulations. However, can the Minister say whether they will take a leaf out of Denmark's book over the antibiotic Virginiamycin? The Danes went to the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition and were told no, there could not be a ban. So they then went to the Council of Europe and asked for a ban, which was subsequently granted. Will the Minister ask Mr. Nick Brown to go to the Council and point out that the UK will not tolerate the destruction of a very specialist and valuable part of our rural culture? Will he also ask his right honourable friend to request a complete review by the Meat Hygiene Service?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Countess for her Question. However, I must make clear that new charges have not yet been decided upon or announced. There will, of course, be consultation with the industry in that respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-01_para1"></a>On the question of the EU rules, we have written to the European Commission to ask for clarification concerning the inspection charges and the level of inspection required, especially for small slaughterhouses and cutting plants where I believe the main problem lies. We have not yet received a reply, but when we do we will communicate it rapidly to the noble Countess. I should point out that her pressure in this area together with other public pressure for the Commission to appreciate the concern about small producers, is not unwelcome to us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the Government are thinking very seriously about how to <P>


<a name="column_466"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 466</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>avoid any further reduction in the number of smaller local slaughterhouses, if only because of the need to deal effectively with casualty animals, to avoid long hauls for any description of animal and, indeed, to cater for small and specialist demands for meat?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, the Government certainly appreciate the importance of the small slaughterhouse, not only in the more remote rural areas but also as regards servicing the small producer who may find that the big slaughterhouse is not very interested in his two or three cattle. So we certainly appreciate the situation. However, I should point out that the over-supply in the slaughterhouse industry is on an enormous scale; indeed, it is estimated at about 50 per cent. Therefore, there is need for rationalisation. We must be concerned about whether the rationalisation takes place in what one might call a rational way or in a way that eliminates all the small slaughterhouses of the kind that I have mentioned. As far as concerns the increased inspection levels which the Commission requires of us and the charges, I should stress that we have made clear that, certainly in the first stages, the increases will be directed towards the big slaughterhouses and only to those smaller ones which have low hygiene scores.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Blackburn: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend the Minister confirm whether or not I heard him correctly? Today is 15th March and the new charges are due to come in on 1st April, but I believe my noble friend said that the Government are still consulting at this stage. Can my noble friend say whether this gives people the opportunity to plan their business commitments when they have, say, 15 or 16 days left in which to do so?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is quite right; there is a certain tightness in the timetable. A small delay may be necessary, especially in order to consult the industry. As I am sure my noble friend knows, there has already been consultation. The industry was not very happy with the level of charges that were being floated. Ministers are looking at two items in particular: first, whether the level of charges could be reduced; and, secondly, whether there are ways in which we can help the smaller abattoir. I am sure that the industry will consider the latter to be worthy causes of any small delay.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister care--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McNair: </B>   My Lords--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, it is the turn of this side. We have not yet asked a question from this side of the House. Sit down!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Baroness Jay of Paddington): </B>  My Lords, I am surprised that neither noble Lord is prepared to give way, but I think it is the feeling of the House that the noble Lord, Lord Chesham, should speak first.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister care to give me a comparison of costs as between this country and France? In France the vets are paid by the state. There is a sanitary slaughter charge of 30 francs per bullock, 12 francs per cow, 1.70 francs per lamb etc., and 11 francs per tonne sanitary cutting cost. How is it possible that the costs in this country should so exceed those in France?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, we are currently investigating the charges in this area in all of our partner countries. France, like some other countries, has a different system from ours, but it operates under the same European Union requirements to recover costs, to have a structure of standard charges and not to have cross-subsidy. We are assured that in the end, although the French have a different system from ours--the French levy the fiscal charge centrally and pay their inspectors centrally--the outcome is similar to ours. I see the noble Lord is a little sceptical about our French friends. We are certainly looking into that matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McNair: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that if the concerns of the noble Countess, Lady Mar, were borne out, this would particularly affect the producers of organic meat?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, if we could find ways to introduce the measure that we are considering it would benefit small slaughterhouses that have good hygiene standards, whether the meat is organic or otherwise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew15"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister justify what he has just said about the charges; in other words, that they will not be introduced on 1st April because consultation is still in progress? Will he please explain why a senior veterinary official visited Mr. John Coles in Devon just this morning and told him that they must work out how Mr. Coles was to pay the charges from 1st April? He stressed that there would be no special allowances for people with high hygiene scores.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, we shall announce the charges as soon as possible. If the noble Countess will provide details of the case she mentioned, we shall certainly consider it.

<P>

<A NAME = "90315-01_para2"></a>Whether they have given assurances to non-nuclear states that under no circumstances will they be attacked by a British nuclear weapon and that these assurances will not be unilaterally withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="90315-01_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My Lords, we have long given assurances to non-nuclear weapon states that we shall not use nuclear weapons against them unless they first attack us, our allies or a state to which we have given a security commitment, in alliance or association with a weapon state. These assurances have been given to the 182 non-nuclear weapon states parties to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and to many non-nuclear weapon states through protocols to regional nuclear weapon free zone treaties. In giving such assurances we make clear that we do not regard them as applicable if any beneficiary is in material breach of its own non-proliferation obligation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that Answer which I think the House will find informative. Can my noble friend tell us whether other nuclear states are following Her Majesty's Government's steps in this matter? What other action is being taken to discourage non-nuclear states following in the footsteps of India and Pakistan?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the 1995 non-proliferation treaty review conference agreed that states should consider further steps to assure non-nuclear weapon states as regards the use of nuclear weapons. These steps could take the form of an internationally legally binding agreement. However, there is no common view as to what form any such international arrangements might take. Discussion on the issue should continue in the ad hoc committee on negative security assurance when it is re-established at the conference on disarmament in Geneva. Of course, Her Majesty's Government will take a full part in those discussions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Chalfont: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it is important that any potential aggressor, nuclear or non-nuclear, should be left in no doubt that we would defend ourselves with any weapons at our command? Is it not true that we have consistently refused to accede to non-first use agreements for that very reason? Will the Minister also assure the House that none of the assurances given to the 182 states concerned will apply if those states are engaged in an act of aggression against this country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I hope that when the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, reads the initial Answer I gave to my noble friend he will see that those assurances were clearly stated. Our security assurances also contain the standard supreme national interest provisions on withdrawal. That is the important point. Of course the supreme national interest must be maintained in all the arrangements we have. As regards first use, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation continues to reserve the right of limited first use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances of <P>


<a name="column_469"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 469</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>self-defence to persuade an aggressor to desist if no other means are available. I hope that that assures the noble Lord on both the points he raised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend saying that, having persuaded the non-nuclear powers to renounce a nuclear future in the non-proliferation treaty, there may still be circumstances in which we would nevertheless attack them with nuclear weapons? Is that not to say not only that we claim the right to use nuclear weapons but that we want to ensure that we do it unilaterally?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that that is the case at all. I hope that my answer made clear that, in all cases where we have given assurances, we have made clear that those assurances are not applicable if any beneficiary is in breach of its obligations.

<A NAME="90315-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Waddington </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "90315-02_para0"></a>When they intend to announce their response to the public consultation on the report by the Advisory Group on Quarantine.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="90315-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, the Government are considering the way forward following the consultation on the review of quarantine rules undertaken by the Advisory Group on Quarantine. In that consultation, more than 96 per cent. of respondents were in favour of reform broadly on the lines of the Kennedy recommendations. We will make an announcement as soon as we can.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply and for his help in this matter. I can assure him that I am not asking this question in any mood of carping criticism. Is the Minister aware of arguments in his department that primary legislation is necessary in order to set up the new system rather than regulations under the Animal Health Act? Is it not necessary to make good speed in this matter in order to avoid any unnecessary hardship to animal owners and animals, and also in order to avoid any risk of an increase in smuggling now that people know that vaccinated animals pose no risk of carrying rabies?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with the noble Lord that we must make the fullest speed possible. The Kennedy Committee recommended that any new system should contain no more risk than the existing system. We have to put into place monitoring and control measures which ensure that. That is what has delayed matters so far.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, I do not think the Minister answered the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Waddington. Can he perhaps rephrase what he said to include an answer to the noble Lord's question on regulations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, on the noble Lord's point about regulations or primary legislation, that depends on what type of machinery we put in place. Some of the machinery may require primary legislation; some, it is to be hoped, will require only secondary legislation. There are also problems of European Union rules. All that is being examined. If we can do something and avoid the need for primary legislation, we will certainly do that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Kimball: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister bear in mind that those people who invested their money in quarantine kennels did so because of government regulations and stood in for a service that the Government would have had to provide? Will the Minister bear in mind in any adjustment to the current regulations that kennel owners are entitled to proper compensation for having done a job that the Government should have done?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, kennel owners have been included in the fullest way possible in the consultation. As far as concerns compensation, the Government's present view is that they have been given due warning. In any case, after the reforms, which will only apply to the European Union and rabies-free islands in the European Economic Area, there will still be a great deal of business for them with animals from elsewhere in the world.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior: </B>   My Lords, it is probably a rumour at present, but can the Minister say whether or not it is true that there may be a legal challenge from the European Union to the United Kingdom for charging for assessing certification at the port of entry on the basis that that would contravene the freedom of movement of goods and animals into this country? If that were to be so, I understand that it might cost the Government some &#163;9 million to &#163;10 million not to charge people for bringing animals into this country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, one of the problems we have to consider is that when we put a procedure in place it must be one that will not be subject to legal challenge or would survive it. The European Union rules on freedom of movement are a prime area. We are looking at ways to achieve the reforms in the direction that Kennedy recommended and which we want, and which will not be subject to challenge. There are indeed costs in the new procedures, and we have to look at how those costs will be met. Many people would feel that <P>


<a name="column_471"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 471</B></P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Sharples: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Lord say how many ports of entry have the necessary facilities to deal with any change in quarantine laws?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I cannot say that because we have not yet reached the point at which we decide what the monitoring facilities are and which ports of entry should have them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister help me on this point? If charging brings the risk of a challenge in the European Union because of interference with free movement, then, a fortiori, the present system of quarantine interferes with free movement. So that argument is as broad as it is long.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, yes. The European factor is one aspect of the charging problem but it is not the only one. As to the decision of who is charged and how, that matter is under active consideration at the moment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Brougham and Vaux: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister give the House an idea of when things might change? What timescale are we talking about?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I cannot give a precise answer to that question. The noble Lord will recall that the Kennedy Report suggested that it might take as long as three years. At present Ministers are very committed that it should take less time than that. But we have to decide the procedures and then possibly develop some pilot schemes. We would like to get it in as soon as possible. The noble Lord should bear in mind that currently about 8,000 animals pass through the kennels. The Kennedy Report estimated that there might be as many as a quarter of a million animals coming through in the first year of the new scheme. Therefore, this will need very careful and detailed preparation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Shore of Stepney: </B>   My Lords, having enjoyed the enormous blessings and benefits of being a rabies-free area for so long, I hope my noble friend can assure me that the onus of proof will be very clearly upon the advocates of change in moving away from our present and effective rabies legislation. I hope my noble friend is not also telling us that the freedom of movement provisions of the European Union extend to animals as well as persons.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-02_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, freedom of movement applies to movements in trade and persons. As to risk, it was a basic principle of the Kennedy Committee that the new proposals should not involve increased risk. The committee carried out a very technical analysis of risk and concluded that the system it proposed would not include risk. I should point out to my noble friend that the European Union is effectively rabies-free as far as <P>

<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "90315-03_para0"></a>What advice they have given to the regulator for gas and electricity on the promotion of energy efficiency.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="90315-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My Lords, the Minister for Energy and Industry has met the regulator, Callum McCarthy, to discuss various matters, including his intentions for promotion of energy efficiency. The powers to set standards for energy efficiency currently rest with the regulator himself. I am confident that, in considering what to do, he will take account of a range of views, including those of the Government. The Government's programme for reform of utility regulation will include a provision for statutory guidance to the regulator on environmental and social objectives to be taken into account in his decisions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that at a recent meeting in another place the regulator indicated that energy efficiency was not on his list of priorities? Asked about that, he said that he had not yet received clear guidance from government. Is that not surprising in view of the fact that the Government issued their Green Paper on utility regulation last March? Even though the legislation has been delayed, it should have been possible for the Government to be clear about what the regulator should do. For example, can the standards of performance scheme that is operating so effectively in the electricity industry be extended to gas?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I am aware that at a meeting of the Parliamentary Group for Energy Studies on 22nd February, the regulator listed his five priorities. When the Minister for Energy and Industry met the regulator, he encouraged him to make positive use of his powers in respect of setting energy efficiency standards of performance. As I said, the Government do not have powers to direct the regulator, who is independent. However, he said before the Public Accounts Committee that he is considering an extension of the electricity standards of performance scheme beyond 2000 and, for consistency, the possibility of a similar provision for gas.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-03_para1"></a>Regarding the longer term, the Government's response to consultation on utility reform, A fair deal for consumers, sets out the principle that where the Government wish to implement energy efficiency measures which have significant financial implications <P>

<A NAME="90315-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, can the regulator do anything to offset the damaging heavy increases in electricity costs that will burden our manufacturing industries, particularly the chemical industry, and may well result in the loss of many jobs? In Germany, electricity costs in those same industries are heavily subsidised. The recent Budget will be very damaging.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that the regulator has those powers. With the new legislation, there will be more scope for the Government to set social as well as economic objectives. I do not believe that under present legislation the regulator has that right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Islwyn: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that manufacturing industry needs a more level playing field in order to meet the threat from overseas competition?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the whole purpose of the present legislation is to create a fair system of charging. Only the setting of further objectives for the regulator would enable him to take a view as to how manufacturing industry was affected.

<P>
<A NAME="90315-03_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   My Lords, do the Government have views as to the future development of combined heat and power and also of tidal and wave energy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the Government have a target of 5,000 megawatts of combined heat and power capacity by the year 2000. About 4,000 megawatts is now installed. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions develops policy on combined heat and power and promotes its wider growth. It will be starting a high level marketing campaign to promote combined heat and power to key industries. We are also developing a policy on renewables so as to meet the 10 per cent. target we have set ourselves.

<A NAME="90315-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, in their Green Paper the Government referred to social objectives, environmental objectives, and energy efficiency objectives. Will the Minister tell the House on which of those objectives the Government place most weight? Gas-fired power stations beat coal-fired stations every time on two of those criteria; first, in terms of cost, and, secondly, in terms of reduced CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions. In view of that, why have the Government imposed a moratorium on gas-fired stations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, one of the fundamentals of energy policy is that it must meet a number of different objectives. There is no scheme that does not involve some kind of trade-off involving efficiency, social objectives and environmental <P>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 474</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>objectives. Therefore, in the new legislation there will have to be a way of balancing outlays in any direction that the Government give to the regulators. So far as concerns gas-fired power stations, it is not true that on all those objectives they beat the marginal cost of running existing coal-fired stations. On a marginal cost basis, coal-fired stations are still in many cases cheaper to run.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that there is great concern about the lack of progress in energy efficiency improvements in the private rented sector? It is particularly worrying since many of the people living in those properties are on low incomes. Will the Minister give assurances that this area will be given high priority by the Government in their discussions with the regulator?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the EESOPs which the regulator presently applies cover areas such as home insulation. It is something we are extremely keen on.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-03_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Hayman) </B>  moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 15, at end insert ("with a view, in particular, to their--

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-03_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, at Second Reading and in Committee we debated at some length the proposition that the Bill should provide a clearer indication as to what primary care trusts will be established to do. The idea received widespread support, including from the Delegated Powers and Deregulation <P>


<a name="column_475"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 475</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Committee. There was also some debate as to what would constitute an appropriate level of detail. The noble Lords, Lord Walton and Lord Skelmersdale, and the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, reminded us of the problems inherent in setting out detailed lists. In the light of our debates, I offered to attempt to bring forward a suitably broad amendment that would address the concerns of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-03_para5"></a>The Government's approach in drafting this amendment has not been to set out a long and detailed list of functions and objectives. That approach is fraught with risks of omission and very real difficulties in relation to defining precisely what various specific objectives might mean as a matter of law, and risks of imposing through primary legislation too rigid a framework for the operation of PCTs which cannot be adapted in the light of the fact that, over time, specific objectives may well change.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-03_para6"></a>Instead, therefore, Amendment No. 1 sets out the broad activities that primary care trusts will be established to undertake. I hope that noble Lords will feel that in so doing we have managed to come up with a provision that is less skeletal than the amendment tabled in Committee by my noble friend Lord Harris of Haringey and perhaps also less skeletal than the amendment that is currently before the House in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-03_para7"></a>To paraphrase Amendment No. 1, it means that primary care trusts may commission or provide hospital and community health services and develop primary care by exercising some functions in relation to general medical services. We want primary care trusts, in particular, to be able to deploy cash-limited funds to improve general practice infrastructure and support practice staff costs; and provide personal medical and dental services under the National Health Service (Primary Care) Act 1997--for example, by employing GPs in the way that community trusts already do under that Act. I am assured that, as a matter of law, this will give us a comprehensive list of what a primary care trust will be.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-03_para8"></a>The amendment provides that the Secretary of State will establish primary care trusts with a view, "in particular", to their undertaking these broad functions. Those words are important for two reasons. First, the listed functions give a clear indication of the main purposes for which primary care trusts will be established, but the list does not set out to be exhaustive. It permits the Secretary of State to establish a primary care trust with a view to exercising other health functions. This fits with existing arrangements whereby health authority functions under Part I are, in the main, not directly conferred by a statute but delegated by the directions of the Secretary of State. Primary care trust functions will be largely delegated from health authorities. Setting out a long list of primary care trust functions would run contrary to this basic structure of delegation which has been a feature of NHS legislation since 1946.
<P>


<a name="column_476"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 476</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-03_para9"></a>Secondly, the amendment does not mean that each primary care trust must perform all the listed functions. For example, matters such as whether a primary care trust will be able to provide services as opposed to merely commissioning them will be left to secondary legislation--in this case the establishment order and directions--as will any restrictions on what primary care trusts can commission and provide. Such flexibility is vital, and I believe that that was accepted by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, at Committee stage when he said that he understood the arguments with regard to flexibility. We want primary care trusts to develop in imaginative new ways; we do not want to lock the service, through primary legislation, into rigid ways of working. I believe that the way services are commissioned and provided should be allowed to evolve in the light of changing needs and developments in clinical practice and technology.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-03_para10"></a>It may be helpful if at this stage I give the Government's response to the amendment standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, which I believe has much the same general purpose as Amendment No. 1. However, there is a difference in that it refers to the responsibility of a primary care trust for promoting and improving the health of the local community. I understand why the noble Lord has framed his amendment in that way and I am sure that, as a general objective, it is not one from which we would want to demur, but perhaps I may explain why the Government have not gone down that particular route.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-03_para11"></a>The functions listed in the amendment all concern the provision of services under the 1977 Act. The fundamental duty of the Secretary of State under that Act, as set out in Section 1, is to promote a comprehensive health service designed to secure improvement in the physical and mental health of people and in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness. The Secretary of State's power to direct health authorities and primary care trusts to exercise his functions is limited to functions relating to the health service. There is, therefore, a definite link between primary care trust functions and the overall objectives of the health service.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-03_para12"></a> Primary legislation does not explicitly require health authorities to exercise functions for these purposes. Such a requirement would be entirely superfluous as a matter of law. We have adopted a similar approach for primary care trusts in the Bill for exactly the same reason. That should not be taken to mean that primary care trusts will not play a critically important role in promoting the health of their local populations. We believe that they will.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-03_para13"></a>Amendment No. 3 also refers to the responsibility of a primary care trust to work within the context of the health improvement programme. I confirm that that is indeed the Government's intention. However, the Bill already makes provision for that and there is no need to replicate this on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-03_para14"></a>Clause 21(3), on page 16 of the Bill, places a duty on the primary care trusts, NHS trusts and local authorities to participate in the preparation, or review, of plans. <P>


<a name="column_477"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 477</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clause 21(7)(b), at the top of page 17, provides that in exercising their functions primary care trusts must have regard to any plan in relation to which they have participated. I should point out that the powers of direction over primary care trusts contained in Clause 7 are also relevant here. Both the Secretary of State and health authorities will be able to give specific directions to primary care trusts to ensure that they play their part in achieving national priorities and in developing and delivering the local health improvement programme.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-03_para15"></a>There is a reference in Amendment No. 3 to a PCT being a body corporate. Paragraph 3 of Schedule 5A--Schedule 1 to the Bill--already provides that every primary care trust shall be a body corporate and I believe that there is no need to repeat that in Clause 2.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-03_para16"></a> I hope that the House will forgive me for explaining in some detail the thinking behind the amendment. I recognise that this is a matter of particular interest. We have tried to take on board the clear view expressed in Committee that there should be a statement of purpose on the face of the Bill and set out reasons why we believe that such a statement should be couched in the terms proposed in the government amendment rather than in those proposed in the alternative formulation. I beg to move.

It may be that I am slightly slow or slightly deafer than usual this afternoon. I should be grateful if the noble Baroness would explain to what Section 28C, referred to in paragraph (c) of Amendment No. 1, applies. Clearly the reference must be to the 1977 Act, but I am not sure what the relevance is to the duties and intentions of the PCTs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may ask the noble Baroness to elaborate on the expression, "body corporate". I ask that because, as a dental practitioner, at one time I owned a body corporate. Body corporates in the dental sense were designed to enable people who were not dentists to run dental practices. Indeed, I noticed from the press recently that Boots had acquired a body corporate and would now be running dental practices, so such bodies still exist. Is there any possibility under this Act that the body corporate could be taken over by people other than professionals, who would then run these health services? Could the whole of the health service be handed over to a body corporate?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-04_para0"></a>I understand the body corporate to be a limited company. Perhaps the noble Baroness could tell me whether that is correct. If it is, is it subject to company law? Is it some other kind of body corporate? It is not a mutual. I should like to know the legal technicalities with regard to the body corporate to which the noble Baroness referred.

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 478</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>never be sufficiently exclusive, or sufficiently inclusive to meet all potential developments, I welcome the amendment, which seems to me to be sufficiently broad to take account of future developments. In particular, I welcome the inclusion of the words "in particular" in the amendment, which means that subsequently, should it prove necessary, other functions could be added by regulation to those specified in the amendment. I believe that this is an admirable solution to a difficult problem and I congratulate the Government on it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-04_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Government for bringing forward this amendment and for responding so constructively to what I sensed was a very widely held view during the Bill's earlier stages that there needed to be an explicit definition or statement of purpose for a primary care trust spelt out in the legislation. My only regret is that the amendment has a slightly circular feel, at least as regards paragraphs (a) and (b). To be told that a primary care trust will be concerned with the provision of services under Part I of the Act is reminiscent of the party of the first part being known in a contract as the party of the first party. I had hoped that a slightly more explicit framework could be inserted without undermining the important principle of flexibility to which the Minister alluded and which the Government understandably want to maintain.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-04_para1"></a>However, the Government's amendment is considerably better than what we had before--which was nothing. Lest I sound too grudging, which I have no wish to do, one of the most significant words is "and" at the end of paragraph (b). I realise that the functions listed are not mandatory for every PCT but the word "and" seems symbolic of the comprehensiveness of a PCT's functions, certainly at level 4, and the linkage between its broader commissioning and providing role and its role as a provider of personal medical and dental services under Section 28(1) of the 1997 Act. Incidentally, that answers my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale. I hope that I have not over-interpreted the significance of the word "and".
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-04_para2"></a>I welcome the amendment and, in light of the Minister's comments, I do not intend to preach the alternative to which I added my name or that which I tabled in Committee--the wording of which was lifted straight out of the Government's White Paper. The issue is not as simple or as straightforward as it might appear and I am grateful to the Minister for her willingness to take on board the main point of principle which causes concern to so many of us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-04_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, ours is almost a composite amendment, incorporating a sentence derived from an amendment tabled in Committee by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, but omitting all the lists that other noble Lords so understandably disliked. Our language is also taken directly from bits of paper and guidance supplied by the department. It occurred to us that it would be better partly to link an amendment on purposes back to the 1977 Act, but I did not find myself competent at that, so we proceeded with the amendment that we first thought of instead.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-04_para3"></a>I listened with interest to the Minister's remarks about the Government's amendment but confess to some disappointment that it does not set itself in the context of the Bill as well as of the 1977 Act. On the other hand, it is extremely welcome that the Minister has fulfilled her indication in Committee by bringing forward a comprehensive amendment. Persons who understand legal language will understand the amendment easily but others will be puzzled and will need legal advice. I regret that it has not been possible to link the amendment with the 1977 Act in the simple way that we proposed. However, in view of the Minister's excellent amendment, it is extremely unlikely that we will contest that point again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-04_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   I am grateful for the support for Amendment No. 1. We have done our best with it but I share some of the concerns expressed by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood. I doubt that it would win a plain English award, but I hope that it satisfies the average legislator more than the absence of any definition in the first place.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-04_para4"></a>The noble Earl is absolutely right when he says that the use of the word "and" is significant. We expect that PCTs will exercise all three categories of function but they do not have to do so. Neither are these necessarily a comprehensive set, so that we may acknowledge developments may occur. He was also right in answering the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, about Section 28(1) of the 1977 Act, which refers to the personal medical and dental services that can be provided. In doing so, PCTs will be put on the same footing as community trusts and be able to provide personal medical or dental services.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-04_para5"></a>To answer the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, a body corporate is a body with a legal personality. It is able to exercise the same rights and be subject to the same liabilities as a natural person, subject to the statutory provisions that govern it. That is a significant area for primary care trusts and is the limitation. Primary care trusts are statutory bodies corporate in exactly the same way as NHS trusts and therefore subject to the requirements of the Bill. A PCT can only be set up by an establishment order under the Bill for the purposes in the amendment. Therefore, it could not be handed over to the private sector. That is the legal mechanism for creating those clearly NHS bodies.

<A NAME = "90315-04_para7"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, this is grouped with Amendments Nos. 4 and 5, to which I have added my name. The amendments address an extremely important issue debated in Committee--the basis on which the Secretary of State should decide whether or not to establish a primary care trust. As the Bill stands, a <P>


<a name="column_480"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 480</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proposal to establish a PCT could be made by a community trust, health authority, primary care group or a combination of those--whereupon that proposal would go out to consultation locally. The result of that process would inform the Secretary of State's decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-04_para8"></a>My concern, which is widely shared among doctors and other healthcare professionals, is that those arrangements do not provide any assurance that the views of key stakeholders--the primary care groups--will determine the Secretary of State's decision. The worry is that a PCT could be established following wide and thorough consultation but without the positive backing of those most affected by it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-04_para9"></a>Consultation is an expensive process and it would be a thoroughgoing waste of NHS resources for PCT proposals to be put out to consultation without approval by the relevant PCG having first been sought. Another issue is implementation. Unless doctors and health professionals represented on a PCG are fully committed to developing a primary care trust and have a real sense of ownership of what is proposed, it is hard to see how the group could succeed in practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-04_para10"></a>In Committee the Minister sought to be reassuring on those points. I fully acknowledge that the amendments previously tabled, at least by these Benches, did not properly capture the aim that the approval process should be wide and inclusive. But when I read again the Minister's language in Hansard it was odd. She twice repeated the phraseology of the circular of the Department of Health which said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is our assumption that the support of relevant primary care groups would be required". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The Minister said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We intend to establish PCTs in a way that is sensitive to local views". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
She also said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The views of PCGs, local GPs and other professions will be key considerations for the Secretary of State". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-04_para11"></a>With great respect to the Minister--I know that she intends to be reassuring--I do not believe that those phrases go far enough. They appear rather guarded. It is because the words seem so carefully chosen that I feel even more strongly than I did before that something of a more prescriptive and definitive nature should appear on the face of the Bill. I believe the Minister when she says that the Government want measured change with progression to trust status being driven locally. However, there is a lurking worry that what ultimately determines the Secretary of State's decision may not be the feelings and views of health professionals but, rather, the views of others or (heaven forbid) the fulfilment of a political agenda. The Bill should not allow for that and, therefore, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl has spoken to a number of very important points that reflect many of the reasons for Amendment No. 5, which is very similar to his own. It is particularly important that progression from PCG to PCT status is clearly understood and that safeguards are built in. In a very recent circular relating to management costs, it is made <P>


<a name="column_481"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 481</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clear to health authorities that it is only by devolving to PCTs in due course that they will achieve the operational cost reductions required of them by the Department of Health. There will be considerable pressure on health authorities to ensure that the fledgling PCGs under their tutelage move towards PCT status, at least to level three, because it is only by moving on that those health authorities will reduce their management costs. It is extremely important to ensure that health authorities are not able simply to insist that a PCG becomes a PCT without the full consent of that PCG.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-04_para12"></a>Like the noble Earl, I recognise that the Minister sought to reassure the Committee. She said that the Government could not put a requirement for consent on the face of the Bill because of particular circumstances. For example, two PCGs and the majority of GPs might want to go into a PCT but for some reason one of the PCGs, by vote of its members, might not be able to consent. That appeared to those on these Benches to be an exceptional circumstance; hence we have reflected that in our amendment. After all, if there were exceptional circumstances preventing progress from PCG to PCT status we would not wish to oppose that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-04_para13"></a>The language used by the Minister was in some ways more positive than that used in a letter dated 19th February from her colleague in another place. As the noble Earl pointed out, Mr. John Denham said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is our assumption that the support of the relevant primary care group would be required". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The noble Baroness said that the Government did not envisage circumstances in which proposals would go ahead without the support of PCGs. I appreciate that she was putting a gloss on that letter. However, the difference in the language of the letter is significant. All of the professionals to whom we on these Benches have spoken in connection with this amendment have said that clearly there is no point in going out to consultation on progress towards PCT status if the basic requirement of consent of the primary care group is not met. Therefore, this amendment seeks further reassurance from the Minister about the nature of the consultation. I hope very much that she will be able to give that reassurance today.

<A NAME="90315-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Howe made a powerful case in moving Amendment No. 2. Almost everything he said has been repeated by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, in speaking to his amendment. I believe that this is a simple matter and should not be made too complicated. To move from a primary care group to a primary care trust is a very big step, particularly if the trust is to move to stage 4. It is a move that all the stakeholders must support if it is to work. The word "stakeholding" is absolutely meaningless if it does not mean that everyone has a stake. One cannot have a stake in something that one does not want. On those very simple grounds I believe that the Government must accept either this amendment or something very much like it. To reject the amendment would be extremely foolish.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I rise to speak to Amendment No. 4. The amendment relates <P>


<a name="column_482"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 482</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to a slightly different issue from the one raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and by my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones. It relates to the wider process of consultation within the community over the establishment of primary care trusts. In Committee the Minister made clear that consultation about the setting up of primary care trusts would be mandatory. The question at issue was who should be consulted in that process. In particular we on these Benches were concerned that the consultation should involve both the wider medical community such as dentists, opticians, pharmacists and professionals allied to medicine, for example, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists and so on, and lay members of the community represented by community health councils and the voluntary sector, including representatives of both carers and patients.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para0"></a>We had considerable discussion as to how far it was possible to prescribe who should be consulted by lists. The consensus, as on other issues, was that lists were too prescriptive and inflexible. The Minister echoed those thoughts. However, she assured us that the regulations to be made would specify wide consultation, including both the wider medical community, patient and carer groups and the voluntary sector. We made clear that we were not entirely happy with the response of the Minister. We have not yet seen the regulations. Can the Minister give an assurance that they will be laid before the House prior to this Bill going to the other place?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para1"></a>While we accept the dangers of being too prescriptive and inflexible, we maintain the core principle; namely, if primary care trusts are to work satisfactorily they must be owned by their local communities and wide consultation helps to create such a sense of ownership. In order to meet the wish of the Minister to have a more flexible and less prescriptive form of words we have redrafted our amendment. We now merely ask that it should be specified on the face of the Bill that key partners in the delivery of healthcare under the National Health Service should be consulted.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para2"></a>I reiterate that although the wording is more generalised, an issue of principle underlies the amendment. The Minister made clear at Committee stage the distinction between primary care groups which are to be led by GPs and practice nurses as commissioners of services and the primary care trusts which may be providers as well as commissioners of services. Unless specified on the face of the Bill, in moving from a stage 2 primary care group to a stage 3 primary care trust, there is a danger that consultation does not go wide enough and is too narrowly focused among the GPs and practice nurses who are involved already in running the group and subsequently the trust. By requiring consultation with key partners, and with the regulations specifying who those key partners shall be, we make sure that wide consultation takes place.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para3"></a>It is an important issue. Healthcare is more than just GPs' surgeries and hospitals. It involves all those we have sought previously to specify: the dentists and opticians; the physiotherapists and occupational therapists; chiropodists and social workers; universities and training institutes; and patients, carers and voluntary <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>organisations. If those groups are to play a full part in this new community-based healthcare system that the Government are promoting--the primary care trust--then they must trust and work with it, and they must be consulted when those trusts are established.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I support Amendment No. 2 moved by my noble friend Lord Howe. I support that part of Amendment No. 5 which makes almost the same provision as Amendment No. 2. I am less happy with the phrase in Amendment No. 5 "except in exceptional circumstances". That provides such a let-out that it negates the majority vote.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para4"></a>The only fault that I can find with the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Howe is that it refers only to a majority. I believe that two-thirds should be in favour. There should be a definite process whereby people are able to register their feelings. My noble friend suggests a majority vote. It is generous to suggest simply a majority on the face of the Bill. We could have suggested a larger figure. However, we believe that those entering into a trust must be committed to it and want the best for the health service. Unless one has that provision, a small group of people on the primary care group with a lot of influence could overrule their less articulate colleagues and one could have people going into a primary care trust without being fully committed. I believe that Amendment No. 2 is a good amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para5"></a>I found the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, on Amendment No. 4 very interesting. It is a chicken and egg situation. The noble Baroness referred to key partners. She did not mention pharmacists. One could go on and on; a list is never complete. But if one refers to key partners the question arises of how they will be defined. There is a problem therefore with Amendment No. 4. But I support Amendment No. 2 wholeheartedly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has differentiated between Amendment No. 2 and the other two amendments. When I describe the NHS as a great juggernaut, it is by no means pejorative. I use the term almost as a mark of respect. It is difficult to stop a great juggernaut and to make it turn corners; in the case of the Queen Mary, for example, to veer slightly to the left or right; or in the case of this Government to veer straight ahead! But we shall leave that point for another time.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para6"></a>It is vital that all healthcare professionals should be consulted. That theme runs through Amendments Nos. 2, 4 and 5. What is different is that having conducted the consultation the primary care group should have a vote which should be settled on a majority. The Government are keen on democratisation. They seek to democratise this House; they seek to democratise local government arrangements; they have almost succeeded in democratising local government proceedings in Scotland and Wales, and of course in London. I see no reason therefore why they should not democratise the institutional change of primary care groups from stage 3 to the ultimate stage 4 of the <P>


<a name="column_484"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 484</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>primary care trust. Therefore I hope that the noble Baroness will have no difficulty in accepting the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_time0"></A><H5>3.45 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-05_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I strongly support my noble friend. The Minister will be well aware that if one is to achieve any change in the NHS, one has to take the key professionals with you. Traditionally, the way to do that has been to consult them fully. The noble Baroness will also be aware of some of the pitfalls of consultation. Those issuing consultation papers profess that they are sincere; that they are listening; and that they will be influenced by the outcome. But those who are being consulted sometimes suffer from consultation fatigue. As a result, they are wary, sometimes cynical, and think that the whole process is just another NHS tribal ritual--a sort of rite of passage before proposals come into being.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para7"></a>The amendment put forward by my noble friend gets over that problem. He seeks a majority vote. That is an excellent idea. It is clear; it is concise; and it rules out any ambivalence, any interpretation, of the consultation exercise that has taken place. I am aware that the Minister may not wholeheartedly support the amendment. However, perhaps I may probe further. There is a possibility that the amendment could be rejected. Will the noble Baroness tell us today what criteria will be exercised by the Government when they take on board the consultation? What evidence will they require to be assured that the majority is in favour? Can the Minister also say what processes will be in place during the course of consultation so that the Secretary of State can assess the views of the PCG about progress to trust status where that view differs from the health authority?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-05_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Fookes: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister replies I have a question, the answer to which may influence the way I vote on the amendments before us. Can we have an absolute assurance from the Minister that if as a result of the consultations she proposes there seems to be no enthusiasm, or perhaps even downright hostility, to moving to a trust, she will not then go ahead with making the order? It is a key point. I am slightly cynical as to whether we shall have such an assurance. In those circumstances, I prefer the certainty of Amendment No. 2.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-05_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, we have had an interesting short debate following the extensive debates at Committee stage. We have discussed some of the same issues. Those issues do not relate to the ends that we wish to achieve but the effectiveness of the means of achieving them.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para8"></a>There are two issues. The first relates to the many difficulties in drawing up in primary legislation exactly who must be consulted before a primary care trust is established. Amendment No. 4 returns to that issue. The second issue is the relative weight which should be given to the views of local players and professionals, and those of the primary care groups and GPs in particular, to which Amendments Nos. 2 and 5 refer. <P>


<a name="column_485"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 485</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I am grateful to those who drafted the amendments for trying to accommodate the "exceptional circumstances" issue, which I put forward as one of the reasons against including this in primary legislation. I am not sure whether that helps, because we then have an argument about what "exceptional circumstances" means, who interprets it and whether it is a meaningful phrase to put into primary legislation. I tried to reassure the House in earlier debates; I will try to reassure your Lordships again today and to clarify some of the issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para9"></a>One issue I should like to make clear at the beginning, which in earlier debates may have become slightly lost in our focusing on the technicalities, is that the Secretary of State for Health can establish a primary care trust only after consultation. The effect of the new Section 16A(4) and (5) inserted by Clause 2 is to impose a cast-iron duty on the Secretary of State to impose consultation requirements before a PCT is established. Our key aim has always been that the whole process leading up to the Secretary of State considering the establishment of a primary care trust is a local one, taking into account a wide range of local views on proposals generated locally. Consultation needs to be thorough and effective. I take the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, made: consultation should not be a ritual process to be gone through; it should be realistic and inclusive, with a significant number of interests being considered and balanced.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para10"></a>We recognise that developing and shaping the delivery of healthcare to meet the needs of the local population needs to involve the whole community. As a matter of government policy we will therefore be considering the interests of all relevant parties when making these regulations. I can give a clear assurance that we will, first, be consulting very widely and, secondly, be taking account of those views--the point to which the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para11"></a>On Amendments Nos. 2 and 5 I will reiterate a further assurance which I gave to the House. It is no part of the Government's agenda to impose primary care trusts on the service in the face of local opposition, nor to deliver GPs and other healthcare professionals, bound and gagged, into primary care trusts. The process will be locally driven, based on and sensitive to local needs. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, I can say that it will not be driven by issues of management costs. There is an envelope to cover health authorities, PCGs and, in due course, PCTs. It is not a question of devolution to PCTs being driven by management costs; rather, the principle is that funding for management costs should be consistent with where the management function is being discharged. If they are taking on more management, the costs should shift to them for doing that; but it is a matter of redistribution and not of changing the existing package.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para12"></a>Returning to the basic issue, the views of primary care groups, local GPs and other professions, as well as those of the wider community and the NHS locally, will be key considerations for the Secretary of State in deciding whether or not to establish a primary care trust, and the support of the relevant primary care group will be a <P>


<a name="column_486"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 486</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>crucial consideration. We intend to establish PCTs in a way that is sensitive to local views and primary care groups are obviously key to that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para13"></a>We have made it clear that it is our assumption that the support of the relevant primary care group will be required before a primary care trust is established. Let me make it clear once again that we want primary care trusts to be established with the support of local primary care groups, and we recognise the arguments that have been put forward about local ownership if they are to be a success. The House can therefore be reassured that the support of the PCG will be a critical factor in our decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para14"></a>So far there is not a great deal in the argument between those who support the amendments and myself, who has difficulty with them. Perhaps I may explain to the House what those difficulties are. In taking account of the views of one group of stakeholders, however important they are--and here we are talking about the PCGs--we should not allow for the possibility of automatically ignoring the views of others in the local community as though they had no weight at all. That is what Amendment No. 2 does. I believe that it would serve to demean the importance of the partners in the local NHS, such as community trusts and their staff, who will be very much affected by these proposals. As I said in Committee, it may be, though we hope that it will not, that complex and difficult situations--dare I say, exceptional circumstances?--arise which require careful and sensitive handling. Amendment No. 5 recognises that possibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para15"></a>At Committee stage I gave one example; perhaps I may now give another. Let us consider the situation where almost exactly half of the local GPs within a PCG area are strongly in favour of a proposal to establish a primary care trust and half are lukewarm about it. The health authority, neighbouring PCGs, the local community trust and acute trust clinicians and managers, and local authority are all strongly supportive; and the Community Health Council and local patient and carer groups give unanimous support in favour of establishing a PCT. Surely the Secretary of State should not then be obliged by primary legislation to ignore those views. After all, the Government have always maintained that they want the establishment of primary care trusts to be locally driven. That means reflecting a broad spectrum of views.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para16"></a>I have given a hypothetical example in which almost exactly half of the GPs within a PCG area are strongly in favour and half are lukewarm, but that is not what these amendments provide for. They state that PCG members--that is, the PCG board--would be responsible for the veto. Local healthcare professionals, who in lay terms may be described as PCG members--that was the point behind the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, regarding a bare majority or a clear majority--do not fall within that definition as a matter of law. Given that PCG boards may comprise a minimum of nine members, these amendments effectively provide that five individuals on the PCG board, a majority of the board, could stand in the way of the establishment of a primary care trust despite <P>


<a name="column_487"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 487</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>overwhelming local support. That does not seem to me to be an appropriate way of dealing with a very difficult local circumstance.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para17"></a>I have a further difficulty with Amendment No. 5. It seems to me to be almost impossible to provide a satisfactory, objective definition of what constitutes "exceptional circumstances". I do not believe that it is feasible to capture all the circumstances which could be considered exceptional. I am not even clear whether the example I have just given would, in terms of statute, constitute exceptional circumstances. It is the sort of situation where the clear judgment of a Secretary of State would be needed regarding the best way forward in a difficult situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para18"></a>A further more technical point is that there is a problem in specifying a particular role for primary care groups on the face of the Bill. The pace at which PCGs progress to PCTs will vary, but there may be circumstances where, say, the whole of the health authority is covered by PCTs. People locally may want to re-configure primary care trusts; for example, by creating a new one. In those circumstances, the requirement to achieve primary care group agreement would not be relevant.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para19"></a>The difficulty with Amendment No. 4 is the use of the term "key partners." As regards the definition, what, as a matter of law, does that proposition mean? Who are the key partners? Could they vary from one locality to another? How does one define them in primary legislation without getting into the recurrent list problem? Furthermore, I suggest that the Secretary of State must bear in mind a whole range of interests and should consider all relevant factors, not just those of the key partners, whoever they might be. There is a danger that in specifying "key partners" we are importing "two-tierism" into the Bill and enshrining in primary legislation a system between partners who matter, who are the key partners, and partners who do not matter, who are not on the face of the Bill. I do not believe that that is the most conducive approach to partnership working.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para20"></a>Finally, the way in which the Bill approaches the issue is based on clear precedent. The 1990 Act does not require the Secretary of State to have regard to particular interests when making regulations as to the consultation requirements which are to apply before an NHS trust is established. We are trying to mirror that situation here. I hope that I have persuaded your Lordships that there is no substantive disagreement as to the policy intentions but that there are some real and serious difficulties in spelling out those policy intentions on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para21"></a>I was asked about the criteria for the establishment of a primary care trust. I make it clear that top among them are likely to be a clear vision of the service and health benefits which establishing the trust may bring, an effective contribution to the local health improvement programme, effective arrangements for developing clinical standards and proper arrangements for monitoring activity. First and foremost, however, there must be broad local support for its establishment, including among the GPs affected.
<P>


<a name="column_488"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 488</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-05_para22"></a>I hope that in the light of those reassurances, our clear intention to have wide and meaningful consultation and our clear recognition that GPs and other primary care group professionals are crucial to the matter, the House will feel that it is not sensible to put such definitions on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="90315-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, will she explain one point? If there is no option for people to vote, does she mean that the Secretary of State will have the sole power to determine whether or not the primary care trusts are set up?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister responds, perhaps I, too, may ask a brief question. In criticising the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Howe, she gave an example where everyone in a local community apart from the doctors, presumably the GPs, are in favour. Is she aware that under my noble friend's proposal in Amendment No. 2, there will be no doubt whatever that the majority vote of the members of a primary care group would go in the direction of forming a PCT?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, we are debating a hypothetical issue of a hypothetical issue in saying that we do not know how a vote will go on the board of a primary care group. I take the noble Lord's point that it would not be a matter of the GPs having a direct vote because the amendment deals only with the board members of the primary care group.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-06_para0"></a>As regards the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, it is correct that there would be no power of veto for a primary care group against the proposition that the Secretary of State, after extensive consultation and examination of the whole range of issues, can decide the most appropriate and best way of taking forward the health of the local community. There is a danger in trying to think through the implications of such legislation. In the hypothetical example of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, the primary care group board would support the proposal and I am not sure that that is absolutely clear. Certainly, the professionals on the PCG board could be out-voted by the lay members. I suggest that there is no magic formula in legislative provision which will guarantee that a proposal is soundly, locally based. There must be some room for judgment. That was recognised in the creation of NHS trusts. I hope that I have reassured the House that it will not be done in a cavalier manner and that we have real arrangements for wide-ranging and meaningful consultation before a primary care trust can be set up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister concludes, perhaps I may ask a question. I fully support the intentions underlying the amendments relating to consultation, but I am afraid that I have difficulty with each of them. Amendment No. 2 provides for "consultation with all health care professionals", but not for consultations with representatives of the local community, the community health council and others. I also accept the difficulty of defining "key partners" and "exceptional circumstances".
<P>


<a name="column_489"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 489</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-06_para1"></a>Clause 2(4) states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If any consultation requirements apply, they must be complied with". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
However, subsection (5) goes on to provide:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In this section, 'consultation requirements' means requirements about consultation contained in regulations". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Is it the case that such regulations would be subject to secondary legislation? Would they be placed before both Houses of Parliament for approval? If so, the Minister's confirmation would reassure me that this is a satisfactory way to go forward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-06_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is correct in outlining the difficulties with the amendments and the rigidity of primary legislation. The regulations would be encompassed in secondary legislation, which would be subject to negative resolution. There would therefore be an opportunity for people to scrutinise what was being suggested.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-06_para2"></a>There is no intention not to consult any of the people mentioned in today's debate. However, the difficulty lies in defining the people who are to be omitted and the exceptional circumstances. I hope we can clarify the consultation process in a way that the noble Lord finds reassuring.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-06_para3"></a>It would be wrong to suggest to the House that we could obviate completely the need for the ability to use judgment at some point in potentially very difficult circumstances. I suggest that it is safer to have the element of judgment, even though the Secretary of State has some power, rather than to bind ourselves to the rigidities of statute law. That would allow decisions to be made which were sensible and best balanced in the interests of local communities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, in view of the remarks which the noble Lord has just made, I hope that it may be in order for me, even though it is Report stage, to ask the Minister why, instead of putting them in regulations at a later date, we cannot have the consultation requirements referred to in subsection (5) defined clearly in the Bill, which could be done on Third Reading.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-06_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, subsection (4) also causes some difficulty.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-06_spnew7"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Order, order!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-06_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, this has been a fruitful debate and I am grateful to the Minister for the care that she has devoted to addressing my amendments. I listened extremely carefully to what she said.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-06_para4"></a>Despite her obvious wish to be helpful and reassuring, I do not believe that she has quite gone far enough to meet the essence of the point which I sought to make. I understand the duty on the Secretary of State to consult. Perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, that, as we have heard from the Minister, that consultation process will be inclusive and wide-ranging. There is no doubt about that. Those who have a legitimate say in the process will be able to have that say. I do not dispute that for one moment.
<P>


<a name="column_490"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 490</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-06_para5"></a>But the result of a consultation is not binding, as we very well know. I could not help but notice again the use of the phrase by the Minister, "It is our assumption that the support of PCGs will be required". That is a strange, guarded phrase to use. I am reassured by the Minister saying that it is no part of the Government's agenda to deliver GPs bound and gagged into a PCT. But the example that she gave--and I believe it was her example rather than that of my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale--would do just that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-06_para6"></a>I should say in relation to my amendments that the members of the PCG are not just there to represent themselves. They are there to represent the whole range of healthcare professionals, voluntary groups and patients in the locality. In that sense, I agree with the noble Baroness; she is quite right in what she said. We do not doubt that GPs and PCGs will be key players and that the views of local professional groups will be key considerations in the decision-making process. But with great respect, that is not the same as ensuring that the actual initiation of the consultation process and the ultimate decision depends, one way or the other, on the support and endorsement of primary care groups.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-06_para7"></a>The principle and policy behind the amendment are almost shared on the two Benches. The noble Baroness intimated that herself. There is an element of judgment to be made, but my contention is that that judgment should be made at PCG level. I was gratified by the degree of support that I received from around the House for the points that I was seeking to make. I believe that this is a sufficiently important issue on which I should seek the opinion of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones </B>   moved Amendment No. 6:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 2, line 27, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) Appropriate arrangements shall be made with a view to securing that a Primary Care Trust's functions are exercised with due regard to the principle that there should be equality of opportunity for all people."").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, to some degree this is a re-run of the amendments that we discussed in Committee on the addition to the duties of primary care trusts of the duty of equality of opportunity. Amendments Nos. 9 and 31 are grouped with this amendment. In Committee, the Minister indicated that she would consider the best way in which to take forward the points raised about adding to the existing duties of primary care trusts the duty to observe equality of opportunity and--I believe that her reply on this was rather more equivocal--adding to the duties of the commission for health improvement in a similar fashion.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_para1"></a>We have not changed the amendment raised in Committee for PCTs. It states in broad terms the principle that there shall be equality of opportunity for all people. However, the amendment as regards the commission for health improvement has been made more specific in response to some of the criticisms that Members of the Committee made when that was discussed. It is an important area and it is important for primary care trusts. It would be easy to say that we need a general statement about the duties of the NHS which covered all bodies in the NHS, and we could spend a lot of time devising appropriate forms of language.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_para2"></a>However, it is particularly important that that should cover primary care trusts, for a variety of reasons. I recognise that recently the Government launched their own initiative, with a circular to managers across the National Health Service, to take tough action to tackle racism; for instance, by April 2000 every NHS employer <P>


<a name="column_493"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 493</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will need to be in a position to tackle racial harassment wherever committed by staff or by patients and progress will be measured and targets for reducing incidents will be set.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_para3"></a>However, the issues of management in primary care trusts will be more difficult. Structures in primary care are much more devolved than they are in secondary care. The historical independent contractual status of GPs has led to a more fragmented and, at times, resistant approach to mainstream equality initiatives coming from the Department of Health and the NHS Executive.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_para4"></a>Many primary care providers are covered by the small partnership exemption in the Race Relations Act. In other primary care professions there has been evidence that ethnic minority professionals are more likely to suffer obstacles to career progress, such as disproportionate appearances at disciplinary hearings. A further reason is that the Health Education Authority's health and lifestyle study in 1994 showed that some ethnic minority groups use GP services more than the majority of the population. That also shows that people from ethnic minorities wait significantly longer in surgery to see a doctor. Among south Asians in particular there is a tendency to register with a GP of south Asian origin.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_para5"></a>The proposed policy for dispersal of asylum seekers will have enormous implications for primary care across the country. There are bound to be misunderstandings about entitlement to healthcare and lack of access to interpreters or specialist help for trauma resulting from their experience prior to coming to the UK. There are a number of other reasons that I could go into.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_para6"></a>On the commission for health improvement, we had less of a debate on that subject in Committee, but the commission for health improvement must see as part of its remit the function of ensuring that equality standards are met for all ethnic groups, whether those are specified in national service agreements or the NHS Charter--no doubt that is to be revised--or local standards. Such a principle should be a founding principle and should be enshrined in law. It is a new public body and it must be in a strong position to guard against institutional racism, as defined in the Macpherson inquiry report.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_para7"></a>I draw your Lordships' attention to two thoughtful and well considered editorials in the Lancet and the British Medical Journal in the past week. Both make the point that action by the NHS is very much needed. I quote from the BMJ:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The NHS needs to go further. We need to take a needs led, evidence based approach to understand the reasons for disparities. We need actively to assess services using a centralised body as this would afford economies of scale and proper levels of expertise and independence"&#183; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I suggest to your Lordships that CHIMP is the very body that would fulfil that role. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support Amendment No. 6. As the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, this is an important area. There is concern that older people and those from ethnic minorities are discriminated against in the NHS. Older people often experience difficulties in primary care provision and are more likely to be dropped off GPs' <P>


<a name="column_494"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 494</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>lists than younger people. There are even reported examples of GP surgeries that refuse to deal with patients over the age of 65.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_para8"></a>In addition, the incidence of illness is patterned by ethnic difference; for example, people of Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds have 50 per cent. greater rates of heart disease than white people. Historically, many primary care practitioners were exempt from the Race Relations Act, so primary care has not been subject to the same drive for equality as the rest of the NHS. Healthcare policy must ensure equality of access to primary care trusts. I strongly urge the Government to accept the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_time0"></A><H5>4.30 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, of this group, I find Amendment No. 31 by far the most attractive and the most sensible. In Committee, the Minister made it clear (at col. 1294 of the Official Report) that she would like to consider the points that were made then. She went on to say that not only would she consider those points but that she would like to look at the best way to tackle the matters put forward and whether they could be accommodated in terms of amendments to the Bill. I therefore looked at the Marshalled List with interest today and at the government amendments on Friday but found absolutely nothing to give me any hope in that regard. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and my noble friend Lord Astor did exactly the same. I hope that the Minister has some good news for us today in anticipation of Third Reading.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-07_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, may I ask the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, whether this amendment would end prescribing by postcode? Also, disabled people could have difficulties getting on GPs' lists.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-07_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Astor has already covered one essential aspect of this and I shall not repeat what he said so eloquently. However, a further point needs making. It relates to the Government's entirely laudable ambition to see a levelling up of patient care not a levelling down. I am afraid that we are seeing just the opposite around the country. Practice-based budgets are being absorbed into unified budgets. In the process, services are being run down. There are numerous examples currently being reported in the medical press and they all relate to mainstream services, not to services at the fringe. I am prepared to accept the Government's assurances that they do not want to see such services disappear as a result of their reforms, but the question has to be asked: what are they going to do to stop it happening?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_para9"></a>The other big concern relates to the burden of pay settlements. There are already reports in the medical press that the only way in which some health authorities will be able to fund their pay bill in its entirety will be to make cuts in the GP prescribing bill. The estimated cost of the inflation-plus element of the pay bill could be as much as &#163;1 million for each health authority--and there are 100 such authorities. That is an enormous amount of money to find. It would be totally <P>


<a name="column_495"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 495</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unacceptable for it to come out of the prescribing budget. The question I need to ask the Minister is this: can she give an assurance that no treatment currently available to patients under the fundholding system will cease to be available under the system of primary care groups and primary care trusts?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-07_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I should like to reiterate the question asked by my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale: does the Minister have it in mind to do anything in the Bill in this respect, because it is most important, and in Committee she said that she had it in mind to put some such provision into the Bill?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_para10"></a>While I am on my feet, when the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, replies to the amendment, perhaps he could comment on this. In Committee I suggested that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"equality of opportunity for all people", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
was a somewhat fatuous and meaningless phrase. I am sorry that the noble Lord did not take my stricture into account. I still think that such a phrase would be an extremely unhappy insertion into the Bill. We all know what "equality of opportunity" means. It is defined in law and is well understood. Saying that we can have,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"equality of opportunity for all people", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
sounds like something that only the good Lord could say and I do not believe that he would believe it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-07_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, in Committee we had some thoughtful and serious debates about equal opportunities in relation to primary care trusts and the commission for health improvement. Some of those arguments have been rehearsed today. I hope that it was clear from my comments in Committee that the Government seek to address this issue in a range of policies.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_para11"></a>Perhaps I may advise the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, that there are a range of ways in which we are trying to tackle the problem of postcode prescribing--not only through this legislation but also with regard to the national service frameworks, the work of the national institute for clinical excellence and through the institution of clinical governance, by which people will have to justify--if I may put it in that way--any deviation from the kitemark standards that are available. I have never pretended that that is an easy task--not least because we do not want a service that is totally centrally controlled and we have to have a proper level of local decision-making about local priorities. We need to get that balance right.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_para12"></a>Perhaps I may return to the issue of equal opportunities. A central part of the Government's agenda is to achieve fairer access to services, to reduce health inequalities and to promote equal opportunities for all those who work in the NHS as well as for those who use it. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said that the Government have put nothing on the Marshalled List in this regard. That is absolutely correct. It is simply because in Committee I agreed to consider a large number of points across a wide range of subjects and this is one of the areas on which we have not yet <P>


<a name="column_496"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 496</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>managed to reach a conclusion about the best way forward in legislation. Indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, drew attention to the drafting.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_para13"></a>This is an extremely important area, but it is also quite complex in terms of legislation. It is important that we consider the issues carefully. I quite understand why the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, has focused on primary care and on the commission for health improvement--not least because they are the issues with which we are dealing in this Bill, but also because they are very important areas that we must tackle in terms of equal opportunities. I do not for a minute challenge that point. However, it is important that we come back with appropriate solutions for the NHS as a whole, not simply for primary care trusts and the commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-07_para14"></a>I should like to reassure the House that we are considering the points raised in Committee. We shall also look at the additional points that have been raised today. I am certain that we shall return to these matters during the passage of the Bill. However, I am not at a stage to go further than that now and I ask the House for a little more leeway on the subject.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo990315/text/90315-08.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, perhaps I may ask her a question. The noble Baroness seemed to indicate that it was the Government's clear intention to consider the best way forward--to legislate for the best way forward--during the passage of this Bill. Am I correct in saying that it is the Government's intention, once they have considered this matter, to insert an appropriate provision during the passage of this Bill and not at a later date?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, as there are serious difficulties in drafting the legislation, perhaps I ought to say that I shall certainly give a commitment to report progress on the issue during the course of this Bill. At this stage it would be premature of me to give an absolute commitment to bring forward such an amendment because I do not yet have before me advice on whether we can properly legislate as the noble Lord would wish. However, I give the commitment that during the course of the Bill we shall return to the subject and report progress. I think that I have given the noble Lord an absolute commitment that we want to address these issues. It would be precipitate of me to say anything beyond those two things.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her reply, which slightly disappoints me because it did not go as far as I would have liked in terms of saying that amendments will be brought forward at a later stage of the Bill. I fully understand the Minister's reasons for not giving that full commitment because of the difficulties of drafting. I also realise, as the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, pointed out, that I did not recognise all the strictures. However, I tried to put forward a bit of a mix and match in terms of tabling a different set of amendments for the commission for health improvement to see if the House was any more enamoured of them. Therefore, I recognise that the Government are having some difficulty in framing their own amendments. I sincerely believe that it is most <P>


<a name="column_497"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 497</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>important for all kinds of public policy reasons to amend the Bill at this particular time in a way that we all clearly desire. I very much hope that the Minister will have some better news for us on Third Reading. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-08_para0"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-08_para1"></a>Schedule 1 [Primary Care Trusts]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford </B>   moved Amendment No. 7:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 42, line 5, at end insert--
<BR>
("(2) The number of persons referred to in sub-paragraph (1)(c) above shall include representatives of key partners in the delivery of NHS healthcare and the promotion of health in the locality.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-08_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I rise to move Amendment No. 7 which has been tabled in the names of my noble friends Lord Clement-Jones and Lady Thomas of Walliswood. The amendment concerns the membership of primary care trust boards. Since we debated this issue on the last occasion, we have had the opportunity to study the detailed proposals put forward by the health Minister in his letter to the chairs of health authorities, NHS trusts and primary care groups, which the Minister referred to in her reply in Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-08_para3"></a>The letter makes a distinction between the trust board, which will comprise a majority of lay members, and the executive board which will be responsible for day-to-day management and led and dominated by the healthcare professionals. We accept that distinction. The amendment relates primarily to the composition of the trust board but it also has relevance to the composition of the executive board.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-08_para4"></a>As the Minister made clear in Committee, the intention is that these new primary care trusts should be firmly rooted in their local communities and responsive to the health needs of the community. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there is on the face of the Bill an obligation to ensure that the trust board and the executive board are representative of both users and providers of healthcare in their locality. This time we have been careful to avoid the lists which were criticised on all sides when we previously discussed these matters. However, the principle remains the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-08_para5"></a>We are anxious that the PCTs should not become enclaves of professionals, run by the professionals for the professionals. We therefore welcome the dominant lay membership of primary care trust boards. But in looking for people to fill the positions of lay members, we are anxious that, among others, the Minister should remember, when making appointments, the need for users in the form of patient and carer groups to be represented, as well as the need for broad representation across age groups, between men and women, and fair representation of ethnic minorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-08_para6"></a>In addition, we are anxious to ensure that it is not just GPs and practice nurses who gain representation among the professionals. We have received extremely strong representation from the professions allied to medicine--midwives, health visitors, physiotherapists, radiographers and speech therapists, to mention a few--about representation on boards. As my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones made clear in Committee, they are particularly concerned about their lack of representation <P>


<a name="column_498"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 498</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>at stage 3 trust level when boards are effectively run by GPs and nurses. As the Minister made clear, this is largely because PCTs will be mainly concerned at that stage with commissioning healthcare services from, among others, these professionals.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-08_para7"></a>However, in moving from stage 3 to stage 4, the danger is that executive boards will remain much the same. If I may say so, that also raises a gender issue. If the executive boards are dominated by GPs, they are likely to be disproportionately male. Therefore the key issue is representation at stage 4 trust level. As the Minister made clear in Committee, the possibility of their being members of the full trust board, as one of the professional representatives, is certainly not excluded. However, as she also made clear, of the 11 members of a trust board, six, including the chair, will be lay members, two will be ex officio in their capacities as the chief executive officer and finance director of the trust, leaving only three places for healthcare professionals, of which one will be filled by the director of clinical governance for the PCT, one by a GP and one by a nurse. Therefore, as the Minister said, although we do not rule out the possibility of the professions supplementary to medicine--or, indeed, midwives or district nurses--being on the board at stage 4 level, in practice it will be extremely difficult to achieve that aim. As the Minister implied, it would in fact be easier to ensure representation on the executive boards.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-08_para8"></a>In that regard, the amendment is not prescriptive: it is essentially concerned to enshrine the principle of wider involvement in board representation. We should not forget that these PCTs are about "joined-up thinking" on healthcare. That joined-up thinking means that we must consider--and include--all those who are concerned with the provision of primary healthcare; namely, dentists, chiropodists, physiotherapists and midwives. There is a principle involved here and it is an important one. Indeed, it is most important that that principle should be written on the face of the Bill so that there is a commitment to broader representation of healthcare deliverers. I beg to move.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I believe that this is the point in our proceedings where mention should be made of a communication from the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy and also of a statement by a whole host of healthcare organisations. They are extremely concerned by a letter which was written by the Minister, Mr. John Denham, to NHS chairmen and chief executives stating that he intends to restrict membership of the primary care trust executive solely to GPs and nurses. They are indeed most worried about that for obvious reasons. I believe that that concern needs to be expressed now.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-08_para9"></a>I am not absolutely sure whether this fits in with the discussion on the amendment now before us, but the communication only came to my attention just before I entered the Chamber. It is always difficult at short notice to consider the amendments while reading the Bill and, thereafter, understand the whole thing. However, it would be helpful if the Minister could say something in that respect which is comforting to all <P>


<a name="column_499"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 499</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those people. They are very important people who are worried that they will not have a say in how such trusts are actually run. Obviously they mind very much about that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-08_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I agree with a great deal of what has already been said, so I shall not repeat any of it. In Committee, the Minister went to some trouble to explain the Government's broad approach to the appointment of the lay element of a primary care trust board. I believe that what she said could be summarised as a wish to ensure flexibility in the representational mix of each board, but also to ensure a balance of representation to reflect the needs and priorities of the local community. Understandably, therefore, the Minister sought to avoid prescriptiveness of any kind. The one element on which she was categoric was the principle of a lay majority.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-08_para10"></a>The only point that I wish to re-emphasise about trust boards is that doctors and healthcare professionals of every kind working for a PCT need to feel a sense of ownership, in however broad a sense, for the organisation in respect of which they are clinically and financially accountable. Even with the comfort of a trust executive with a professional majority, doctors may well feel distanced from the decision-making in a way that--to use a common expression--switches them off. This amendment is helpful in fostering a sense of local ownership, which is why I have put my name to it, but I suggest that the issues here run somewhat deeper.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-08_para11"></a>The first concern is a lack of tightness in the chain of accountability. How in practice will a lay-dominated board exercise the degree of control over doctors that it needs to do if it is to fulfil its responsibilities to the Secretary of State? What incentives are present to ensure that GPs fully accept their own responsibilities? The second concern comes, if you like, from the other direction. Doctors are extremely worried that a non-clinical majority on a level 3 PCT could not only make decisions with which they disagree but are powerless to do anything about but could also initiate and force through a move to level 4. That could see GPs being run by a community trust. There are all kinds of fears associated with that such as a salaried service and so on. I respectfully say to the Minister that if PCT boards are to be lay dominated--I understand why the Government have arrived at that view--there is a need to address the kinds of concerns among GPs that I have referred to. This comes back to the need to instil a sense of corporate feeling and identity in a PCT as much as a sense that the views of doctors carry some weight and are being acted upon at board level.

<A NAME="90315-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rowallan: </B>   My Lords, I, too, support this amendment. I, too, received the letter alluded to by my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour which appears to suggest that 11 associations connected with medicine, representing 130,000 health professionals, are all prepared to boycott PCTs at level 3. This is a rather frightening situation; namely, that there is such a huge backlash to try to stop things happening in this regard <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, it has been helpful to have dealt with the proposals that concern the make-up of primary care trust boards and their governing arrangements in perhaps a little more detail than we did at Committee stage. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, is right; namely, we need to get the balance right and we need to establish a sense of corporate feeling in this area. We need to ensure that the views of doctors and general practitioners who have particular concerns are heard. However, I take the point that the noble Lord, Lord Rowallan, and the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, made; namely, that there are other groups who also have their concerns and their fears in this regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-09_para0"></a>One of my objections to this amendment concerns the term "key partners", because if we suggest that some partners are more key than others we may cause exactly the problems that are being manifested now. However, at the end of the day we have to establish the right governance arrangements. There are obviously a limited number of places on a governing body but I hope that we can provide some reassurance in this regard, particularly to professions supplementary to medicine. We intend to bring forward a government amendment so that primary care trusts, like health authorities, are required to secure appropriate professional advice in carrying out their functions. I shall discuss that in a little more detail in a moment. There will also be significant lay involvement in the running of PCTs.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-09_para1"></a>I hope the House will forgive me if I switch for a moment to PCGs and clarify the analogy that I gave to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, as regards who could be outvoted by whom on a PCG board. Professional members could not be outvoted by lay members on a PCG board because, unlike the PCT, the lay members would not be in a majority. We discussed the views of general practitioners. General practitioner members--especially if they had not exercised their right to be in a majority of professional members--could be outvoted on that board. I suspect that I may have muddied the waters slightly as regards the terms "professional" and "GP". I take this opportunity to put that right.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-09_para2"></a>I return to the governing arrangements of PCTs. As has been pointed out, they will be established under the overall supervision of a lay majority board but with a trust executive where health professionals will be in the majority. We hope here to have struck the right balance. The aim is for professionals to exercise through the executive major influence in shaping service policies and investment plans but within the wider framework of accountability--that has been mentioned--offered by the lay majority on the trust board. We envisage a board of 11 members, comprising the chairman, five lay members, the chief executive, the finance director and three professional members drawn from the executive, of which at least one will be a GP and one a nurse. One of the professionals will be a director of clinical governance. That is obviously essential if we are to establish the clinical governance provisions.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-09_para3"></a>A difficulty has arisen with regard to the professional make-up of the executive varying between level 3 and level 4 PCTs. A level 3 PCT will consist of up to seven GPs, up to two nurses, one professional with public health or health promotion expertise and a social services officer, as well as the PCT chief executive and finance director. A level 4 PCT will consist of up to 10 clinicians as well as the chief executive, the finance director and the social services officer. It may be helpful if I explain why there is different professional membership at levels 3 and 4, as this is an issue that I know is of concern to the professions allied to medicine. There are two reasons. At level 3, the composition of the executive--with GPs allowed a majority--reflects the commissioning-only role of these primary care trusts. We believe that GPs must have a key role in commissioning because of their role as gatekeepers and in committing resources through their referral and prescribing decisions. This unique role is reflected in the make-up of a level 3 executive.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-09_para4"></a>At level 4, however, PCTs are commissioning and providing bodies. The make-up of the executive must balance significant GP representation alongside local nurses and other community and public health professionals. There also needs to be flexibility in the precise balance of professional members. This is because the configuration and range of services that level 4 PCTs will provide may differ from place to place. Therefore we need to allow flexibility for the balance of professional members appropriately to reflect local variations.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-09_para5"></a>I assure the House that the Government recognise the extremely important contribution that a wide range of groups, including secondary care clinicians, the universities, academic medicine and the professions supplementary to medicine could bring to primary care trusts at level 3 as well as level 4. We will expect PCTs to work closely with all the key local stakeholders, including academic interests. This will be particularly important when PCTs commission services from teaching hospitals, to ensure the interests of NHS teaching and research are fully taken into account.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-09_para6"></a>I appreciate from my own discussions with members of professions allied to medicine their deep concern that the expertise at health authority level as regards commissioning services, particularly therapy services, should not be dissipated or lost completely in the move to primary care groups. As I said earlier, it is for that reason that I intend to bring forward a government amendment--I hope in time for Third Reading--so that PCTs, like health authorities, have a duty to make arrangements to secure appropriate professional advice. The House will understand that while we wish to avoid the problem of lists on the face of the Bill, we shall seek to ensure that the amendment is sufficiently wide to cover academic medicine, the acute sector and the professions allied to medicine.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-09_para7"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McColl, who drew attention to this point during the Committee stage. We are currently considering a suitable amendment to Section 12 of the 1977 Act. I hope that in the light of those assurances the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 42, line 37, after ("members") insert (,"provided that not more than half of the membership appointments are vacant,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-09_para9"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, this is a very simple amendment. From time to time, and particularly over the past 18 months, we have seen NHS trusts struggling to cope with board vacancies that remain unfilled, some for quite lengthy periods of time. The question I pose to the House is what will happen if this situation is replicated in primary care trusts? As the Minister said, at the moment the government proposal is for a board comprising 11 members, including the chair. This amendment to paragraph 7 proposes that if six of those positions are for any reason unfilled, the PCT board is automatically inquorate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-09_para10"></a>It is not simply that the business of the trust would otherwise end up being decided upon by too few individuals but that a rump board of five or fewer would not be truly representative of the various interests which the trust is meant to represent. As we know from experience with NHS trust boards where there are vacancies, the additional workload that falls upon the shoulders of the remaining directors--in the case of the PCT it will be members--is unfairly heavy. We should not ask a minority to take on such responsibilities. What I hope from the amendment is that it will act as a spur for the Secretary of State never to allow a PCT to arrive at such a position in the first place. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-09_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I wish most strongly to support this amendment. I have been appalled by the delays in filling the vacancies for non-executive directors on trusts and area health authorities. It has been very unfair to people. There has been no excuse whatever for it. In the instance about which the noble Baroness has heard me speak before, we interviewed 16 people, of whom six were considered immediately appointable. One was appointed months after the vacancy occurred. When I wrote to ask why the second vacancy was not being filled--this is out of five non-executive appointments, so it is a very small number--the answer I received was that they were waiting until they could find someone suitable from an ethnic minority. I do not see why that was necessary when another vacancy was in the pipeline and was due to come up within four months. In the original trawl, ethnic minority members were interviewed but were found unsuitable. Only two were eminently suitable for interview and, at interview, it turned out that they clearly were not suitable. One really thought she was applying for a job and did not understand what a non-executive directorship was; and the other was unsuitable for a different reason altogether. The point I wish to make is that the Government specifically kept that vacancy open for that great length of time for no <P>


<a name="column_503"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 503</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reason whatever when another vacancy was shortly to follow. I think that appointment was made approximately 11 months later.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-09_para11"></a>When I have previously raised this matter with the noble Baroness she has always said, "We are improving. We are getting better at appointing these people". I certainly hope so, because the present position is very unfair, both to the organisation--whatever the organisation is that is active in the health service--and, as my noble friend said, to the remaining members of a board who have to carry the extra burden.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-09_para12"></a>My noble friend is not asking for very much. I said before that a majority is not much to ask for. He is very modest in everything that he asks for and he is being modest again in asking for this provision to apply only when not more than half the positions are vacant. Again he is adopting the same very reasonable tone. I cannot see why the Government would not accept the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-10_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I, too, try to be reasonable. I can perhaps try to be helpful about the substantive issue, although there are some difficulties, as I understand it, with the amendment as drafted. The substantive issue is to ensure that proper and appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the integrity of primary care trust boards and the decisions made by them. There is also another issue of the burden put on the remaining non-executive members, in particular, of boards when there are vacancies. I take seriously the strictures of the noble Baroness in this area and perhaps in a moment I can give her some facts and figures to show that we are making progress and improving.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-10_para0"></a>I wish to deal with the technical problems that I understand could arise if we accepted the amendment as drafted. There may be exceptional, rare occasions where a significant number of the officer or non-officer members resign from a board. I am sure that it would not happen under the chairmanship of the noble Baroness opposite or of any of us who have taken forward those positions. But if it were to occur-- it is not unknown in public life--we would not wish to invalidate the proceedings of the trust for the short period before replacement members were appointed. That is the technical issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-10_para1"></a>On the substantive issue, it is the clear intention of the Secretary of State to make the appointments that fall to him--that is the non-officer appointments--as quickly as a rigorous appointment process allows to avoid leaving primary care trusts to cope with a number of vacancies on their boards, which I fully accept is a very unsatisfactory position. I can understand the concerns, given the problems experienced during the 1997 round of trust non-executive appointments, which are well documented and have been well expressed in your Lordships' House. There were delays in making decisions but, as I said to the noble Baroness, considerable improvements are being made. In 1998 approximately 50 per cent. of those appointed had four weeks' notice of their appointment and 83 per cent. were <P>


<a name="column_504"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 504</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made before the term of the incumbent expired. There were no cases in which the quoracy of a board was compromised by delays in the appointment process.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-10_para2"></a>Having said that, I should acknowledge that too many people are still being given only very short notice of an appointment decision, or perhaps none at all when there has been a delay. We are committed to securing further improvements in the appointment process and to ensuring that delays and the subsequent problems for other members are kept to a minimum. The Secretary of State has explicitly asked officials to look at ways of improving the process in 1999 to ensure that our non-executive directors are treated with the courtesy that their contribution to the NHS demands, including proper notice of appointment decisions. I recognise that I and ministerial colleagues have to play our part in ensuring a speedy process.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-10_para3"></a>I wish to assure the House that we intend to put primary care trusts on the same footing as other NHS bodies as regards arrangements to ensure the proper transaction of business. Although the boards of NHS trusts have been in operation since 1991 without any restriction on the number of vacancies that might exist on their boards at any one time, they have done so within the context of the safeguards written into the NHS Trust (Membership and Procedure) Regulations which ensure that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"no business shall be transacted unless one third of the whole number of directors are present including ... at least one executive director and one non-executive member".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
There is a similar provision in relation to the business of health authorities in the appropriate legislation. The Government would not wish to create an anomaly in relation to the proceedings of primary care trusts. The Bill as drafted allows for regulations to make provisions about the procedure to be followed by trusts in the exercise of their functions. The Government will use those powers to put in place equivalent safeguards in relation to primary care trusts. For those reasons, and in the light of the assurances I have given, I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-10_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister, in particular for her acknowledgement that the issue of vacancies has been a problem in the past and needs to be guarded against in the future. The Minister said nearly all the right things. I accept that the situation is improving. I am particularly reassured that the Government intend to see equivalent safeguards put in place to those that exist in other areas of the health service. I do not wish to press this provision. However, this is an important area for Ministers to bear in mind; that is why I tabled the amendment. I am grateful to those noble Lords who have supported the thrust of the issue. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "90315-10_para6"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, the purpose of this amendment is straightforward: it is to provide a clear and accessible way of publicising the burden of management and administrative costs carried by a primary care trust in the delivery of patient care. Subject to the acceptance of common definitions as to what does or does not constitute a management cost, a statistic in percentage form would enable comparisons to be made between PCTs which in turn could trigger some useful questioning about the factors underlying any differences.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-10_para7"></a>In case noble Lords understand me to be saying that management and administrative costs are "a bad thing" and are therefore to be referred to in terms of disparagement, I need to make one point absolutely clear. The health service needs management. It needs to be properly administered. This is not, therefore, a case of saying that "less" necessarily means "better". That point needs to be made. If the present Government came to office with an idee fixe, it was that bureaucracy in the health service was "a bad thing" and needed reducing.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-10_para8"></a>The elimination of unnecessary bureaucracy is wholly to be desired. However, if one examines management costs across the health service as a whole in relation to the value of services delivered, I believe that that ratio, both now and over the past few years, compares very favourably with other areas of commerce and industry. During the term of office of the previous government, NHS management costs were considerably streamlined, contrary to all the received myths on that subject.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-10_para9"></a>Furthermore, it is a truism that, in any industry, cutting management below a certain level leads inevitably to a deterioration in business performance. To do so in the NHS would equally result in its being unable to sustain the delivery of services. Where that level lies is a matter of judgment; however, I suggest that there is not now a great deal of scope to alter the level downwards.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-10_para10"></a>However, the messages that we are receiving from the Government are rather different. They are fond of repeating that their reforms--and not merely from the abolition of fundholding--will lead to a substantial saving in the cost of administering the NHS, amounting to &#163;1 billion over the course of this Parliament. That is quite a claim and it needs testing. Yes, the abolition of fundholding will reduce the number of commissioning bodies, with a consequent reduction in the numbers and costs of transactions handled by NHS trusts. Yes, moving across to three-year contracts, which is a perfectly sensible move, will save additional administration.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-10_para11"></a>However, we need to look at what else is happening. In the regional offices there is now a huge workload arising from the Government's reform programme. What is the cost of that at health authority level? Will the Minister say whether management costs are rising or decreasing? What are the costs of administering primary care groups? In PCGs, we are seeing a huge disparity in management costs as between one PCG and another--anything from &#163;2.20 to &#163;6 per head of population. I confess that I do not understand why that <P>


<a name="column_506"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 506</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be. However, it implies quite strongly that some PCGs will be struggling to deliver what is required of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-10_para12"></a>I realise that my remarks go somewhat wider than the terms of the amendment, which relates strictly to PCTs. But we need from the Government more than simply generalised statements about anticipated savings in management and administration costs within the NHS. First, we need hard figures. Secondly, we need mechanisms such as the amendment proposes by which to make meaningful comparisons between different bodies within the health service. At present, it is hard to get a handle on what is happening to costs. That cannot be satisfactory for anyone, least of all the Government. I beg to move.

The Government keep telling us that they wish more money to be spent on health and education, and that means on the things that matter, not merely frittering it away on unnecessary administration. If this amendment, or a similar provision, were to be accepted, the Government's purpose would be achieved. I therefore hope that the noble Baroness will welcome this provision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-10_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I wish to speak to Amendment No. 11, which is grouped with this amendment. Whereas Amendment No. 10 relates to the details to be included in the annual reports of primary care trusts and, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, explained, details of administrative costs, Amendment No. 11 relates to the need to give wide publicity to that report.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-10_para13"></a> Paragraph 17 of Schedule 1, to which this amendment relates, states that the Secretary of State,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may provide that any Primary Care Trust shall take such steps as may be specified in the regulations to publicise... the trust's audited accounts ...[and] the trust's annual reports", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
and that any report on the trust's accounts is to be made by an auditor on a matter of public interest. The provision also relates to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any other document as may be prescribed". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The purpose of this amendment is to strengthen that requirement so that primary care trusts are in all cases required to take steps to publicise those documents. The amendment would achieve that aim.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-10_para14"></a>As is well known, we on the Liberal Democrat Benches support the principles of open government. We therefore believe that information about the work of primary care trusts should be made readily available to members of the public and interested organisations in a form that is clear, accessible and easy to read and understand. We support the requirements in Schedule 1 that each primary care trust should prepare an annual report on its activities during the previous financial year and that the report is to be sent to the relevant health authority and the Secretary of State. However, as the amendment makes clear, we believe that there should be a clear obligation on the trusts to give wide publicity to such documents.

<P>

<A NAME = "90315-10_para16"></a>Patients, local communities, community health councils, staff and professional organisations, as well as the wider public, all have a right to know about the activities of their local primary care trusts and to be able to satisfy themselves that trusts are behaving in a financially responsible way. Primary care trusts should be required to make the information available in a way which is affordable and accessible, including placing it in local libraries.

<P>
<A NAME="90315-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support Amendment No. 10, moved by my noble friend Lord Howe. It is important to be able to see what money is spent on administration. I believe that this matter has been hyped up artificially. When the present Government were elected, they spent all their time talking about the waste of money on bureaucracy in the health service. My own experience, as chairman of a major trust, was that the administration was extremely hard-worked, very good value for money and that no big business enterprise could have hoped to have achieved, with the same amount of money, what was achieved by the administrators in that trust. The matter has been turned into a political football, which is a great pity. Administrators within the health service are not a separate class of people; they are the people who have been asked to carry out necessary and unenviable tasks, without whose efficiency and commitment the health service could not be run. Nothing has changed on the ground. The same people are all in their places, doing the same jobs; but now they are all in partnership and the terminology is different. It is important that these figures should be available.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para0"></a>I agree with the point made by my noble friend that, unless there is a basis for comparing like with like, there is no way of knowing the true position. With the national institute for clinical excellence we shall be able to see clinical standards that are parallel. We need to be able to see financial standards that are parallel, too.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para1"></a>In a different capacity, I am involved in an NGO which helps children in the third world. I notice that in their annual accounts NGOs include various categories under different headings, and comparing one with another is extremely difficult. If one NGO has an overhead of 10 per cent. and another an overhead of 90 per cent., often a totally false basis has been used for assessing that. My own NGO is very strict with regard to percentages, but, for example, we have noticed that other NGOs include all kinds of things under the heading of education, such as perhaps paying for a person to go in a taxi to deliver papers to someone who is to be educated.

<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para2"></a>It is extremely complicated to achieve a common basis on which to assess costs. However, it is worth doing, and not just in the case of primary care trusts, but throughout the health service. It would enable us to know where we were getting value for money. Within the health service it is not just a matter of cost, which I know is very important; it is also a question of value for money. If something looks cheap but is not satisfactory, there is nothing cheap about it. We want to be sure that we are getting good care for patients in this country and that whatever we spend is well spent. That could be done by showing the proportion spent on administration.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para3"></a>When one asks them a question, this Government, like all governments, say that they cannot give an answer. I have had that experience repeatedly over many years when I have asked dental questions: "No, we cannot give you the answer". Yet there is a vast enterprise, which is completely computerised, which decides on the type of filling that everyone has. I am a member of the Parliamentary Information Technology Committee. That committee would tell you that it should be possible to press a button on the computer and see exactly what is spent on every different aspect of dentistry. But, no; we have always had the answer that the information is not available. The amendment, if passed, would mean that the information would have to become available, and I strongly support it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para4"></a>I read in the newspaper that the Secretary of State wishes to appoint the chief executives in the National Health Service. I believe that that is like expecting a major company to allow the Government to appoint its chief executive. It is a very worrying matter. It is one thing to appoint the non-executive members, but I believe there is cause for concern if the Secretary of State wants to take on the appointment of chief executives in the National Health Service, whether it be of one of these trusts or of any other type of trust or authority. I hope that the Minister can give us an assurance that that will not be the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, it is inevitable that, like the Minister's arguments sometimes, in any large organisation subsets of the organisation will come under the heading of "the good, the bad and the ugly". I believe it is vital that these details should be publicised, whether they relate to my noble friend's charity, part of the health service, secondary schools, primary schools or, indeed, clinical excellence. It should not only be possible for the sum to be compared--in other words, by the Government and possibly Parliament--but, much more importantly, for local people to be able to compare and to know that what is done in Blackpool is better or worse than what is done in Blackburn, or wherever.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para5"></a>Governments tend to be rather frightened about the amount of income spent on this or that service. It may well be that a good trust spends more on administration and that that is why it is good. Equally, it may be that a good trust, in specific instances, spends rather little on administration. There is no reason to hide that <P>


<a name="column_509"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 509</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information in either of those cases because it is germane to the public's understanding of what their trust is doing for them. That is what the Bill is all about.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-11_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, the Government should not underestimate the interest that the public takes in how much is spent on administration and what the reason for it is. The noble Baroness probably knows that increasingly local government councils, which have by law to circulate a leaflet to their council-tax payers explaining how the council tax is made up, give descriptions of what is spent on administration and why because they know how great the interest is. I believe that most people are sensible enough, as my noble friends pointed out, to know that sometimes a bit more spent on administration can result in a better service and better value for money within a given sum. They understand that, but they need to know the figures and to be able to compare them with those for other like bodies.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para6"></a>The health service is thought of by the public as being somewhat amorphous and difficult to understand, and they do not know where the money goes. I believe that the provision in the amendment would help the public to find the health service user-friendly and that they would understand much better than some of us might suppose, on the face of it, why sufficient money has to be spent on administration. Some of them know the administrators, whether they think they are good or bad, and so on. The better people are educated on this matter, the better regard they will have for the management of their local health service.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Laming: </B>   My Lords, we should recognise the helpful point made earlier about NGOs. There is no point having figures for expenditure on administration without definitions of what is included in "administration". We cannot compare like with like unless we record like with like. Recording like with like across primary care trusts and a range of activities requires a sophisticated accounting and recording system. Of course it would be helpful to have information of this kind, but we should not be under the illusion that it can be achieved at the press of a button. It will require a substantial amount of investment and time to assemble information across the country which can be useful in the way in which your Lordships have asked for it. If that is to happen, we must acknowledge the infrastructure required to achieve it.

<A NAME="90315-11_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, who had a distinguished career throughout social services and in government. When the last Government established the total purchasing pilot schemes--the nearest thing to primary care groups--that was, an academic said to me the other day, about the only sensible thing they did. They monitored those schemes carefully, set the baselines and could see how costly they were. Interestingly, research has shown that they are more expensive than GP fundholding and general practice in its generality.

<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para7"></a>The Government are setting out on a new road of innovation. Some of us do not agree with the whole approach but clearly the Government are intent on that route, so we are determined to make it work. However, we need to know the cost. I support those of my noble friends who said that the cost should be transparent. The Government have put on record on many occasions their wish for transparency and in this case, they should prove that is so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-11_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to those noble Lords and Baronesses who contributed and hope that I can be reassuring on both strands of the argument. There has been debate about transparency, comparability of costs, and the need for effective management, which I do not challenge for a moment--but I will speak about the difference between bureaucracy and of the importance of removing systems that create unnecessary administrative work that adds no value to the services provided. It is crucial to make that distinction.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para8"></a>We are completely sympathetic to the suggestion that primary care trusts should include details of the proportion of income spent on management costs in reports to their health authorities and to the Secretary of State. However, we do not believe that Amendment No. 10 in necessary. Primary care trusts will be required to keep and publish accounts in a form directed by the Secretary of State. Under Section 98 of the National Health Service Act 1977, the Secretary of State directs health authorities and NHS trusts to present their accounts in a form set out each year in the manual for accounts. They will show management costs--income spent on administration, to use the words of the noble Earl, Lord Howe--as a separate item. The accounts will show also details of the PCT's income and it will be easy to work out the proportion of income spent on management costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para9"></a>Paragraph 16(2) of Schedule 1 states that the report prepared by a PCT at the end of each financial year--that is, its annual report--shall give details of the measures the trust has taken to promote economy, efficiency and effectiveness in using its resources. Crude demarcations between the amount spent or not spent are an insufficient reflection of whether money has been well and usefully spent. That is why economy, efficiency and effectiveness are useful. Those details will embrace administrative or management costs and that is certainly one of the areas at which we shall be looking.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para10"></a>Further scrutiny of expenditure on management costs will be provided by the Audit Commission--which, as the noble Lord, Lord Laming, pointed out acknowledges the importance of the comparability of data. We do not add much light to the argument if we try to compare apples with pears. I accept the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, about ensuring from the beginning that systems are in place to monitor expenditure. As to her comment about the total purchasing pilots, they had higher management costs than fundholding but covered the full range of commissioning or purchasing activity, whereas fundholding only covered 20 per cent. or so. The <P>


<a name="column_511"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 511</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>findings are entirely consistent with the Government's approach to funded care groups--that management budgets should be linked with the responsibilities that go with them.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para11"></a>In Committee, when we considered a proposal similar to Amendment No. 11, I undertook to give the matter further consideration. I can report that we will seek to bring forward an appropriate amendment, I hope on Third Reading, that will have the effect of placing on PCTs an express duty to publicise the specified accounts and reports in accordance with requirements set out in regulations. That will make the duty on PCTs more specific, in line with the proposed amendments, but will retain the Secretary of State's discretion to make regulations setting out, for example, when the accounts and reports must be published, any other requirements, and whether the list of documents that must be publicised should be extended to those other than accounts, annual reports and auditors reports on matters of public interest. That arrangement will have the added benefit of retaining flexibility, to cater for future changes in circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para12"></a>Many statutory schemes contain powers rather than duties to make regulations. That is true even when the failure to do so would render the scheme inoperable. There are a number of instances in the Bill where the word "may" is used but where there is a clear intention that such regulations will be made. It would not be appropriate to review every such instance where the word "may" rather than "must" is used. I hope that the noble Baroness accepts my assurance that we intend to impose an express duty on PCTs on the face of the Bill to publicise their reports and accounts. On that basis, I hope that she feels able to withdraw her amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para13"></a>As to management costs and our commitment to ensure that &#163;1 billion that would otherwise have been spent on bureaucracy is freed up for patient care, I was asked for hard facts. In Committee, I reiterated that we are looking to add to that target as well as improve the target reduction set in May 1997 of &#163;84 million in health authority, NHS trust and GP fundholder management costs, together with further reductions of &#163;73 million in 1998-99, which we announced last December.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para14"></a>Cumulative savings to date are already about &#163;250 million. Primary care trust management costs are expected to be contained from the replacement of the internal market, GP fundholding and related measures. Together with PCGs, they will bring a more rational approach to the commissioning services and, across Great Britain, the number of commissioning bodies will be cut from more than 4,000 to 600. PCTs in particular will enable savings in management costs through the merger of functions between PCGs and community trusts and by more cost-effective use of staff, a greater skill mix and sharing of skills, and resources across primary and community healthcare. As I said earlier, there is no way that I would wish to denigrate the contribution made by managers within the NHS as part of the team that provides high-quality healthcare. Money that is spent on effective management to ensure that that takes place is money well spent.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para15"></a>To deal with the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, about the appointment of chief executives, the Government attach great importance to developing and supporting a strong cadre of highly trained managers. We have already strengthened appointment procedures by arranging for NHS executive regional directors to act as the external assessors for such appointments. This new approach will need arrangements and methodology that are being developed. It is right that the Secretary of State should have an interest in ensuring that there are high quality managers available to the NHS, which is a public service, but I can assure the noble Baroness that these new plans will fall strictly within the Nolan Committee rules. In no way are they concerned with politicising the appointments process, and the appointments will themselves be made by NHS chairs and boards. I hope that the noble Baroness finds that reassuring.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-11_para16"></a>I hope that I have also reassured the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that the Government recognise that a high proportion of NHS costs should not be spent on management. One of the great successes of the National Health Service is that it is much cheaper to administer than systems based on private insurance or private healthcare. That is one of the reasons why we manage to provide a high quality, effective service at lower cost than in other countries. For that reason we are determined to safeguard that publicly taxed-based system. In so doing we recognise the role of effective management and the payment of appropriate amounts of money to reflect that management. We do not want to spend money on the unnecessary and bureaucratic paperchase that was a feature of previous arrangements in the NHS with all those different commissioning bodies. In particular, teaching hospitals had to deal with contracts involving hundreds of individual commissioners and bill them which meant a paperchase around the National Health Service. That added nothing to patient care but took money out of it. Based on the assurances I have given as to what is already in the Bill and what we intend to put in it, I hope the House will feel that the Government are safeguarding the transparency of the costs of administration and management within primary care trusts.

<P>
<A NAME="90315-12_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, this has been a useful debate. I am very grateful to the Minister for her helpful and thoughtful comments. I agree with the noble Baroness that a distinction must be made between management costs and bureaucracy. But if there is a disagreement between us at the margin it is whether the savings of paper to which she referred will result in overall savings to the NHS at the end of the day once the Government's reforms have been put into practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para0"></a>I am a little disappointed not to have had from the noble Baroness a fuller picture of what is going on currently on the ground at regional offices, health authorities, primary care groups and so forth in that the bill for administration appears to be growing quite alarmingly, if anecdotal evidence is to be believed. The estimates that I have seen for the costs of administering the PCG/PCT structure range from &#163;150 million to over &#163;300 million a year excluding start-up costs. That is <P>


<a name="column_513"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 513</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>much greater than the cost of fundholding. I do not believe that that should come as any surprise. Any system that seeks to control the commissioning functions and budgets of every single GP, to control the co-ordination of many different bodies and agencies, including local authorities, and engage in almost continuous consultation with local interest groups is bound to result in a considerable burden of management and administration.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para1"></a>As to the amendment, I never sought to suggest that there was always direct comparability between one NHS body and another. Clearly, that would be an absurd suggestion. However, the kind of statistic that I propose in the amendment is, I believe, useful as an initial standard of comparison not only for internal management purposes but also to inform the general public. I shall read carefully the words of the Minister, but in the meantime I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 2, line 38, at end insert (", including an identified minimum sum to meet the need for investment in primary care").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para5"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, when primary care groups were first proposed 16 months ago one of the main concerns of GPs was the need to protect current levels of investment in primary care. The establishment of unified budgets for PCGs meant that GMS funds to pay for staff, premises and computers in GP practices were in danger of being squeezed by the other elements of the unified budget--namely, secondary care and prescribing--the direct consequences of which would be a fall in investment in primary care infrastructure.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para6"></a>Secondary care and prescribing are both areas in which costs have the potential to spiral upwards. The unified budgetary structure allows for a measure of flexibility in the way that funds are utilised. But the concern of the General Practitioners' Committee was that the unified budget could be put under enormous strain. That led directly to an agreement with the Government in the middle of the previous year that within the unified budget allocated to PCGs a specified level of funding would continue to be available for general practice infrastructure. That minimum level of funding is equivalent to the present levels of expenditure from the money that health authorities allocate for general medical services with an allowance for inflation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para7"></a>Amendment No. 12 is intended to address exactly the same issue in the context of primary care trusts. The quality of frontline services should be protected. Without the proper level of investment in staff, premises and computers within GP practices the standards of primary care will suffer. These are not minor concerns. The investment in the practice infrastructure can represent up to 30 per cent. of the income of a GP practice. Therefore, the issue facing GPs is one that will weigh heavily with them as they consider any proposal <P>


<a name="column_514"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 514</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to progress from PCG to PCT status. They will look ahead and see a PCT board that is controlled by lay members who have been appointed by the Secretary of State. It will be that board, not the executive below it--certainly not the GPs themselves--that determines how the unified budget is spent. The board will take advice from the executive, which we understand will have a professional majority on it, but need not accept that advice.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para8"></a>I should like to put some questions to the Minister. First, to what extent is it intended that there should be mechanisms to safeguard the investment in infrastructure in GP practices? Secondly, does the noble Baroness agree that that infrastructure is of key importance in the delivery of a quality agenda? Thirdly, does the Minister also agree that the views of local medical committees should play a major part in informing primary care trusts as to what levels of investment are needed, as indeed they do under present arrangements? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-12_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, we have general sympathy with this amendment. These days one hears a great deal about investment in the infrastructure of hospitals and the importance of it. The current level of investment in GP practices is quite a small proportion of the total expenditure in that area of medicine. I look forward with interest to the comments of the Minister in response to the noble Earl, Lord Howe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-12_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Earl, Lord Howe, for raising the matters addressed by Amendment No. 12. We are fully aware of the significance of these matters to GPs and to other members of the primary care team. The Government, too, place great significance on securing appropriate investment in developing primary care.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para9"></a>That is why the modernisation fund includes &#163;82 million specifically for investment in GP practices in the coming year, 1999-2000. It is also reflected in the guarantees, to which the noble Earl, Lord Howe, also referred, which the honourable Member, the then Minister of State for Health, gave in his letter of 17th June last to Dr. John Chisholm, chair of the BMA General Practice Committee, on the minimum levels of investment in GP practice infrastructure to be delivered by health authorities and primary care groups.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para10"></a>Those guarantees have subsequently been confirmed in the guidance to health authorities and primary care groups on allocations for 1999-2000. The guarantees go further than any previous ones in ensuring that the investment in GP practice infrastructure will increase year on year. In practice we expect that most primary care groups and primary care trusts will want to invest above that floor. But the floors provide a guarantee for GPs and their teams in areas where, for whatever reason, the investment priorities of the local health community, and in particular of the primary care group and health authority, lie elsewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para11"></a>I hope that it will be helpful to the House to say in response to the amendment that I can confirm that in their plans for primary care investment, primary care <P>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 515</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>trust expenditure will be subject to the same government commitment in maintaining the level of spending on GMS infrastructure that covers primary care group expenditure. That guarantee will be secured in the same way as that which now applies to primary care groups; that is, reliance on the Section 97 powers, as extended by Clause 3. We shall also be publicising this commitment in a further paper about primary care trusts which we are planning for publication next month. In response to the specific question about LMCs, primary care trusts will have the same relationship with LMCs as health authorities now do in any decisions they take over GMS matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para12"></a>Given that assurance and confirmation of our intention to maintain the level of expenditure on infrastructure within primary care trusts, I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="90315-12_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, before the Minister sits down perhaps I may ask the noble Baroness a question to which I shall be grateful if she can find out the answer. It will save putting down another amendment relating to Part II of the Bill about Scotland. There is much concern among GPs about the squeezing out of expenditure on infrastructure in Scotland. Will the answer the noble Baroness has just given be replicated in Scotland? Will the Government make sure that those amounts are reasonably protected? That would be of great comfort to general practitioners in Scotland.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I announced during the earlier debate in Committee on Clause 3 of the Bill that we would be bringing forward a government amendment to refine the definition of the prescribing costs that will be included in health authorities' and primary care trusts' unified budgets. That is the main purpose of these amendments. The main feature of the amendments is a new schedule to the 1977 Act defining health authorities, and primary care trusts' "main expenditure" (which is cash-limited) and their "general Part II expenditure" (which is demand-led).
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para15"></a>Before I address the amendments in any detail I should offer your Lordships some background. I know that it is an area of interest to the House. Unified <P>


<a name="column_516"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 516</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>budgets--which we announced in the White Paper, The new NHS--will create for the first time a single financial envelope covering the commissioning of hospital and community health services; primary care prescribing; and investment in general practice infrastructure--the issue which we have been addressing. This is essential to achieve our objective of aligning clinical and financial responsibility: offering those closest to patients the maximum scope to deploy NHS resources in ways that best meet patient needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para16"></a>In the past, distinctions between these funding streams have made it difficult for local clinicians to make changes that they know would be beneficial. They could see ways of saving in one area of activity to support much needed improvements elsewhere but did not have the power to move resources around to achieve that. As local needs or clinical practice changed, it was difficult to adjust patterns of expenditure.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para17"></a>We want a system that is more responsive. Moving to unified budgets will give health authorities and, after this Bill is enacted, primary care trusts greater flexibility in deciding the most appropriate balance between these three areas of expenditure. This will enable health authorities, primary care groups and trusts to decide relative priorities between and within the three areas of activity and match the resources to those priorities without the artificial barriers imposed by the present separation between the different funding streams.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para18"></a>The unified budget itself does not depend on the Bill. Two elements of the unified budget--hospital and community health services, and GP practice infrastructure--are already part of health authorities' cash-limited budgets. But these are managed separately and divided by a statutory ring fence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para19"></a>The third element, prescribing costs, can be brought within the unified budget using existing powers in Section 97 of the 1977 Act. Those powers allow expenses incurred by family health services practitioners--that is, GPs, dentists, pharmacists or optometrists--to be designated as part of health authorities' cash-limited main expenditure.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para20"></a>Indeed, in effect prescribing costs were partially brought within wider cash limits by the previous administration through the fundholding scheme. It is right to acknowledge that one of the important lessons we can learn from fundholding is that when offered the opportunity to handle a budget which brought together prescribing with an element of hospital and community services expenditure and funding for practice staff, many fundholders were indeed able to find efficient and effective ways of providing services for their patients.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para21"></a>Of course the fundholding scheme also had important limitations. It left artificial barriers between emergency care and other services, for example. And it only ever covered around half the country. But over the past year it has been interesting to see the GP commissioning group pilot schemes managing budgets effectively on a larger group basis--some of a similar size to primary care groups. The 1998 report of the University of Birmingham Independent Health Service's Management Centre on GP commissioning groups found that the groups sought continuously to improve their prescribing <P>


<a name="column_517"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 517</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and promote high standards of care. They took their responsibilities seriously and adopted a range of tactics in order to monitor and develop individual, practice and group prescribing practice, including development of formularies, setting up prescribing groups, open sharing of prescribing data and use of incentive schemes. Most used professional pharmaceutical advice for management and peer review purposes--it is another example of where other professionals such as pharmacists need to be involved--and nurses were also employed as advisers. Quality was addressed, as well as cost issues, including the importance of developing a peer review culture; and over a quarter of the pilot sites projected underspends on their prescribing budget--which I think is interesting.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para22"></a>Our new approach will for the first time bring all hospital and community services within a unified budget and will extend the flexibilities and freedoms of unified budgets to the whole country. This means--and let me be up front about this--that we will for the first time bring all prescribing expenditure within a unified cash limit. Equally, we are not putting a cash limit around prescribing expenditure itself. We are bringing that prescribing expenditure, &#163;4.4 billion in England, within a wider unified budget of some &#163;24 billion in England. Many GPs already have experience of working with this kind of approach, and hospital prescribing has always been managed as part of a wider overall cash limit.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para23"></a>Let me turn now from the overall policy context to the purpose of the amendments before us. It is critical that the new arrangements should operate in a fair and equitable way. The amendments are addressed to this, and are designed to ensure that we apply the principle of aligning clinical and financial responsibility as accurately as possible at local level.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para24"></a>As I have explained, Section 97 as it stands does already allow us to create the unified budgets that we are putting in place from April 1999 for health authorities and primary care groups. But in practice the framework which the existing Section 97 provides does not enable us to align clinical and financial responsibilities as accurately or equitably as is desirable. The main reason for this is that, under the existing powers, we would be bringing within a health authority's cash-limited budget the cost of drugs dispensed in its area, rather than the drugs prescribed by GPs and other practitioners in that area. In other words, we should be asking the GPs in a PCG to take responsibility not for expenditure on the drugs they had prescribed for their patients but on the prescriptions presented at chemists within the area of their PCG.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para25"></a>In some health authorities there is a significant mismatch between the two. Up to around 25 per cent. by value of the drugs dispensed in some authorities are prescribed elsewhere, and up to around 15 per cent. of the drugs prescribed by some authorities' practitioners are dispensed elsewhere. At primary care group level the discrepancies could well be more marked.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para26"></a>The amendments address this issue by allowing the Secretary of State to apportion payments for drugs among health authorities to take account of <P>


<a name="column_518"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 518</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cross-boundary prescribing and dispensing. They allow health authorities to make comparable arrangements for primary care trusts.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para27"></a>To put it another way, and I hope more simply, these amendments will refine the definition of prescribing costs so as to enable those costs to be charged to the health authority or primary care trust where the prescription was written rather than where it was dispensed. We need to achieve this because the crucial decision is that of the GP or nurse on whether to prescribe for a particular patient and, if so, which drug. The patient's decision on where to get the prescription dispensed should be of lesser significance to the arrangements for attributing prescribing costs. These amendments will deliver that objective. They will also enable the apportionment process to be used to average out those elements of drug costs that are outside the influence of the person doing the prescribing, for instance, the amount deducted from pharmacists' reimbursement to reflect average discounts. This will be more equitable for health authorities and primary care trusts, again ensuring our principle of aligning clinical and financial responsibility is implemented as fully as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para28"></a>These practical arrangements for attributing drug costs will build on the well-established systems which are familiar to health authorities and currently operate for tracking spend against GP fundholders' budgets or against non-fundholders' indicative prescribing budgets. What will change, by virtue of these amendments, is that these refined attributions can be used as the basis for determining what prescribing expenditure counts against a health authority or primary care trust's unified budget. In other words, we will be aligning those responsibilities at practice and health authority or primary care trust levels.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-12_para29"></a>I apologise to the House for the fact that the resultant amendments are lengthy and technically complex. They have to be so because they amend Section 97 of the 1977 Act, which is in itself a complex piece of legislation. They are also complex because they are designed to provide for an equitable charging system which can be operated by adapting the existing well-established NHS systems for remunerating dispensing contractors. Despite this legal complexity, the purpose of the amendments is straightforward. They are designed to deliver the fair and accurate charging of prescribing costs to health authorities' and primary care trusts' unified budgets. I commend the amendments to the House. I beg to move.

<A NAME="90315-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, I shall try to be constructive rather than critical in what I have to say. We appreciate the efforts that the noble Baroness has made to explain the Government's intentions, but we are in a rather unusual position on this Bill. At least a third of it consists of amending previous Acts of Parliament. Indeed, Clauses 3 to 10 inclusive are confined to amending the Acts of 1977 and 1990. The 10 pages of Schedule 4 comprise a mass of amendments to previous legislation.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para0"></a>Of the three amendments moved by the noble Baroness we are mainly concerned with Amendment No. 15. It adds a new clause, adding a new schedule to the 1977 Act. This is rather unusual. Rather than adding a new clause, it would have been more usual, tidier and more logical, to have a new schedule to the Bill. I have studied the content quite closely. It deals with detailed guidance as to the way in which expenditure shall be handled: the sort of thing which is very often put into a schedule. I hope that we shall have early consolidation after this Bill becomes law, because those splendid people with the professional duty and administrative ability will have a terrible time trying to establish across the statute book exactly what the law is. If one looks at the amendments in Schedule 4, it will require tremendous documentary effort on their part to find out their responsibilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para1"></a>I do not say that there is much that the noble Baroness herself can do about this. My main point, however, is to implore those concerned within the Government to give high priority to consolidating all this legislation on health before great confusion sets in.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-13_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, what was said by my noble friend Lord Renton is even more true of Part II of the Bill. I have attempted, with very much less expertise than he has, to ask whether the Government would consider the same matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para2"></a>I turn to the question of how prescriptions will be charged and the part they will play in the unified budget. The Minister has already kindly agreed to find out about the replication in Part II of the Bill in connection with the arrangements she spoke of last time. Could I ask her also to add what she has just said about prescribing and how those arrangements will be made, because that is part of the problem which I tried to enunciate?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, as the Minister said, the amendments tabled in her name are exceptionally complex, particularly the one relating to Schedule 12A, proposed as an amendment to the 1977 Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para3"></a>Drug budgets in the NHS have always been cost-limited to an extent. Is the intended purpose of these amendments to make prescribing across the country more even, ruling out, one hopes, the issue of post-code prescribing, which has been referred to on a number of occasions when this Bill has been debated in your Lordships' House?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para4"></a>We have seen the establishment of the national institute for clinical excellence, inexorable rising costs of technical and pharmaceutical developments and the introduction of expensive new drugs. After due inquiry, NICE may indicate that within the NHS a particular form of treatment is the most right and cost-effective for a particular condition. Might not the drugs budget then be adjusted to take account of its recommendations? The director of NICE has said that in making recommendations the institute will take account of cost-effectiveness. However, it is likely that drugs such as beta-interferon, the other interferons for multiple <P>


<a name="column_520"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 520</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sclerosis, Donepezil and other drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's, and many more, will put an increasing burden on the NHS and its prescribing budget. Does the Minister believe that the amendments she has introduced today will help to deal with such problems?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-13_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for her thorough explanation of the amendments. I am also personally grateful to her for taking the time to brief me about them last week with her officials. I understand that a principal purpose of the amendments is to direct the costs of prescribing to the place where they should properly fall; that is, to the point at which the prescribing rather than the dispensing is done. I entirely understand why that should be thought desirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para5"></a>However, I find one point in Amendment No. 15 somewhat obscure. In paragraph 3(4)(b) of the new Schedule 12A the Secretary of State is granted power to exercise his discretion in apportioning funds,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"by reference to averaged or estimated amounts". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I see the sense in allowing for estimated amounts of expenditure, but what is the significance of "averaged"? In what circumstances might the Secretary of State be minded to apportion funds relating to the cost of drugs in a way which averaged out any likely differences between health authorities, or is reference being made to some other kind of averaging?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for her careful explanation of the amendments and for the opportunity she gave us last week of discussing them before they were tabled.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para6"></a>We on these Benches have considerable sympathy with the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant. In Committee we tabled an amendment which probed cash limits and the drugs budget and the Minister gave a clear and firm assurance, as she has done today, that there was no intention to cash limit drug prescribing budgets at GP level. However, there are dangers in the unified budgets being held at PCT level when there is overspending.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para7"></a>The Minister mentioned the temporary financial assistance which would be available if unified prescribing budgets were overspent, and that provides some assurance. However, we believe that if NICE, which will set standards for prescribing, regards particular drugs as being important and necessary as an effective form of treatment, making GPs bound to prescribe them, there is a great danger that the overall unified budget will not be sufficient. Will not either temporary or permanent financial assistance at that unified level need examining?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para8"></a>We accept, however, that these amendments do not alter the principles involved and the moves towards indicative and unified budgets. We also accept that there is considerable logic in being able to pinpoint with greater accuracy who is responsible for the prescription of the drugs. Therefore, that amendment does not give us cause for concern, unlike the overall framework in which it would be placed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para9"></a>Furthermore, I have sympathy with the view expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Renton. These are perhaps plangent amendments in terms of their clarity, <P>


<a name="column_521"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 521</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and early consolidation of the Bill is important. Representations have been made to me for a memorandum explaining the amendment in greater detail prior to any consolidation. Perhaps the explanation which the Minister has given today will be extremely helpful, but there is concern about people's ability to understand the new legislation. I described our previous canter through unified budgets as being a financial seminar. Today we have had the second round of that financial seminar and I am grateful to the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-13_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have contributed to the debate, not least the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. It is the first time I have ever heard the word "plangent" used in normal discourse--if a debate in your Lordships' House can be described as normal discourse.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para10"></a>I shall deal first with some of the technical issues. When dealing with the three components of the unified budget, I gave as the total sum &#163;24 billion, but I should have said &#163;28 billion.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para11"></a>In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, I point out that at a later stage my noble friend Lord Macdonald of Tradeston expects to bring forward a similar amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para12"></a>As regards the inclusion of the words "averaged" and "estimated", the key adjustments we wish to make take account of cross-boundary prescribing but other adjustments will allow prescribing costs to be more accurately and equitably attributed to health authorities. They build on well-established systems for measuring spend against GP fundholders' budgets and against indicative budgets.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para13"></a>Averaging is perhaps most relevant where payments to pharmacists are made. They take into account the level of discounts which is assumed to obtain on the purchase of drugs. The larger their volume of NHS dispensing, the larger the assumed discount. The level of that discount deduction has nothing to do with the prescribing decision as such, so it is fairer to average out that discounting element in the recharging costs to health authorities. I hope that that clarifies the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, spoke of an over-commitment on unified budgets. In the first instance, it will be for health authorities, as now, and primary care trusts to manage the risks across the whole of the unified budget; in other words, by balancing over-commitments in one part by reducing spending elsewhere. But health authorities will assist primary care trusts in that task by, for example, helping them to pool financial risks.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para15"></a>As in the current system, an over-commitment may sometimes be unavoidable. There are well-established in-year mechanisms for dealing with over-commitments. For example, a health authority or primary care trust could have its cash-limited budget increased to cover potential overspend by transferring resources from an under-spending health authority or primary care trust elsewhere. That is the well-established brokerage system.

<A NAME = "90315-13_para16"></a>I am not sure what I can say to the noble Lord, Lord Renton. I feel as much a prisoner of the complexity of the legislation as any other Member of your Lordships' House. I certainly recognise the difficulties to which he and other noble Lords referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-13_para17"></a>As regards the issue of the new clause or schedule, I must deny all responsibility, if that is not inappropriate behaviour at the Dispatch Box. In dealing with those technical drafting issues, one depends on the advice of parliamentary draftsmen. It was chosen as the preferred method of dealing with the issue but it is obviously not the preferred method of the noble Lord, Lord Renton.

<P>
<A NAME="90315-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, I hope that the noble Baroness will realise that parliamentary draftsmen are there to serve and not to direct. I hope that she will bear in mind what I said about the need for consolidation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-14_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I shall certainly do that. I shall go on my assertiveness training course for dealing with parliamentary draftsmen as soon as the Bill has passed through your Lordships' House!
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para0"></a>Serious issues were raised in relation to the memorandum. Revised explanatory notes will be published to cover those new provisions on the introduction of the Bill in another place. A further revised version will be published after that, on enactment of the Bill. However, I recognise that that goes only so far and does not deal with the major consolidation issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para1"></a>I deal now with the major substantive issue which has been raised on the effect of bringing together the prescribing budgets in primary care. Perhaps I may offer some reassurance to the noble Lord, Lord Walton. We believe that allowing maximum flexibility for local clinicians to identify and take the steps which will produce the best results for patients from all the resources available in the unified budget, free of artificial and distorting boundaries between different types of expenditure, is an important driver towards the high quality prescribing which I am sure we all wish to see.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para2"></a>The main issue is in relation to outputs rather than inputs from prescribing. We can all recognise that spending large amounts of money on prescribing is not necessarily a guarantee of high quality in that prescribing. As I made clear, the unified budget will not place a cash limit on any area of GP activity as such, whether it is prescribing or referrals. The cash limits will apply at the health authority or PCT level and not to individual practices and GPs.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para3"></a>The point has been made about NICE. If it functions as we hope it will do so that clinically-effective treatments are more widely available sooner, we must recognise the need to provide a system which also delivers on rigorous and cost-effective prescribing in other areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para4"></a>The experience to which I referred earlier, in terms of peer group review and working in a broader and larger system with the advice that is available from pharmacy advisers, is that it is possible to improve the quality of <P>


<a name="column_523"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 523</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>prescribing. There are a range of ways in which that can be done without necessarily sending the bill sky high. I recognise that that is an important area if we are to see clinically effective treatments reaching all patients who need them as soon as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para5"></a>It will perhaps be reassuring if I make clear that the extra resources we have made available to the NHS for the next three years take full account of the growth in recent years of prescribing costs, which have been about 8 per cent. annually, and of our expectations for the future. I reiterate that there is no reason for us to think that the unified budget will lead to patients being denied the medicine that they need. As I said in my opening remarks, all the evidence points in the other direction. I hope that the House will accept that these very technical and lengthy amendments provide a sound basis for what will be a better way in which to ensure that we achieve the best value for money across the board in relation to the way in which funds are spent by primary care trusts rather than in artificially-divided funding streams. I commend them to the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para6"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-14_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe </B>   moved Amendment No. 14:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 4, line 33, at end insert--
<BR>
("(9) The Secretary of State shall provide guidance to Primary Care Trusts regarding appropriate levels of expenditure on research and development, training and tertiary services."").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para7"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, on Second Reading and again in Committee, we heard contributions from a number of noble Lords, not least the noble Lords, Lord Winston and Lord Walton of Detchant, which highlighted the importance of clinical academic medicine and training within the context of a thriving health service. The purpose of the amendment is to enable me to address those issues in what is intended to be a constructive spirit.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para8"></a>The Richards Report of 1997 recognised that the supply of academic clinicians is drying up. The UK is producing a lower proportion of academic papers than it used to. If we look at teaching hospitals, part of the problem is the developing fault line between the two sides of their activity: the clinical care side and the academic and training side. Those two sides are in danger of becoming dislocated due, in large part, to the increasing pressure caused by the need to treat more and more patients.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para9"></a>That is a serious trend. It goes almost without saying that any erosion of the teaching base will have a highly detrimental effect on both the quality of training and the numbers being trained. In the longer term, it will lead to this country losing its place as one of the foremost centres of excellence in clinical research.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Winston, whom I am sorry not to see in his place, reminded us on Second Reading of how intimately bound up with each other are those ingredients of excellence--the availability of academic clinicians, the concentration of specialist expertise and case studies of patients and the clinical research base. It is vital to retain the links between the universities and <P>


<a name="column_524"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 524</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>other centres carrying out basic research and the various arms of the health service, but particularly the teaching hospitals.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para11"></a>As we witness ever-greater demands on the NHS budget, my great fear is that those vital elements of excellence in the delivery of healthcare will diminish both in quality and quantity. Of course, the streams of money which flow into academic training and research are not exclusively an NHS spend. The DfEE element is designed to cover a large part of the teaching and research activity, although the split of responsibility between the DfEE and the DoH is fairly complex. In the unified budgetary structure of a primary care trust, especially at level 4, we may find less and less of a commitment and, therefore, less money flowing towards those activities in NHS trusts. The purchasing horizons of a PCT will inevitably be much shorter than those of the Department of Health or even of a health authority. It is not clear what mechanisms will be in place to protect the broader, long-term objectives of the health service.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para12"></a>Those are the issues that lie behind the amendment. They are tremendously important, but they are not easy to deal with. I hope the Minister can provide some reassurance. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support warmly the amendment so splendidly proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. As he said, the issue of the future of clinical academic medicine and the related problems of teaching and research are crucial to the future of the National Health Service. It was reassuring when the Minister spoke earlier about the crucial importance of academic clinical input into primary care trusts. I am delighted that she was able to acknowledge that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para13"></a>One important matter of relevance to the problem is that today's development in medical clinical research brings about tomorrow's practical development in patient care. In the area of primary care, academic departments and general practice play an increasingly important role, not least in training medical students, but also in the vocational training of future general practitioners and in a much wider range of activities than ever was the case in the past.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para14"></a>To the credit of the last government, they recommended that 1.5 per cent. of the NHS budget should be devoted to research and development. I had the privilege of chairing an inquiry of your Lordships' Select Committee on Science and Technology into research in the NHS in the light of the last government's reforms. The Culyer inquiry on R&D in the NHS reported at about the same time as our Select Committee. Those reports identified the need to have research and development funded, first, at a central level through the Research and Development Directorate; secondly, by regional directors of research and development; and, thirdly, at a sub-regional level, with the intention that funds for research could be channelled to those general practitioners, to those nurses and other healthcare professionals who wished to undertake research of importance to the future of the NHS.
<P>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 525</B></P>

<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para15"></a>Such matters are of great importance. I am delighted that they have been highlighted in this amendment. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us assurances that the present Government propose to continue support for research and development at all three levels. It is a very important issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-14_para16"></a>I am also glad that the amendment includes tertiary services. An unexpected effect of the internal market introduced by the last government was that tertiary referrals to centres of excellence, upon which so much major research depended, fell away sharply. That is a matter of relevance to Amendment No. 20 which stands in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. The issue of cross-boundary flow and the ability to have patients referred to centres of excellence, not only because of the quality of the treatment that they will receive in such centres, but also in the furtherance of the clinical research which is so important to the future of the NHS, is a vital characteristic that I trust the Government will continue to support.

We need the ability to research and develop evidence-based practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I also rise to support the amendment. As the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, and other noble Lords indicated, it is extremely important that we maintain the high quality of research and development in this area of expertise in the UK, where we have led for many years.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-15_para0"></a>Given present scientific developments, there is an increasing lowering of boundaries between the life sciences, the biological sciences and the medical sciences. Although we have seen some diminution in the proportion of papers produced on the medical sciences, the UK is still highly ranked on the production of papers on biological sciences. We have recently seen an increase in the numbers of papers published in those areas. Nevertheless, the points made by noble Lords on all sides of the House are absolutely correct and we fully endorse them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, far be it from me to throw rocks into still waters and make them troubled, but I am rather troubled by this particular amendment of my noble friend. Of course, there is no doubt that both medical noble Lords who spoke on this issue in Committee are worried. They are right to be worried because the situation, as the noble Lord, Lord Walton, has just said, is, without a shadow of a doubt, deteriorating. That said, I believe that beggars--or perhaps cobblers--ought to stick to their lasts, which is  why I only really welcome two-thirds of this amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-15_para1"></a>Primary healthcare trusts are, after all, going to be concerned with primary healthcare. Training, especially the postgraduate training of doctors into various disciplines, some of which are not truly recognised like stroke medicine or indeed the professions allied to <P>


<a name="column_526"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 526</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>medicine--PAMs, or whatever they are called; for example, the various therapists--needs extra input. We all know that there are not nearly enough of them. It is in those areas that the primary care trusts should get involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-15_para2"></a>I take issue with the noble Lord, Lord Walton, in going on to expect the primary care trusts to expend money on research and development in the tertiary services. Tertiary services are equally in need of boosting, of extra funding and all the rest. The question is whether it should be done by the health trusts, by central government or some other organisation. I rather suspect that it would not be right for the primary care trusts to do it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, I add my support to the amendment, but I should like to ask the Minister if he can say who will fund the tertiary services. There seems to be concern about that. As other noble Lords have said, the quality of training spreads throughout the country. People who are trained in tertiary units move on. They get married and move down to the primary care services. Therefore, their expertise is spread around the country. The existence of units of excellence encourages nurses from all over the world to train in such places. The training of doctors, nurses and physiotherapists is vital when there is such a shortage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-15_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I did not understand the point made by my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale about tertiary services. I do not think that the amendment calls for GPs or primary care trusts to support research in tertiary services. It is more concerned with the referral of patients to the tertiary services and, because patients are referred to tertiary services, the tertiary services themselves will carry out the research. Can my noble friend confirm that the training will include newly qualified doctors who often undertake a period of primary care training in general practice? Are they included in the amendment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-15_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, although that area is important, it was not uppermost in my mind. I was seeking to focus on clinical academic medicine in the medical schools. I believe that that was the principal concern also of other noble Lords, including especially the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant.

<A NAME="90315-15_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, we have had a useful debate, following which I cannot be in any doubt about the strong feeling held by noble Lords about the importance of academic medicine. As the Minister in the department with responsibility for research and development, I feel that I am reminded constantly of the areas in which we need to ensure that those interests are properly safeguarded. We recognise the seedcorn that they represent in terms of high quality patient care for the future. We should not lightly neglect that.

<A NAME = "90315-15_para3"></a>I was grateful for the acknowledgement from the noble Lord, Lord Walton, of what we are trying to do in terms of the amendment that we shall be bringing forward to ensure that, as part of a PCT's duty to make arrangements to secure appropriate professional advice, the local stakeholder must take into account the key area of academic interests, particularly where a PCT commissions services from a teaching hospital.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-15_para4"></a>In terms of the effect of the amendment, the provisions of Schedule 1 will give primary care trusts powers similar to those currently enjoyed by NHS trusts to conduct or commission research and to make offices and facilities available for training purposes. As the House is aware, funding for research and development is achieved through the research and development levy. It is for each trust to put forward research proposals for central funding. The strategic framework for the R&D levy, issued in January 1997, sets out the principles that govern the allocation of NHS funding for research and development. A strategic review is currently under way with the aim of ensuring that the allocation of funding takes full account of the organisation and function of the new NHS and that it continues to improve quality and value for money.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-15_para5"></a>With regard to the short debate which was initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, we should not think of research and development as something that happens simply in academic medical departments and tertiary centres. One of the opportunities for primary care trusts with regard to their ability to undertake research and development is to ensure that that work is conducted in areas such as nursing, the professions supplementary to medicine and primary care where, after all, the vast majority of healthcare is delivered to patients and where the research base has not traditionally been as strong as in some areas of secondary and tertiary care. There are great opportunities there.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-15_para6"></a>With regard to training, undergraduate and postgraduate training are both funded also through a system of levies, although postgraduate deans contribute to the costs. The arrangements for both are well established for NHS trusts. Primary care trusts will be brought into the same system.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-15_para7"></a>The appropriate level of expenditure on tertiary services will obviously depend on local circumstances. However, I hear the concerns expressed about the importance of ensuring patient access to proper tertiary facilities. I am sure that when we reach Amendment No. 20 we shall have an opportunity to debate some of those issues. The appropriate level of expenditure will vary greatly. The provision of guidance from the Secretary of State would restrict the local flexibility that is required to ensure the most appropriate arrangements for the commissioning and provision of services. I am not sure that it would be appropriate for the Secretary of State to provide guidance on appropriate levels of expenditure on tertiary services, although I recognise the importance of ensuring access to those tertiary services and of the trickle-down effect of that throughout the service.

<A NAME="90315-15_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, this has been a useful debate and I am grateful to all noble Lords who have participated in it and to the Minister for her response. In my view at any rate, part of the problem is that those who perform work that deals in long-time horizons--that is, in training and research, or in what is sometimes referred to as the "futures agenda"--are inevitably subject to a different kind of culture from those who deal in purchasing and commissioning decisions of a short-term nature. The second culture benefits from the first, but it is an underpinning that allows change to manifest itself only gradually. One day you notice that something on which you relied is no longer there.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-15_para9"></a>One of the less satisfactory features of the proposed system for funding tertiary services is, as I understand it, the emphasis to be placed on historical spending patterns. It is essentially a system that relies on rolling forward what has happened in the past. That may well cut down on the paperwork, but it may also serve to ossify current structures in an unhelpful way. Alongside the protection of the overall levels of funding, one needs to achieve an ability to build up new tertiary concepts where there is the scope to do so. An over-reliance on the past will not allow such flexibility. If the Minister feels that she can elaborate on what she has already said on that point, I should be grateful if she would write to me.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-15_para10"></a>On PCTs, I was trying to make it clear that it is not so much that funding will be voted away from training and research, but that the decisions taken by PCTs, particularly in areas such as tertiary services, will have direct, knock-on implications for those activities, with the resultant consequences in terms of funding over the medium to long term. With that, and with thanks once again to the Minister, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 4, leave out lines 40 to 44.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para0"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I should say straightaway that this is a probing amendment, but it concerns a matter of genuine puzzlement to me. Clause 18A(2), which is to be found at the bottom of page 4, contains a provision that permits a PCT to provide services to patients of other NHS bodies, such as a primary care group or another PCT, as long as it already provides those services to its own population. In itself, that seems a perfectly sensible provision, but can the Minister say whether the flexibility granted to a PCT in <P>


<a name="column_532"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 532</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that way is entirely without condition? As I understand it, the clause would allow a PCT that was a provider of services and an acknowledged centre of excellence for, let us suppose, one or more of those services to treat patients living outside its own boundaries without restriction. I did not believe that that was the Government's intention.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para1"></a>In this Bill, we are seeing a move towards more proactive partnerships within the NHS. The powers in Clause 24 will allow greater operational flexibility between NHS providers and social services, perhaps in some cases involving more than one NHS provider. These will doubtless make for more co-ordinated provider arrangements, but that is not the point of new Section 18A(2) as set out in Clause 4.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para2"></a>It seems to me that what we have here is, in some senses, a continuation of market mechanisms. A PCT will be allowed to sell its people and facilities to other parts of the service. By definition, the purchaser/provider split is thereby retained. If one reads the section as an open-ended provision, it would be possible to envisage a health authority which happened to require a particular service choosing between two neighbouring NHS providers on the basis of the cost and quality that each could offer. If that is not a continuation of a kind of internal market, we need to understand exactly what it is. I look forward to what the Minister has to say about it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, perhaps it will be helpful if I clarify for the noble Earl exactly what new Section 18A(2) of the 1977 Act, which will be inserted by Clause 4, is intended to achieve.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para3"></a>A level 4 PCT will have a degree of flexibility as to whether it deploys its unified budget to commission community health services from another provider or provides those services itself. The noble Earl is right to point out that this is not as neat a division as perhaps the most logical of minds would wish. However, I suggest to him that it actually reflects a sensible way forward which recognises the benefits brought by separating providing and commissioning responsibilities; but it does not bring with it such a total separation that would actually stand in the way of sensible patient care.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para4"></a>Therefore, perhaps I may explain the circumstances in which we think it would be appropriate to allow a PCT to provide to patients outside its own area any service that it can provide to its own population. Under this provision a PCT will be able to enter into a service agreement with a health authority or another PCT to provide services. These services may be health services--for example, health visiting or speech and language therapy. That flexibility--I believe the noble Earl recognised this in his introduction to the amendment--may be especially helpful where a PCT has particular expertise or well-developed services which other parts of the NHS might sensibly want to use.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para5"></a>Equally the services provided by a primary care trust could comprise management or support services. This provision thus offers opportunities to arrange services in <P>


<a name="column_533"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 533</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>more efficient ways, for example, by allowing a PCT to provide support services--such as payroll management, estate management or IT support--to other parts of the NHS. This provision therefore provides both for operational flexibility in the way in which primary care trusts secure the delivery of services to patients and provides opportunities to increase management efficiency.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para6"></a>Where a PCT provides services to other parts of the NHS in this way, it would get income for these services through service agreements. That income would be on top of the unified budget allocation that the PCT will get to commission and provide services for its own population. Any arrangement for a PCT to provide services outside to other parts of the NHS--and this is the key issue about whether we are allowing a free-for-all into a market let rip--would obviously be subject to agreement between all the interested parties. The health authority will have to satisfy itself that any arrangement is consistent with the local health improvement programme. We believe that that will give a framework in which such arrangements can take place. It will be a sensible one in terms of maximising the expertise and services that an individual PCT may be able to provide for a wider geographical area and group of patients, without turning the chief executives of PCTs into Arthur Daleys trying to sell services throughout the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para7"></a>I believe that it is a sensible recognition to say that some of the divisions are not as neat and tidy in some areas as they could be. However, it would actually allow an appropriate extension of the providing activities of the PCTs. On that basis, I hope that the noble Earl will feel that I have answered the questions raised by his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-17_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for what was a most helpful explanation. I do not disagree in any way with the provision in the clause, as explained by the noble Baroness. Indeed, it will obviously make for greater operational flexibility. The clarification she gave about how this fits into the context of health improvement programmes was also most helpful. No doubt it will be a comfort to all the Arthur Daleys out there in the NHS.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para8"></a>However, if you do retain the purchaser/provider split and actively allow a PCT to sell its services to other arms of the NHS, it seems to me that what you have in some sense or another is a kind of market. Nevertheless, it is not an issue which I want to press in any way. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="90315-17_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I should like to repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health. The Statement reads as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "90315-17_para12"></a>"Madam Speaker, much of the National Health Service which we inherited from the previous government was run down and shabby. Much of its investment in information technology had been an expensive failure. Much of its equipment was unreliable and let down both patients and staff. Patients waiting on trolleys had become a commonplace feature of the service. That is why one of the top priorities of the new Government is to modernise the NHS, build new hospitals, replace outdated and unreliable equipment and give patients quicker, easier and more modern access to NHS services.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para13"></a>"We are already committed to investing an extra &#163;21 billion in the NHS over the next three years. The biggest hospital building programme in the history of the NHS is already under way. This coming year at least &#163;350 million will be invested in upgrading and replacing outdated equipment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para14"></a>"Today I can give the House details of an additional &#163;200 million to be invested in the coming year to speed up our programme to modernise the NHS. This is made up of &#163;100 million to be invested in modernising accident and emergency departments and, drawing on the example of NHS Direct, in improving rapid access to professional advice and help for patients. The second &#163;100 million will come from the National Lottery and will be used to step up the fight against cancer by helping provide new and replacement equipment like linear accelerators, diagnostic machines and scanners as well as extending the services provided by hospices. What better use could there be for lottery money.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para15"></a>"Earlier this year I was able to announce that &#163;30 million was to be invested to improve 79 accident and emergency departments round the country. That will be funded from the NHS Modernisation Fund. Last Tuesday in his Budget the <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_535"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 535</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that &#163;430 million from the Government's Capital Modernisation Fund had been earmarked for investment in the NHS, and that &#163;100 million would be made available this coming year to modernise the NHS. Between &#163;70 million and &#163;80 million of this will be invested to modernise all those A&E departments that remain in need of improvement. These improvements will include special areas for children and easier access to X-ray, pathology and pharmacy services. The layout and furnishings of A&E departments will be improved to make them both more pleasant and more secure. Video surveillance and alarm systems will bring greater efficiency and add to the security of both patients and staff. Some modernised A&E departments may incorporate an NHS Direct telephone point. All A&E departments which need it will benefit from some or all of these changes.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para16"></a>"A survey by the Royal College of Physicians published early in 1997 showed that fewer than half the hospitals with A&E departments had an admissions ward. Since that survey the numbers without either an admissions or observation unit have been reduced to 22 out of 202, and by the end of this initiative only five will not have one and all five have good local reasons for not doing so.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para17"></a>"Proposals which are likely to be funded under the new A&E initiative include extension of children's A&E at the Royal Liverpool Infirmary, improvements at Sheffield Children's Hospital and in children's facilities at North Staffordshire Royal Infirmary. In Ipswich there is a major scheme including improvements to resuscitation facilities and a children's area, and in Luton more resuscitation facilities and close circuit TV. Some &#163;250,000 worth of improvements are intended at the Royal London in the East End and a similar sum at the Mayday Hospital, Croydon. Large-scale improvements are intended at Southampton General and a new observation unit and better facilities for the GP co-operatives are planned for Frenchay Hospital, Bristol. These are just a few examples of what is planned for hospitals in every part of the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para18"></a>"This is the biggest programme of investment in A&E services in the history of the NHS. It will cover every part of the country. By April 2000 every A&E department will have been modernised or work will be well on the way. It should ensure that patients are treated more quickly, more effectively and with greater privacy than ever before. I am determined to make sure that both patients and staff get maximum benefit from the A&E modernisation programme, so it is not just a matter of new buildings, new plant and new equipment. We have to make sure that the new and better ways of organising A&E such as emergency nurse practitioners and greater use of telemedicine are taken up all over the country. We need to speed up the spread of best practice. I am setting up a team of professionals to spearhead this <P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para19"></a>"This A&E modernisation programme will not just be good for patients and staff. It will be good for jobs, not just for the builders who do the work on site but also for firms who supply building materials and specialist fittings. Let me give just one example. The A&E department at Portsmouth has just been refurbished at a cost of just over &#163;1 million. It used materials supplied by more than 20 firms from all over the country. Orders, large and small, included locks from Walsall, paint from Darwen, weather proofing from Slough, carpet from Swindon, wash-basins from Rugeley, partition walls from Loughborough, wall units from Broadstairs and the specialist security reception desk came from Glasgow. The A&E modernisation programme will reflect such orders one-hundred-fold.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para20"></a>"The remainder of the &#163;100 million from the Government's Capital Modernisation Fund will be invested in improving direct access to the NHS. The success of NHS Direct, the nurse-led 24-hour helpline, has demonstrated the public demand for rapid direct access to professional advice and help from the NHS. Following the success of the pilot schemes, NHS Direct has already been extended since Christmas to cover 5 million extra people in the Black Country, Essex, Northampton and West London and will cover 20 million by Easter. Its success has also shown that, given the chance, the talented staff of the NHS can do a brilliant job supplying what the public want. We are now considering an NHS online service to provide a web site with on-line access to a wide range of health information. Between &#163;20 million and &#163;30 million is being made available in the coming year to finance capital investment in further developments in direct access to the NHS, including pilot schemes for walk-in services. These could include services provided by GPs or practice nurses located in or near accident and emergency departments; out of hours services provided by GP co-ops; and services in main streets or shopping malls.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para21"></a>"We want, as with NHS Direct, to work with the professionals to try out direct access, walk-in services in places and at times which are particularly convenient to patients. Some schemes may be confined to providing advice or directing patients to existing services for treatment or care. Others, particularly those associated with A&E departments may provide treatment and care, there and then. This is not intended to replace general practice but to augment it. All these ideas go with the grain both of modern living and what the health professionals are already developing. The new Government are determined to give impetus to all this to help create a new NHS for the new century.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para22"></a>"That brings me to the extra &#163;100 million which will start to be invested in the coming year to augment the existing NHS investment in the fight against cancer. In line with our election promise we have set up the New Opportunities Fund to make sure that <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_537"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 537</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>more money from the National Lottery goes into the things the people of this country want to see it spent on. Every time there is a discussion about what to do with lottery money, thoughtful people ask why some of it is not being used to combat cancer. Well from now on, it will be.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para23"></a>"Over the coming three years &#163;150 million from the New Opportunities Fund will be invested in tackling cancer in the UK as a whole. In England we want to make a major start this year in investing in new equipment. The order making this possible was laid by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. The direction he issued at the same time makes clear that the focus of this initiative in England will be to augment voluntary efforts to raise funds to provide new and better equipment, including breast screening units, scanners and linear accelerators and also to help hospices and palliative care. The aim is to provide additional equipment and replace unreliable equipment. It is likely to help fund, for example, replacement linear accelerators at the Christie Hospital in Manchester or new equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer of the colon at Lewisham Hospital which my right honourable friend and I visited this morning.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para24"></a>"All this money comes on top of the extra funds previously announced for the NHS and will help the NHS in every part of the country to catch up with more modern standards of cancer diagnosis and treatment. The initiative has the strong support of Macmillan Cancer Relief, Marie Curie Cancer Care and the National Council for Hospice and Specialist Palliative Care services. It comes on top of the extra &#163;30 million we have invested in breast and colorectal cancer over the past 18 months and the further &#163;40 million we are making available in the coming year to combat breast cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer and our commitment to speeding up specialist attention for people suspected of suffering from cancer.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para25"></a>"The commitments I have announced today will speed up the renewal and modernisation of the NHS. They will make services more readily available and more dependable. At the same time they will make it easier for the dedicated staff of the NHS to provide quicker and more high quality services. That is only possible because we have a Government who invest public money wisely and have the right priorities".
<P>
</UL>
<A NAME = "90315-17_para26"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

<P>
<A NAME="90315-17_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, once again the House has cause to be particularly grateful to the Minister for repeating the Statement on the Budget settlement for health. My only slight regret, if I may be candid, is that there is a rather unnecessary tone in the opening sentence which seems to cast aspersions on the record of the previous government. I am sorry about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para27"></a>At first blush this is all good news for the health service, which we welcome. There is no doubt that many accident and emergency departments in acute hospitals need additional funding to help them to <P>


<a name="column_538"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 538</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>improve services to patients. It is true to say that improvements of this kind will also help doctors and nurses, who can suffer considerable levels of stress in trying to cope with working in conditions that are far from satisfactory. As we have said before from these Benches, it is a remarkable tribute to doctors and nurses that the pressures experienced during the past winter in A&E departments did not lead to greater difficulties than they did.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para28"></a>One of the lessons learnt from last winter was that money and schemes designed to alleviate A&E pressures should be announced in good time so that hospitals can plan ahead properly. It has to be said that the Government's announcement last winter was far too last minute for many hospitals to take timely action before the pressures built up. Can the Minister say whether the amount of money allocated for this up-grading work to A&E departments is based on any preliminary assessment of need? In other words, how many hospitals are likely to benefit from this funding? How will bids from hospitals be assessed and ranked?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para29"></a>I am confused about whether this money is really new money. There are two aspects to that. It is said to be part of the capital modernisation fund, so I am not sure whether this is money that has been announced before in one form or another. Secondly, on 9th November last year the Secretary of State announced &#163;250 million of additional spending following the pre-Budget announcement. The NHS confederation spokesman, Stephen Thornton, said at the time:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This is really only next year's money paid early". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Was he right to say that and, if so, is any of the money that we are talking about today part of that previously announced package?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para30"></a>The other area of puzzlement relates to the capital modernisation fund. It is very difficult for those outside the DoH to keep track of the portion of the fund that has now been earmarked for various purposes. The modernisation of A&E units seems a perfectly bona fide use for modernisation fund money, unlike the funding of the nurses' pay award from the NHS modernisation fund which came as a somewhat unexpected use for it. To my mind, at least, pay should fall into the category of regular expenditure. Can the Minister say how the modernisation fund is now placed after these latest calls upon it?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para31"></a>I do not know whether the Minister recalls, but her party pledged in 1996 to set up a taskforce to monitor the number of patients forced to wait on trolleys for treatment. I am not sure what has happened to that idea. It does not seem to have been proceeded with. The worry I have is that if one dedicates wards for people waiting for A&E then one is bound to reduce capacity elsewhere in hospitals. I would welcome the Minister's comments on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para32"></a>Turning to NHS Direct, once again I have a sense of deja vu over what has been announced. Have the Government come to any conclusions as to how NHS Direct will be organised on a national basis? National centres are likely to be more efficient and lead to more uniform standards but, at the same time, they are more <P>


<a name="column_539"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 539</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>likely to reduce co-ordination with local GPs; whereas local centres based in practices may have advantages; they may also lead to a lack of uniformity in standards.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para33"></a>It would be impossible not to welcome a new investment of &#163;150 million into cancer care. In particular, it was heartening to hear mention in the Statement of the Christie Hospital in Manchester, which the late Lord Dean of Beswick did so much to support. I am always worried by the appearance of Lottery money in this context. Can the Minister reassure me that none of the proposed expenditure represents what is normally regarded as core NHS spending? It would be quite wrong to use Lottery money to take the place of central funding.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para34"></a> I shall conclude by making one or two comments about the context in which the Statement has been announced to Parliament. The 6 a.m. news on Radio 5 Live contained a detailed report on the setting up of admissions wards within hospitals which could only have come from a detailed knowledge of the contents of the Statement. It has also appeared on BBC Teletext. The Statement on the nurses' pay award was leaked to the press more than two weeks before publication; the Statement on Ashworth Hospital was leaked to the Daily Telegraph one day before the delivery to the House; the Statement on mental health was leaked to the Sunday Telegraph two days before publication; the Statement on social services appeared in the Independent  and the Guardian on the morning of publication; the Statement on safeguarding children appeared in the Evening Standard on the morning of publication; and the Statement on health spending of March 1998 appeared in The Times on the morning of delivery to the House. I do not believe that I am alone in finding that unacceptable. I hope that the Minister can provide some reassurance that she and her right honourable friends will do all that they can to stop that kind of practice.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-17_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I join the noble Earl in thanking the Minister for repeating the Statement made in another place. I have very similar concerns about understanding the exact amount of money involved in the Statement. It is difficult enough as it is to distinguish between the capital modernisation fund and the NHS modernisation fund and to understand the linkages between the two when, for instance, the &#163;30 million previously announced for accident and emergency comes out of one fund and the current expenditure today, it appears, comes out of another.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para35"></a>In addition, of course, as I understand it, this money is brought forward money rather than new money, as was announced on Budget Day. The Chancellor was basically saying that &#163;250 million could be brought forward from later years into this year, and in that regard the NHS, I assume, is getting something approaching &#163;70 million or so additional funds. Sometimes it is rather difficult to track and it would therefore be helpful if in future Statements the Government were able to be more precise about what money is involved in terms of being brought forward, how much money is new and <P>


<a name="column_540"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 540</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>how much has already been announced in any Statement. Otherwise, bald figures such as these are extremely difficult to track.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para36"></a>As I understand it, we have the announcement today of expenditure of &#163;100 million which comes from the capital modernisation fund but we do not yet have an understanding of how much will come out of that fund and how the remainder of the &#163;430 million will be spent over the next two to three years. Again it would be helpful in terms of planning by NHS trusts if that information were available.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para37"></a>That said, however, I very much welcome the additional expenditure announced by the Government for accident and emergency. That is a proper response to the winter pressures and the problems in the NHS that we have seen over the past few months. Patients waiting on trolleys is completely unacceptable. The idea of admissions wards is a good one and is clearly an imaginative way of dealing with some of the issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para38"></a>However, at the end of the day, capital expenditure must be linked with the staff to go with it. Without the commitment on staffing the capital improvements that are taking place in accident and emergency will not tackle the winter pressures that have been identified. Furthermore, in the context of accident and emergency, it is worth while taking a look back at the Audit Commission report of 1996 which discussed the issue in considerable detail. It is not enough simply to look either at staffing or at capital expenditure. For instance, are the Government looking at other areas such as taking steps to meet the resource requirements of supporting an effective emergency service, in particular specialist staff and in-patient beds? Other recommendations include setting a research agenda to build a robust knowledge base for decisions about the future of emergency care; optimum approaches for meeting a full range of emergency needs; how patients' views can be ascertained in a way which is useful to improve care; the cost and quality of alternative forms of emergency services; improving education to facilitate informed self-care and first aid as well as more appropriate use of alternative facilities for emergency care; and, finally, and very importantly in the context of a great deal of the load that was put upon accident and emergency departments by the flu epidemic--or perhaps I should say the flu non-epidemic--communicating to the public the need for change in the organisation and use of accident and emergency departments so that it is clearly seen to be inappropriate to refer yourself to accident and emergency in those circumstances. It would be helpful to have the Minister's response on those aspects.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para39"></a>I also welcome the proposals for better access to primary care. But I am somewhat confused. The noble Earl referred to expenditure on NHS Direct, but I think that this is analogous to NHS Direct. This does not represent further funds for NHS Direct. We have asked many questions in the past about that particular aspect--I am sure we will ask more in the future--but, as I understand it, this is building on the experience of NHS Direct to improve primary care and other aspects of the NHS.
<P>


<a name="column_541"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para40"></a>We on these Benches welcome the additional expenditure on cancer equipment and treatment. However, &#163;100 million of lottery funding has been spent on cancer treatment. The Government admitted in their manifesto that this was a core area for additional expenditure. It seems extraordinary that a transfer of responsibility from government to lottery funding is taking place. We have grave doubts about that. If this area is a major priority for the NHS, should it not be funded out of ordinary mainstream NHS income? Where do we draw the line? What other core NHS expenditure will be borne out of lottery funding? Where does it end?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-17_para41"></a>We are talking about capital expenditure and about an important set of components. We welcome the fact that there are funds which allow capital expenditure to be made. That said, there are other aspects of capital expenditure within the NHS which give considerable cause for concern. I have previously raised the issue of how PFI funding is proceeding. The evidence so far is that that is providing very poor value for public money. I believe that the Government have now succeeded in uniting the BMA, the NHS Confederation, UNISON and the Health Select Committee in being extremely critical of the current PFI programme. If the Minister is able to respond to that point, we on these Benches shall be grateful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-18_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, on the noble Lord's last point, we shall have an opportunity to discuss these issues later this week in relation to a Question that he has tabled. Therefore, perhaps I need not go into the issues surrounding the PFI in response to comments made from both Front Benches.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-18_para0"></a>The noble Earl began his remarks with a caveat, so perhaps I, too, may begin with a caveat. I am slightly disappointed at the lack of enthusiasm for what is a very important injection of finance into two crucial areas of the NHS. Perhaps I may deal with the second area first; namely, cancer treatment. I have said several times in this House that we are not in any way breaching the question of additionality. I have made absolutely clear the extra funds that are going into cancer services and producing results in those services. The investment in breast cancer services are having a daily effect in reducing the amount of time that women wait for referral to consultants and increasing the coverage of one-stop clinics. We announced the process asking for bids for improvements to services for lung cancer patients. I was able to visit Papworth Hospital and see some of the things that are going on there. There are a number of exciting and innovative projects in colorectal cancer which have been funded through the &#163;10 million that has been put into that area.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-18_para1"></a>From my own experience of the NHS, I find it difficult to understand the way in which people seem to think that some kind of charitable contribution towards equipment in the NHS is an innovation. There is a long history of charitable involvement. Very few hospitals are so well-equipped that they have not held a scanner appeal. Very few hospitals have not benefited, particularly in the field of cancer care, from partnership with voluntary organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Relief. On Friday, during a visit to Leicester, I saw a <P>


<a name="column_542"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 542</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>magnificent building providing high quality cancer care. Large sums of money have been poured into that project. I met the Macmillan staff who were providing that care. There is a long-established tradition of Macmillan pump-priming for three years Macmillan Nurses, and of the funding then being taken over by the health service. They enjoy that commitment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-18_para2"></a>Of course the NHS must take on its share of the responsibility, as it does, for using such equipment and for providing the staff to ensure that it is properly used. However, we have talked many times during debates on the Bill that is before the House about the importance of equalising access to high quality care. We do not have that equal access at present. We have equipment that is terribly in need of replacement. This is an enormous opportunity to make a step change in the quality of care that is provided to cancer patients. It is an absolutely appropriate use of lottery money. I have no hesitation in saying that. Nor do I hesitate to say that I believe that that is the popular view among patients and the public in general.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-18_para3"></a>I now turn to the &#163;100 million that is being put in to improve accident and emergency services. I confirm that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, was correct. We are not talking about a further expansion of NHS Direct. I repeated a Statement in this House about how that coverage is being extended in order for it to be up and running in the larger part of the country by December this year to deal with the Christmas and millennium period. With some of that money, we seek to build on that experience of providing easily available access for patients to advice and care in innovative ways. I outlined some of the ways in which that will be achieved.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-18_para4"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, asked which hospitals would benefit and how bidding processes would take place. I do not think that there will be a classic bidding process. I believe that I made clear, particularly in relation to admission wards, that we have done some work to see what is needed through regional offices. We are confident that the money that has been made available will be enough to ensure that every hospital A&E department that needs it will receive the appropriate capital investment. Some have already benefited, or are benefiting, from the &#163;30 million NHS modernisation fund. Therefore, not every hospital is in need of investment. However, a large number do--perhaps up to 100. We believe that that investment can be made possible by this money.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-18_para5"></a>I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. It is not just a matter of capital investment. We are examining ways in which we can ratchet up the quality of care through investing in infrastructure. In some areas that is straightforward--for example, in security. In others, it provides the opportunity for re-engineering and ensuring that staff can provide more efficient and effective services by improving access to pathology or radiology, space for nurse practitioners, and the things that go hand in hand with providing appropriate services.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-18_para6"></a>A&E services are central to the functioning of the whole system throughout a hospital. If we get those services right, we take a great deal of pressure off other <P>


<a name="column_543"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 543</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>parts of the service. I have seen, and I am told by admissions units that a large proportion of their patients are discharged straight from the admissions unit rather than having to be admitted to a ward and benefit from that speedy concentration of resources. It is therefore clear that the impact of providing that extra space, rather than taking space away, can have a crucial effect on the working of the whole hospital.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-18_para7"></a>It is in that spirit that we have taken forward the issue that the noble Earl raised about trolley waits by setting up the emergency services action team to look not simply at trolley waits, which are often a symptom of a problem, but at the whole range of emergency services, both in the hospital and outside.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-18_para8"></a>The funding is &#163;100 million of new money for the NHS. The &#163;2.5 billion capital modernisation fund was set up in the Comprehensive Spending Review to support capital investment to improve public services. It initially provided &#163;1 billion for spending in the year 2000-2001 and &#163;1.5 billion in 2001-2002. It was announced last week that the Government now believe that there is scope for a more rapid start in these key areas and that they have brought forward &#163;250 million of the fund from 2001-2002 to 1999-2000. The CMF allocation is now &#163;0.25 billion in 1999-2000, &#163;1 billion in 2000-2001 and &#163;1.25 billion in 2001-2002. I hope that that clarifies the position as far as the capital modernisation fund is concerned. As far as health service expenditure is concerned, this is all extra money.

In that role, perhaps I may assure the House that my board and I are completely committed to the principle of additionality, which the Minister mentioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-18_para9"></a>Does the Minister agree with me that the best way to ensure that people recover from cancer is to have, first, early diagnosis and, secondly, public awareness and that, while it is very important that all hospitals have diagnostic equipment of the highest quality, equally as important is the provision of information to patients and their families about early symptoms and lifestyle--in other words, a holistic approach to detection, prevention and treatment of cancer?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to agree with my noble friend. The principle of additionality is one that is being safeguarded. While we envisage that, because of the importance of early diagnosis, a significant proportion of the money will be spent on equipment in the first year, that is not exclusive. I mentioned the provision of palliative care. My noble friend referred to the valuable role that information centres and information services can provide. That is something that we shall want to look at when considering the bids from individual localities. Those <P>


<a name="column_544"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 544</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bids will take account of priorities but will also be able to look at the whole patient journey rather than simply at one area of expenditure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said that between &#163;20 million and &#163;30 million would be made available for further developments in direct access, including services in main streets or shopping malls. Can the Minister tell us a little more about that? I suspect that it is related to the weekend press reports that the Government are to encourage Boots the Chemist to establish GP centres in pharmacies. I have no objection to that in principle provided there are certain safeguards, but, if this is to be the trend, it is a huge change in the philosophy of the gatekeeper role of GPs in a given community. It also challenges the idea of registered patient lists. I should like to know how it will affect the payment of GPs. Have the Government a strategy for this or will it be left to serendipity and commercial initiatives? I am not critical of it, but I should like to know what the Government's long-term strategy is towards these kinds of developments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, as I said in the Statement, these are innovative areas that we are looking at, building on the success of NHS Direct. I have to say to the noble Baroness, as I should have said to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that I do not have responsibility for what is written in the press about the health service, which is not always of the highest level of accuracy.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-18_para10"></a>The Government want to look at ways in which we can provide services in places and at times which are particularly convenient to patients. Part of that will be building on information services and perhaps providing those services perhaps in different places and through different media from those where they have been provided before. In A&E departments, in particular, it may be about providing treatment and care there and then--for example, by extension of out-of-hours GP services.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-18_para11"></a>As far as developments outside traditional healthcare settings are concerned, the important thing is that we go with the grain of how people now live their lives and how they expect to have access to services. However, we recognise some of the points to which the noble Baroness referred. General practice is a jewel in our crown which we would not wish in any way to undermine by these developments. We need to take a careful and considered approach and work with the professionals, as we have worked with them on NHS Direct, to ensure that the new services that are provided are complementary and do not in any way undermine the services that already exist.

The Minister knows what a problem MRSA is. Is there any hope of speeding up the tests for <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-19_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I agree with what the noble Baroness says. I accept that in A&E departments when there are, for example, trolley waits in crowded circumstances, there is not only a risk of cross-infection, to which the noble Baroness referred, but also of pressure sores and a variety of other matters, including the privacy and dignity of patients, at a most stressful time, not being properly safeguarded. That is one of the reasons why we shall focus in particular upon medical assessment units, which will provide speedy diagnosis and consider the opportunities for isolation facilities, as appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   My Lords, the Government are to be congratulated on what is a very worthwhile initiative in two most important areas of medicine.

It follows a model widely used--for example, the use of charitable money to such great effect in the United States for healthcare.

<A NAME = "90315-19_para0"></a>I wonder whether the Government have considered the possibility of using some of that money in the future for the kinds of services which are much more difficult to fund in the National Health Service. I am thinking in particular--and this is admittedly special pleading--of reproductive services. Will the Government give some thought to allowing some part of that money to be used for that purpose? In his Budget Statement the Chancellor made a great plea for the family. I am sure that my noble friend will agree that reproductive services are an important part of general health.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-19_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I always give thought to suggestions that my noble friend makes. I suspect that I should lay myself open to criticisms far worse than those I have received today about the funding of mainstream services if I gave him any further assurances. I understand exactly the connection that my noble friend makes and of course undertake to discuss it with colleagues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rowallan: </B>   My Lords, while I welcome the extra funding for accident and emergency, which is the front line, I have two questions. There is to be &#163;100 million of lottery funding this year plus &#163;50 million over the next three years, making a total of &#163;150 million. As all citizens of Great Britain together put money into the national lottery how, with devolution, will those funds be distributed to the different parts of the country? Presumably the money must be given to Scotland, but not for specific projects.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-19_para1"></a>The Hampshire Magpie scanner appeal has been working hard to raise money. Can the Minister confirm that the main idea is to augment funds that have already been realised or to have completely new scanners, and so forth? Which will have higher priority?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-19_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, priority will very much depend on regional cancer leagues informing us of <P>


<a name="column_546"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 546</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>their priorities. For some, the priority will be to replace equipment. Others will want added capacity. We need to view the matter from the patients' perspective, to ensure speedy access to effective treatment. There is no one answer but we should look at the output in terms of what the patient sees from the investment. Like the noble Earl, Lord Howe, I thought of my noble friend at Christie Hospital and how he would have reacted to the possibility of investment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-19_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rowallan, referred to how the funds would be split between the four countries. The &#163;150 million for the UK as a whole, excluding administrative costs, will be allocated in such a way that over time, 77.5 per cent. will be committed to projects in England; 11.5 per cent. in Scotland; 6.5 per cent. in Wales; and 4.5 per cent. in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-19_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, I have no quibble with using lottery money for capital equipment in the National Health Service. That is the right way to proceed. As many have said, including the Minister, it is an adjunct or fillip to what goes on. My noble friend Lord Rowallan mentioned a scanner in Hampshire.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-19_para3"></a>The Government have three priorities for the health service this year, They are cancer, cardiac treatment and--it was a surprise that my noble friend did not mention this--mental health. In this additional tranche of money that the Government have courageously provided, just one of those priorities is singled out. Why could not the money be spread a little more thinly and appropriately, according to the Government's own priorities?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-19_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, we have made it clear that, in terms of lottery funding, expenditure was on cancer services, where we felt there was a need for the catch-up exercise--particularly in respect of equipment. The noble Lord rightly draws attention to other priorities. One is mental health, for which the national service framework is being drawn up and substantial additional funds have been allocated. We have ring-fenced additional funds for mental health. We are currently working too on the national service framework for coronary heart disease, where I am examining the resourcing implications. It is important to acknowledge that demand but there are demands also for the drugs budget and public health areas such as smoking cessation support, which will have a great effect in respect of coronary heart disease. I do not think that we are neglecting those two areas.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-19_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Emerton: </B>   My Lords, I also welcome the funds that have been allocated, and particularly the emphasis that my noble friend the Minister placed on the importance of accident and emergency departments and admission beds. Having just personally experienced the upgrade of A&E departments and the introduction of admission beds, I know that the Statement will be much welcomed throughout the NHS.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-19_para4"></a>However, while an A&E department is being upgraded, use of it is halved; that creates pressures, particularly in the winter, and makes life difficult for nursing staff and patients. It increases trolley waits and other pressures in the department. While trying to deal with the government <P>


<a name="column_547"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 547</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>initiative to reduce waiting lists, one must acknowledge the pressures created when money has to be spent over time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-19_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend gives wise advice. Anyone who has lived through the major upgrading of an A&E department knows exactly how disruptive that can be for staff and patients alike. She is right to say that upgrades should be timed carefully and not at the peak of demand. A variety of smaller schemes will not necessarily involve the same disruption and could be successfully progressed. The carrot of knowing that new facilities will be made available takes people through the sticks of adversity and living with the builders.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-19_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I also welcome my noble friend's Statement. Does she agree that one of the greatest concerns of recent years has been the number of assaults on NHS staff and that a significant proportion have occurred in A&E departments? Will her Statement lead to a significant improvement in the security arrangements for staff working in A&E departments and will there be close co-operation between NHS trusts, community safety officers and the police?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-19_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is right to draw attention to that aspect. Additional security facilities were among the priorities in the additional investment of &#163;30 million from the modernisation fund. He is right to say that A&E departments are a particular flashpoint, which can create danger and distress for staff and patients alike. We must ensure that improvements are made in closed-circuit surveillance, and that is provided for in some of the schemes. My noble friend is sensible to suggest that local police services are involved in examining how that can best be done.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-19_para5"></a>As well as the specific expenditure focused on security, other measures will include improving services overall, cutting waiting times and improving the quality of the surroundings in which people wait, and reducing access times to radiology and pathology. Improvements will reduce stress levels and, hopefully, levels of violence against staff and patients.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-19_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I have a similar line of questioning to that of my noble friend, Lady Cumberlege, but we arrived at our questions quite separately. I have a particular interest in GP work in main streets and shopping malls. In Australia this occurs almost everywhere. The system of funding the health service in Australia is very different. Patients choose where to go and then reclaim what they have paid according to means after the event. That is a real test of patients' choice. They have greatly welcomed the provision of surgeries in shopping malls, to the extent that they have been expanded enormously.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-19_para6"></a>As I understand the Minister, the service is intended to be free to the patient. I ask that question again. It is said that it will be at places and at times convenient to the patient. We would all like that. But the statement that this is not intended to replace general practice but to augment it may give rise to some risk. If patients take to this free <P>


<a name="column_548"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 548</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>service in a big way there will be a great demand for it. If a patient goes to a doctor in a shopping mall and the doctor gives a prescription--my noble friends have already asked how he will be paid, and, presumably, it will be done on a sessional basis--from whose budget will that come? How will it be fair either to general practices or to any other source? How will it be allocated?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness asks exactly the questions to which we must work out the answers together with the professionals to ensure that the services that are offered--for example, general practice in the high street--are properly and effectively run. I believe that I made clear that initially the provision of direct services is more likely to take place in an existing NHS setting. That is one of a number of options that we are considering to improve access to high quality care. It is too early to provide the details. We have set out the direction of travel.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para0"></a>But we should not think only of GP services. We must build on the work that is done by community pharmacists. That is an issue about which we have spoken in your Lordships' House on many occasions. People place faith in pharmacists to provide well-informed advice, particularly on the treatment of minor ailments. We want to see the role of pharmacists generally and community pharmacists in particular extended. Not to make full and proper use of their skills and knowledge is a waste of a highly effective resource that can provide exactly the easy access to services in the high street about which we have been speaking.

Indemnity cover. 
<BR>
43C.--(1) Regulations may make provision for the purpose of securing that, in prescribed circumstances, prescribed Part II practitioners hold approved indemnity cover.
<BR>
(2) The regulations may, in particular, make provision as to the consequences of a failure to hold approved indemnity cover, including provision--
<BR>
(a) for securing that a person is not to be added to any list unless he holds approved indemnity cover;
<BR>
(b) for the removal from a list prepared by a Health Authority of a Part II practitioner who does not within a prescribed period after the making of a request by the Health Authority in the prescribed manner satisfy the Health Authority that he holds approved indemnity cover.
<BR>
(3) For the purposes of this section--
<BR>
"approved body" means a person or persons approved in relation to indemnity cover of any description, after such consultation as may be prescribed, by the Secretary of State or by such other person as may be prescribed;
<BR>
"approved indemnity cover" means indemnity cover made--
<BR>
(a) on prescribed terms; and
<BR>
(b) with an approved body;
<BR>
"indemnity cover", in relation to a Part II practitioner (or person who proposes to provide Part II services), means a contract of insurance or other arrangement made for the purpose of indemnifying him and any person prescribed in relation to him to any prescribed extent against any liability which--
<BR>
(a) arises out of the provision of Part II services in accordance with arrangements made by him with a Health Authority under this Part of this Act; and
<BR>
(b) is incurred by him or any such person in respect of the death or personal injury of a person;
<BR>
"list" has the same meaning as in section 46 below;

(5) The regulations may provide that a person of any description who has entered into a contract or arrangement which is--
<BR>
(a) in a form identified in accordance with the regulations in relation to persons of that description; and

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I suspect that this amendment will take a little longer. The amendment makes an important contribution to help patients on the fortunately rare occasions when something goes wrong. It will ensure that GPs, dentists, pharmacists and optometrists practising in the family health services are able to meet any damages that might be awarded against them in cases of death or personal injury caused to their patients.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para8"></a>At the moment neither doctors nor dentists are required legally to maintain professional indemnity cover. Although those employed in the NHS, for example in an NHS trust, are covered by NHS indemnity for general medical practitioners and high street dentists, we rely on the guidance of the regulatory bodies and the professional organisations. We consider that to be unsatisfactory.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para9"></a>In September 1996 there was considerable interest in a case which involved a dentist in Lancashire who was continuing to practise without professional indemnity. A patient who suffered at his hands began legal proceedings to prove negligence, but at the assessment hearing the judge established that the dentist was not in benefit of professional indemnity cover at the material time. Since he had no assets, he was unable to meet the &#163;23,000 damages awarded; and unfortunately there have been other similar cases. To suffer harm as a result of a visit to your doctor or dentist is bad enough; to then find that you are unable to receive the compensation you deserve is of great concern. I believe that in the interests of patients clinicians should not practise on the NHS without proper professional indemnity cover.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para10"></a>This amendment would allow the Secretary of State to require Part II family health service practitioners--those are the professions providing general medical services, general dental services, general ophthalmic services, or pharmaceutical services--to hold indemnity cover. I should say that the vast majority of those practitioners already act responsibly by arranging suitable indemnity cover for their work. By covering all, this amendment seeks to address the small minority who are not so responsible.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para11"></a>The Secretary of State would be able to enforce the requirement in either or both of two ways. Regulations could specify that having approved indemnity cover is a requirement to joining a health authority list for a Part II service. Noble Lords will be aware that practitioners must be on such a list in order to provide those services on the NHS. This requirement would also specify that practitioners on the list must hold approved indemnity in order to remain on the list.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para12"></a>The second way the requirement could be made is that the regulations under this amendment could allow the Secretary of State to specify that the holding of <P>


<a name="column_551"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 551</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>approved indemnity cover be set out in the terms of service for any or all of the Part II services. This would mean that, if approved cover was not held, the practitioner required to hold it would be subject to the established health authority service disciplinary committees, and ultimately to the NHS tribunal which could strike them from the health authority list in a sufficiently serious case.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para13"></a>The two approaches allow flexibility. The four different family health services are different from each other and also different in their relationships with the health authority under the 1977 Act. Both approaches give proper protection to patients, but would allow the Secretary of State to apply the appropriate mechanism to the circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para14"></a>The amendment states that the indemnity cover which must be held is to be approved indemnity cover. This is to ensure that cover is adequate to meet the anticipated level of claims and remains contemporaneous with the event giving rise to the claim. For example, we might want to ensure that adequate cover remained in place after a practitioner had ceased clinical practice to meet a claim should an adverse event come to light some years later. Approval would be given by the Secretary of State, although this could be delegated to, for example, a small representative group of interested parties set up under the regulations to carry out this function on behalf of the Secretary of State. In the interests of probity such a group would of course exclude any potential providers of indemnity cover. In forming decisions on approval of indemnity, we envisage there being consultation with the provider bodies concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para15"></a>To provide full protection for patients, the amendment provides for the approved practitioners to hold indemnity cover which covers not just themselves--the practitioners on the health authority's list--but which also provides indemnity against claims for their assistants, deputies, employees and for any auxiliary whose work they may direct. We will also be able to ensure that health authorities review the indemnity cover held by Part II practitioners at regular intervals. Where the requirement was that indemnity must be held to remain on the health authority list, the result of failure to comply would mean removal from the list, subject to a short period of grace allowing practitioners time to put their house in order. The length of that period of grace could be specified in the regulations. As I said a moment ago, staff employed by NHS bodies, when providing services under the NHS, are covered by the present NHS indemnity scheme. The amendment does not alter or interfere with those arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para16"></a>We have consulted widely on these proposals among patient groups, professional bodies, and with the providers of indemnity cover. I am pleased to say that our proposals have been supported. This amendment will enable patients to be protected, and properly compensated on those rare occasions when something goes wrong. Where a patient is deserving of compensation, we believe that they should be able to receive it. I commend this amendment to the House. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="90315-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that very clear introduction to this amendment. In principle, we firmly support the terms of the amendment. It is clearly crucial that the practitioner is covered "at the material time"--the phrase used by the Minister in his introduction--because otherwise great unfairness and injustice ensues if, having had the trauma of an injury or a failure of treatment, the patient is subsequently unable to obtain compensation in the way described by the Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para17"></a>The vast majority of Part II practitioners do hold indemnity insurance but it is important that there is this safety net. In some ways it is highly surprising that we have not had this on the statute book before. Speaking as a solicitor, I have to hold indemnity insurance and that is true also for other professions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para18"></a>It would be helpful if the Minister could deal with some points of clarification. The definition of approved indemnity cover includes cover made on prescribed terms. The Minister referred to a body which might be delegated to discuss this question. Is the Secretary of State expecting to lay down requirements which would mean GPs having to increase or to change their current level of cover? Is that in prospect or is this simply a mechanism for future change? It would be important that the consultations described by the Minister included no change to the regime currently practised by those practitioners who do have insurance.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para19"></a>Secondly, will there be different levels of cover for different types of practitioners? It is difficult to give a blanket definition of the level of cover that GPs in particular may need. Some of them provide only core general medical services, while others will be undertaking obstetric or child surveillance work, for instance, both of which would cover much greater liability risks. Flexibility in that prescription, so to speak, would be important.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para20"></a>The amendment relates only to Part II practitioners. That of course is the vast majority of practitioners, dentists and so on who provide those services. But why does it relate only to them? For instance, there are GPs working in pilot schemes who are Part I practitioners. It would be important to make sure that they too were covered by this type of indemnity insurance.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-20_para21"></a>I have referred throughout to the phrase "indemnity insurance". There is the feeling, particularly among members of the medical profession, that their type of cover is not described as indemnity insurance. The kind of mutual cover which is provided by their medical defence organisations technically is described as something else: it is membership rather than indemnity insurance. That may be a technical phrase. I do not know whether it has some significance, but perhaps the Minister will be able to answer that.

<A NAME="90315-21_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, as I understand it this indemnity is just for professional negligence or failure to treat the patient correctly. It in no way indemnifies the general practitioners who will be left with all these debts after 1st April. I had a dinner-time conversation with a practitioner from <P>


<a name="column_553"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 553</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Slough who is very disturbed at Berkshire Health Authority pushing all the debts on to the GPs' budget on 1st April.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-21_para0"></a>When I first arrived in the UK and wanted to register as a dentist, the first thing I was told I must do was to join one of the protection societies--either the Medical Protection Society or the Medical Defence Union. Towards the end of my time in practice those bodies changed and, under one of the Finance Acts, had to become insurers. Their status changed, and unfortunately the premiums went up a great deal. As I understand it, they then became insurers in the same way as any other insurer. What control do the Government have over what such bodies charge practitioners? There has been a great increase in the cost of "membership", but it is indemnity insurance. We hear that in the United States, the indemnity cover of obstetricians is exceptionally high. In this country, certain practices may become high risk and insurers may ask more from them. Will the Government decide what the limits should be and how the system should be operated?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-21_para1"></a>The Minister answered that everyone in a practice would be covered. Does that mean that no one practitioner in a GP group will be responsible for himself? Is it to be a joint practice insurance which will be taken out by individuals and will cover the people working for them? Can the Minister clarify that the care assistants, physiotherapists, counsellors and so forth who GPs are concerned about losing, will also be covered by the practitioners' insurance? I support the general principle of the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Colwyn: </B>   My Lords, I, too, support the amendment. I must declare several interests: I am a dentist; I have indemnity cover; and I am a council member of the Medical Protection Society. I hate to answer on behalf of the Minister, but I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that there are different levels of indemnity for different risks in medicine and dentistry. My noble friend Lady Gardner does not have insurance, but is a member of a society which provides indemnity. It is not an insurance; one is a member of a society which takes care of its members if anything goes wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-21_para2"></a>The introduction of compulsory indemnity cover for doctors and dentists, providing NHS general practitioner services, is long overdue. It is an essential element in the protection of patients. Although the overwhelming majority of GPs subscribe to a medical protection organisation, the irresponsible few who do not must be made to comply. The definition of "approved indemnity cover" in the amendment is cast in broad terms. I venture to suggest that in order to maximise patients' protection, requirements should specify the need for occurrence-based indemnity cover, which I mentioned on Second Reading. Occurrence-based cover simply means that the doctor or dentist will be indemnified provided that he or she was in benefit at the time of the incident giving rise to the claim, no matter when the claim materialises. That may of course be years after the events in question.
<P>


<a name="column_554"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 554</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-21_para3"></a>In medical cases, a claim usually occurs between three and five years after the event and in dentistry one or two years later. This cover should be compared with the usual insurance claims-made model in which both the events and claim must take place within the insurance period. Indemnity cover on a claims-made basis can, through administrative oversight or simple misunderstanding of the principle, result in patients being denied the compensation they deserve. At least one other country, Israel, is contemplating introducing a requirement for occurrence-based indemnity cover. I hope that the Minister and her advisers might consider a form of words which specified a type of cover. The mutual societies are occurrence-based, but if cover is provided by an insurance company, it is important to ensure that indemnity includes claims which have not yet been reported or claims which can arise when, for example, a GP has retired and is no longer paying a premium. I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>

<A NAME="90315-21_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, covered all the points about which the British Medical Association wrote to me, so I will not reiterate them. However, I wish to ask the Minister a narrow question. Have the Government taken into account those who are not employees of the National Health Service or the universities, but who by virtue of their medical schools have employees working within the health service?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-21_para4"></a>I ask that question because when I was asked by the local health authority and university to be chairman of the medical research ethics committee, I was tipped the wink by a friend to ask whether I would be indemnified if the ethics committee should make a decision which ultimately resulted in liability for damages. I made the inquiry and discovered that I would not be indemnified, nor would the other lay members of the committee. Therefore, I asked to receive assurance in writing that it would be the case and I did so. However, had I not been tipped the wink I would have run considerable risk during the four years of tenure. Can the Minister reassure us that people who are not employed by the National Health Service or by a university are indemnified?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Nunburnholme: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister answer the question posed by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-21_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Blackwell: </B>   My Lords, it is difficult to disagree with the principle of the amendment, but I worry about the risk of escalating costs. If indemnity insurance is known to be available on these terms, that may encourage the escalation of the compensation paid. One then fears that such an escalation will lead to higher <P>


<a name="column_555"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 555</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>insurance premiums. Have the Government considered whether in making indemnity insurance compulsory they can prevent the escalation of large claims?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-21_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, this has been an interesting debate. I will endeavour to answer all the questions that have been asked, but if not I shall write to noble Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-21_para5"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, asked how long patients have in which to make a claim. I understand that, generally, one has three years in which to make a claim for personal injury, but that can be extended in cases where the injury comes to light only at a later date. Then it would be three years from the time the injury became apparent.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-21_para6"></a>A number of noble Lords asked about the potential liability outwith those employed in the NHS. The professional regulatory bodies--for example, the General Medical Council and the General Dental Practitioners Association--currently recommend that all practitioners should hold professional indemnity cover. If holding such cover were to be made mandatory for all dentists, the route to achieving that would not be through NHS legislation but through legislation concerning the dental profession. If the regulatory bodies concerned wish to take such a step, the order-making power under Clause 47 of the Bill would enable such provision to be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-21_para7"></a>A number of questions were asked about funding. First, the charges made for indemnity cover are for market forces, but the number of practitioners who do not have indemnity cover is very small. Therefore, the additional cost to the NHS of that provision should be negligible. It is worth making the point that the cost of that cover falls to the NHS and not the practitioners personally. The cost of indemnity cover is a legitimate practitioner expense and so would fall to be reimbursed within the overall contract arrangements for GPs and dentists, as the existing arrangements made by the great majority already are. We believe that the cost will be marginal and certainly worth paying.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-21_para8"></a>Perhaps I may deal with the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner. To provide full protection for patients, the amendment provides for approved practitioners to hold indemnity cover which covers not just themselves--that is, the practitioners on the health authority list--but also claims made in relation to their assistants, deputies, employees and any auxiliary whose work they may direct.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-21_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, raised the issue of primary care Act pilots. Those are covered by the National Health Service (Primary Care) Act 1997 and I can confirm that they are a Part I service. Health authorities are required by the direction of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State to contract only with providers who undertake to ensure that all their performers have indemnity against claims for negligence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-21_para10"></a>In dealing with the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, perhaps I may refer to the issue of occurrence-based cover, which is a term used by <P>


<a name="column_556"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 556</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>providers of cover to indicate that they will still meet claims which arise from events when the clinician was covered that only came to light later, perhaps after the period of cover has ceased. Other forms of cover could be claim-based, whereby the claim must be made during the period of cover. Under the amendment, regulations would allow the Secretary of State to specify the type of indemnity cover which would be approved.

<A NAME = "90315-22_para0"></a>I should prefer to write to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, on the matter which she raised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Colwyn: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, I believe that I heard him say that the indemnity of dental surgeons is paid for by the NHS. I believe that he will find that all general practitioners have to pay their own indemnity, whether they are working for one day or five days per week. It is not paid for by the NHS. It may well be covered indirectly by the fee structure, but they have to pay their own indemnity, whether they work for the NHS or privately.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-22_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, the Minister said that there would be flexibility. Is he suggesting that there may be a possibility of a no-claims bonus?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, no. I was not suggesting that. The arrangements which are brought into play will need to reflect the points which the noble Lord made about the differing circumstances. I commend the amendment to the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para1"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para2"></a>Clause 7 [Directions]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-22_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton </B>   moved Amendment No. 20:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>

("( ) The power conferred by subsection (1) shall be exercised so as to enable patients resident in an area covered by a body referred to in that subsection to be referred out of that area where appropriate for the purpose of receiving specialist hospital treatment and after-care.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I apologise to the Committee for not being present throughout the Committee stage of the Bill. The reason is that my noble kinsman, my husband, was not well and with the very <P>


<a name="column_557"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 557</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>serious medical conditions he has, I did not have carers who were adequately trained to deal with the situation. Therefore, I had to go back to Yorkshire.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para4"></a>That is the reason I now bring to your Lordships on Report what I consider to be most important amendments. Amendment No. 20 deals with the general powers of the Secretary of State to issue directions to NHS bodies. The intention of the amendment is to require the Secretary of State to issue directions to achieve out-of-area treatments where appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para5"></a>Amendment No. 48 provides that the duty of co-operation should extend to OATs, making sure that they are covered in the Bill. People are often suspicious of change. We have before us a Bill which deals with the new National Health Service. It has many changes within it. The National Health Service is something from which every family in the country benefits at some time in their lives.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para6"></a>I have had my life saved by the expertise provided at a centre of excellence which dealt with spinal injuries. I was transferred from an accident and emergency department of a general hospital to a spinal unit attached to a general hospital out of the area in which I was living. Because of that, I declare a personal interest in these amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para7"></a>I founded the Spinal Injuries Association and I can tell your Lordships from first-hand experience that I have seen some terrible cases of patients who have not been transferred to a spinal unit and have been treated in a general ward of a general hospital. After many months, some of them have at last been transferred, looking like a person from Belsen--emaciated, with sepsis, pressure sores, urinary infections, contractions of the limbs and suffering from depression.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para8"></a>There are many supra-regional specialties which these amendments would cover such as those dealing with liver disease, cancers, HIV/AIDS, skin diseases, head and spinal injuries, special eye surgery and complicated fertility problems, to mention but a few. It is cost-effective for patients to receive correct treatment from experts who know what they are doing.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para9"></a>Nobody seems to know exactly who will be responsible for OATs. Will it be health authorities, primary care trusts or NHS trusts? Many doctors and patients do not trust those trusts. The Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, has worked for the NHS as a hospital trust chairperson. The Minister knows how important it is for an individual patient to receive the correct treatment. My amendment refers to patients to be transferred only where appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para10"></a>Last Friday I had a most interesting visit to the vascular unit of St James's Hospital in Leeds. The expertise of the doctors and nurses at that specialising unit was excellent. The benefit to the patients was obvious. Very difficult conditions were being treated and the patients felt confident. The expert advice given to patients makes all the difference to them and their families. The benefit to teaching and research was also obvious. We live in a fast-developing technological age. Expensive medical equipment cannot be made available in every hospital. It is from such specialised units that the patients, universities and students can benefit.
<P>


<a name="column_558"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 558</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para11"></a>We must keep up with the advancement of medical expertise. We must keep up the morale of staff and patients. These amendments will help to recognise the wonderful work of the experts. I hope that the Government and your Lordships will accept them. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-22_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McColl of Dulwich: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the two amendments. I cannot imagine for one moment that the Government will not support them. As noble Lords will be aware, it is not just the medical personnel at the specialist centres who make the difference; it is the whole team, including the nurses, the physiotherapists and the much-maligned management. The whole atmosphere of such places is geared to providing a superb service. Of course, they treat a sufficient number of these injuries to be expert in them. If a clinician has only one such case a year at his hospital, there is no way that he can acquire the expertise that obtains in the specialist hospitals.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para12"></a>There are also many other problems, perhaps less acute, which nevertheless are so rare and difficult to treat that they need to be concentrated in a specialist unit. Everyone in London used to send cases of a tumour, chorionepithelioma--cancer of the womb--to the Charing Cross Hospital because the best person worked there. Ewing's tumour of bone is another rarity and such cases tend to congregate in the Middlesex Hospital where again there is the expertise.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para13"></a>It is essential that that practice is allowed to continue and is encouraged under the new arrangements. We believe that it is important to have a provision on the face of the Bill so that there is absolutely no doubt that the arrangements can operate when required.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support strongly the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. She brings a particular understanding and expertise to this area. She has cogently put the case for this provision to be on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para14"></a>We have had a discussion already in Committee on the question of out-of-area treatments and the way in which extra-contractual referrals move towards OATs. If we genuinely are to have a situation where referrals can continue to be made to specialist hospitals, that is a test as to whether or not the internal market is being done away with.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para15"></a>In her previous replies--if I did not misunderstand her--the Minister made it fairly clear that, although generally the commissioning contracts of PCTs and PCGs were to cover tertiary care and specialist care, where it was necessary and where it was in the patient's interest and at no cost to the PCT or the PCG, such a referral would take place. It is important that we have absolute confirmation of that as that is precisely the kind of treatment that the noble Baroness was talking about in terms not only of spinal injuries but also liver disease, cancer, head injuries, plastic surgery and so on, where tertiary referral will be vital.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para16"></a>We hope that the Government will support the spirit of the amendment, if not necessarily the precise wording. It is a litmus test. It is extremely important that <P>


<a name="column_559"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 559</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the new system of commissioning does not confine GPs to taking services only from within their own area. It is vital that patients have full access to expertise of the highest order outside their particular area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-22_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. I did not hear the first two minutes of her speech but I have managed to pick up the threads. I am interested in this matter because I speak from personal experience. What is aimed at in these two amendments is already in operation in the area of England in which I live. I live five miles from Huntingdon, where there is a general hospital with a certain amount of specialist treatment available.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para17"></a>I now draw on experience within my family. One member of my family had to go to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge where she needed particular specialist treatment. She was operated on there and received that treatment there, but she could not have had that treatment in Huntingdon. Another member of my family, alas, had to go to a specialist unit in a hospital in Peterborough. Out-of-area treatments already take place. Under the new arrangements which the Government have in mind, I hope that that flexibility will be maintained.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-22_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   My Lords, this is a matter about which I feel absolutely passionately and on which I have spoken in your Lordships' House in the past. Sadly, I fear that the noble Lord, Lord Renton, is not entirely correct when he says that this practice invariably goes on. It does not. It happens in some areas of the country but not, unfortunately and regrettably, in all areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para18"></a>There is growing concern, especially in the teaching and specialised hospitals, that there is an increasing problem with the reorganisation of the health service. Although I do not want to talk about different governments and their different reforms, I do think that this started in some way with the internal market and it is still causing increasing nervousness. Many specialists have seen a falling off in out-of-area transfers. I am sorry to return to reproductive services, but my hospital in Hammersmith has seen an astonishing fall in referral practice, so much so that we now have empty operating theatres, fully staffed, waiting for patients who are not there. I was talking this week to the director of leukaemia services there and he has found similarly that patients are now not so easily able to attend his expert unit for leukaemia treatment because they are not being referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para19"></a>I believe that that is completely counter-productive to the health service. First, it reduces the research base. When I first used to lecture in the United States about what we were doing at Hammersmith Hospital, the Americans were amazed at the wealth of clinical material which an individual clinician could build up. Whereas we were building up literally thousands of cases, American doctors would see tens or perhaps hundreds of cases. We were able to do that because of <P>


<a name="column_560"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 560</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the remarkable pattern of referral across the nation inside the National Health Service.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para20"></a>Secondly, out-of-area transfers present great benefits in terms of teaching and training. That in turn allows the dissemination of excellent practice, which is very important for the training of specialists.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-22_para21"></a>Above all, I hope that the Government will recognise that sensible out-of-area transfers can save money. There is no question in my mind but that at the moment we are spending more than we need. In my own area of reproductive medicine, for example, I am convinced that if we sensibly concentrated services in certain areas to which patients could easily travel, there would be a great benefit to the patients, a benefit in terms of training and research, and a saving of money. I feel strongly that there is sense behind the amendment and I hope that the Government will be able to give some kind of assurance--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, perhaps I may say how grateful I am to him for putting me right. What the noble Lord has said supports the amendment and what I said about what can be done in one particular area also supports the amendment because it shows that such transfers take place elsewhere.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   My Lords, I feel that I hardly need to answer that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-23_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Fookes: </B>   My Lords, I feel equally strongly about this. At different times, both my parents benefited from being referred to a specialist service outside the area in which they were living, so I have some personal reason to be grateful for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-23_para0"></a>More recently, I intervened, if that is the right word, on behalf of a lady of my acquaintance who I felt needed specialist treatment which she was not receiving in her local area. However, it proved quite difficult. Her GP was not anxious to refer her. She was not the kind of lady who was in a position to make herself felt. That was partly because of the illness from which she had suffered, which was a massive stroke. I tried to make representations to the doctor myself and in the end, very successfully, the case was referred to a specialist unit. That was to her great benefit because after a considerable number of tests something was discovered to be wrong which had not been discovered at the local level.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-23_para1"></a>However, such problems should not arise. I would like an assurance from whoever answers on behalf of the Government tonight that, where a patient is anxious to have treatment out of area, no undue blocks will be placed in his or her way. Indeed, not everyone has someone to speak up for them. If there is to be equality of provision, which this Government set great store by, then it is most important that people should have equal access to the very best specialist treatment that is available.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-23_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I, too, should like to express my support for the amendment. <P>


<a name="column_561"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 561</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>In my own district health authority, which is struggling at present with a large deficit, there is considerable pressure to limit the number of extra-contractual referrals. Therefore, what the noble Lord, Lord Winston, has said is totally true.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-23_para2"></a>When we discussed another amendment earlier, we talked about the position of research and development in this country. The expertise that we have in our teaching hospitals is amazing. It is ludicrous that we are not making use of such expertise at present. If we are to maintain state-of-the-art capabilities in medicine, it is essential that we maintain the expertise here. We must make use of these out-of-area referrals. Indeed, we have centres of excellence and we must build upon them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, as someone who might have died had I not had an out-of-area referral, I was horrified by the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Winston. The idea that specialist units are under employed in the health service when there is so much need out there in the country fills me not only with horror but also with dismay and disquietude. The nub of this debate is to ask the Minister what provision will continue to be made--if necessary, a new provision--to ensure that the description provided by the noble Lord, Lord Winston, will no longer pertain. It is absolutely disgraceful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-23_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Berners: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. I strongly agree with referrals to specialist hospitals. Indeed, it makes very good sense. I hope that the Government feel able to consider the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-23_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I support the principle of being able to refer people to specialist hospitals. That is absolutely right. However, I draw the line when it comes to the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Winston. For years everyone was referred to hospitals in London. It would be a great pity if there was in any way a feeling that we were making a special plea for people to come back to London. I say that because it has been beneficial for people to have centres of excellence in many different parts of the country. I hope that that will continue. Of course I would be delighted if the noble Lord, Lord Winston, were to have full occupation all the time in his hospital, but not if that disadvantaged some other equally good centre of excellence in another part of the country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-23_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   My Lords, I should point out to the noble Baroness that what I said would apply equally if I were living in Leeds. It is a pure accident that I happen to work at Hammersmith Hospital. Nevertheless, the principle of what I said pertains across the country and it is true in different parts of the country. It is ludicrous to suggest that I am special pleading for London; indeed, I am certainly not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-23_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, has raised a very important matter. I certainly understand the concerns that lie behind her amendments. Indeed, other noble Lords who <P>


<a name="column_562"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 562</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have spoken in this debate have experienced problems which some specialist units have encountered with the operation of the internal market. I hope that I can convince the House that the arrangements which the Government are now putting in place will meet some of the concerns expressed. Of course, one needs to start by saying that it is absolutely essential that all patients have ready access to specialised treatment and care.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-23_para3"></a>We are committed to promoting fair access both to NHS services generally and in particular to specialised services. In The new NHS White Paper we said explicitly that an aim of our new arrangements for planning and commissioning specialised services was to develop the more systematic approach needed if fair access is to be guaranteed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-23_para4"></a>It may be helpful if I explain in a little more detail how the new arrangements will work. Each health authority, and increasingly, each primary care group and primary care trust, will be responsible for commissioning services for their population. There is of course nothing to restrict them to commissioning services from hospitals in their own immediate area. Many will have service agreements with hospitals in neighbouring health authorities to reflect established flows of patient referrals, and many more will also enter into agreements with more distant hospitals, for example to reflect patterns of treatment for cardiac or cancer patients.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-23_para5"></a>As regards specialist centres, I make it clear that funding for those services will come through long-term service agreements. The main funding route will be through the specialised commissioning arrangements. NHS Executive regional offices will be responsible for ensuring that health authorities and their primary care groups and primary care trusts come together with the clinical units concerned to agree the future pattern of services. As we said in The new NHS, the intention is to balance the population perspective of health authorities, primary care groups and primary care trusts as regards addressing questions of fair access with the need to support clinical units and their staff in developing the most suitable and effective care.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-23_para6"></a>In their health improvement programmes, health authorities and their partners will set specialised commissioning issues alongside their local priorities. They will need, as ever, to form a balanced judgment about areas for development along a number of broad fronts. One of the criticisms of the internal market was that fragmentation of responsibility made it difficult to ensure co-ordinated planning and commissioning of specialised services. The comments of a number of noble Lords in this debate have reflected this problem of fragmentation. The noble Lord, Lord Walton, is not present at the moment, but as he pointed out earlier this evening, in some instances specialist units were uncertain as to the future flow of patients and, consequently, their future funding arrangements. The new specialised commissioning arrangements we are putting into place will offer a much more coherent and purposeful way forward. We are giving regional offices clear responsibility for ensuring proper arrangements are <P>


<a name="column_563"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 563</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in place, and will require all health authorities and all primary care groups and primary care trusts to participate in that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-23_para7"></a>Having said that, I cannot, of course, go so far as to say that every specialist centre will receive the funding it would like as a result. I do not think any system in the NHS has, or could, ensure that. There will still be a need for difficult judgments to be made and difficult priorities to be set, but in future there will be a clear and ordered system for ensuring that the concerns that are expressed are properly and collectively addressed by all the partners in a health region or in smaller areas respectively.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-23_para8"></a>To complete the picture, the new arrangements for out-of-area treatments will cover cases which cannot readily be brought within a primary care group or trust's planned service agreements, for example, emergency admissions away from home or a rare case needing specialised treatment. Where a hospital receives referrals of this kind, that pattern will be reflected in the allocation of the health authority which is its main local commissioner. That health authority will build this funding into its own service agreements with the hospital to cover these ad hoc cases. There is no constraint here on the freedom of a GP to refer a patient in such circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-23_para9"></a>I believe that these arrangements should, between them, meet the concerns of the noble Baroness. I can also confirm that the powers of direction in Clause 7 are wide enough to enable directions to be issued on this point. The scope and duty of partnership in Clause 19 is similarly broad enough to cover these arrangements. As I said in Committee, the co-operation in the commissioning and provision of specialist services is precisely the kind of issue that we see coming within the scope of that duty. In the light of my explanation and assurances I hope that the noble Baroness will consider withdrawing her amendment.

<A NAME="90315-23_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, I wish to thank all the supporters of the amendment. I believe it is necessary to have the out-of-area treatments written on the face of the Bill. It does not matter where they may be--Leeds, London, Liverpool, Glasgow, Belfast, Middlesbrough or anywhere else--but if the specialised services are not written on the face of the Bill, which is, after all, a health service Bill, a strong emphasis is put on primary health care in the Bill, and secondary healthcare--tertiary healthcare--will seem to be forgotten.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-23_para10"></a>I think that I speak for many outside the Chamber who would like our National Health Service to be the best in the world. We cannot be the best in the world unless, as the noble Lord, Lord Winston, said, there is the clinical material necessary to carry out research and to advance in treatments. We live in a fast-advancing world. I shall read very carefully what has been said. I will go back to the supporters of the amendment and we will wait for Third Reading. The Government should <P>

<P>
<A NAME="90315-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McColl of Dulwich </B>   moved Amendment No. 21:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 7, line 28, at end insert--
<BR>
("(4) The Secretary of State may direct NHS Trusts to establish that number of consultant posts recommended centrally in order to deliver a consultant-based service.
<BR>
(5) In pursuance of subsection (4) the Secretary of State shall establish the appropriate mechanism to ensure that agreement is reached centrally on the relationship between the number of junior staff in training and the number of consultants required.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, as usual I declare my interest. I have a score of relatives who have been involved in the health service in this country, some of whom are still in training. In addition, I have trained hundreds of members of junior staff in hospitals, many of whom face a fairly bleak future as they seek consultant posts under the current chaotic system. The amendment is designed to help solve what must be one of the most serious manpower crises in the NHS.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para1"></a>First, I wish again to draw attention to the fact that there are fewer consultants per head of population in this country than any other western country with the exception of Portugal. Everyone who knows anything about this subject agrees that we desperately need more consultants in order to have a consultant-based service. That is the only way to improve the quality of care, especially as there has recently been such a large reduction in the number of hours worked by the junior staff. Secondly, there are far too many junior staff being trained for the consultant vacancies currently available. Thirdly, what makes this even more unacceptable is that at the end of their training, which takes a total of 20 years, doctors are now being sacked without, of course, redundancy payments. The NHS is a monopoly employer and there is nowhere else for them to go. When one considers the millions of pounds that have been spent on training them and the demoralisation experienced by these sacked trainees, noble Lords will realise that we have a major crisis on our hands.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para2"></a>If that scenario is not bad enough, noble Lords will find it difficult to believe that the NHS continues to recruit new, and therefore less experienced, trainees to fill the posts vacated by those who have just been made unemployed. Specific instructions have been given by the Department of Health to the postgraduate deans who are in charge of the employment of these trainees not to renew their contracts but instead to go on recruiting more trainees. I am not complaining; I am offering solutions. One immediate solution to the problem is to stop recruiting more trainees until this totally unacceptable situation has been sorted out.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para3"></a>Some senior people in the NHS maintain that we must go on recruiting junior staff to ensure that we have continuing recruitment into each specialty. We have been here before. At the end of the war and at the inception of the NHS, the number of junior staff was doubled in order to provide an opportunity for those returning from the war to specialise in hospital <P>


<a name="column_565"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 565</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>medicine. At the same time, with the inception of the NHS, the retirement age for consultants was raised from 60 to 65. So there was a great increase in junior staff and virtually no vacancies for five years. That created enormous problems. However, the problems were eased by keeping the trainees employed. They were not sacked when they came to the end of their allotted training period, and we never had any problems of recruitment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para4"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Winston, pointed out, the problems in obstetrics are probably worse at present than in any of the other specialties. Last year, there was a 33 per cent. cut in the number of consultant posts advertised. It has been estimated that at the end of this year there will be 150 fully trained obstetricians without a job and that within two years that figure will double.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para5"></a>In an earlier debate I drew attention to the fact that 65 per cent. of all the medical legal cases involve obstetrics and gynaecology. The British Medical Association has pointed out that the confidential inquiry into stillbirths and deaths in infancy and the confidential inquiry into maternal deaths have raised questions about the lack of consultant input into these problem cases. The BMA also points out that both the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives have recommended that a consultant should be on the labour ward throughout the normal working week to supervise care. Several hundred new posts will be needed to reach that standard. But, as I have mentioned, last year there was a 33 per cent. cut in the number of consultant posts advertised. Doctor Ian Bogle, chairman of the BMA Council, said recently:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This is a human tragedy for trained experienced doctors who are being put on the scrap heap in their thirties and for the women and children who are dying because of lack of care". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para6"></a>When one attempts to find out who is responsible for this state of affairs, everyone points an accusing finger at someone else. The postgraduate deans say that it is the NHS Executive; the NHS Executive says that it is up to the NHS trusts; and so it goes on. It must be written on the face of the Bill who is responsible and who should correct this state of affairs. These amendments go some way towards doing that by providing on the face of the Bill that it is the Secretary of State who is responsible.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para7"></a>I should emphasise that we are not asking that everyone recruited into training should be given a consultant post. No one has ever suggested that. But clearly, if there are only 50 consultant vacancies a year in a particular specialty, it would be unreasonable to recruit 10 times that number of junior staff every year. There must be a sensible relationship between the number who are trained and the number who are needed. As the president of one of the Royal Colleges said today, the number of trainees should be more closely matched to the number of potential consultant appointments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I strongly support the spirit of the amendment. The noble Lord, Lord McColl, has cogently described the unsatisfactory situation with regard to workforce planning. We had considerable debate on this issue in Committee. Since <P>


<a name="column_566"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 566</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>then we have had the report from the Health Select Committee, which highlighted the situation in technicolour. I had not realised before I saw that report just what kind of alphabet soup we had in terms of the bodies responsible for workforce planning. We have the MWSAC, the SWAG, the MPC, LMWAGs and REDGs. We have a host of bodies, none of which, on their records so far, seem to be very effective in getting things right in terms of the number of consultants we need or the number of trainees who can go through the pipeline to become consultants.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para8"></a>The Health Select Committee said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the longer term we recommend a major review of current planning procedures which should pay particular regard to their rationalisation and eventual replacement by an integrated planning system". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
What better integrated planning system could there be than placing the responsibility where it belongs, with the Secretary of State? The amendment has considerable merits in doing just that. The result of the current planning system is headlines such as the following in The Times:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No jobs for 400 doctors trained at a cost of &#163;40m". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para9"></a>I thought that that was pretty hair-raising. Obviously the BMA is highlighting this as a campaign. Two relatives of mine are obstetricians. They are registrars and hope to become consultants in due course. The situation is worse in the area of obstetrics than in many others. However, the BMA highlights the fact that, before long, ear, nose and throat specialists, as well as cardiothoracic and renal surgeons, will face a similar problem. The situation is not satisfactory. Someone must take responsibility for making sure that we have the right numbers coming in for training and the right numbers of jobs available when training is finished.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para10"></a>There are other considerations which can be added to the mix. There is the EU Working Time Directive, the impact of Calman, training reforms and the New Deal. In addition, more doctors wish to work part-time. There are also considerations of how doctors wish to balance their family lives and their work lives. If our planning system cannot get it right, then we shall have a lot of extremely unhappy trainees and a lot of overworked consultants. I suggest that the department should look at its planning system and take on board the spirit of this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Patel: </B>   My Lords, I am unaccustomed to speaking in your Lordships' House and noble Lords will therefore forgive me if I am a little slow. Certain facts need to be clarified. It is correct that a major problem has developed in the specialty of obstetrics. I declare my interest here: I am an obstetrician and until the end of September 1998 I was president of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. To that extent, I presided over the problem that has arisen.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para11"></a>There are several factors which led to the problem, and they apply to all specialties. I am currently chairman of the Specialists' Training Authority and therefore sign every certificate in every specialty when a trainee completes the specialist training, and I know how many <P>


<a name="column_567"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 567</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>certificates I have signed. There are more than we originally thought there would be. The problem will occur in other specialties.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para12"></a>The problem has come about because some four-and-a-half years ago we changed our way of training in post-graduate medicine and made it more structured than it was before. The noble Lord, Lord McColl of Dulwich, referred to that. It meant that when a trainee completed the training he or she was issued with a certificate of completion of specialist training, which identified that trainee and enabled him or her to apply for a consultant post in the NHS. The numbers of trainees entering the programme are controlled by a complicated formula worked out by the Specialist Workforce Advisory Group every year for every specialty.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para13"></a>Four-and-a-half years ago, when so-called Calman training was introduced, the contention was that the NHS would move towards a more consultant-based service. What is a consultant-based service as opposed to a consultant-led service? It is a service whereby most if not all treatment is provided by fully trained specialists. We are moving more and more towards a service provided by non-consultants. That is the third problem. Trusts are appointing more non-consultant career grades on short-term contracts rather than longer-term consultant contracts. There are many issues to be teased out.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para14"></a>After the reforms in training, the question arises of how we want to man the medical workforce in the NHS. The public want treatment by fully trained people and those who are not trained or who are in training to be supervised. If that is the intention, many issues must be addressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-24_para15"></a>The amendments highlight the problem but I am not sure that they go far enough. A complete review is needed of medical workforce planning. Another problem is that in general practice recruitment is poor, while in specialist services overall, it is good.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   My Lords, the hour is late and I do not want to detain the House but I am absolutely obliged to speak briefly to the amendment because it concerns another area about which I feel passionately. I will tell my noble friend the Minister a brief story about one of the people on my own unit to highlight the seriousness of the problem. She has completed her training. She got an excellent degree at Cambridge and has three higher degrees, including a doctorate and a distinction. In September, she will be redundant. She is one of the most deft surgeons we have trained and she is excellent with patients.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-25_para0"></a>It seems extraordinary that such people can be on the scrap heap of their speciality. That applies to obstetrics at the moment but, as the noble Lords, Lord McColl and Lord Patel, said, it will apply to other specialities. I agree that this may not be precisely the right amendment but it is a critical issue for the health service. Given that there is growing public expectation of a consultant-led service and growing risks of litigation, particularly in obstetrics and gynaecology--<P>


<a name="column_568"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 568</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with the need for consultants to be on the labour ward--I beg the Government to examine the issue closely and with a degree of urgency.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, this bullet must clearly be bitten by the Government and I hope the Minister will say that it is being bitten. Whether the type of biting will be acceptable to your Lordships remains to be seen.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-25_para1"></a>The nub of the new amendment is in new subsection (5). As I read the Bill, subsection (4) is not necessary. Under Clause 7(1) and (2), the Secretary of State may give directions to health authorities and NHS trusts on virtually anything. In my book, the nub of all this and arguably the solution--I should like to hear what the Minister has to say--is new subsection (5) of the amendment, rather than the two together.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord McColl, has returned to the very important issue of consultant and medical workforce planning. I do not believe that there is any doubt that anyone who has lived and worked within the NHS for many years would acknowledge that this is a matter that we have struggled with to get right. We still have difficulty in meeting some of the points raised tonight by noble Lords. To get the right balance between national strategy and the issues that face those who run the health service locally is very difficult. I am not convinced that to take a directional approach from the centre is the right way forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-25_para2"></a>Clearly, we must ensure that medical and other workforce planning reflects forecast service needs and available resources. It is in the interests of both the NHS and those in training that we get this right. But the amendment goes on to specify a power to require that local posts be created to match a central forecast or recommendation. That surely goes too far. The noble Lord, Lord McColl, himself acknowledged this evening that no one suggested for a moment that all those trained in a specialty should be guaranteed jobs. As my noble friend the Minister said when the noble Lord raised similar matters in relation to Clause 8 during Committee stage, the Government reject as a matter of principle that direction should play a part in medical workforce planning. We prefer to work in co-operation with NHS trusts.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-25_para3"></a>The whole experience of the NHS shows that unless one balances out national medical workforce planning and the needs of local NHS services one will never be able to deal with the problem successfully. NHS trusts are themselves in the best position to judge the staffing and grade mix required to deliver high quality patient services within the framework of their local health improvement programme and service agreements with local health authorities and primary care groups and trusts. In making those judgments they will also be guided by the requirements of clinical governance.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-25_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, spoke about responsibility; and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, spoke about a circle of responsibility. Noble Lords will be aware that in terms of the relationship between the number of junior doctors in training and the number of <P>


<a name="column_569"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 569</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consultants the Speciality Workforce Advisory Group and its associated processes already exist to provide a central assessment both of likely future service needs for consultants and the number of staff in training needed to supply them. Both NHS management and the main professional interests are directly represented on this group. That is of crucial importance because, almost for the first time, it has brought together those people concerned with workforce planning at national level and those concerned with managing services at local level.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-25_para5"></a>Every year this group agrees its recommendation to Ministers about the number of higher specialist training places needed to fill consultant posts in the future on the basis of input from the colleges, NHS management, educationists and other interested bodies. We believe that these arrangements ensure that national workforce planning is properly informed by the local NHS perspective. This should mean in turn that NHS trusts' local workforce decisions are informed by the national planning to which they have contributed. But to go beyond this and pre-empt individual local decisions would go far too far. For that reason I cannot therefore support the amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-25_para6"></a>I stress that while the Government do not believe that these amendments are the right way forward, they nonetheless recognise the real issues to be addressed. Matching forecast demand with planned supply is a complex issue, especially for a multi-disciplinary service like the NHS, with a long period involved in completing full medical training.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may put one point to the Minister. The tone of his response is variable, which I find interesting. He said that he did not believe that a directional approach was the right one. When I read these amendments I cannot see such an approach. It is a matter of establishing the appropriate mechanisms at the centre rather than a directional approach.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-25_para7"></a>In the Minister's response, I did not hear him say that the current system is not working well. Clearly there is a crisis. SWAG may have brought people together but, having brought them together, is it effective? We may be living on past rather than current methods of planning.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-25_para8"></a>I am sorry to ask the Minister a rather long question. However, from the tone of his response it does not sound as though there is a great sense that the current system is inadequate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I did not mean to give the impression that I am complacent about the issues which noble Lords have raised. Indeed, my experience in the NHS is that medical workforce planning and the tying of it into service needs has been one of the most difficult issues faced by the NHS. Simply taking directional powers to specify the number of consultants posts centrally is not necessarily the most appropriate and practical way forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-25_para9"></a>One of the problems that we have had over many years is that the needs of the service have not been matched sufficiently with medical workforce planning <P>


<a name="column_570"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 570</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>decisions made at the centre. That is why it is so important that in this SWAG group, almost for the first time, people managing the service in the field are working and meeting face to face with the people concerned with the number of doctors and specialists who are to be trained in the future. I believe that is a significant advance.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-25_para10"></a>But we are talking about long lead times. I do not think that one will ever get the situation exactly right. Of course it takes time for improvements to come through. I believe that I made that clear in my remarks. I believe that one can point to some improvements in addressing shortages in specialties such as anaesthetics and accident and emergency. Nevertheless, I believe that minimizing shortages or oversupply remains a difficult balancing act.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-25_para11"></a>I accept, as the noble Lord, Lord Patel, suggested, that many issues remain to be sorted out. Improving the way in which national and local planning mesh together is important. Our intention is that the health improvement programme process will ensure better local links between service planning and identification of the workforce consequences both for medical posts and other professional groups. At the same time we are looking at ways of improving the linkages between local planning and the way in which the picture is drawn together at regional and national level. We recognise and are committed to the need to strengthen those arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-25_para12"></a>We have discussed the particular concerns over obstetrics and gynaecology. I do not think that I can add a great deal to what my noble friend said in Committee on those issues. We recognise the concerns about job prospects for those completing higher specialist training in that specialty. That is why arrangements were made for postgraduate deans to give one-off extensions to specialist registrar contracts for 18 months to allow more time for those involved to seek posts. Postgraduate deans will be keeping closely in touch with those concerned as the period comes to an end for the first group, to offer advice about job and other opportunities. In parallel we have already reduced the number of higher specialist trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology so as to try to bring supply and demand back into balance.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-25_para13"></a>I listened again to the prescription of the noble Lord, Lord McColl, that no new trainees should be taken on until all who have completed training have consultant posts. But that would have a negative effect. It would effectively close down the specialty for at least two years, making it difficult to generate recruitment after that time.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McColl of Dulwich: </B>   My Lords, I have not suggested that we stop all training in obstetrics; what I suggested was whether, as we are making 100 redundant every year, it is sensible to recruit more. The plans are to recruit 65 starting in April of this year and that has been agreed at the Department of Health. Why?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-26_para0"></a>I suggest that we do not recruit 65 this year. How on earth can that possibly be disruptive to the service, when all these people are there? I suggest that we do what we <P>


<a name="column_571"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 571</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>used to do in the old days: do not sack them; keep them on, but stop bringing in more trainees who are less experienced. Why do we not do that?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-26_para1"></a>The junior staff in this country will be in utter despair when they read what the noble Lord has just said. They will realise that he gives the impression that he does not understand what he is talking about. Could I have an answer to the question why we do not stop the recruitment of trainees for just one year? That would do something, though I think that it should be done for several years.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-26_para2"></a>Could I also ask the noble Lord about the &#163;5.4 million which has been taken out of the obstetrics training budget this year and given to another specialty? Why could not that be used to create more consultant posts?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-26_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, I must remind the House that this is Report stage and the Minister is winding up on an amendment. It would be very useful if noble Lords refreshed themselves from the Companion for guidance on procedure in relation to the Report stage of this Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the clarification by the noble Lord, Lord McColl, of the point he is raising. He is presumably suggesting that the recruitment of trainees be stopped for a certain period. I believe that that would have a negative effect on future recruitment to the specialty overall.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-26_para3"></a>Nevertheless, we have reduced the number of higher specialist trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology in order to try to bring supply and demand back into balance. As my noble friend explained at Committee stage, a working group with membership drawn from the medical and midwifery professions and from NHS management has been exploring every angle to improve the staffing position in this specialty. A way forward has now been agreed. We shall launch a series of local workshops, including NHS trusts, health authorities, the professions and others to take the agenda forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-26_para4"></a>There clearly can be no complacency about the matters which have been raised by noble Lords in this debate. I do not believe that the amendment itself offers the appropriate way forward but the comments which have been made have been extremely valuable and I will ensure that those are communicated to the people most concerned with these issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-26_para5"></a>We are dealing with difficult issues to which, to my certain knowledge, the NHS has not found a solution in the 50 years or more of its existence. I believe that the only sensible and proper way forward is by a continuing dialogue between those responsible for setting targets and dealing with medical workforce issues at a national level and those responsible for managing the National Health Service at a local level. I believe that we have the machinery to enable that to happen. It will not be easy and it will take time; nonetheless, I think that we <P>


<a name="column_572"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 572</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have the right mechanism with which to deal with the issue. On that basis, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McColl of Dulwich: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for speaking in an intervention; I thought that I was responding to the amendment. The Minister's reply was disappointing, and a large number of junior staff will be utterly dismayed. Indeed, patients will become more apprehensive as they see their services deteriorating. I cannot for the life of me imagine why the Government cannot stop training this year and possibly next. There is no way in which that will make a hole in the service. We have been there before, we did that years ago, and there was no lack of recruitment or continuity in the service when trainees were retained instead of being sacked. It is a myth and I do not understand how it was perpetuated. And it will be seen as a myth by the vast number of trainees who are looking forward to a solution to the problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-26_para6"></a>The Minister today and the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, previously said that the Government did not believe in diktat. It was not so long ago that the Secretary of State threatened to sack all the chief executives of the trusts if they did not reduce the number of people on the waiting lists. We all know that the number is irrelevant; what matters is how long they wait. If he can do that with something as irrelevant as the number of people on the waiting list, why can he not say to the NHS trusts, "We have a problem. We would like you to restore the 33 per cent. cut made last year in the number of new consultant obstetric posts"? The problem is so serious that I wish to test the opinion of the House.

<A NAME = "90315-26_para11"></a>Clause 8 [Establishment orders]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-26_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Howe </B>   moved Amendment No. 23:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 9, line 2, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) The functions which shall be specified in an order under subsection (1) above include a duty to comply with any direction the Secretary of State may make in respect of the establishment of an occupational health service.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-26_para12"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, this is an important amendment, but it is an amendment not without some irony. Last week the Minister for Public Health, Tessa Jowell, launched the healthy workplace initiative, which is designed to encourage employers to commit themselves to improve health in the workplace. Better health in the workplace leads to better productivity, fewer accidents and less absence through sickness. That is all extremely worthwhile.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-26_para13"></a>Unfortunately, there is one organisation in which health, safety and welfare are not universally guaranteed, and that is the NHS. Access to occupational health services in the NHS throughout the UK is patchy, particularly in the primary care sector. It is true that there exists guidance from the NHS Executive on occupational health policy, but that guidance is only "commended"; it is not monitored, nor enforced. Meanwhile, prosecutions of health authorities and trusts for breaches of health and safety legislation are on the increase. That is bad for staff and bad for patients.
<P>


<a name="column_574"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 574</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-26_para14"></a>The NHS should have an across-the-board facility to provide occupational health services for members of the NHS workforce. Those services could be organised and co-ordinated regionally. Within a district the organisation could be undertaken by an occupational health doctor and a senior occupational health nurse, alongside a human resources officer. That team would share accountability with the health authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-26_para15"></a>The responsibility should not stop at that level. The NHS Executive should take the ultimate responsibility for monitoring the availability of occupational health services across the NHS. One million people work within the National Health Service. At a time when patient demand is increasing and staff numbers are low, it is all the more important that there should be proper professional structures in place, designed to help reduce work stress, eliminate hazards in the workplace, ensure the provision of lifting and handling equipment and carry out those matters identified in the Green Paper, Our Healthier Nation, aimed at raising standards of health. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I rise briefly to support the amendment. As the noble Earl said, of course, it is good to see the launch of the Department of Health and the Health and Safety Executive sign-up campaign. That must be translated into action within the health service.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para0"></a>There are certainly a number of particular cases where occupational health services are badly needed and one only needs to read representations made in connection with the amendment, particularly from the Royal College of Nursing, to understand the need for occupational health services. There are areas where, because of the independent contractual status of GPs, GP practice nurses--there are 18,000 such nurses--have no access to occupational health services. Research by the University of Sheffield found that nurses in general are 40 per cent. more likely to suffer stress than are other groups of professional and technical workers. One could relate this to a whole range of professionals working in the health service. It is clearly important that all should have a high level of occupational health service available to them. I support the noble Earl in his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl has raised a very important issue. In the past, perhaps the NHS has not done as well as it ought with regard to occupational health.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para1"></a>Legislation already exists in relation to the provision of occupational health services for employees. Section 2(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 lays a duty on every employer,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his employees". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para2"></a>This is viewed by the Department of Health and the Health and Safety Executive, in their capacity as inspecting authority, as placing upon NHS management a duty to provide comprehensive occupational health services for their staff. This provision forms part of all inspections by health and safety inspectors and failure <P>


<a name="column_575"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 575</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to provide an adequate service can result in the issuing of an improvement notice or result, where necessary, in prosecution.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para3"></a>The NHS Executive has further strengthened this line by including the provision of quality occupational health services for all staff as an objective in the new framework for managing human resources--Working Together, Securing a quality workforce for the NHS. This document sets out the framework for improving the health, welfare and working conditions of all NHS staff and raises these issues to the top of the management agenda where they should be.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para4"></a>Research carried out for the NHS Executive in March 1998 suggests that all NHS employees have access to occupational health services provided by their employers. The quality of provision varies and this is being addressed as part of the human resources strategic framework, Working Together.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para5"></a>The NHS Executive issued The Management of Health, Safety and Welfare Issues for NHS Staff in the spring of 1998 setting out details of what constitutes a comprehensive occupational health service and encouraging NHS employers to work towards this for their staff. This has been extremely well received by the field and is being widely used as the standard for negotiating provision by outside contractors.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para6"></a>I very much take the noble Earl's point about the importance of occupational health services in the NHS. I believe that that is a shared aim. I hope that I have explained that the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 lays down the duties that the NHS is already required to undertake. Taking that and the management action which I have described into account, I hope that the noble Earl will find this reassuring and will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-27_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. I do find it reassuring, at least in part. By the noble Lord's own admission, the system across the country has been patchy: in some places it has worked reasonably well, although in others it has not. Clearly, there is work to be done. I worry that although, as the Minister rightly pointed out, duties are enshrined in law, there is not a tight enough system to enable shortcomings to be identified and corrected, as they should be. However, with those words, and in view of the hour, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para7"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para8"></a>Clause 13 [Duty of quality]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-27_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Howe </B>   moved Amendment No. 24:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 11, line 8, after ("arrangements") insert (", including identifying adequate resources,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para9"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, this amendment is designed to highlight one of life's simple truths--that in healthcare, as in any other area, you get what you pay for. If you believe in a quality agenda--clearly, we all do although we may disagree about the means to that end--you have to invest the money and the support staff to ensure that you achieve it. The commission for health improvement needs to do its job properly and it has a wide remit. I do not know--perhaps the Minister can <P>


<a name="column_576"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 576</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tell us--what it will cost to set up and run the commission and how many employees the Government expect it to have; nor do I know what kind of additional funding will be made available to trusts to enable them to put the necessary systems in place to implement the new statutory requirements. Where is the money to be found and how much money will be needed?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para10"></a>I very much hope that the Minister will not say that each trust will need to find the necessary money from within existing budgets. That implies a knock-on effect to other parts of the service. We hear a great deal about the additional resources that the Government have committed to the NHS over the rest of this Parliament. If they mean business on delivering quality, I should have thought that this is one area that ought to have a call on that additional pool of resources.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para11"></a>The way that the quality agenda is supported centrally will have a very big impact on the degree of credibility carried by the policy as a whole once it is put into practice. Trying to implement the quality agenda on the cheap simply will not work because no one will have confidence in the results. The results will depend on assessments that have an objective basis to them. As I said in Committee, to judge the performance of a surgeon or of a specialist you need a reliable series of bench-marks which are themselves compiled from representative data on outcomes. It is a fact that at present very few specialist disciplines have such information available. Therefore, does the Minister agree that a great deal of data collection and analysis will need to be done in the first instance to enable the commission to do its work? If so, how is that to be funded and in what way will it be done?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para12"></a>My second quite separate question relates to the revalidation of GPs. The proposals for revalidation are not yet fully worked out, but it is already clear that testing the competence of a GP to continue practising will not be a cheap exercise. Revalidation is a concept which brings together two of the big issues in the Bill; namely, the quality agenda and the self-regulation of the medical profession. To what extent are the Government prepared to consider helping with the costs that this will inevitably entail? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-27_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I rise to express my support for the amendment. As we on these Benches have made clear, we support the establishment of the commission for health improvement. As in education, we recognise that there are many ways in which the quality of service provision can be raised. Just as Ofsted in education is a mechanism for stimulating and monitoring improvements, so we see the new commission as having that responsibility in health.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para13"></a>However, as in education, the new quality framework is not costless, as the noble Earl made clear. Anyone present in the Chamber who has been a school governor will know the time and energy required from all teachers, especially the top management team, to prepare the necessary documentation for a full inspection. Exactly the same will be true of CHIMP. Sufficient time, money and, indeed, support must be <P>


<a name="column_577"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 577</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>invested to make it work properly. This amendment looks to the Secretary of State to allocate sufficient funding to meet these requirements. We fully support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-27_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I, too, strongly support the amendment. I do so because I believe that resources are absolutely essential. I mentioned earlier tonight--and I repeat it now--that even at this stage when we are just getting to primary care groups, let alone to other issues with which we shall deal later, the resources are not there. I have in mind, for example, the Berkshire health authority. I mentioned Slough, which is an area with a great many single-handed practitioners and quite a deprived population. There is no communication between practices and many people have to work on their own. Others do not have a computer; indeed, some of them have non-matching computers. The debts being passed on from Berkshire health authority are enormous.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para14"></a>If things are so bad, and if something does not happen on 1st April, how will we know the outcome? Unless we can be confident that there is adequate resourcing for the next much more important stage after the PCGs, I believe that we need this amendment. It crystallises the whole issue as regards these necessary resources. I support it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_time0"></A><H5>10.30 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-27_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, we have had a brief but interesting debate on the link between resources and service quality. However, I should point out to the House that the amendment as it stands does not deal with the commission for health improvement; indeed, it deals with the duty of quality which is to be placed on primary care trusts. However, I would not wish that to stand in the way of debate on how quality is resourced.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para15"></a>As I say, I recognise that there are important links between resources and service quality, although perhaps a recurrent theme that I have been trying to put forward in looking at quality is that high quality services sometimes are also cost-effective services, and sometimes improvement and investment in quality lead to longer term savings. I believe that that was the point that the noble Lord, Lord McColl, made earlier; namely, that it may be more cost effective to employ highly qualified staff than to pay the costs of litigation that may arise if one does not employ them. That leads me to say that special funding for quality cannot be ring-fenced or handled through a separate stream of funds. The whole quality agenda of the Government is concerned with the way we use all resources, not just some resources that are earmarked for improving quality.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para16"></a>As regards revalidation, it is premature to consider the costing of that. The GMC has only recently taken a view on that issue. There is a great deal to do. It has not made any attempt to assess the financial implications of the proposals. Even if the individual clinician bore the costs of any assessment requirements, there would be implications for NHS employers in terms of providing locum cover and possible remedial training costs. We would not wish to attribute the ongoing costs of CPD, <P>


<a name="column_578"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 578</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which would of course underpin the success of any revalidation system. There are important issues to be explored there.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para17"></a>As I say, this amendment is concerned with putting a duty on primary care trusts and NHS trusts to put in place arrangements to monitor and improve the quality of healthcare they provide to individuals. The amendment would require them also to identify adequate resources for this. It is, of course, important that the arrangements which trusts put in place are backed up by the appropriate resources. As I say, in some instances investment in quality may lead to a longer term saving.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para18"></a>However, in placing a duty on NHS trusts and primary care trusts to identify adequate resources, the amendment would appear to be giving them some responsibility for the size of the total sum of resources available to them. That would be to impose on them a responsibility which they could not reasonably discharge. It is, and has always been, the proper responsibility of government to determine the appropriate level of resources for the NHS. It is likewise the responsibility of government to make arrangements to promote the fair distribution of resources to health authorities and now for health authorities to arrange allocation to their primary care groups and their primary care trusts.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para19"></a>The roles which can properly be discharged locally include decisions through the health improvement programme process on how the resources available to the local healthcare system can best be deployed to respond to national and local priorities and needs. Our forthcoming guidance on clinical governance will make clear that if issues with significant resource implications emerge from that process, they should be explored in the context of the health improvement programme. In addition, NHS trusts and those primary care trusts with direct responsibility for providing services will, of course, need to have regard to the implications for service quality in deciding how best to deploy their own resources. That is already encompassed within the duty as drafted,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to put and keep in place arrangements for ... improving the quality of health care".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
We believe these proper local responsibilities in the matter of deploying resources to maintain and improve service quality are already properly covered. So far as responsibility for securing resources is concerned, the Government have no intention of trying to confer their own proper role on others. Our recognition of the challenges facing the NHS informed the results of our comprehensive spending review when we committed an extra &#163;18 billion to the NHS in England over three years. Noble Lords who can remember as far back as seven o'clock this evening will remember that I announced the investment this coming year of an extra &#163;100 million into modernising A&E departments and improving rapid access to professional advice and help for patients. All those things are about improving quality within the NHS and providing the resources so to do. This time of night is perhaps not the best time for an extended debate on expenditure records or the pressures and opportunities facing the NHS. However, I suggest <P>


<a name="column_579"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 579</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to the House that an amendment to this clause to confer on NHS trusts and primary care trusts a responsibility that they are simply not in a position to discharge is not the best way forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_time1"></A><H5>10.30 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-27_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for her comments on the amendment. I take her point that I am guilty of going wide of the amendment in addressing the issue of resources for the quality agenda generally, including the commission for health improvement. But the point that the amendment seeks to bring out is that, with a duty placed upon them to improve the quality of healthcare as the clause demands of them, primary care trusts and NHS trusts cannot just shrug off the issue of how that will be paid for. While they may not have a responsibility to provide those resources, they must address those issues. However, I shall read carefully what the Minister said and reflect further. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-27_para20"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones </B>   moved Amendment No. 25:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 11, line 17, at end insert ("including, without prejudice to the generality of this section, general clinical care as well as medical treatment, and the promotion of health,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-28_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, perhaps I may remind your Lordships of the definition in the Bill of health care:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'health care' means services for or in connection with the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of illness". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Amendment No. 25 is designed to ensure that the definition is rather wider. It seeks to add the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"including, without prejudice to the generality of this section, general clinical care as well as medical treatment, and the promotion of health". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is similar to, but significantly different in one respect from the amendment which we put forward from these Benches in Committee. The difference is that we seek to include the words "and the promotion of health".
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-28_para1"></a>In Committee the Minister's case was that the existing definition was wide enough and would cover many of the points on general clinical care raised in our amendment. In Committee the noble Baroness said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The duty, we believe, is broad enough to cover not only medical interventions but certainly nursing care".--[Official Report, 1/3/99; col. 1384.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
At face value, that is a perfectly fair statement. But the more one looks at that definition, the more one sees that it does not cover all the cases it should cover if the duty of quality is to mean anything. In particular, let us consider the reception of pregnant women or the position of women immediately after childbirth. That surely is not covered by "illness". I cannot believe that that is the case. The termination of pregnancy is not "illness". I could cite a number of other aspects; for example, the carrying out of surgical procedures under anaesthesia. That is not always a question of illness. They are procedures often carried out on perfectly well people. This means that the definition is certainly faulty in that respect.
<P>


<a name="column_580"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 580</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-28_para2"></a>The second respect in which it is faulty is that it refers to the prevention of illness. Surely that is not the same as the promotion of health. The prevention of illness is much narrower in scope. The promotion of health is, as the Minister said, very much something for which the PCTs will be responsible in their new incarnations. Having wrestled with this point since the Committee stage, I believe that there is a case for the department to consider the definition and come back with something rather wider. Otherwise, the duty of quality will not carry the weight that is being placed on it in the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-28_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I support this amendment. It is phrased in a different way from the similar amendment that was moved in Committee. The Minister argued in Committee that it was unnecessary to expand the definition of health care in the way proposed. I, too, have re-read her remarks. I confess that I am still uncertain about the matter. In particular, like the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, I wonder whether the prevention of illness is the same as the promotion of health. It does not seem to me to be the same. Nor am I certain whether the treatment of illness includes the kinds of nursing activity referred to so powerfully by Christine Hancock at last week's RCN congress: an end to mixed sex wards; the privacy and dignity of the patient; emotional support; the absence of noise on a ward, and so on.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-28_para3"></a>If a nurse is instrumental in planning the discharge of a patient successfully from hospital and providing information to the patient, is that really part of the patient's treatment? Similarly, if a nurse with expertise in pain control alleviates a patient's physical distress, is that necessarily part of the treatment of an illness, or is it rather an example of a much broader type of care? I do not know the answer to that. But if there is any doubt about it, some words, such as those in the amendment, should be included in the Bill. General clinical care is too important a part of the quality agenda to be left to argument in court as to what is meant by treatment of an illness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-28_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I do not have any quarrel whatsoever with the general thrust of argument used in support of this amendment. I hope that I signalled that when we had a similar debate in Committee. However, we return to matters of drafting. Perhaps I may try to clarify further why we believe that these amendments are not necessary to encompass exactly the kinds of activity mentioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-28_para4"></a>We define "health care" in the duty in Clause 13(4)as,

I draw the attention of the House to the words, "or in connection with", which significantly broaden the scope of the definition.

Again, I draw the attention of the House explicitly to the inclusion of nursing care. It is clear, when one examines the Bill carefully--although I am the first to concede that one needs to look below the surface--that there is no question of the definition of health care equating solely with medical care.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-28_para6"></a>It is our belief and intention that the duty covers all those basic aspects of patient care which impact in one way or another on an individual's health and recovery. So far as a hospital is concerned, I see those as including cleanliness and hygiene, nutrition, and so forth. The HAS 2000 Report highlighted concerns that elderly patients in particular should be confident of basic care and nutrition as part of their hospital treatment and care. I am sure that none of us would dissent from that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-28_para7"></a>I do not believe that the addition of "general clinical care" on the face of the Bill would add to what is already there. One would then have to define that in a more precise way, and I cannot immediately think how that might be done in a way that addresses areas not already covered by the existing definition of health care.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-28_para8"></a>I suggest that we also need to think very carefully about what would in practice be added to the duty if we were to add "promotion of health" to "prevention of illness". It is important to remember that we are dealing with a duty of quality related to the role of NHS trusts and primary care trusts in providing services. I can see that one might argue for a broader view of health-promoting activity in connection with the role of health authorities and primary care trusts in working with local government to promote the health of local communities in a wider sense. But I suggest that that is the territory of the duty of partnership. So far as the provision of health care by NHS bodies to individuals is concerned--that is what the duty of quality is all about--activities related to the prevention of illness will surely also have a health promoting effect and vice versa. One can think of examples of activities such as immunisation, smoking cessation support, healthy eating advice, and all kinds of things that noble Lords were stretching to ensure would be covered in the definition. They all relate to both the promotion of good health and the prevention of illness and are therefore encompassed by the duty as currently drafted. Indeed, the very act of providing high quality treatment and care plays its part, one might argue, in promoting better health.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-28_para9"></a>I certainly share the view that the NHS should be just that: a health service, not merely a sickness service. But I believe that, for the purposes of the duty of quality, "prevention of illness" is a broad enough term to cover all that is intended. However, in the spirit of reading through the entrails after our previous debate, as noble Lords have done, I shall be happy, in the light of the specific points that have been raised in the debate, to check once again that nothing which has been pinpointed as essential in the contributions that noble Lords have made tonight is beyond the scope of the present definition. I hope that, with that assurance, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>authorship was so strong that there was no way that there was going to be any improvement on that definition of "health care". Clearly I think that there should be. It is a genuine concern. One wants to make sure that the services that the noble Earl and I mentioned are covered. I thank the noble Baroness for her undertaking to look again to see whether the definition can be improved. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones </B>   moved Amendment No. 26:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 11, line 20, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) The Commission for Health Improvement shall, except in exceptional circumstances, be guided by the relevant national service frameworks, the standards set by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and other relevant national standards as regards best practice in clinical care and treatment.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-28_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the hour is late and I think that it would probably be more suitable to have a debate on this important aspect at a later stage of the Bill. We had some debate on the matter in Committee. It relates to the important area of postcode prescribing and the way in which many groups feel that there is no rhyme or reason for the way in which certain health authorities allow prescribing of certain drugs. I have particularly in mind beta-interferon for MS sufferers and Aricept for those who suffer from Alzheimer's disease, but I could cite many other examples. The concern is that the commission, which is a potentially powerful new body, should be guided by national standards in order to ensure that there is not a continuation of that postcode prescribing.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-28_para13"></a>At Committee stage the Minister rather chided me for proposing too limited an amendment in that the only national standards and guidelines referred to were those produced by NICE. Of course, there were national service frameworks. I have attempted to cure that in this amendment by including the important national service frameworks. The Minister said in Committee:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As I say, I think it important that the commission is guided not only by NICE but that it considers best practice in clinical care and treatment, and particularly national service frameworks. I do not wish to specify only NICE guidance as that which the commission should take on board and which it should ensure is being implemented".--[Official Report, 1/3/99; col. 1389.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Neither do I. I am perfectly happy to bring in the national standards. There were other national standards, and the noble Earl introduced an interesting amendment on those in Committee. It is, however, extremely important that NICE's standards are enforced by CHIMP. If that is not the case, what is NICE there for? Is everything purely voluntary within the health service?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-28_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said that the Government would be concerned if there were an unacceptable delay in the implementation of guidance. She acknowledged that the Secretary of State for Health had the power to enforce compliance with NICE guidance under the terms of the National Health Service Act 1977. But she gave no commitment that the Government would use those powers to enforce the guidance. For instance, if CHIMP spotted in its reviews that a particular trust was not <P>


<a name="column_583"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 583</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>observing the national service framework, what would be the consequence of that? What is a reasonable delay to expect an NHS trust to encounter before putting the national service framework into practice?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-28_para15"></a>All in all, it is extremely important that the standards of NICE and those of the national service framework are enforced by the commission. There is a suspicion among many of the bodies that have promoted the amendment that the reason for not making NICE or national framework standards enforceable is cost--that automatically central funding will be required to ensure that local health authorities and trusts act on the recommendation, for example, to introduce a new drug. When the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, was Minister of State, she told an all-party group on MS in April 1998 that the Treasury was resistant to making NICE guidance mandatory for precisely that reason. If that is the case, it is worrying.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-28_para16"></a>It is notable that in the case of the notorious 1995 beta-interferon circular to which I referred in Committee, the department did not provide extra money to assist the introduction of the new drug, even though that was national policy. There are issues here. The amendment is based on somewhat unhappy experience as a result of that circular and continuing forms of postcode prescribing. I hope that the Minister will be able to give extra comfort in that respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-28_para17"></a>Of course one does not want national standards to be enforced in an over-prescriptive way. We had that debate in Committee. Nobody believes that is the best way forward. There has to be flexibility and understanding of the fact that different trusts operate in different ways. The broad principle that the national standards should be enforceable is one that a great many people support. I commend the amendment to the House. I beg to move.

<A NAME="90315-29_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I have a little difficulty with this amendment. If one takes, for the sake of argument, a benign view of NICE's role and the way that the commission will operate, we are back to the point made by my noble friend Lord Renton the other day in another context, which was,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Expressio unius est exclusio alterius". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
In other words, if one mentions one thing on the face of the Bill, one is by implication excluding other things.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para0"></a>I agreed with the Minister when she said in Committee that it is not only the guidance from NICE and relevant national standards that the commission will want to take account of but a broader range of issues--especially those relevant to particular circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para1"></a>With great respect to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, the phrase "except in exceptional circumstances" is most unsatisfactory. We are talking here about guidance, not rigid adherence to a rule book. If it is said that the commission ought to be guided by the standards set by NICE, that implies that the system will allow some discretion and latitude. If one qualifies that by citing "exceptional circumstances", the messages that go out will be rather more confused. I return to the point that we do not want and cannot have the word <P>


<a name="column_584"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 584</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>"guidance" used as a synonym for direction, yet there are overtones of just that in the amendment by virtue of the phrase "except in exceptional circumstances".
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para2"></a>Clinical governance will only work and be acceptable to the medical profession if it is administered with a light touch and there is built-in flexibility. I am uneasy about the amendment for those reasons.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Patel: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Howe. It would be difficult if the commission were only to take guidance from NICE and national service frameworks. As I understand it, NICE will not only advise about the appropriate use of drugs, but issue guidelines, and that is what they are--guidelines. Local hospitals and clinicians will develop appropriate protocols. Other organisations, not least the colleges, produce guidelines. It is inappropriate if the only standards to be used are those of NICE.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-29_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, we have returned briefly to a subject that evoked strong feelings in our debates at Committee stage. I have no quarrel with the broad objectives of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, in moving this amendment. The setting of national standards will play a key part in delivering a truly national health services and ensuring that patients receive the best care. Our intention is clear. We want an NHS that offers dependable, high standards of care and treatment everywhere. The problems and distrust created by completely unacceptable variations in access to services and prescribing that have been echoed tonight are clear. The care provided should be appropriate to people's needs and effective in drawing on the best available clinical evidence and maximising health gain for the population. That is what drives our quality programme. At other points in the debates I have said that I believe that to be a comprehensive and coherent approach.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para3"></a>We take seriously the business of raising standards and promoting the consistent application of the best evidence. There is no difference between us as to that aim. But I share with the noble Earl, Lord Howe, concerns about the exact strength of the touch and how dirigiste we are about the way in which the commission goes about its work. I chided the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, about his failure to give a definition that was not wider than NICE. He has come back with a definition of other relevant national standards. The world being as it is, he will not be surprised if I now criticise that particular definition in this amendment. Because we do not have a definition of it, it does not suggest who should make the judgment of what is relevant in this instance. I was very interested to hear the noble Lord, Lord Patel, put in a bid for Royal College standards not to be omitted from the list of possible standards to be taken into account.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para4"></a>If the judgment as to what is a relevant national standard is for the commission itself, it is not clear what is to be gained by putting this on the face of the Bill. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, there is no indication of what the exceptional circumstances may be in which the commission is not to be guided by--that is another phrase that will be difficult to define--relevant <P>


<a name="column_585"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 585</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>standards. We are all clear about the underlying intent, but there are considerable stumbling blocks as between this and sorting out legal definitions on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para5"></a>In connection with the duty of quality, we discussed in Committee the difficulty in foreseeing and defining now what national guidance or standards it might be appropriate to take into account in future. In the light of this amendment, I do not believe that we are any closer now than we were then to an answer that we can safely prescribe on the face of the Bill. I suggest that the difficulty in drafting appropriate provisions on points of this kind should cause us to ask whether it is right to attempt it in the first place. If we intend the commission to be guided, may we not be better advised to stick to guidance in this area?
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para6"></a>In practice, I believe it is inconceivable that the commission would not be guided by national service frameworks, the work of NICE or other appropriate guidance. National service frameworks and the national institute will in particular be key points of reference and will be for guidance. There is a danger in having too tight a hold on both individual local decision-making about priorities and circumstances and individual clinical decisions as between patients and clinicians.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para7"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will forgive my saying that I cannot accept this amendment any more than the earlier one, although I do not wish to deny the importance of the issue he raises.

<A NAME="90315-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Several different and interesting arguments have been used against the amendment. It was intended to be a light touch guidance; but clearly it has not been taken as such. The phrase "except in exceptional circumstances" was intended to do precisely that. However, it seems to have fallen foul of both the Minister and the noble Earl.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para8"></a>We are concerned that NICE has been set up but there is no real nexus with CHIMP as regards the legislation. We are worried that CHIMP is set up under the Bill but without standards to which it can refer. I am reassured by the noble Baroness's statement that it is inconceivable that CHIMP would not take on board the standards advocated by NICE and the national service frameworks. That may well be so. I hope that it is true. But time will tell.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the purpose of this amendment which we tabled at Committee stage as a probing amendment is to prevent the commission for health improvement from charging for its services. In the lengthy discussion at Committee stage, the Minister used the analogy of the work undertaken by the Audit Commission, including its value for money services, when NHS trusts pay individually for the work undertaken even when that work is part of a nationally commissioned study rather than being individually commissioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para19"></a>Our concern--as we made clear at Committee stage--is that such costs will inevitably come from hospital budgets and mean less money for patient care. The Minister made it clear that costs would come from that part of the budget allocated to administrative costs and that there need be no cost on patient care. But as we heard earlier, administrative costs in the NHS are not themselves excessive. We are not convinced by any of those arguments.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para20"></a>As I made clear in an earlier amendment, we see CHIMP as analogous not to the Audit Commission but to Ofsted: that it will be a regular inspection force concerned to maintain standards. As with Ofsted and unlike the Audit Commission's value for money studies, it will be part of a continuing series of inspections required by the Secretary of State as part of a programme of quality improvement. The trusts will not invite the CHIMP inspectors in; rather the inspection will be imposed upon the trusts. As with school inspections, there will be substantial costs incurred in preparing the necessary paper work for inspection which will fall on the administrative budget of the trust. That it should also then have to bear the commission's costs seems quite outrageous. It could not possibly be done without a special allocation that year to the administrative budget, which in effect means taking that year from the patient care budget. Unless there are allocations to the NHS budget from the Secretary of State to meet the costs of CHIMP, there is no way that its costs can be met without taking money out of the patient care budget.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para21"></a>In this case we take the view that the costs should be met from central funds and not from trust funds, which is the purpose of the amendment. The Minister replied that, if this were the case, the costs would be top-sliced from the sums already allocated to trusts. So be it, but this would have the advantage of making open and <P>


<a name="column_587"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 587</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>transparent how much CHIMP is costing and, in so far as it hit trust allocations, that it was marginally at the cost of patient care.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para22"></a>The costs and benefits need to be weighed up at the national level by the Secretary of State, because he is the person who is imposing the inspection. It would be quite different if, as my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones suggested at Committee stage, it were a matter of management consultancy, where the trust called the commission in to advise it. In such a case it is quite fair that the costs be met by the local trust, for it is up to the trust to weigh the costs and benefits of the exercise and to judge whether it is worth while; but this, as I have made clear, is not what is being proposed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para23"></a>What we have here is a regular inspection required by the Secretary of State. As such, we believe that this should be seen as a mechanism used by the Secretary of State to improve and maintain standards in the provision of healthcare, just as Ofsted is there to improve and maintain standards in education, and that its direct costs--like Ofsted's direct costs--should be met from the central health service's budget, preferably by an allocation of new money.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para24"></a>If successful, then over time its costs would be recouped by the extra efficiency it engenders within the service as a whole. If this is the case, then it should be viewed by the Secretary of State, and indeed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as an investment. The initial costs which would have to be borne now would over time be offset by a stream of benefits. But the cost benefit analysis must be for the Secretary of State, not for the local primary care or hospital trust. If Ofsted is the appropriate model, any inspection will impose enough costs in terms of preparation and paperwork. It adds insult to injury to suggest that the local trust should also pay for the direct costs of the inspection team.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-29_para25"></a>I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-30_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I too remain uneasy after our debate on this subject in Committee. We are back to the territory of a previous amendment which focused on resources to implement the quality agenda, and this is yet another example.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-30_para0"></a>I do not know what the annual operating budget of the Commission will be in future years, but it would be interesting if the Minister could give us an approximation. If in a few years' time that budget is charged out to trusts and health authorities, I cannot see how this could fail but to have an impact on the funds available for other areas of patient care. In many instances it would be an unbudgeted outlay. One can easily imagine cases where the commission is sent in to investigate a hospital on a false alarm, does a great deal of work and ends up by giving the hospital a clean bill of health. A fat bill at the end of that would be particularly galling to the hospital management.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-30_para1"></a>I sense that there is a balance to be struck on this question, setting aside for a moment extreme examples like the one I have just given. There has to be a sense of ownership by a trust of whatever the commission recommends, and that is a point which the noble <P>


<a name="column_588"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 588</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Baroness made in Committee. The bill for achieving it, however, should not be so great as to place the hospital in graver difficulties than it was before. It means that the monitoring and policing of the quality agenda should, in large measure but perhaps not completely, be funded centrally.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-30_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, like the noble Lords who have spoken, I too have been reflecting on the debate we had at Committee stage. I drew attention then, and do so now, to the fact that charging is in itself not an unusual arrangement in the NHS. In this way, for example, the Audit Commission supports its statutory duties with regard to financial audit and its value for money studies. Audited bodies fund this work through fees paid to local auditors appointed by the Audit Commission. So NHS bodies are perfectly familiar with this approach and accustomed to the need to budget for this kind of activity. This approach to charging encourages greater local involvement and ownership and provides a greater incentive to ensure that prompt action is taken in following up advice and recommendations.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-30_para2"></a>We have every reason to expect that the NHS locally will value the commission's input. The commission will have a clear role in providing advice and independent expertise. In its local reviews it will identify good practice and areas for improvement. Similarly, where the commission investigates local clinical problems, it will provide external advice and support to identify and address the root causes. In this way, the commission will help strengthen an organisation's capacity to assure and improve the quality of services it provides.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-30_para3"></a>I made clear in Committee that, in the first instance, we intend to finance the commission centrally. But it remains the Government's view that, once the commission has demonstrated its effectiveness in helping the NHS improve quality and tackle service problems, there is merit in moving towards a system where more of its work is directly funded locally. However, I accept the noble Earl's argument that it is perhaps a matter of balance.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-30_para4"></a>It may help if I address some of the concerns that have been raised about how future arrangements may work. The starting point is that arrangements for the recovery of costs must be fair, flexible and reasonable. The commission will recover expenditure only where it has properly incurred costs in carrying out its own functions. And it will be held properly to account for undertaking these effectively, efficiently and economically.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-30_para5"></a>In that respect, I differ from the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. I see no reason why in the commission's rolling programme of reviews, given reasonable notice, we should not expect local NHS bodies to plan and budget for this activity in the same way as they do now for Audit Commission activity. However, I accept that we need to think carefully about the rather different circumstances where a local NHS organisation decides it needs to call in the commission "off-cycle", as it were, to help investigate or pre-empt a potential problem; or where, exceptionally, the Secretary of State decides to send in the commission to investigate a serious problem. <P>


<a name="column_589"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 589</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I recognise and understand the concern over the possibility of perhaps heavy extra costs falling on an organisation already in some difficulty, and I would certainly want to avoid deterrents to a body inviting early help rather than allowing a potential problem to fester.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-30_para6"></a>I suggest that now is not the time to determine the detailed charging policy for the future, but I hope it will be helpful if I say that these are the kind of considerations we should weigh carefully when we come to do so. We need arrangements to ensure that the commission's role is valued and that its help is brought to bear promptly where it is needed, and this will inform any future plans in this respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-30_para7"></a>In summary, our aim will be to ensure flexibility and fairness in charges made by the commission. There will be additional safeguards in that the Bill provides for the Secretary of State to determine the charges that may be made by the commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-30_para8"></a>Important issues have been raised and what has been said today is valuable. We can take it into account in due course in developing our thinking on how charging arrangements will operate. I hope that in the light of the undertaking to take those considerations into account and the reassurances I have given, the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="90315-30_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her reply, although we are not totally satisfied with it. The words "fair", "flexible" and "reasonable" are easily said. It is also fair to say that it is reasonable for the trusts to plan and budget for those costs. But they are real costs and all local health authorities are under very tight budget constraints. However, I shall study the Minister's answer and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-30_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I hope that I can be both brief and satisfy the concerns of the House on this issue. In Committee it was suggested that qualified privilege would be more appropriate than the absolute privilege which was written into the Bill for the purpose of the commission for health improvement reports. Considerable concerns were raised and I agreed to take them away for further consideration. This amendment is the result of that consideration. We believe that it is important that the commission is able to be frank and open in identifying areas for improvement, and we will wish the commission to be able to make clear where NHS organisations are falling below the expected standards.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-30_para11"></a>In doing so, however, we should not wish the commission to become involved in unnecessary litigation which could delay the publication of reports and otherwise disrupt its important work. Nevertheless, I recognise the concerns which were expressed in Committee about conferring absolute privilege on the commission. That may well be an excessive provision. <P>


<a name="column_590"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 590</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>In the light of those concerns, we have reconsidered the position and have brought forward this amendment. Instead of absolute privilege, qualified privilege will protect the commission's reports against defamation unless it could be proved that the comments had been made with malice.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-30_para12"></a>It is worth stating that we expect the commission to act fairly in producing its reports. It will need to do so if it is to be successful in winning the trust and respect of NHS patients and the healthcare professions. After the comments which were made in Committee and further reflection, we now believe that giving the commission qualified privilege is appropriate. It is not necessary to have explicit provision on the face of the Bill because under common law the commission's reports will be subject to that qualified privilege. Therefore, I hope that this amendment will address the concerns which have been expressed. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-30_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may say how immensely grateful I am to the Minister for bringing forward this amendment and for taking on board so carefully the points raised in Committee from all sides of the Chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-30_para13"></a>I am convinced that this is the right way forward, not only as a means of leaving open the possibility of legal redress in very isolated cases but, much more important, as a means of ensuring that the culture of the commission will foster co-operation and trust. Removing the right of absolute privilege will go a long way towards doing that. I do not believe that there is any need to fear that without such a right the work of the commission will be in any way frustrated.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-30_para14"></a>It is a highly satisfactory outcome for all concerned. I thank the Minister warmly for the trouble she has taken to bring it about.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I too thank the Minister. This is a very elegant solution. It is so nice to see the complete deletion of a subsection from the Bill, even at this time of night.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 36 to 38 and 41 to 45. Noble Lords will remember that when this was discussed on previous occasions a plea was made that when it comes to confidentiality we really should have the same high standards on the face of the Bill as have been adopted by the General Medical Council. Why should the Bill have inferior standards of confidentiality?
<P>


<a name="column_591"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para1"></a>Noble Lords may think that the medical profession is being over-fussy about the whole subject of confidentiality, but to us and to the patients it is of great importance. I am sure that noble Lords are aware that doctors are obliged to adhere strictly to confidentiality and can break that obligation only under exceptional circumstances, for instance, where a failure to disclose information may expose a patient or others to the risk of death or serious harm.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para2"></a>When the amendments were discussed before, the Minister agreed that they highlighted the important issue of confidentiality of information relating to individuals, and went on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We intend and expect that information that is produced by the commission should, wherever possible, be in a form that protects the identity of the individual".--[Official Report, 1/3/99; col. 1434.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para3"></a>We are concerned with absolutes, not "whenever possibles". The Minister went on to say,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The intention is that the circumstances in which information that identifies an individual is obtained without consent are kept to the absolute minimum necessary to ensure that the commission is able to fulfil its functions". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
In other words, she seemed to be saying that the means justifies the end. I am not sure that that is acceptable.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para4"></a>Amendments Nos. 35, 41 and 42 try to make sure that the same rights of confidentiality over medical records apply to deceased persons and patients no longer in contact with their doctor. In Amendment No. 37, we again emphasise that if an individual cannot be traced, confidentiality should, nevertheless, be protected. The Minister's answer to that was that the Government expect there to be "confidentiality wherever possible". However, I would suggest that confidentiality wherever possible and confidentiality unless it interferes with the work of the commission, are not tight enough provisions. In col. 1435, she expressed the concern that the provisions of Amendments Nos. 36 and 38 will impose too heavy a burden on the holders of confidential documents as they will require them to make a difficult judgment about what might be ascertained from their information when placed together with material outside their control. As far as concerns confidentiality, I believe that there should be a heavy burden on those who hold confidential documents. The Minister went on to say in col. 1437 that she would be happy to consider what further guidance or secondary legislation might be framed to cover what she described as "rare eventualities". It will be interesting to know whether she has had further thoughts about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para5"></a>Later on the Minister went on to say that she thought it would be wrong to prohibit the commission assessing information about deceased patients. We have no wish to do that. Our wish is to maintain confidentiality. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I rise to speak briefly to Amendment No. 43 in this group of amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, in the debate in Committee cogently noted that it was important that such duties should be aligned with the general duties of confidentiality of the medical profession as generally understood. In the context of this <P>


<a name="column_592"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 592</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment, which inserts the word "serious" before "criminal offence" in line 13 on page 15, I note that the General Medical Council's recently issued guidance, Confidentiality: Providing and Protecting Information, says that disclosure of information may be justified,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"where a serious crime which would be likely to involve the risk of serious harm or death could be prevented or detected. Serious crimes will usually be crimes against the person, including abuse of children". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para6"></a>That is clear. Of course, it is not a precise legal definition, but it is clearly what the medical profession is bound by and understands to be the duty of confidentiality. One does not have to look far for a legal definition. The Police Act 1997 contains provisions on entry, and interference with property and wireless telegraphy in the course of the prevention or detection of crime. Section 63 of the Police Act 1997 defines serious crime as conduct which constitutes one or more offences if, and only if: it involves the use of violence or if one of the offences is an offence to which a person who has attained the age of 21 and has no previous convictions could reasonably be expected to be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of three years or more. That is a fairly clear definition. There was general agreement by both government and opposition when that provision was passed that that was a perfectly proper definition of "serious crime".
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para7"></a>One could perhaps use the definition of "serious arrestable offence", if that was thought preferable, as defined in Section 116 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Your Lordships may be relieved to hear that I shall not cite the full definition! However, that shows that the definitions are available. It is important that the Bill is aligned to the duty of confidentiality, as generally understood currently by the medical profession.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-31_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the hour is late, but these are important issues and I hope that the House will forgive me if I deal with them in some detail. I admire the brevity and lucidity of both noble Lords. I fear that I shall not be able to emulate it, but I shall do my best.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para8"></a>In Committee, a number of issues were raised, many of which have been repeated this evening. With the Committee's agreement, I agreed to take away those concerns and look again to see whether we could further strengthen the safeguards on confidential information, whether through the Bill or through secondary legislation or guidance. We have given this area considerable further thought. We have also had the advantage of further useful discussions with representatives of the medical profession, and have been able to explore their concerns in some depth. I hope that I may be able to help clarify the issues and to offer some important safeguards.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para9"></a>The overall context is that, in carrying out the majority of its functions, we expect the commission to work with anonymised data. Cases where the commission needs to look at confidential information that identifies individuals will be rare. They will usually occur only when it is conducting an investigation when there is a particular cause for concern. Our aim has been both to set proper constraints around the commission's <P>


<a name="column_593"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 593</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>access to confidential information, and to ensure that when it does have such access the information is treated with due care and confidence. That is why Clause 16 sets out the circumstances under which the commission can obtain information and Clause 17 sets tight conditions on disclosure of information.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para10"></a>It may be helpful if I explain now the purpose of government Amendment No. 39. It aims to ensure that the definition of confidential information in Clause 16(6) is sufficiently broad to cover all information held subject to a duty of confidence. In reviewing these provisions in the light of the Committee stage debate, we concluded that there was a potential ambiguity in the original draft: it could be argued that in defining confidential information according to the terms in which it is held, the original definition did not cover information that should be held in confidence by virtue of the circumstances in which it is obtained. The amendment ensures that both sets of circumstances are now covered. It strengthens the protection offered by the provision and I hope that it will command the support of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para11"></a>Before I turn to the other amendments it may help if I refer to a number of other safeguards on the commission's handling of confidential information, some of which go beyond what is on the face of the Bill. For example, only clinical members of the commission's review teams will be expected to access confidential patient information. They will be subject to the codes of confidentiality of their regulatory bodies and be under a duty of confidentiality. They would owe this duty to the individual concerned, and to the commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para12"></a>In addition, we expect that the contracts of employment of the commission's staff, both professional and lay, will contain provisions dealing with the issue of confidentiality. If it were necessary to enforce this, the Secretary of State would be able, under paragraph 7(6) of Schedule 2 of the Bill, to direct that contracts of employment contain such provisions. Knowing or reckless disclosure of confidential information without lawful consent is subject to a criminal offence under Clause 17. When we turn to the discussion of specific points of concern covered by the amendments, it is in the context that the commission will access confidential information only by exception and under carefully controlled circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para13"></a>Perhaps I may turn specifically to the first of the areas that I have highlighted. I refer to confidential information relating to deceased individuals or those who cannot be traced. I fully recognise that inappropriately obtaining or disclosing such information could, for example, cause grave and unnecessary distress to relatives. None the less, there are exceptional circumstances in which the commission would need to have access to information about such patients. We need to ensure that the scope of these clauses allows appropriate, but only appropriate, access.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para14"></a>There may be cases where the commission has concerns about a service where it suspects that there might be a risk to the health and safety of patients, but it would need to be able to access more records before <P>


<a name="column_594"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 594</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it could prove the risk. It would of course be able to ask for the consent of living people, but there would be difficulties in a case where a number of patient deaths had occurred which the commission wished to investigate. I am sure that the House will appreciate that it would be particularly unfortunate if we were to put obstacles in the way of what might be a most pressing case for investigation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para15"></a>I do not pretend that there is a straightforward way through this process. As I explained in Committee, there are problems in placing the same protection for the living and the dead on the face of the Bill, as proposed in the first set of amendments. One particular problem is that, generally speaking, no one has a legal authority to give consent on behalf of a deceased individual for the access or disclosure of confidential information about him or her. That means that if the safeguards in Clauses 16 and 17 were extended to cover deceased people, as proposed in the amendment, the commission would have more limited ability to obtain or disclose information relating to deceased individuals than was the case with living individuals.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para16"></a>The lack of legal clarity here also gives rise to other issues. While I recognise the ethical obligation healthcare professionals have to respect the confidentiality of individuals after their death, it is unclear in legal terms how far the duty of confidentiality extends beyond a person's death, if at all. It is therefore unclear whether information on a specific deceased individual is held subject to a duty of confidence. The constraints in Clause 16(2) only concern information which is held subject to such a duty. We are continuing to give this particular matter close consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para17"></a>It is a difficult issue to balance. The Government share the concern expressed to ensure that the confidentiality of information relating to deceased individuals is properly respected. However, we would not wish unduly to restrict the operations of the commission in its work. I believe that there is general agreement that the commission should work within a clear and enforceable set of parameters when handling confidential information relating to deceased patients.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para18"></a>The real issue here is whether the best place for those parameters is the face of the legislation. I hope that I have explained why I consider the amendment moved by noble Lords to be too restrictive; indeed, it could jeopardise the effectiveness of the commission in what might be some of the most serious investigations with which it is faced. Nor is there an alternative appropriate approach as far as concerns the Bill. Nevertheless, we do take the issue very seriously. I have already explained the way in which the commission and its staff would safeguard any confidential information they need to handle. Over and above this, we propose to draw up guidance in consultation with the professions to cover the circumstances in which the commission would be able to obtain confidential information about the deceased. We would then propose that the Secretary of State would direct the commission through his power in Clause 15(4) to adhere to this guidance in the course of its work. I believe that these arrangements would ensure the right balance, allowing the commission necessary <P>


<a name="column_595"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 595</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>access to information in exceptional circumstances while ensuring any such information was handled with the greatest care.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para19"></a>I turn now to the disclosure of confidential information on the deceased. Again, the Government consider it very important that such information should be treated with the greatest respect. The amendments before us seek to apply Clause 17 to the deceased in the same way as to the living. The difficulty we face is that of all the circumstances in which Clause 17 provides that the commission may disclose information "with lawful authority", the most commonly used is likely to be where the individual concerned has given consent--under Clause 17(5)(a). We need to consider further to what extent the lack of consent available with regard to deceased individuals may pose difficulty in allowing the commission to act in the interests of the public.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para20"></a>It is important that we reach the right solution in the matter. If noble Lords will agree to withdraw Amendments Nos. 41 and 42, I shall undertake to continue to consider the matter. I hope to bring forward a proper resolution to what is, for the reasons that I have outlined, a difficult issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para21"></a>I now turn to the matter of untraceable individuals. The same general principles apply here. The amendment on this point would again bar the commission from obtaining confidential information in circumstances where it suspected there was a risk to the health and safety of patients but would need to be able to access more records before it could prove the risk. If it was not possible to trace the individual and obtain consent to access to the information, the commission would simply be unable to obtain this information, although it could be in the public interest that it should do so. Again I would argue that we should not put an absolute bar on access to information in such circumstances but should look instead to the safeguards I have outlined in terms of the arrangements for the commission's handling of confidential information.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para22"></a>In Committee concerns were raised that information should not be made available in a form which, in combination with other information, would enable the identity of an individual to be discovered. Two amendments in this group reflect this continued concern. There are practical difficulties surrounding this. As drafted, the provisions would tighten the duty on the body (for example, a hospital) making information available to the commission. While it is right and proper that we should expect such bodies to ensure they do not hand over data from which the identity of an individual can be deduced, it is simply not appropriate or reasonable to expect them to make an informed judgment about how this relates to information already in the hands of the commission or to assess with certainty what information the commission is likely to obtain in the future. I believe the test in the Bill on this point goes as far as is appropriate. However, we are considering the formulation of the provisions relating to information which identifies an individual and seeing if we can improve the clarity of the provision. I hope that this goes some way to meeting your Lordships' concerns.
<P>


<a name="column_596"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 596</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para23"></a>Finally, concern was raised in Committee about some of the provisions in the Bill dealing with disclosure of information. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, deals with Clause 17(5)(e); that is, disclosure in connection with the investigation of any criminal offence triable in the UK. It has been suggested that this sets a lower threshold for disclosure than applies in primary legislation at other points of interface between the NHS and the criminal justice system. I have reflected on this provision and have some sympathy with it. I would, if I may, like to take a little longer to ensure we select the most appropriate precedent, but with your Lordships' consent I should like to take this point away and bring forward a suitable amendment at a later stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para24"></a>The final amendments deal with Clause 17(5)(h) which allows disclosure of confidential information where an individual is seen as a threat to the health and safety of other individuals. The amendments seek to substitute a test of,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"risk of death or serious harm".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
In this instance I have more difficulty with the proposed amendment. I believe that the precedent here argues more strongly for the form of words currently on the face of the Bill. In drafting these provisions we, of course, had close regard to the provisions in the ECHR. We are satisfied that this provision is compatible with the convention which your Lordships' House helped to give effect to through the Human Rights Act 1998. I believe that Clause 17(5)(h) is currently of adequate strength to prevent inappropriate disclosure of confidential information. It mirrors the wording under which the Health Service Commissioner operates. To restrict the provision in this Bill further would place the commission in the position that if it discovers information showing that a person presents a risk to patients, it may not be able to protect patients because of the strictness of the provision. In this instance, I believe further safeguard should be by way of guidance rather than primary legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-31_para25"></a>This has been an important debate, reflecting what I believe is a shared concern to strike the right balance between protecting patient safety and enabling the commission, where necessary, to act in the wider interests of the public. I apologise for the length of my remarks but I hope that I have been able to offer reassurances about the safeguards that will be in place to protect confidential information, to propose some respects in which I believe in the light of these debates we can improve the drafting of the Bill and to explain why other points are best handled other than through primary legislation. I invite the House to accept government Amendment No. 39, but I hope that the others will be withdrawn.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90315-32_para6"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, in Committee my noble friend Lord Lucas made what I felt was a powerful case for removing from the Bill the blanket ability of primary care trusts and the commission for health improvement to exclude the public from their meetings. He suggested that there was absolutely no good reason why the arrangements for PCTs and the commission should be any different from those which apply to local authorities, which are allowed to close meetings to the public only in particular circumstances as specified in the Local Government Act 1972. My noble friend has now tabled a differently worded amendment to advance the same idea. This time though he has extended his proposal to health authorities and special health authorities as well as PCTs and the commission. The amendment takes as its starting point that there should be a presumption in favour of public access to meetings and formal arrangements to supply <P>


<a name="column_598"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 598</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>all those who wish to attend with agendas and briefing papers. Subsection (7) then deals with the exceptions by allowing the Secretary of State to make regulations specifying those circumstances where it is appropriate for the public to be excluded and for the relevant papers to be kept confidential. I think that this represents a much more satisfactory formulation than that laid down in the Bill which allows PCTs and the commission virtual carte blanche to close their doors whenever they choose. So, on behalf of my noble friend, I beg to move.

<A NAME="90315-32_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I would do anything to try to be helpful to the House at this time of night, even if I did not have sympathy, which I do have, with the intention behind the amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, in Committee and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, today, together with the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, have made clear their concern that public bodies should be accessible and responsive to the people they serve. Like the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, we are committed to the principles of openness and transparency of process and the need to build on these to ensure that the public are involved and informed and have an opportunity to see decision-making in action.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-32_para7"></a>We have already taken action on that commitment. We have followed up the provisions in the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960 with guidance to NHS boards on how best to open up meetings to the public. We have made clear to NHS boards that open board meetings are not a cosmetic exercise. They are not to be orchestrated events with decisions taken in closed session. Meetings must be used as an important and proper part of local accountability, demonstrating how and why decisions are made about local health services.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-32_para8"></a>Perhaps I may turn to the circumstances in which the public may be excluded from meetings. Provision under Section 1(3) of the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960 allows for the public to be requested to withdraw where it is resolved by the body that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"publicity would be prejudicial to the public interest by reason of the confidential nature of the business to be transacted". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I know that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, had a particular concern that that goes on to allow for a request for the public to withdraw,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for other special reasons stated in the resolution". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The amendment substitutes a power to make regulations providing for the public to be excluded from meetings in specified circumstances. It is worth bearing in mind that the clause as a whole is drawn up to cover meetings of committees and sub-committees as well as the main authority or board meetings. Any regulations would <P>


<a name="column_599"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 599</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>need to cover all those circumstances, and we need to consider carefully what impact such provisions might have.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-32_para9"></a>The current position is that guidance to NHS boards makes clear that any resolution to exclude members of the public must be taken in public and the outcome recorded in the minutes of the meeting. Such a resolution should state in broad terms the nature of the business to be discussed without breaching the confidentiality of the matter concerned. A statement made during the meeting provides immediacy and allows for the flexibility that may not result from specifying in regulations all the circumstances in which members of the public are to be excluded or documents withheld. I am unconvinced that this amendment offers a better course.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-32_para10"></a>On the question of committees, I have already explained that NHS boards and the commission for health improvement are unlike local government, where there is a statutory provision for committees to conduct the business of the main body. NHS boards conduct the vast majority of business in their main meetings and the commission is likely to have similar arrangements. Again, existing guidance states that, where items of business are discussed in committees, that does not preclude an invitation for the public to attend those meetings. Neither should they be used as a means of diverting business which is rightly a matter for <P>


<a name="column_600"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column 600</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discussion by the main board. Again, I am unconvinced that the approach of the amendment to committees and sub-committees is best suited to NHS circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315-32_para11"></a>I hope that I have conveyed the importance that the Government attach to openness and transparency in the conduct of NHS and related bodies. I have outlined the practical steps that we are already taking to strengthen these arrangements and which are very much in keeping with the spirit of the amendment. However, there are important respects--the handling of decisions on exclusion from meetings and the approach to committee and sub-committee meetings--in relation to which I am not convinced that the complex amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is better suited to the NHS and its public than our existing arrangements. Therefore, I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315-32_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for her full and helpful comments, which clearly merit careful study and reflection. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="90315w02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   On 28 February and 1 March, coalition aircraft took action against communications facilities forming part of the Iraqi air defence network, in response to being fired upon by Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery and being targeted by air defence radars. It appears that elements of these facilities also carried part of the pipeline control network. The Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline was not damaged, and the flow of oil was resumed in three days.

<P>
<UL>What are their arrangements for the support and promotion of exports.[HL1521]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315w02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   I am delighted to respond also on behalf of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315w02_para8"></a>This Government attach great importance to the promotion of exports. That is why in June last year the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Foreign Secretary asked the Secretary of the Cabinet, Sir Richard Wilson, to review the current arrangements for the support and promotion of exports. I am pleased to be able to report on the outcome of that Review. Copies of Sir Richard's report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, and will be widely distributed. It is also available on request to members of the public, and the executive summary can be found on the FCO and DTI websites.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315w02_para9"></a>The report records the excellent service given by personnel working on export promotion activity throughout the United Kingdom and in FCO posts around the world, while at the same time identifying a number of areas in the current arrangements which leave scope for improvement.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315w02_para10"></a>We welcome the recommendations, the core of which is that all trade promotion and development activities of the DTI and FCO should be unified in a new joint operation led by a single Chief Executive. The Government will expedite the establishment of such a unified operation, equipped with resources, both personnel and finance, broadly along the lines recommended in the Review. It will be known as "British Trade International". This will be a radical change. The new operation, which will have lead responsibility within Government for trade promotion and development, will provide a coherent framework for the Government's work in this area. We are confident that it will deliver an even better service to business.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315w02_para11"></a>The operation's first Chief Executive, who will have Permanent Secretary rank, will be Sir David Wright, currently Ambassador in Tokyo. We are confident, that with his experience of export promotion at home and abroad, he is ideally equipped for the task. He will be responsible, in consultation with DTI and FCO and <P>


<a name="column_WA64"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1999 : Column WA64</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>others concerned, for the design of the new operation's precise configuration and the implementation of Sir Richard's other recommendations. Sir David will of course have flexibility over the details of the implementation, and he will have effective control over the operation's resources and personnel. And he will be responsible to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Foreign Secretary, through a ministerially-chaired board, for the performance of the entire operation from local to international level. This will be measured against a national export development strategy and objectives which the board will set.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315w02_para12"></a>The new board will be chaired by DTI and FCO Ministers and will subsume the present British Overseas Trade Board. It will be drawn predominantly from the private sector. In addition to senior officials from the FCO, DTI, and ECGD, it will also contain representatives of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations to guarantee their direct involvement in shaping the national strategy.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315w02_para13"></a>The current arrangements for the delivery of export promotion services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will continue within the context of national policy. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations would continue to have discretion to provide supplementary programmes to meet the particular needs of businesses in those parts of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315w02_para14"></a>Overseas delivery of the services of the new operation will continue through our diplomatic posts overseas. Heads of Mission will be responsible to the Chief Executive for the performance of their posts in support of British business abroad against the strategy and objectives of the new operation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315w02_para15"></a>In England, the new operation will place greater emphasis on effective delivery of export services in the regions. The regional and local network, at present in Government Regional Offices and Business Links, will be integral to the new unified operation, under the effective control of the Chief Executive. In implementing the recommendations, the Chief Executive will need to work closely with the new Small Business Service which the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced earlier this week and the Regional Development Agencies in each region.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315w02_para16"></a>British Trade International will seek to provide a fast, consistent and high quality response to its customers in the business community. It will be staffed by personnel from both the FCO and DTI, and may also recruit directly, including through secondments. It will be supported by modern IT and other facilities designed to provide integrated information and communication systems.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315w02_para17"></a>The Chief Executive and the board will review the balance between the present range of export services and the provision of help to firms to develop their export capability, and also the scope for devolution of responsibility to the regional and international networks.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315w02_para18"></a>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Foreign Secretary are confident that the new unified operation will represent a significant advance over present arrangements, both in terms of strategic <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>direction and of improved customer focus, producing a real improvement in service delivery to business. It will be a major change and will take time to achieve. That will be primarily the task for the new Chief Executive. Meanwhile I can assure the House that there will be no hiatus: the present services to exporters will remain fully operational and available throughout the transition period.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="90315w03_wqn0"></A><B> Baroness David </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is their policy on sanctions.[HL1528]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90315w03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   The Government have recently completed a wide-ranging review of their sanctions policy. All Whitehall departments with an interest in sanctions were involved in the review.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315w03_para0"></a>As a result, the Government have decided to launch a new policy of better targeted "smarter" sanctions. This will sharpen the focus and effectiveness of sanctions whilst trying to minimise their impact on ordinary people, including children, and on our own commercial and economic interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315w03_para1"></a>Apart from the threat of or use of force, which will remain essential in the more extreme cases, sanctions are the only coercive measure available to the international community to respond to challenges to international peace and security. The review concluded that they will remain an important tool of our foreign policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315w03_para2"></a>The review also concluded, however, that better targeting would be likely to enhance the effectiveness of international sanctions and minimise the risk of harm to ordinary people. A range of sanctions, of varying type and severity, is available and different measures may be selected depending on particular circumstances. Comprehensive sanctions should be reserved for cases where the objective is to isolate and contain a very serious transgressor.
<P>

<A NAME = "90315w03_para3"></a>The review concluded that, although the circumstances in which sanctions are imposed vary from case to case, there are a number of broad principles that should normally be followed. Sanctions should:
<P>

However, the Government do not believe that British farmers would wish their sheep to be slaughtered in unacceptable and inhumane circumstances: we shall be appealing to the British sheep sector to consider the risk that sheep which they export to the continent at the present time may be slaughtered cruelly during the Eid el Kebir festival on 27-29 March.
