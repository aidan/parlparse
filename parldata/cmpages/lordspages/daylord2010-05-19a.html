<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="10051952000011"></a>In the <I>Official Report</I> for Tuesday, 18 May, two errors were made. First, a paragraph of text was attributed to Lord Strathclyde which he never said. The relevant lines are in the second column, from "And it further appears" to "such manner as they shall see fit". Secondly, the Lord Speaker was recorded as having taken the Oath, when in fact she made the solemn Affirmation. We sincerely apologise for these serious mistakes.</p>
