<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Greengross </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How they are ensuring that vulnerable adults in care homes and using domiciliary care receive the highest standards of care and are protected from abuse.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  My Lords, we have issued guidance to the field on action to protect vulnerable adults from abuse. We have also established the National Care Standards Commission, which will work with providers to ensure that service users receive good quality care.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Greengross: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. I feel positive about the actions being taken for the future but there is much to worry about now. Care standards are dependent on the quality of agency staff, but we hear of poor standards of training and competence. Many vulnerable adults are at risk because the Criminal Records Bureau is so over-committed that it is, quite understandably, concentrating on children. Does the Minister agree that vulnerable adults are at risk and that the protection of vulnerable adults list is a potent safety net?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I agree that we must ensure that protection of vulnerable adults becomes a part of the normal business of statutory and voluntary agencies at local level. As to domiciliary care services, we are committed to introducing a regulatory framework. Regulations will come into force shortly. We are aware of the problems that have arisen with the Criminal Records Bureau. However, I can assure the noble Baroness that pre-employment checks are carried out in the sector.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Pitkeathley: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend the Minister agree that the establishment of the General Social Care Council, with its remit for ensuring that care workers are properly trained, is an important step forward? Does he further agree that the codes of practice for employers and employees developed by the General Social Care Council, which are currently in circulation, will also be of great importance?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend about the potential of the General Social Care Council, which will embrace not only qualified social workers but all staff within the social <P>


<a name="column_458"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 458</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>care sector. However, its remit should go wider than that and extend to the training curriculum of NHS professionals. The recently published national service framework for older people makes the point that training within the curricula needs to cover these issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that Age Concern is presently conducting an exercise to promote its work in the voluntary field? Would it not be a good idea to use voluntary workers from organisations such as Age Concern to inspect homes and places where elderly people are looked after? This would involve no extra expense but would provide much expertise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, we have a statutory inspection agency&#151;the National Care Standards Commission&#151;but I agree that organisations such as Age Concern have a wealth of experience. I would certainly encourage the National Care Standards Commission to enter into dialogue with such organisations, both nationally and locally. My department is supportive of the organisation Action on Elder Abuse, which has a phone line available for older people and their relatives who wish to draw attention to specific issues of abuse. It is doing excellent work in this area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Blackburn: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend's department liaise with the appropriate government department to ensure that agencies and private homes are paying the minimum standard wage to people who work in such homes?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, this is an important point. The National Care Standards Commission is concerned not only with the physical standards in homes but with staffing levels and managerial and employment issues. There is a statutory requirement on such homes in relation to the national minimum wage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest in that I work for Age Concern England. Was the decision to create a hierarchy of vulnerability between children and older people based on evidence? If so, what was that evidence? If the decision to prioritise children was based on resources, will the Government agree to review that within a specified timetable? Will the Government publish the Carter review of the shambolic operation of the CRB?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I assume that the noble Baroness is referring to the CRB, the question of checks and the priority given to children. In view of the pressures on the CRB, there can be no doubt that the Government took the right decision. Anyone reading the report of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, in relation to Victoria Climbie would come to the same conclusion. I do not underestimate the problems in relation to older people nor the impact of abuse upon them. We were right to ensure that pre-employment checks were introduced. We hope that the <P>


<a name="column_459"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 459</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>problems in the CRB will be cleared up as soon as possible. The noble Baroness knows that an independent review team has been appointed. Ministers will consider its report and make announcements in due course.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister assure the House that the enormous strides that have been made by the National Care Standards Commission in developing good practice in inspection and in regulation generally will be protected when these responsibilities move to the new super-regulator, the commission for social care inspection. I declare an interest as the vice-chair of the National Care Standards Commission.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Yes, my Lords, the National Care Standards Commission has made good progress. It has an enormous responsibility, covering a wide range of care homes and other parts of the care sector, including independent hospitals. We shall, of course, want to take through into the new organisation the good work that it has undertaken.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, will the regulatory framework extend to agencies? It appears that agencies are where most of the problems arise&#151;there is no question about that&#151;particularly in the area of domiciliary care. Will there be an inspection service for domiciliary care served by agencies?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I can reassure the noble Baroness that the regulatory regime does extend to agencies. When the legislation was before Parliament we were concerned to make sure that the agencies came under a regulatory framework. There had not previously been a national registration scheme. This will fulfil a very important function.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Strange: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that we were all once vulnerable children and may all become vulnerable older people? Therefore, my noble friend's Question affects everyone in this country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   And indeed, my Lords, Ministers answering Questions in this House also feel vulnerable.

<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Beaumont of Whitley </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the cost of the decision to agree to the request of the United States to use Fylingdales will be paid out of the defence budget; and, if so, at the expense of what other part of it.
<P>
</UL>

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Bach): </B>  My Lords, the cost of upgrading RAF Fylingdales will be borne by the United States Government. The station's running costs are borne by the Ministry of Defence, as is appropriate for a station staffed and controlled by the Royal Air Force, but the impact on these costs is expected to be minimal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Beaumont of Whitley: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that reply. Will the sum expended on running costs&#151;indeed, the Secretary of State is reported in the Guardian as saying that there will be more to come&#151;allow us to get rid of the weapons of mass destruction, the possession of which we so deplore in others?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, the present annual operating cost of RAF Fylingdales is some £15.6 million per year. The introduction of additional security measures announced by the Secretary of State following the events of 11th September 2001&#151;which have nothing to do with this proposed upgrade&#151;means that this figure will rise to almost £18 million per year. This extra security should be sufficient for any increased protestor activity as a result of the upgrade. But I repeat what I said in my original Answer: the cost of upgrading Fylingdales will be borne by the US Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, when did the Government last report on the leasing arrangements for Fylingdales, Menwith Hill and other US intelligence bases in this country? The last time I checked, I was unable to discover any report on an exchange of letters extending the lease which went beyond 1970. I did discover an RAF press release dated October 2001 stating that RAF Menwith Hill and Fylingdales are,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"made available under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement of 1951 and additional confidential arrangements".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-01_para0"></a>Might it not be helpful to Parliament if the Government were to inform us as to the exact terms of the leasing arrangements? We should then know a little more about costs as well.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030210/text/30210-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I have told the noble Lord and the House all that there is to know about costs. The costs of any upgrade will be met by the United States Government. The running costs of this RAF station are paid by the Ministry of Defence, and I have given the figures. It is important to remember that the staff at RAF Fylingdales are all British RAF men and women, apart from one American liaison officer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, is it correct that Fylingdales is virtually essential to the defence of our own country against various forms of attack? If so, does it really matter on which budget it is paid for?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is right, in as much as the existence of Fylingdales gives us early warning as well as the Americans. The early warning <P>


<a name="column_461"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 461</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>system is for the benefit of the Americans, but it gives us important data which helps us to defend our country. So the noble Lord is correct.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Vivian: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches are thoroughly supportive of missile defence systems and we welcome the decision taken by Her Majesty's Government for the USA to be able to use RAF Fylingdales. But will the Minister explain whether the costs of the space-based infra red system related upgrades currently under way at Menwith Hill will be part of the agreed US costs; and will the US costs package also be extended to cover the upgrading of future linked facilities?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I always dislike it when I am unable to answer a direct question from the noble Lord. The Question is about Fylingdales. I have not been briefed about costs at Menwith Hill, but I promise to write to the noble Lord at the earliest opportunity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Tanlaw: </B>   My Lords, is Fylingdales capable of giving advance warning of nature's missiles of mass destruction? I refer to hazardous near-earth objects, or asteroids, which endanger the population. It seems to me that vast sums of money are being spent on the proper defence of the country; but exactly the same system is required to defend it against asteroid impact, and very little money appears to have been spent on the latter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I do not know whether what exists of Fylingdales at the moment protects us as the noble Lord says. All that I can say is that he raises an important question, and I shall find out the answer for him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Eden of Winton: </B>   My Lords, are the facilities at Fylingdales in any way shared with NATO? What are Her Majesty's Government doing to co-ordinate the response of NATO to the threat from Iraq?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, as far as I know, the facilities at Fylingdales are not shared with NATO. There is a bilateral arrangement between the United States and the United Kingdom. Our NATO allies are committed to examining options for addressing the increasing ballistic missile threat, of which the whole House is aware. Fylingdales could be a key building block in any extension of missile defence to Europe as a whole, should we and our allies decide that that is what we want to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Avebury </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What were the value and the terms of reference of the contract awarded to MCM Research by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on the problems of noise and disorder arising out of the Licensing Bill; and whether there are any links between the company and the alcohol industry.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My Lords, the cost of the contract will not exceed £50,000. The aims are to provide best practice guidance to address potential noise from pubs and clubs and to support local authorities and the licensed trade both under the current licensing rules and those proposed in the Licensing Bill. MCM Research Ltd has had clients from drinks and entertainment organisations and was appointed by competitive tendering, partly as a result of its knowledge in this area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, can MCM Research be seen as fully independent by the residents who will be affected by the Licensing Bill in view of the fact that the vast majority of its clients are from the alcohol industry? The company has appeared frequently at licensing applications, defending the proposition that ambient noise should not be taken into consideration in deciding those applications.
<P>

<a name="30210-02_para0"></a>Further, when will the report be published? Surely, its findings will be relevant to the Licensing Bill. Will there be opportunities for challenging the findings in view of the fact that many local communities will be seriously affected by all-night noise that is not up to the threshold in the tests for the licensing considerations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, as to the independence of the organisation, it has a great range of clients, by no means all of whom are in any way related to food or entertainment. It achieved the award of the contract in competition with several others. As with any independent research organisation, it will have clients that people will query, but nevertheless I believe that it will produce an independent report.
<P>

<a name="30210-02_para1"></a>The report is not yet complete, but it will be completed in time to deal with the operation rather than the principles of the Licensing Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, was the contract awarded because the department expected the Licensing Bill to give rise to noise and disorder, as the wording of the Question suggests? If so, is this the only known case of a government legislating to condone inebriation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I hesitate to say that the Government in any context condone inebriation. However, we recognise the realities of life. Even under <P>


<a name="column_463"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 463</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>current licensing laws, excessive noise occasionally emerges from licensed premises. Therefore, we want to consider the current situation and whether the Licensing Bill, and the way in which it is operated, will make any significant difference. That is why we awarded the contract.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that disorder is already rife in country market towns every Friday and Saturday evening? Can he expect an objective report from MCM? It is a big problem. With the Courts Bill reducing the number of magistrates' courts, the Government are cooking up a big problem for themselves in the countryside.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, your Lordships debated the terms of the Licensing Bill at some length in Committee. Clearly, there is disorder in several parts of the country under existing rules. It is generally concentrated round about chucking out time. Part of the operation of the Licensing Bill will be to ensure that there is not a concentration of people coming out of licensed premises. Part of the effect of the transfer of responsibility will be to ensure that local authorities take account of the views of residents in areas where there are licensed premises.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, given what the Minister has just said, would it not have made sense for the research to be carried out before we set about scrutinising the Licensing Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, we are at the stage with the Licensing Bill where we have established the principles, which are still before Parliament. The way in which they are operated, and the guidance that individual local authorities will need, should be informed by the research that is coming out. That is why the focus of the research is best practice guidance to the trade and to local authority enforcers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   My Lords, as the Government have given an assurance that the guidance will be available by Report stage, can we be certain that the research will have been completed by Report stage as well?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the best practice guidance will not be available until we have considered the outcome of the report. It is at that stage that the research becomes appropriate. I shall not give further commitment as to what further information will be available on Report, over and above what my colleagues have given in the process of the Licensing Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, will the research being undertaken include taking views from magistrates? It is currently the magistrates who give licences, but in the new Bill it will be taken away from them. I would like clarification on that point.

<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the conduct of the research will include talking to local authorities, magistrates and police, as well as the trade and residents organisations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-02_spnew23"></A><B> Viscount Falkland: </B>   My Lords, will the report be focused entirely on the late-night drinking that we are seeing, or will it take into account that we are moving into a 24-hour economy of which it is simply the vanguard? Noise will be a problem, regardless of drinking, because everything will be going on for 24 hours a day.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the remit of the £50,000 research contract is unlikely to go quite as wide as the change in social mores to which the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, refers. However, it will consider all aspects relating to changes in licensing laws, including liquor and entertainment licensing.

<A NAME="30210-03_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will ensure that all statutes are published on the Internet as soon as they receive Royal Assent.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, all Acts are published simultaneously on the Internet and in print as soon as possible after Royal Assent. It is important to ensure that an accurate approved text is published and that all users have access at the same time to the same text. To do otherwise might raise issues of fairness. When a Bill has been heavily amended during its final stages, there may be some delay between Royal Assent and the receipt of the final text by the Stationery Office.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, is the noble and learned Lord aware of a case recently reported in The Times, in which the Home Secretary made an order for the removal of an asylum seeker on 14th November 2002, under Section 115 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, two weeks before the Act was published? It was a matter of great concern to the Court of Appeal. Does he accept that it is intolerable that decisions should be taken on statutes that are not yet in the public domain? Does he agree that the best way in which to deal with the situation would be to ensure that all statutes are put on to the Internet as soon as they receive Royal Assent?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am familiar with the case which attracted significant criticism from the noble and learned Lord the Master of the Rolls with regard to the delay in publication. The difficulty was that the Bill received Royal Assent on 7th November only two hours after your Lordships agreed to the final round of Commons amendments. Therefore, there was uncertainty about the outcome. The Public Bill Office could not make a proof copy <P>


<a name="column_465"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 465</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>until Royal Assent had been granted. The proof copy was sent to the printers the next day. There were two further stages. The Public Bill Office, parliamentary counsel and the relevant government departments had to check the proofs carefully which then had to be printed. Checking the proofs took eight working days and the printing took five working days. I do not pretend that that situation was satisfactory.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sheldon: </B>   My Lords, does my noble and learned friend agree that the use of the Internet as regards the publication of parliamentary material could be much improved and speeded up? Is he aware that in the other place the minutes of evidence of certain Select Committees are put on the Internet the following day? That is an enormous advantage for those of us who like to keep in touch with what is happening in certain Select Committees at the time when such events are making the greatest impact on public affairs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is quite right. I revert to the general topic raised by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in saying that many judgments are published immediately on the Internet. Some benefit would have been gained from immediate Internet publication of the statute we are discussing. However, that would not have met the essential point that Bills cannot, or should not, be published on the Internet until they have been carefully checked. Four substantial Bills received Royal Assent at about the same time and the resource simply could not cope. We are trying to prioritise important Bills. I accept that the one specified by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, would have fallen into that category.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, is the noble and learned Lord aware that the Information Committee is examining proposals to display amendments daily on the Internet? Although that is not immediately in sight, it is certainly something that we are working towards.

<P>

<A NAME="30210-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, it is very important to disseminate accurate public information as soon as possible. Normally, there is a gap between the passage of a Bill and Royal Assent of the order of two months. The Royal Assent we are discussing was expedited and a delay arose in the printing of the relevant document.

<A NAME="30210-03_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, in view of the concern felt on all sides of the House about the gap between citizens and Parliament, will the noble and learned Lord, who is after all distinguished for his support for modern approaches, consider the possibility of publishing draft Bills and explanatory notes on the Internet to encourage the public to comment on them? A precedent exists with regard to some of the operations of the US Congress whereby Bills are published on the Internet in draft form and the public are invited to make suggestions on how they might be amended.

<A NAME="30210-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, that is an extremely valuable suggestion. I hope that as we develop pre-legislative scrutiny&#151;to which I believe we are all committed&#151;that useful avenue will be explored. One would then be likely to obtain a wider and a more fully informed public response.

<A NAME="30210-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   My Lords, Acts of Parliament and their associated Hansards should be published on the Internet. But what happens if the relevant Hansard is incorrect? That happened recently with regard to a Treasury matter when the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, wrote to Members of your Lordships' House to correct a statement he had made at the Dispatch Box. However, that letter has been seen only by a handful of Members of your Lordships' House. Will important correspondence of that kind also be published on the Internet?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the letter mentioned by the noble Lord is in the Library of the House which, as we know, is the most appropriate place in which to conceal material one does not want widely disseminated. That is a constitutional convention of many centuries' standing. However, I shall certainly consider that point and any similar points.
<P>

<a name="30210-03_para0"></a>I believe that I may inadvertently have made a slip of the tongue. I meant&#151;I thought that I had said this&#151;to refer to a period of two months between Royal Assent and commencement. If I said between amendment and Royal Assent, I was wrong to do so.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-03_para5"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "SUPPLEMENTAL LIST
<br>
(1) There shall be kept in the office of the keeper of the rolls for each local justice area a supplemental list as provided for by this Act (in this Act referred to as "the supplemental list").
<br>
(2) There shall be entered in the supplemental list the name of any justice of the peace who has attained the age of 70.
<br>
(3) The name of a justice of the peace shall be entered in the supplemental list if he applies for it to be so entered and the application is approved by the Lord Chancellor.
<br>
(4) A person's name shall be removed from the supplemental list if&#151;
<br>
(a) he ceases to be a justice of the peace; or
<br>
(b) the Lord Chancellor so directs.
<br>
(5) A justice of the peace for any area while his name is entered in the supplemental list shall not by reason of being a justice for that area be qualified as a justice to do any act or to be a member of any committee or other body."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30210-03_para6"></a> The noble Baroness said: Before I speak to Amendment No. 43, I declare an interest. I have had the pleasure of receiving a letter from the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor informing me that I am included on the supplemental list.
<P>

<a name="30210-03_para7"></a>This amendment is not of the greatest judicial importance but I am sure that many Members of the Committee will agree that it is important in human terms. It is an amendment about which I feel most strongly as I believe that deleting Sections 7 to 9 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997 has no merit at all. At Second Reading (at col. 21 of Hansard of 9th December) I challenged the Government to explain why they wished to abolish the supplemental list.
<P>

<a name="30210-03_para8"></a>The lay magistracy can trace its heritage to the late 12th century when Richard I commissioned knights to preserve the peace. Since that time the Justices of the Peace, as they have been known since 1361, have worked tirelessly in the pursuit of justice in this country.
<P>

<a name="30210-03_para9"></a>The Auld report provides the astounding figure that lay magistrates deal with about 91 per cent of all summary criminal cases. The Auld report also states that the lay magistracy is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unpaid, receiving only a modest allowance for financial loss and subsistence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-03_para10"></a>Furthermore, Justices of the Peace,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"are required to sit for a minimum of 26 half-day court sittings each year, but on average sit 40 or more times a year".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-03_para11"></a>
Surely that dedication to a job with very few rewards which makes such a difference to the local community should be recognised by inclusion on a supplemental list. I am wholeheartedly opposed to the abolition of the supplemental list which strikes me as an <P>


<a name="column_468"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 468</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unnecessary attack on people who have given at least 15, and often up to 30, years of their life to the community by their work on the Bench.
<P>

<a name="30210-03_para12"></a>Membership of such a list enables a retired lay magistrate to sign passports and witness signatures&#151;something which professionals such as doctors rarely have time for nowadays and, if they do, they probably require a fee. Moreover, supplemental justices often contribute a great deal to community projects, mock trial competitions and recruitment drives, and for this reason are of substantial ongoing value to their community.
<P>

<a name="30210-03_para13"></a>In the letter which the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, sent to noble Lords over Christmas, she stated that the Government believe that the list now serves little substantive purpose. We hope that that does not mean that when people reach the age of 70 they are to be airbrushed out of history. But I was encouraged to see that the noble Baroness went on to state that she recognises the need to value the achievement of retired lay magistrates, and that the Government would consider with care the points raised at Second Reading. I hope that we shall be told that as a result of that further consideration our fears can be allayed. This is an important matter for so many people. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-04_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Tenby: </B>   I should like to associate myself very strongly with the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe. At Second Reading, I am afraid that I was guilty of rather ponderous levity in my speech on the subject, but what I said masked real concern. The original proposal bears all the hallmarks of a Whitehall tidying-up exercise. I should like to know whether a costing exercise was undertaken to find out the expense of having a supplemental list.
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para0"></a>I do not think for one minute that anyone would dispute the fact that magistrates ought to finish their operational duties at the age of 70. Unlike other members of the judiciary, we are realistic in that respect. However, one cannot regard 70 as the end of meaningful life as we know it. This is the last place where we could hold such a view.
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para1"></a>We must not throw the baby out with the bath water. We should think of the important contribution that retired magistrates could make in terms of education. The noble Baroness talked about the mock trial system, and we must also consider education in schools, education with the other agencies, training exercises and the like. Then we come to the question of being a counter-signatory to some quite important documents, such as a shotgun certificate. I happen to think that a magistrate's signature on a shotgun certificate is rather important, instead of having a willy-nilly trawl through the rest of the community in the hope that someone can be found who has the time, inclination or expertise&#151;that is the point&#151;to do it. Above all else, that expertise comes free, so I beg the Minister to look kindly on the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I also support the amendment. I challenged the Government when they said in the noble Baroness's letter, to which reference has been made, that the list now serves little substantive purpose.
<P>


<a name="column_469"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 469</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para2"></a>I want to refer to the experience of Mr Alex Demetriades, who has written to me. For 25 years, he was a member of the Manchester City Bench and ended up as chairman. Since that time, he has been on the supplemental list. Beyond signing documents, in those 10 years he helped with Victim Support and Witness Support schemes, assisted in mock trials and in open days as part of the "Magistrates in the Community" project.
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para3"></a> Those schemes all have the support of the Lord Chancellor's Department. The specialised experience of magistrates really adds something to them. Far from being of little substantive purpose, the list has a real object to achieve.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jones: </B>   I too support the amendment. In practice generally today, to be a magistrate on the supplemental list is regarded as something of an honour, and it costs the Government nothing. It will have been an honour very thoroughly deserved. The 70 year-old magistrate will have been, in all probability, some 15, 20 or 25 years or more on the Bench as a serving magistrate. In itself, that will have been a record of public service, and public service volunteered to the community. It will have involved many sittings throughout each year, often after no small inconvenience.
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para4"></a>The service will have been given to the fellow members of the Bench, to the Court Service and, in the widest sense, to the village, the township and the county. All in the best British tradition, it will have been understated, unpublicised, unpaid and unsung. However, it will have been very valuable. Surely we can let people remain on the supplemental list. Perhaps the Minister, in his wisdom and generosity, would accept such an amendment so cogently moved.
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para5"></a>Certainly, the service given will have been very decent, conscientious, exemplary and, I rather think, lengthy, and all of that in an increasingly important sphere of British society and its daily life. The administration of justice at grass-roots level is of growing importance to our communities, wherever they may be. That service also comes at a time of rapid and bewildering social and economic change, in which magistrates must always make sound and subsequently much-scrutinised judgments.
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para6"></a>What is required is an act of generosity by the Government. The supplemental list might be seen as a roll of honour. Let it be so for any justice of the peace who has attained the age of 70 years.

<P>
<A NAME="30210-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   There is a general feeling that the intention of the provision needs to be looked at again. I certainly share the commendations, especially that of my noble friend Lord Jones, that have been given about the standing and stature of magistrates who have served a very long time. Perhaps the Minister will say something&#151;I am sure that it will be honest, not kind&#151;about the value of the magistracy in our law.
<P>


<a name="column_470"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 470</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para7"></a>It is intriguing that at one stage there must have been general acceptance that there needed to be some form of semi-retirement at the age of 70, because the supplemental list came along. If the relevant age is not 70, what is it? Are we saying that there should not be any supplemental list at all? If there is to be a supplemental list, at what age does one become eligible for or compulsorily retire to it?
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para8"></a>The matter is not unique to the magistracy. We all know about voluntary organisations. As the Committee well knows, I am strongly involved in the Co-operative movement, in which there have been constant arguments and battles about the term "ageism", and as to what age one should retire from being a director of a local co-op society. Some societies have an age limit and some do not; I am not arguing as to which are the better. Without a supplemental list, questions about age limits are being asked in our society. I know that the Minister listens with care to such matters. I hope that he will recognise the strength of the argument, and that the debate raises an important point for those such as myself who argue that perhaps consideration should be given to some other age. If it is not, that is like the situation in the American Senate. Someone can be a senator whatever age they are when they are returned, which is by election.
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para9"></a>If one wants to give the Lord Chancellor and his staff the right to decide arbitrarily that someone is past it because they have reached the age of 70 or 80, others will argue that some who are under 70 are already past it. Ageism and retirement is a big issue. My noble friend Lord Jones is absolutely right. The arbitrary age at which one retires, from either employment or office-holding in many organisations, is a genuine issue. Given the powers of magistrates and their courts, it is more important for them than for others. They make big decisions, and one needs to be satisfied that they are compos mentis, as I think is the term.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I declare an interest in that last February my wife retired from the magistracy. With due respect to all that I have heard, I do not believe that agreement to any measure today will prevent retired magistrates assisting in mock trials or assisting in training. However, an important past consideration should be recognised. I am unsure whether the amendment is in the correct form. It will be up to my noble friend to take it away and return on Report or later with a suitable amendment.
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para10"></a>Nothing that I have heard today should detract from the way in which people up to the age of 70 have discharged their responsibilities without pay. The lay magistracy is an important cornerstone of our society. I know that my noble friend recognises that from her highly distinguished career at the Bar. My wife has told me of the way in which the bulk of magistrates approach their duties. In my view that emphasises again and again the importance of the magistracy.
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para11"></a> I urge my noble friend to reconsider what the Government have done in relation to this matter. I do not believe that the proposed new clause is in the right <P>

<A NAME="30210-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  I hope that I shall be able to please a number of noble Lords this afternoon. I am very surprised that the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, has reached an age at which she could receive such a letter from the Lord Chancellor.
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para12"></a>After such an onslaught I feel like saying, "I'll come quietly". I join with all noble Lords who have sung the praises of magistrates who have served so loyally for so long until the age of 70. I do not believe that the magistracy can be unsung again. It cannot be said that it is unsung as that song has been heard clearly around the Committee.
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para13"></a>My noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis is right to say that there is no need to be on a supplemental list to do any of those matters to which he alluded such as mock trials or helping with training, and so on. However, I certainly take on board what all noble Lords have said.
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para14"></a>The amendment is not in the precise form required. We shall have to consider the consequences of such a provision on other parts of the Bill. Although I am more than willing to say in principle that we accept the import of the amendment, we shall have to consider the other sections of the Bill and ensure that such a provision is in its proper form.
<P>

<a name="30210-04_para15"></a>I do not want to set a discordant note, but noble Lords will be aware that the supplemental list was introduced in 1941 because, regrettably, during the previous 15 years some people who were either elderly or infirm had refused to retire. It was brought in for that reason, and although I accept that then the age was 75, the way in which the supplemental list has been viewed has changed over the years. It may now be perceived as a role of honour, but it was not always thus.

<A NAME="30210-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I am glad that the noble Baroness has shown herself to be open minded on this matter. As I used to say to my clients, it is better to confess before one is found out. I am only 94, but I have known people who have been finished at 50, others who were scintillating at 60; and others who were brilliantly scrutinising at 70. To get rid of people, even when they are on top of the world, just because they have reached the immature age of 70 seems to be utterly wrong. We must bear in mind that we are all different. I confess that a few of us are biological freaks, although I am still more or less in possession of my senses. I remember Lord Shinwell who at the age of 100 gave great service not only to our nation but also to his party. To have a supplemental list, as recommended by my noble friends, would be a great advantage.

<P>
<P>

<a name="30210-05_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 44 I shall speak also to Amendment No. 45. Clause 15 sets out the circumstances in which a chairman or deputy chairman may have a right to preside in court or to chair a meeting of justices. That is merely a drafting point. The reference in the Bill to the words "sitting or other" is an archaic practice and we see no reason for its inclusion. My redrafted version of the subsection would state simply that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If the chairman for a local justice area is present at a meeting of lay justices assigned to or acting in the area, he must preside".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-05_para5"></a>That reflects the fact that any meeting will include any sitting of a Bench.
<P>

<a name="30210-05_para6"></a>I would be grateful if the Minister could explain why the archaic practice of including the extra words "sitting or other" need to be retained, or she may feel able to accept the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-05_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for raising this point. I understand that it is the current statutory position. Therefore, the effects of the Bill on the status quo are not entirely clear to those in the magistrates' community.
<P>

<a name="30210-05_para7"></a>To achieve the intention of the amendment it would need to be drafted differently. As drafted the amendment would fail in its aim because removing the words "sitting or other" from the clause will not have the effect of removing, as the noble Baroness said, court sittings from the class of occasions at which a Bench chairman may preside. She is right about that. According to Stone's Justices' Manual, the term "meeting of justices" includes a judicial sitting.
<P>

<a name="30210-05_para8"></a>The noble Baroness is right to say that the phrasing has been carried through from a number of Bills. We are maintaining the status quo, which provides clarity because it is a term of art that has become familiar to all who use it. It is clear that we are trying to continue the position where the chairman of the Bench sits and <P>

 "TRAINING AND APPRAISAL OF LAY JUSTICES
<br>
(1) The justices for each local justice area shall establish a bench training and development committee to monitor the training and appraisal of lay justices.

(2) The bench training and development committee may make recommendations to the Lord Chancellor to which he shall have regard in carrying out his duties under the provisions of section 11(6)."

<a name="30210-05_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is supported by the Magistrates' Association. It seeks to impose a commitment to provide adequate training for lay magistrates and an ongoing commitment to ensuring that the highest possible standards are upheld.

<P>

<a name="30210-05_para14"></a>This will meet the Magistrates' Association's requirements and avoids giving the Lord Chancellor any extra powers, but it gives powers to the Magistrates' Association, which would be subject to a judicially reviewable process.

The training and appraisal of lay justices is an important part of what they can achieve. Without it they are much the poorer, and so is society. Establishing Bench training and development committees is extremely important because there has to be some way of insisting that the training and appraisal of lay magistrates reaches a proper proportion.
<P>

<a name="30210-05_para15"></a>But training and appraisal should not be seen as something that can be finalised; it must be reconsidered repeatedly in the light of experience. Therefore I am not sure that the phrasing of the new clause is right. I would like to hear from the Minister that she agrees with its principle.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-05_spnew10"></A><B> Viscount Tenby: </B>   I support the amendment and I hope that the Minister will look on it with sympathy. It cannot be said often enough that the training of <P>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 474</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>magistrates is of critical importance; after all, they are all amateurs. In the 20 or more years during which I was a magistrate, the demands made in training went up by leaps and bounds. We live in a very technical and litigious world, and it is essential for magistrates to keep up with all that is new. I am sure I do not need to remind the Committee that lay magistrates do so under their own volition in the evenings and at weekends&#151;in their spare time, in other words. In addition to their commitment to the Bench, they are committed to this additional workload. It should not be a matter of hit-and-miss; it should be enshrined by statute so that there is unanimity throughout the justice system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-05_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Chan: </B>   I express my support for the amendment. It may come as a surprise that my wife has been a lay justice for 15 years. Training is important in encouraging potential lay justices and helping new lay justices to perform their functions professionally and correctly. There is no doubt not only as to the good will of lay justices in giving up their time to this important function, as my noble friend Lord Tenby said. They also want to do the job well.
<P>

<a name="30210-05_para16"></a>Changes in sentencing, particularly in the light of the Criminal Justice Bill, make the training and appraisal of lay justices even more important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-05_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   We also support the amendment. Its purpose appears to be not so much training as the monitoring of training, which will no doubt be carried out by the Lord Chancellor's Department. It is important to write in the Bill the possibility that justices through training and development committees may have a say in the Lord Chancellor's disciplinary powers exercised under Clause 11(6). The new clause appears to be an excellent suggestion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-05_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Jones: </B>   I support the amendment. Training and appraisal are fundamental requirements for today's much scrutinised and much reported court procedures. It is shrewd to propose a statutory basis for them. My guess is that the historically recent introduction of training, appraisal and mentoring took some getting used to by existing magistrates. Some established magistrates were wary of the initiatives when they were proposed not so long ago.
<P>

<a name="30210-05_para17"></a>What are the Government's proposals to promote and enhance the existing training and appraisal systems? Perhaps more should be done to persuade the existing 29,000 magistrates of the need for more training and appraisal. I should also declare that my wife is a lay justice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-05_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   We are sympathetic to the amendment, although not to the precise terms in which it is framed. The Magistrates' Association has put its views to us on this and related matters.
<P>

<a name="30210-05_para18"></a>The amendment as drafted does not fully reflect the policies we have developed, partly in response to concerns raised with us by the Magistrates' <P>


<a name="column_475"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 475</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Association. I am grateful for this opportunity to set out our thinking and to outline our proposals for government amendments.
<P>

<a name="30210-05_para19"></a>We seek to address several related concerns. The concern about the lack of statutory backing for Bench training and development committees was hinted at by the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, and other noble Lords. Given the importance of these activities, there is also concern over whether the Bench training and development committees will be able to achieve all that they and we would like them to.
<P>

<a name="30210-05_para20"></a>Those activities include, as many Members of the Committee know, managing the Bench appraisal and mentor scheme, identifying training needs, referring those magistrates deemed not to have demonstrated the required level of competence to advisory committees, and responsibility in relation to magistrates qualified to preside in court. At present, only that last activity appears in primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="30210-05_para21"></a>There is concern&#151;a matter highlighted by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford&#151;about the grounds on which magistrates may be removed from office. The current Act gives the Lord Chancellor a broad power to remove magistrates by instrument and the grounds are not specified. The Bill sets out certain grounds for removal that sit better with today's human rights considerations. However, the concern is that setting out specific grounds for removal can render arguable grounds which are not expressly mentioned; for instance, the ground of persistent failure to attain the necessary competence. That is touched on by the second part of the amendment. Currently, there is a set procedure whereby magistrates can be removed from office on that ground. It involves referral by Bench training and developmental committees.
<P>

<a name="30210-05_para22"></a>Additionally, there is a related concern that the Bill should contain express provision for general magistrates' courts training. A number of noble Lords have highlighted that issue. I do not think that the amendment bears upon that.
<P>

<a name="30210-05_para23"></a>We have accepted all those concerns and plan to bring forward amendments at Report to cover them. Their exact form is still under consideration, but we are contemplating a power for the Lord Chancellor to require lay magistrates to undertake training and to make arrangements for that training, and probably other developmental activities, such as appraisal schemes. The details need to be explored further. However, we expect that the provision will include or go alongside a power to make rules regarding the establishment of magistrates' committees for the purpose of carrying out, among other things, functions relating to training and development. That would cover the Bench training development committees. Having outlined our intention in that way, I hope that the noble Baroness will be content.

<A NAME="30210-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I thank the Minister for giving way. At the present time there is no statutory provision. It is widely recognised that there must be some form of Bench training and development. I <P>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 476</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accept what the Minister says&#151;of course without demur&#151;that this or a similar provision should be included in the Bill. However, that will not be achieved until about June or July&#151;by which time the Bill will have gone to another place and been returned to this House. What is the position in the interim?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   We have undertaken a series of training schemes where magistrates were invited to participate. Noble Lords will know that whenever there is a new piece of legislation&#151;for instance, the Human Rights Act or so on&#151;a wholesale programme of training is offered to magistrates across the country. It will be made much easier under the unified system. The Committee will know that the Judicial Studies Board will in future have a stronger role in overseeing magistrates' training, which will help to achieve greater consistency across the jurisdiction. Noble Lords are aware that the Judicial Studies Board currently undertakes all the training for district judges, circuit judges and the higher judiciary. It will enable us to have consistency throughout the system, which we are confident will benefit everyone.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   I thank noble Lords for taking part in the debate. It has been interesting to note that nearly everyone who has spoken has either been a justice of the peace or has a spouse who is one. It is heartening that all those people involved are anxious that this matter should be put on a statutory basis.
<P>

<a name="30210-06_para0"></a>I am delighted that the Minister has accepted the thrust of the amendment. Perhaps I may say that when I was appointed in 1968 I turned up at court and started sitting that very day. There was never any thought of training for many a year. I came to value training very much. Magistrates were always keen to take part in any training and there were few recalcitrant ones. Magistrates welcome it.
<P>

<a name="30210-06_para1"></a>We shall look at the drafting of our amendment. We understand that the Minister has said that she will bring forward amendments on Report, but we will look at ours to see whether we can bring forward an amendment on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>


<a name="column_477"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 477</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-06_para8"></a>The relationship between the magistrates and their clerk is vital to the satisfactory operation of a magistrates' court. It is based on a mutual trust that builds up over a period of time. In addition, it ensures independence of advice because the justices' clerk cannot be removed against the wishes of the magistrates concerned except by the Lord Chancellor. That is an important constitutional issue.
<P>

<a name="30210-06_para9"></a>These amendments ask the Government to clarify the role of the justices' clerk under the new centralised system of employment. My amendments would put on the face of the Bill the guarantees that we believe are necessary. Clause 22(1) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A justices' clerk is a person who is appointed . . . and designated by the Lord Chancellor as a justices' clerk",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-06_para10"></a>as a result of the Lord Chancellor's responsibility under Section 2(1). There is no mention of what the justices' clerk is to do or from where he or she is to operate. One would expect the Explanatory Notes to provide some clarification on the matter, but they do not. In theory, therefore&#151;although I would hope not in practice&#151;the Lord Chancellor could appoint justices' clerks without providing any link to a local justice area or areas. That would be unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="30210-06_para11"></a>Clause 22 makes the justices' clerk a grade of employee rather than a statutory post holder. As such, the justices' clerk can be moved at any time and anywhere in the country.
<P>

<a name="30210-06_para12"></a> In Clause 10(2) magistrates are assigned to local justice areas. The Justices' Clerks' Society in its helpful briefing points out that logic dictates that its clerks should also be so assigned. It was in response to the points made by the Justices' Clerks' Society that at the end of last week I withdrew one or two of my amendments which did not meet with its favour. I listened carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, said last week about being keen on amendments that people are keen on outside the House. I can tell him that I have tried properly to reflect the views of the Justices' Clerks' Society in these matters.
<P>

<a name="30210-06_para13"></a>I have one rogue amendment that I shall turn to shortly. I tabled Amendment No. 48 as a rough and ready amendment simply to make it clear that we believe that the justices' clerk should be appointed to one or more local justice areas. I refined that amendment after hearing from the Justices' Clerks' Society. As a result of its views I tabled Amendments Nos. 47A and 50B. Amendment No. 47A is a paving amendment for Amendment No. 50B, which places a duty on the Lord Chancellor to assign each justices' clerk to one or more local justice area.
<P>

<a name="30210-06_para14"></a>I have been reasonable. I have left the Lord Chancellor the required flexibility to be able to move the justices' clerk where necessary to a new area. But of course we would hope and expect that the clerk would be left in place long enough to be able to develop that valuable working relationship with magistrates that has been the hallmark of the success of our magistrates' courts.
<P>

<a name="30210-06_para15"></a>My noble friend Lord Renton has just informed me that Amendment No. 55 does not find favour with him. I can assure him that Amendment No. 55 was <P>


<a name="column_478"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 478</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tabled merely as a tool to stimulate debate and I have absolutely no intention of pressing it. I am pleased to see that he is relieved about that.
<P>

<a name="30210-06_para16"></a>Amendment No. 55 simply says that a justices' clerk should be left in place for a minimum of two years. We are trying to tease out how long the Government anticipate that magistrates should have the assistance of a particular clerk. We are interested in the stability of the system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I hope that the noble Baroness will clarify Amendment No. 55. As drafted, it is not possible for anybody to accept it. The noble Baroness has endorsed that view. It is incumbent on her to express her view. For example, a justices' clerk may not agree with some of the magistrates on personal or other grounds and may want to move to another area. Should not he or she be entitled to do that? I do not think that there should be an arbitrary requirement for a justices' clerk to be present throughout.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-06_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   As ever, the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, has read my mind. He has intervened and put words into my mouth that I was about to utter. He has therefore saved me and the Committee a little time. The reason why I tabled Amendment No. 55 was to see whether there should be an arbitrary period of, say, two years. The Justices' Clerks Society says "no" for the reasons mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. I agree with the noble Lord and endorse what he said.
<P>

<a name="30210-06_para17"></a>However, I would argue that I have met the deficiencies in Amendment No. 55 by Amendment No. 50B in which I leave the Lord Chancellor the flexibility of being able to reassign a justices' clerk if there are personal or professional reasons why it would be inappropriate for the clerk to stay in one position for too long.
<P>

<a name="30210-06_para18"></a>The underlying theme is that if one does not have some security of tenure as a justices' clerk in a magistrates' court, one will rob that court of the vital link of building up trust with the judicial adviser. I remind the Committee that the clerks in higher courts are in a very different position. They do not give legal advice to those sitting on the Bench. The clerk to a circuit judge and a High Court judge has a very different role.
<P>

<a name="30210-06_para19"></a>The Justices' Clerks Society points out that in Clause 23 the Government have made the justices' clerk a grade of employee rather than a statutory post-holder. The society is concerned that there should not be a short arbitrary period, but says that it is vital to have a geographical link and that there must be consultation about removal. I hope that my amendment meets the society's point that there could already be a problem with the public's perception of the Bill. The clerk may appear to become a civil servant advising magistrates on the law. The society stresses that every step should be taken to reassure the public of the independence of such advice. Geographical links would obviously assist in that process.
<P>


<a name="column_479"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 479</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-06_para20"></a>I understand that the Government may consider placing the issues of geographical links and consultation procedure about appointments in secondary rather than primary legislation. The danger is that that would downgrade the importance of those links. On an interpretation of the law, it would be presumed that those areas had been changed for a reason and that they were less important than they are. Those issues remain as important as ever. Amendment No. 50B properly and clearly reflects a commitment that should be on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-07_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I have not spoken on the Bill before, and perhaps noble Lords may think that I should not do so now. My experience of lay justices working with professional clerks was in Scotland when I was an honorary sheriff, but I think the experience is not dissimilar.
<P>

<a name="30210-07_para0"></a> I hope that the noble Baroness appreciates how important lay justices and their relationships with their clerks are to bridge-building between local communities and the law. Local people are very interested in what happens in a magistrates' court and pay great attention to how local justice is administered. If they get the impression that the clerk who is so important to the operation of the magistrates' court has come from on high, possibly from far away, and is likely to be removed to another stratosphere at any moment, it will shake confidence in the magistrates' court as a local operator of the law. In the world in which I operated, the local roots of the clerk were every bit as important as the local roots of the lay magistrates. I hope that the noble Baroness will remember that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jones: </B>   I accept the general thrust of the amendments. Is it the case that justices of the peace will no longer be consulted on the appointment or removal of justices' clerks? If so, are we to assume that the special relationship between a justices' clerk and the Bench is being downgraded at the very least? It is arguable that if justices' clerks become civil servants they will be subject to the direction of central government. That points towards the curtailment of the independence that courts will want to see maintained.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-07_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Tenby: </B>   I want to re-emphasise what has already been said far better and in far greater detail than I shall be able to do. The subtle relationship between the justices' clerks and the Bench is of immense importance. Each must have confidence in the other, so I urge the Minister to listen carefully to what is being said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   It may come as a surprise to some, but it is not all that many years ago when justices' clerks did not have to be qualified. Although they had no legal qualifications, some of them were extremely good and made up for their lack of qualifications and detailed legal knowledge by having a good relationship with their justices, which worked <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>wonders. I am not sure what the right formula is, but something should be worked out to underline the importance of the close relationship between the Bench and the justices' clerk. I should not be happy with a system that allowed the Lord Chancellor, without consultation with the Bench, to move a justices' clerk to wherever it was thought administratively convenient. The close relationship pays dividends and we should try to maintain it if possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I have no interest to declare and I am left feeling rather naked in such debates, but I should like the Minister to reflect on the kind and extremely well-deserved encomia that she has paid to the justices' clerks and then to ask herself whether it is not significant that the magistrates themselves and the Justices' Clerks Society support the thrust of the amendment? If the magistrates who perform what we all agree to be such an important function in our judicial system want a security of tenure, as referred to by my noble friend Lady Anelay, that should weigh very heavily with the Government.
<P>

<a name="30210-07_para1"></a>There is a very good reason for that opinion. We all agree on the importance of the link with the locality of those who administer justice. It is important for local confidence that that link should be maintained for the magistracy. As my noble friend Lady Carnegy and the noble Lord, Lord Jones, said, it is just as important that the advice coming to the magistrates should be informed by local considerations.
<P>

<a name="30210-07_para2"></a>The Minister will doubtless say that a guarantee of independence is written into the clause. One is always glad to read something like that, but in practice it is unenforceable in the circumstances relevant to our discussion. For example, if a magistrates' clerk takes a locally justifiable view about a particular topic&#151;length of time on bail, or whatever&#151;that may conflict with the policy of the Lord Chancellor's Department, he can be removed by the department and posted elsewhere, where he will be less of a nuisance, without any recourse whatsoever. It would be in vain for him to say, "My independence has been infringed".
<P>

<a name="30210-07_para3"></a> So I hope that the Minister, as she always does, will think carefully about what has been said in support of the amendments&#151;and support them in turn.

<A NAME="30210-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   I am untutored, compared with other speakers, on the practice. I mentioned previously that my wife was a magistrate at Haringey and at Highgate. During those 30 years, I had the opportunity to meet many of the clerks and their staff. The situation is not dissimilar in many other walks of life. Earlier, I referred to the fact that my great experience outside this House was in the co-operative movement. A man may take a senior position and everyone knows that he will not stay there much longer because he has quality. Everyone knows that, whether or not they want to keep him, other people will be knocking at the door. I am not talking about poaching <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>or offers, but, especially if people are young&#151;in their 30s, in my experience&#151;you know that they will move on up higher, and you say, "That's great".
<P>

<a name="30210-07_para4"></a>Recognising that fact, my noble friend and her colleagues have the difficult and delicate job of trying to satisfy the need for continuity in an area. Many noble Lords, like me, were Members of Parliament. We knew well our patch and the value of the people with whom we worked&#151;and they knew that we knew that. That is a great thing, but when it comes to understanding the community served by the court, although there may be distress when someone who is eminently loved and respected moves on, one knows how quickly, given the right choice of appointment, someone else can immediately begin to make an impression.
<P>

<a name="30210-07_para5"></a>I have no advice for my noble friend or her colleagues, who must deal with the matter, except to say that the trick is to satisfy everyone that the way that the law has been rolled out is, as far as possible, equitable and to the community's satisfaction. I take kindly what was said from the Opposition Front Bench about the power of the advocacy that they have received from outside. I hope that my noble friend will be able to respond to it. Consultations take place with various bodies and I cannot believe that my noble friend and her colleagues would, in the face of strong advice all round, persist in doing something that would patently be resented by those on whose behalf it was promulgated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I was an advocate in the local courts for a long time. During that period, the role of the justices' clerk was all-important. There was a rapport between the advocates and the justices' clerks, both formally and informally when the court was not sitting. It is important that that should continue. I grew a little alarmed at what the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, had to say. Frankly, I do not think that he is right.
<P>

<a name="30210-07_para6"></a>As far as I can see, there is no requirement envisaged for a justices' clerk to be qualified. He or she can be qualified, but it is not imperative. Clause 22(2) sets out the qualifications that must be applied. Although being recognised as a lawyer&#151;a barrister or a solicitor&#151;is important, it is not the sole criterion. Having said that, I support the purpose of the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-07_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Perhaps I may first reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, and others who spoke about the importance of the relationship between the magistrates and the magistrates' court clerks. I absolutely accept and endorse that it is crucial that that relationship be built on trust and confidence. Magistrates' court clerks may be in place not just for months but, as many Members of the Committee who have practised in the courts will know, many years. Sometimes because of other moves in their personal lives or career development, their tenure is shorter. We absolutely understand the nature of that relationship and its importance.
<P>


<a name="column_482"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 482</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-07_para7"></a> Let me assure the Committee that we fully expect that justices' clerks will continue to be assigned to local areas. However, as my noble friend Lord Bassam said in our debate on Clause 8, in future that will happen outside the statute, which will allow for more flexibility in their deployment. It will also allow justices' clerks the opportunity to work in the headquarters of the new agency or the Lord Chancellor's Department more generally, if appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30210-07_para8"></a>I stress again that there is no intention that the Lord Chancellor should move justices' clerks from one area to another at will. With his usual acuity, my noble friend Lord Graham put his finger on a problem that sometimes occurs: there are talented justices' clerks who for their own career development want to move on. I am therefore grateful for what the noble Baroness said about Amendment No. 55, which would be unrealistically restrictive. As she knows, there is no such time limit at present to the appointment of justices' clerks to petty sessions. Sometimes there are perfectly good reasons for them not to continue.
<P>

<a name="30210-07_para9"></a>However, there are difficult issues to consider. Although there will be no statutory link between justices' clerks and local justice areas, we fully envisage that clerks will continue to serve those local areas. I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Jones, that we will continue to consult magistrates before a justices' clerk is appointed or removed. Magistrates, via their Bench chairmen, will continue to be consulted about the assignment or replacement of a justices' clerk to their area, although, as I said, that will happen outside the statute.
<P>

<a name="30210-07_para10"></a>As regards deployment, we have made no decisions yet, but we will discuss how it will work with the Justices' Clerks Society. I can certainly assure Members of the Committee that justices' clerks will not be moved without their being consulted. As a matter of routine deployment, justices' clerks, in normal circumstances, will be deployed locally, but transfer under the usual Civil Service terms to another area for agreed personal and/or personal needs cannot be ruled out. We intend to deal with this issue sensitively and flexibly, taking into account local needs.
<P>

<a name="30210-07_para11"></a>One of the benefits we hope to gain from a unified system is a greater opportunity to deploy the right people at the right moment. Members of the Committee will know that sometimes there are difficulties which can be met by deploying people elsewhere, with the agreement of various persons, to meet those needs. We believe that that will be a very helpful addition to flexibility and in making sure that the system works more easily than it does at the moment. I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.
<P>

<a name="30210-07_para12"></a>As regards other matters, we are keeping these issues under review because we have to see how the jigsaw fits together. I certainly understand the concerns that have been expressed. Members of the Committee will know that the Justices of the Peace Act 1949 and the compensation regulations of 1978, the "Crombie" <P>

<A NAME="30210-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am intrigued by the Minister's final remarks that she expects the local areas in the main to remain. I shall look at that carefully in Hansard. I am very grateful to the noble Baroness for the care she has taken in answering the points made by myself and other Members of the Committee. I am grateful for the support from around the Chamber. I was intrigued by the very careful and helpful language used by Members of the Committee. The noble Lord, Lord Jones, spoke about the special relationship which must not be downgraded. The noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, spoke about the subtle relationship where each has to have confidence in the other. There is two-way traffic in confidence which is so vital.
<P>

<a name="30210-08_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, referred to the rapport built up between local magistrates and their justices' clerk. It is that combination of tremendous confidence, rapport and trust which needs to appear clearly on the face of the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, was absolutely right when he said that the trick is that the law is rolled out equitably and to the satisfaction of the community. That is a tremendously difficult thing for any government to do in each and every Bill. It is something we should all strive to achieve.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. While it is important to obtain rapport between magistrates and clerks, I was also referring to that between advocates and the clerk.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-08_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   The noble Lord is absolutely right. Another noble Lord commented on the importance of local knowledge and building up rapport between various people. I believe the description used by the Government is "court users". I do not say that with any cynicism because all of us at some time in our lives use a court and need to be properly received there.
<P>

<a name="30210-08_para1"></a>I listened carefully to what the noble Baroness said. She said that the Government would expect that justices would still be assigned. They want flexibility for assigning justices' clerks. I want more than an expectation; I want clarity on the face of the Bill. I want that while still keeping the flexibility that the Government wish to maintain. Amendment No. 47A is a paving amendment for Amendment No. 50B. That amendment meets the requirement that there is locality, continuity and flexibility of employment. I now wish to test the opinion of the Committee on Amendment No. 47A.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30210-08_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: I return to the theme of the position of the justices' clerk in the magistrates' court, but from a different angle. The Minister has already referred to it, so I shall be briefer than I otherwise would be. I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 50C and 51, which are in the same group.
<P>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 486</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-08_para8"></a>Clause 22 gives total responsibility for the appointment of justices' clerks to the Lord Chancellor. That does nothing to make local justices feel that they have any ownership of their local administration. Amendment No. 50A seeks to correct that by requiring local agreement to such appointments by,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the justices assigned to the local justice area or areas to which the Lord Chancellor intends to assign the justices' clerk".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-08_para9"></a>In speaking to the previous amendment, the Minister said that the Government expect that there will still be a system by which clerks are assigned to local justices. I am disappointed that the Government do not wish to clarify that in the Bill. The Committee also decided that it does not wish that to happen at this stage, so we shall go ahead with the Bill as it is currently drafted. I am trying to clarify in the Bill that, in making an appointment, the Lord Chancellor should have a duty to take into account the views of the local justices.
<P>

<a name="30210-08_para10"></a>Amendment No. 50A would require local agreement, putting a strong duty on the Lord Chancellor. The Justices' Clerks' Society was content with either this amendment or my other one. But I understand that the Minister might respond by asking how on earth one would obtain the agreement of up to 200 justices. One justice could feel plain awkward on the day and say "no". One would, therefore, expect flexibility to be built into the system. I have done that in Amendment No. 50C, which is reasonable to the point of being almost too weak. It simply requires the Lord Chancellor to consult the magistrates of the local justice area before he assigns a justices' clerk there. That is essential, good practice. I hope that the Minister will be able to accept Amendment No. 50C.
<P>

<a name="30210-08_para11"></a>Amendment No. 51 is in the name of my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith, who is unavoidably absent today and asked me to speak to it. It complements Amendments Nos. 50A and 50C, continuing the theme of local ownership by requiring that the appointment of an assistant to a justices' clerk should be made only if it is first agreed by the justices' clerk, whose own appointment cannot be made unless it has already been agreed by the local justices. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   We are entirely happy to support Amendment No. 50C. As the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said, Amendment No. 50A is rather strong. The question of the kind of agreement required and possible difficulties in securing agreement would make it difficult to justify insisting on agreement by local justices. Nevertheless, it is obviously correct that they be consulted. I expect the Minister to respond that in practice they will be consulted. If so, it is, in principle, desirable that that be an obligation in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I have a mild objection to Amendment No. 51. As the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, is not here, I shall be very mild indeed, because the amendment was spoken to on his behalf. It is unreasonable that a justices' clerk should have a veto <P>


<a name="column_487"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 487</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on the appointment of anyone as his assistant. It would be either his mate or nobody. That will not do at all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I understand the import of why the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, moved the amendment. However, she put her finger on the inherent difficulty that would arise in consulting every magistrate. Mergers of the petty sessions areas are being conducted now by the Central Council of Magistrates' Courts Committees. That could mean that when the Bill is law, local areas become significantly larger. The noble Baroness highlighted some real difficulties; for example, what happens if one magistrate, on a frolic of his or her own, decides not to agree? I am pleased that the noble Baroness sees the flaw in her argument.
<P>

<a name="30210-09_para0"></a>The phrasing of the amendments will require that the Lord Chancellor obtains agreement. Amendment No. 50C requires the Lord Chancellor to consult magistrates assigned to a local justice area before assigning a clerk to that area. As a number of noble Lords have previously said, that would present some difficulty.
<P>

<a name="30210-09_para1"></a>Clause 10(2) allows magistrates to be assigned to more than one local justice area. Amendments Nos. 50A and 50C propose gaining the agreement of or consulting a significant number of magistrates before a clerk could be appointed or assigned to an area. During the debate on Clause 8 my noble friend Lord Bassam gave noble Lords an assurance that in practice magistrates will continue to be consulted about the assignment or replacement of a justices' clerk for their area.
<P>

<a name="30210-09_para2"></a>The Government made that clear in their statement on unified administration placed in the Library on 16th January. It mirrors the position in the current court service in which there is close consultation with the judiciary on certain staffing issues. I expect such consultation to take place with the Bench chairmen as representatives of the magistrates for a local justice area, rather than with each individual magistrate for that area.
<P>

<a name="30210-09_para3"></a>During the debate on Clause 8, the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, pointed out that our statement that consultation with local magistrates on the assignment of justices' clerks would continue, appeared to be at odds with paragraph (75) of the Explanatory Notes.
<P>

<a name="30210-09_para4"></a> My noble friend Lord Bassam said that he would be happy to withdraw that point, given the confusion. My response is that we have listened to the persuasive arguments put forward both by noble Lords, the Justices' Clerks Society and the Magistrates' Association, in support of retaining the close link between Benches of justices and their clerks. While we remain opposed to placing consultation with the local magistracy on a statutory footing, we are happy to give assurances that such consultation will take place administratively. We shall take steps to clarify that point in the Explanatory Notes.
<P>


<a name="column_488"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 488</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-09_para5"></a>I turn to a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. He asked whether justices' clerks would be judicial officers who will, at all times, maintain quasi-judicial independence. My noble friend Lord Bassam reassured the noble Lord that clerks will retain their statutory independence. Clerks are not currently judicial officers&#151;nothing in the Bill alters that. I appreciate concerns about the possibility of frequent changes of justices' clerks around the country. However, I am sure that there will be no great loss of continuity.
<P>

<a name="30210-09_para6"></a>Amendment No. 51, tabled in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and spoken to today by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, would require the Lord Chancellor to obtain the agreement of a justices' clerk before designating a member of staff of the new courts agency as an assistant to that clerk. Imposing a statutory requirement on the Lord Chancellor to obtain the consent of a justices' clerk before designating a member of staff to be an assistant to that clerk would be unnecessary. No such requirement exists in relation to magistrates' courts committees, who currently appoint assistants. However, justices' clerks, as local heads of legal services, are currently involved in the appointments process. We envisage that this will continue to be the practice.
<P>

<a name="30210-09_para7"></a>I understand the anxiety that many noble Lords have expressed to have absolutely every minute detail placed on the face of the statute. I hope that noble Lords consider that over-prescriptive and cumbersome. Much in the system works well through good sense and justices' committees with justices' clerks and others working administratively on their behalf; namely, working together in partnership in order that the courts work well. Our amendments are predicated on good sense and good working relations continuing. Therefore, I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, will withdraw these amendments.
<P>

<a name="30210-09_para8"></a>However, I am a little disappointed at the approach taken, particularly in respect of justices' clerks, by virtue of the last amendment&#151;not least because I have made clear that the Government are listening, will consult and will continue to look at this matter. Notwithstanding the decision of the Committee in respect of the last issue, I repeat that my openness will continue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-09_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful for the Minister's response. We do not question her openness at all. The difficulty is that we have just one opportunity to obtain clarity on the face of the Bill, which, at the moment, there is not. It is no reflection on any comments made by the Minister that we press these amendments. As Members of the Opposition, it is right for us to respond to views put from outside the Committee and to take the opportunity that discussing the Bill gives to press such matters.
<P>

<a name="30210-09_para9"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, for his support of Amendment No. 50C. I note the objection raised by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, to Amendment No. 51. I accept his point and that of the <P>


<a name="column_489"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 489</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister. I was intrigued at the Minister's comment that I had noticed the problem with my own amendment. Indeed, I noticed the difficulty with Amendment No. 50A. It would be unwise to press for agreement from all local justices to be placed on the face of the Bill. However, I do not have such difficulty in attempting to persuade the Government with regard to Amendment No. 50C.
<P>

<a name="30210-09_para10"></a> The Minister said that in practice magistrates will continue to be consulted. If that were placed on the face of the Bill, it would reflect what is currently in statute. Therefore, it is not a case of adding minute detail.
<P>

<a name="30210-09_para11"></a>I refer briefly to an e-mail that I received from Mr Sid Brighton of the Justices' Clerks Society on 31st January. He points out that if the current statute is to be reflected, the views of all justices assigned to the local justice area should be sought. Their objection to the consultation to which the Minister refers&#151;the consultation that the Government intend with the Bench chairmen or deputy chairmen&#151;would be too restrictive because there would be a question as to where the mandate was obtained.
<P>

<a name="30210-09_para12"></a>I accept that the Minister is listening. However, I take the opportunity provided to register my discontent with the lack of clarity on the face of the Bill. I therefore want to test the opinion of the House. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-09_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Brougham and Vaux): </B>  The Question is that Amendment No. 50A be agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-09_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I apologise. I was so keen to press the right amendment that I managed to move the wrong amendment. I should make it clear to the Committee&#151;but first to myself&#151;that I accept that Amendment No. 50A is not a good amendment and should not be pressed. I apologise to the Deputy Chairman of Committees. I give notice that I shall press Amendment No. 50C. Before I bring the House down around me, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 50A.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-10_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 52:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 10, line 30, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-10_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"( ) Before the Lord Chancellor takes steps to remove a justices' clerk from office he shall&#151;
<br>
(a) consult the justices for the relevant local justice area;
<br>
(b) consult the Court Administration Council for the area which includes the relevant local justice area; and
<br>
(c) consider any recommendations made to him by the justices, the Court Administration Council or by the justices' clerk who is under notice of removal."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30210-10_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: In its response to the draft Bill, the Justices' Clerks' Society states that it is important to ensure that safeguards are in place for the process of the removal from office of a justices' clerk. We have discussed the process by which justices' clerks <P>


<a name="column_492"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 492</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be appointed. We now turn now to the other end of the process and discuss how they should be removed.
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para2"></a>My amendment probes the good practice that should be followed if the Lord Chancellor determines to remove a justices' clerk. Whom will he consult? Should it be the justices, or the court administration council? In consulting, what notice would he take of the views expressed? What does he consider to be his duty in accepting or rejecting those views, and would he make that consideration public? What hearing would be given to the justices' clerk who was under threat of removal?
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para3"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, stated at Second Reading that the decision-making on removal would effectively be taken by,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the local chief officer, who makes decisions within the court administrative council".&#151;[Official Report, 9/12/02; col. 83.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-10_para4"></a>So what will happen if the local justices and members of the CAC disagree with the local chief officer? Who has the final say?
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para5"></a>My amendment, which noble Lords opposite may be relieved to hear is a probing amendment, after their recent exercise&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Shame!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-10_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   The Minister says it is a shame. Perhaps she tempts me to make the amendment more probing. We shall see. The amendment provides good practice on the face of the Bill. It would add the provision that the Lord Chancellor should consult,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the justices for the relevant local justice area . . . consult the Court Administration Council . . . and . . . consider any recommendations made to him by the justices, the Court Administration Council or by the justices' clerk who is under notice of removal".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-10_para6"></a>I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   Clauses 23 and 24 deal with the functions of the justices' clerk, and in certain respects his independence. About half an hour ago, my noble friend the Minister mentioned that justices of the peace can be dismissed only on certain grounds, including "incapacity or misbehaviour"&#151;a phrase with which we are familiar in relation to professional judges and which appears in any case elsewhere in the Bill in relation to those professional judges described as district judges.
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para7"></a>Under clauses that we are about to discuss, the justices' clerk will in many cases have to substitute for justices and in others will have judicial or judicial-type functions. Why, I wonder, should the justices' clerk be more easily removable than under the provision which is fresh for lay justices and more familiar from the point of view of certain professional judges; namely, circuit judges, and, as has been the case for many years, district judges?
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para8"></a>In other words, I am more concerned about the independence of the justices' clerk being truly underlined. I am sure that I can appeal to the noble and <P>


<a name="column_493"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 493</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, in the light of his earlier remarks. I am sure that many Members of the Committee must be concerned that the justices' clerk should be able to give legal advice according to the functions set out in the next clause, freely, without worrying whether it is in accordance with some current statement by the Lord Chancellor's Department; and that that independence should be subscribed to by having a formal procedure that he can be dismissed only on certain grounds.
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para9"></a> I am more interested in getting answers to why the removal provisions are not in the Bill, and in how they could be included to help the points that I have just mentioned, than I am in the possibilities set out rather ponderously in the amendment of a complicated set of rules for consultation before a justices' clerk can be removed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   Having sat patiently through the earlier debates but not taking part, I was struck by the fact that the Minister herself stressed the importance of the independence of the justices' clerk and the high regard in which she holds the magistracy. Surely, as the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, has said, if that independence is to be clear, there must be some clear set of principles on which the clerk can be removed. I hope that the Minister will accept at least the spirit behind the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, does not look to me in vain. I support what he says, for the reasons that he gave. The Government's difficulty arises from the fact that they are turning the justices' clerks into civil servants and members of the Lord Chancellor's Department. But that does not render impossible the achievement of the change advised by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-10_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I thank all Members of the Committee who have raised this issue. Of course I understand the reasons why these concerns have been expressed.
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para10"></a>As I said in relation to other amendments, we expect that consultation with the local magistracy via the Bench chairman will continue over the assignment or replacement of justices' clerks. I suggest, however, that it would be inappropriate to consult court administration councils on such matters. While court administration councils may have a strategic role in staffing matters, they will not be the employer body; nor will they represent the interests of local magistrates. There would, of course, be nothing to prevent the local court administration council, magistrates or the justices' clerks themselves from making representations to the new court agency in the rare event that a clerk is to be removed from the post.
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para11"></a>In answer to my noble friend Lord Borrie on the removal of justices, all that is new in the Bill is listing the grounds for removal. Under the Justices of the Peace Act, the power to remove is unfettered, save by the usual public law principle.
<P>


<a name="column_494"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 494</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para12"></a> In relation to justices' clerks, they, as any other employee, or indeed civil servant, have a right to be protected from unfair dismissal, so all of those rules will continue.
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para13"></a>I should say en passant that Members of the Committee have made a clear distinction between the way in which justices and other judges are removed and the fact that that is now coming together. One remembers that justices' clerks, important as they are, are not judicial officers&#151;although they have huge importance and independence.
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para14"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, both expressed concerns about justices' clerks becoming civil servants and about the possible reduction in their independent status. Justices' clerks are currently employed by specific magistrates' courts committees. Clause 24(1) of the Bill states that justices' clerks, while exercising advisory or judicial functions, will not be subject to the direction of the Lord Chancellor or anyone else&#151;I stress "or anyone else". That reflects the current provision, which similarly guarantees independence from the justices' chief executives. So justices' clerks will have exactly the same statutory guarantee of independence in relation to their advisory and judicial functions as they currently do. We do not intend to change that position.
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para15"></a>I understand that this is a probing amendment. I hope that I have been able to give the noble Baroness satisfactory answers and she will feel able to withdraw the amendment at this stage and, it is to be hoped, not bring it back.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-10_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I thank the Minister for her helpful response, although I cannot satisfy her entirely on not bringing back an amendment at a later stage. I am grateful to the Members of the Committee who took part in the debate.
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para16"></a>I need to reflect carefully on the wording of the amendment. I am grateful for the Minister's comments with regard to the expectation that consultation would continue with justices. I need to see how that would be expressed in the Bill, if at all.
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para17"></a>I take the Minister's point that the CAC may not be the proper body to be included in the amendment, if the Bill goes forward in its current form and there are no further changes in the way in which local management takes place. I accept that, as it is currently constituted, the CAC may not be the right body to be included in the amendment. I included it to get some idea from the Government about the relationship between the CAC and the justices' clerks. I am grateful to the Minister for saying clearly that the CAC is not the employer and does not represent the interests of magistrates.
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para18"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, that more important matters underlie the amendment. A person should not be removed from his position as justices' clerk unless for a good career reason or because he is not performing to the best of his ability. The reason should be justifiable and not a matter of personal prejudice&#151;not that one would ever accuse the current <P>


<a name="column_495"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 495</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Chancellor of doing that. We are talking not about a personality but about what powers might be written into the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para19"></a>After the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, I shall consider the amendment carefully. I do not think that it should be brought back exactly as it is in its current form or simply by chopping out the CAC reference. I need to consider more closely the mechanism for removal. In those circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para20"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="30210-10_para21"></a>Clause 22 agreed to.

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030210/text/30210-11.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 53:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 10, line 33, after "things" insert "currently"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-11_para0"></a><P>

<a name="30210-11_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: With the leave of the Committee, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 53A, 53B and 54.
<P>

<a name="30210-11_para2"></a>I tabled these amendments to ask the Government to put on the record what role they see for the justices' clerk in the future, with regard not to his role in advising magistrates but to his day-to-day functions. Do the Government anticipate the further transfer of the functions of the lay magistracy to the justices' clerk?
<P>

<a name="30210-11_para3"></a>On Second Reading, the Minister said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The powers of the justices' clerk in the Bill are a re-enactment of existing powers".&#151;[Official Report, 9/12/02; col. 83.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-11_para4"></a>She is saying that I should not be unduly worried.
<P>

<a name="30210-11_para5"></a>The Government may have no intention to transfer further activity from the magistrates to the justices' clerk. However, the drafting of subsection (1) is so open that it would allow rules to be made in the future for the further transfer of functions from magistrates to justices' clerks. Why do the Government want the drafting to be left so open, unless they want to keep their options open to transfer functions away from magistrates' courts?
<P>

<a name="30210-11_para6"></a>I listened with care to the remarks of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, when he stated on Second Reading that Clause 23 was "objectionable in one respect". It is that one respect that I have picked up in this amendment. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Why cannot the Lord Chancellor define on the face of the Bill what functions currently done by JPs he wants to be done by clerks in the future? The provision, as it now stands, would allow for civil-servant-driven justice and is undesirable".&#151;[Official Report, 9/12/02; col.63.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-11_para7"></a>I agree entirely with him.
<P>

<a name="30210-11_para8"></a>Will the Minister respond to the point put so clearly by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner? Will she also give an explanation of how much or how little of the current functions of the magistrate may be transferred overall?
<P>

<a name="30210-11_para9"></a>Amendment No. 54 was tabled simply to probe what the Government have in mind for the work to be done in the new centralised system. In their quest for flexibility, do they intend to develop any new categories of assistant to do court work, who will not <P>


<a name="column_496"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 496</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be subject to the same qualifications as justices' clerks and their assistants? We have just had a brief debate with regard to whether justices' clerks must be qualified. I listened with interest to the remarks made by other Members of the Committee. I am aware of the changes over the years with regard to the legal qualifications that justices' clerks must possess. I hope that in responding to the amendment, the Minister can clarify what qualifications justices' clerks are expected to have. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   With the greatest respect, I see no point in Amendment No. 54. If the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, wanted to discuss the purpose of Clause 23 in any shape or form, she could have done so by putting down a notice that she wanted to discuss this issue. I see no point in the amendment that she tabled and she did not seek to argue any point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-11_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   It may be convenient for the Committee if I respond now, although I did attempt to argue the point. With Amendment No. 54, I am trying to find out what other persons the Government may want to do such highly qualified work. I am trying carefully not to table amendments to this clause that would lead either the magistrates or justices' clerks to assume that I was launching an assault on the role of the justices' clerk. As the noble Lord knows, the functions so far transferred to the justices from the justices' clerk, not without some controversy on occasion, are being properly carried out. Amendment No. 54 was tabled simply to get the Government to say what other people they were talking about.

<A NAME="30210-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I wish that I could agree with the noble Baroness, but I cannot. If she wanted to discuss any of the provisions of the clause, she could have done so, but to put down a meaningless amendment&#151;a point which has been underlined by what she said&#151;is purposeless.
<P>

<a name="30210-11_para10"></a>The other amendments are also utterly worthless. The word "currently" should not be applied in statute in any form. Does the noble Baroness really mean to apply it? I cannot believe it. As for the other amendments, I do not know about the omission of the word "to" in lines 33 and 34. She may have a point, but I doubt it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   I arise in puzzlement. Surely a range of consultations take place before changes are made, not only in respect of functions and duties. I am struck by the point that my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis raised about the introduction of the term "currently". I assume that "currently" means "at the moment" or "presently". If the functions and duties are constantly being considered and marginally changed, they are constantly and currently being updated.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>proceeding too quickly, especially as regards the law. Thousands and thousands of people are far better qualified than I am in this matter. I do not refer to professionals but to lay people. They watch these matters like hawks. I cannot believe that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and his officers and Ministers will undertake to do too much too quickly or too drastically. I invite the Minister to tackle the sense or, as I see it, the nonsense, of allowing the term "currently" to be spatchcocked into the Bill by the amendment we are discussing.

<A NAME="30210-11_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, took me to task in relation to my explanation of Amendment No. 54. However, I had not explained the amendments which refer to the word "to". I am simply puzzled with regard to what one does to a magistrate. That is simply a drafting point and no more. What does one do to a magistrate that one does not do before him?

<P>
<A NAME="30210-11_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I hope that I can assist the noble Baroness. Clause 23 remodels Section 45 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997. For completeness, it may help if I read out what Section 45 currently states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Rules made in accordance with section 144 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 may (except to the extent that any enactment passed after this Act otherwise directs) make provision enabling things authorised to be done by, to or before a single justice of the peace to be done instead by, to or before a justices' clerk".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-11_para12"></a>Clause 23(1), in slightly more simple language, basically redraws Section 45 but says the same thing. It sets out the functions of a justices' clerk and empowers the Lord Chancellor to make rules allowing a justices' clerk, or an assistant to a justices' clerk, to perform the functions of a single justice of the peace. The Lord Chancellor currently makes rules on the advice of, or after consultation with the Magistrates' Courts Rules Committee, but he will also now consult the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee and the Family Procedure Rule Committee before making such rules. That is the only change of substance to the provisions of Section 45 of the Justices of the Peace Act. I am in sympathy with the puzzlement of my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis and that of my noble friend Lord Graham. The noble Baroness said that the amendment was a probing amendment. I respond in that vein.
<P>

<a name="30210-11_para13"></a>Amendment No. 53, which seeks to amend subsection (1) of Clause 23, would limit those functions of a single justice of the peace which a justices' clerk is presently authorised to do to those that currently exist. I hope that the Committee will not object if I too wonder what period is covered by the term "currently". As has been said, that period would be forever changing. More to the point, I should stress that subsection (1) is not a new provision. I have outlined the precise nature of Section 45 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997. As I said, Clause 23(1) effectively re-enacts that provision. I also refer to Section 49 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which sets out certain powers which are exercisable by a <P>


<a name="column_498"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 498</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>single justice and provides that rules may permit them to be exercised by a justices' clerk. We do not think that it would be desirable if even the smallest change in the future had to be made by primary legislation, as would be the effect of this amendment, instead of by rules. I am sure that that is not what the noble Baroness intends. I should add that rules made under Clause 23 may be made only after consultation with the rule committees.
<P>

<a name="30210-11_para14"></a> Amendments Nos. 53A and 53B would remove the word "to" in two places in Clause 23(1), so that instead of referring to things done "by, to or before" a justice or a justices' clerk, it would refer to things done "by or before" them. As I mentioned, Clause 23(1) effectively re-enacts the provision in Section 45 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997. This provision was first made in the Justices of the Peace Act 1968, and the phrase "by, to or before" has been included ever since then and is well understood by all those who have sought to implement it.
<P>

<a name="30210-11_para15"></a>It has been accepted for over 30 years that it is necessary for efficiency that justices' clerks should be able to undertake some of the functions of justices of the peace. We see no reason to draw back from that policy by deleting the word "to", which would have the effect, for example, that an application made under statute "to" a justice could not be made "to" a justices' clerk, even though it was the sort of matter that did not require the involvement of a justice. Clause 23(1) therefore does nothing new. I hear the phrase whispered, "But it is unnecessary". I hope that the Committee will appreciate that, because of the way in which other statutes are framed, that "to", which looks somewhat oddly placed here, does in fact become necessary. The Committee will be aware that our most skilled and wonderful lawyers are capable of finding a hair to split on the least possible occasion. The statutes in which the word "to" is included would be encompassed within the rubric we are discussing. I hope that the noble Baroness will be satisfied with that response.
<P>

<a name="30210-11_para16"></a>Amendment No. 54 appears to seek confirmation that those functions authorised to be done by a justices' clerk or an assistant to a justices' clerk must not be done by any other person. I respectfully say that I do not see that this amendment really adds anything. The wording in subsection (2) of Clause 23 already specifically states that these functions are authorised to be done by a justices' clerk or an assistant to a justices' clerk. There is no mention of any other person undertaking these functions. Again, I should make it clear that the subsection is very similar to the present statutory provision in Section 45(2) of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997. In view of that, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>more helpful than she may have imagined. The amendments were never intended to be anything but probing.
<P>

<a name="30210-12_para0"></a> I am grateful to those Members of the Committee who took part in the debate. The Minister put us on notice that there could indeed be a further transfer of functions from magistrates to justices' clerks but only in specified circumstances. The Minister gave an assurance to the Committee that such transfer of functions would result from consultation with the appropriate bodies. I am sure that the Magistrates' Association would be included in the consultation. That is an important matter.
<P>

<a name="30210-12_para1"></a>I am delighted to hear that the Lord Chancellor's Department takes a different view on drafting from that adopted by the Home Office. The Home Office does not have such a high regard for the language of existing statutes and seeks to go all "new" on us. It disregards some of the existing legal language and substitutes more common or garden language. I accept entirely the Minister's careful explanation of why the word "to" is needed. During the passage of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill we heard from Home Office Ministers that even though certain words were commonly understood and had been for decades we ought to change them as they were not really "with it". I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30210-12_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: I tabled the amendment after listening carefully to the speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, at Second Reading. He said that he wished to ensure that under Clause 25(1) the magistrates' courts were,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"locally accessible by all communities in England and Wales. The Bill should provide for that as a statutory objective".&#151;[Official Report, 9/12/02; col. 63.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-12_para14"></a>I agree with him.
<P>

<a name="30210-12_para15"></a>I return to the argument that it is vital for all members of the community to have reasonable access to our courts. In our debates on Clause 1, I pressed an amendment that required the Lord Chancellor to have a duty to ensure that there was an efficient and effective system to support the work of the Supreme Court, county courts and magistrates' courts in both urban and rural areas. The amendment did not find favour with all Members of the Committee at that stage. I will not tire the Committee by repeating the arguments that I put then. In respect of the more narrow field of magistrates' courts under Clause 25, they are as valid as they were then.
<P>

<a name="30210-12_para16"></a>Amendment No. 56 is more narrowly focused and yet more broad in its impact. It is focused solely on access to the magistrates' courts, where well over 90 per cent of all criminal cases are heard, yet it is broader and more inclusive than my amendment to Clause 1. It does not refer to rural or urban areas. The Minister seemed to think that suburban or semi-rural areas would be omitted, and I have listened to her in that respect. In the speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, I have found a wording that must be wholly unobjectionable to her. The amendment would include the needs of all geographical areas, ethnic groups, religious groups, and those who have any difficulties with physical access, whether they use wheelchairs or not.
<P>

<a name="30210-12_para17"></a>If the Lord Chancellor wishes to gain support for his plans for the new courts agency and unified system, he needs to make clear in the Bill a duty to deploy the resources of the unified courts administration in such a way that all members of our community have reasonable access to magistrates' courts. I am reasonable in leaving it to him to define what is reasonable. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I heard what the noble Baroness said, and I am sorry to tell her that I am not convinced. What does the Lord Chancellor have to do? He has to assure himself that all members of the community have reasonable access to a magistrates' court. I do not know how he goes about his duty. If he,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall have regard to the need to ensure that all members of the community have reasonable access",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-12_para18"></a> how does he go about that? Putting a duty on the Lord Chancellor that he will find it very difficult and expensive to fulfil is inappropriate.

<P>
<A NAME="30210-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, is uncharacteristically unfair on this occasion. Like him, I have been involved in other matters in Committee upstairs and have not taken part in the debates on the Bill. However, I assume that the intention behind the amendment&#151;I thought that it was clear&#151;was to remind the Lord Chancellor of the need for all members of the public to have reasonable access to local magistrates' courts when considering matters such as their closure. There is great concern throughout the country when courts are closed and local people see justice taken further away from them. One gets complaints about the difficulty of getting to court and others of that nature.
<P>

<a name="30210-12_para20"></a> I would have thought it reasonable to ask or require the Lord Chancellor to take account of the needs of the community when deciding whether a court should be closed. Perhaps the matter is covered by another part of the Bill; if so, I apologise for raising it at this stage. It seemed to me that that must be the purpose of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30210-12_para21"></a>Living within a few miles of Knutsford, where the argument is going on at the moment, I assure the noble Baroness that feelings run very high about the closing of local magistrates' courts and people having to travel substantial distances to other courts instead.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I support the amendment, which takes me back to my early days as a solicitor when I was a partner in a small practice. The senior partner was the justices' clerk for the area, so I was naturally involved in the local court. The chairman of the Bench was Lord Maelor, Mr T.E. Jones, formerly the Member of Parliament for Merioneth. He knew everyone in the mining community of Rhosllannerchrugog. The clerk to the magistrates, my partner, Mr Maurice Evans, knew everyone in the chemical industry in Acrefair and Cefn-mawr. Between them, they could pinpoint any local miscreant to his family and background. Nothing could have been more local. They knew their people and there was a very considerable link between the Bench, the justices' clerk and the community that they served. I like to think that they occasionally did justice quite well.
<P>

<a name="30210-12_para22"></a>Today, that court has of course gone, as have the court at Llangollen where I was brought up and others in the area. The Wrexham court is now the centre of the district, with a radius of some 20 miles in all directions. It is quite impossible for that same link with the community to continue. I understand that the purpose of the amendment is to try to keep the magistrates' courts as local as possible to serve the community&#151;not just the miscreants in the community, but those who are witnesses or victims, those who need the services of the court from time to time. I very much support that position.

Nowadays in most courts in this country one's first task in the retiring room is to look through the list to see whether one knows anyone on it. That drives a coach and horses through the idea of local knowledge. One has to retire and declare an interest if one knows anyone, even the grandmother of anyone on the list.
<P>

<a name="30210-12_para23"></a>I try not to be unhelpful to the noble Baroness&#151;I never want to be unhelpful to her&#151;but the amendment is drawn with rather a broad brush. It is like inviting us to support apple pie and mother. This provision is something we all want, but to some extent the Lord Chancellor and his colleagues are in a dilemma. People can take advantage of the new freedom to move cases around because a court has wheelchair access or better video facilities. Such matters are important in trying to improve our system of justice. I do not believe that in this context one should impose a straitjacket. Of course we all want local justice, provided we can have all the other points as well.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I too support the amendment. I do not believe that anyone need be worried about the failure to define the concept of what is reasonable. The notion of what is reasonable is perhaps the only great contribution made by British jurisprudence to the study of the law. One knows it when one sees it.
<P>

<a name="30210-13_para0"></a>While agreeing with the points already raised, I view this amendment partly from the point of view of witnesses and partly from the point of view of magistrates. Time and again one hears of cases that have been held up and interfered with in one way or another because witnesses have not been able to travel long distances to attend a court in time. That is particularly true in rural areas. It is absolutely true that magistrates should have local knowledge, although, as the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, said, not necessarily knowledge of the characters of those appearing in the list. It is important that the noble Baroness should heed the letter written to her by the chairman, Dr Laurence Howard, of the Central Council of Magistrates' Courts Committees, on 5th April. In that letter, which has perfectly properly been copied to some noble Lords, he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Courthouse closures remain a key issue in relation to the proposals in the Bill. In interviews last year, the Lord Chancellor admitted that, in relation to the courts estate, there were vast opportunities for economies of scale".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-13_para1"></a>Admittedly, those words were perhaps not the most felicitous and the word "claimed" may have been better. But that is why there are anxieties that the provisions of the Bill will facilitate centralisation and economies of closure and will get in the way of locally accessible justice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   The noble and learned Lord appears to have ignored Clause 25(4)(c) where a <P>


<a name="column_503"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 503</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>specific reference to witnesses is included. I believe that the noble and learned Lord's case is met by that provision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   It has its relevance, but I do not believe that the thrust of the amendment is negatived by that. There is an overriding desirability to have reasonable access to a local magistrates' court. That drives at the whole purpose of the lay magistracy and of sustaining local confidence in locally administered justice. Although the accessibility for witnesses is one matter that the Lord Chancellor should take into account, there are also many others. I hope that my noble friend's amendment receives from the noble Baroness the careful consideration that it deserves, particularly in light of the letter from which I have just read.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I support the motive of my noble friend's amendment and I agree with what my noble friends have said, but we should aim to ensure that those who attend the courts, or who are likely to attend the courts, will behave themselves once there. There are drunkards, lunatics and notorious criminals whose behaviour, according to ushers who allow people entry to a court, may be dubious.
<P>

<a name="30210-13_para2"></a>My noble friends hope and believe that the expression "reasonable access" will cover the kind of situation that I have mentioned. If the Minister feels that the words "reasonable access" are an adequate protection, well and good, but it is arguable that we need to make it clear that good behaviour must be maintained. I suppose a slight excess of zeal may be allowed so long as people behave properly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-13_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   As we are in Committee, perhaps I may ask my noble friend a question. My noble friend spoke about the need for proper behaviour within court buildings. The Committee will be aware that such behaviour is not always adhered to. Does my noble friend agree with me that once someone is in a court building there is recourse to common law in regard to any misbehaviour that takes place and that once in a courtroom there could be recourse to contempt of court? Perhaps that reassures my noble friend about existing ways of dealing with people's behaviour.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I have listened carefully to all that has been said in an important debate which goes to the heart of our criminal justice system. Access for all is an important matter. We have a certain sympathy for the amendment in those terms because the Government want to see access for all. However, we have another important responsibility which is to ensure that the courts' estate is run well and efficiently and that it works. That is why Clause 25 is so drafted. It empowers the Lord Chancellor to direct where and when magistrates' courts are to sit. That would allow magistrates' courts' business to be conducted at any place in England and Wales. It brings magistrates' courts into line with the Crown Court, the High Court, <P>


<a name="column_504"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 504</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Court of Appeal and county courts. The power to determine when magistrates' courts sit is likely to be used as an emergency measure only; for example, when determining the days on which courts will close for civil service privilege days.
<P>

<a name="30210-13_para3"></a>Amendment No. 56 would require the Lord Chancellor, when directing the places in which magistrates' courts may sit, to have regard to the need to ensure that all members of the community have reasonable access to a local magistrates' court. I am grateful for the way in which the issue has been raised. As the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said in the debate on Amendment No. 2, in our view improved access to local courts can be achieved only when the unification of the administration of the courts' system is properly in place. It is our belief that the unification of court administration will allow better use of the court estate, including increased opportunity for co-location of county courts within magistrates' courts in rural areas. That will permit a wider range of rural areas to have the services of both county courts and magistrates' courts.
<P>

<a name="30210-13_para4"></a>There are already a number of examples of such developments, including co-location of county courts within magistrates' courts buildings in Rotherham, Kendal and Ashford. Additionally, I understand that the county court in Altringham has recently moved into improved accommodation in Trafford magistrates' court; a reverse approach, perhaps.
<P>

<a name="30210-13_para5"></a>The rural White Paper 2000 ensures that rural needs are taken into account as part of the formal policy-making process from April 2001. This is often described as "rural-proofing" policy making, as I said in our earlier debate. It requires that government departments assess whether policies will have a different impact in rural areas; and, where necessary, decide what sort of policy adjustments or compensations need to be built into the general policy to reflect rural needs and circumstances. The Lord Chancellor will have to have regard to rural-proofing when making directions under Clause 25.
<P>

<a name="30210-13_para6"></a>Provisions in this clause and elsewhere in the Bill will remove current statutory restrictions on where magistrates' courts can sit. Magistrates' courts are, for example, currently unable to sit on licensed premises. Some may say that that is beneficial. On a recent visit to one of my favourite rural pubs I noticed a courtroom. I was told that many decades ago it was indeed a courtroom; a court leet, I believe. But that is a digression.
<P>

<a name="30210-13_para7"></a>Removing restrictions will introduce greater flexibility, and would allow the use of non-court buildings in local areas where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30210-13_para8"></a>If we were minded to accept the need for the amendment, we would hesitate to insert the phrase "the community" into legislation without any notion of what it might cover. The amendment would also need a couple of other small corrections. Clause 25(1) confers a power on the Lord Chancellor, so the amendment should not refer to a duty on him, and it should make reference to "court houses" rather than courts, since a magistrates' court is defined in the <P>


<a name="column_505"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 as being the justices, not the building. There are some technical issues to be considered in the amendment's construction if it is deemed necessary to retable it for further clarification.
<P>

<a name="30210-13_para9"></a>I return to the rural dimension, which has been referred to by a number of noble Lords&#151;particularly the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford&#151;concerned that rural services are being lost. We have made plain our commitment to work closely in this regard with the Countryside Agency and other rural bodies to develop effective policies for the delivery of rural justice. We have worked closely with them on our proposals for the civil and family estate. They are comfortable with our arrangements and with the premise that services should be defined by the service itself rather than by the bricks and mortar through which it is delivered. That is an important consideration.
<P>

<a name="30210-13_para10"></a>The new arrangement will enable extensive co-location of services across all jurisdictions from joint facilities. The Countryside Agency is clearly happy about that. It will reduce the prospect of closures. There have been many closures in the past year for the understandable reason of rationalising and making good and effective use of the estate.
<P>

<a name="30210-13_para11"></a>Under a unified administration it should be easier to share buildings and to timetable particular cases in courts with the right facilities. There will be increased access&#151;which is the point of the amendment&#151;to specialist facilities that will enable and benefit all court users. I hope with those assurances and our desire to do our best to ensure future access, the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30210-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   With the greatest respect, I was not saying that there is no such thing as community. I believe the expression the noble Lord remembered was, "There is no such thing as society", but I may be wrong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I stand corrected. Might we use the word "stakeholders" instead? My enthusiasm for the word "stakeholders" has increased since I looked in the Oxford English Dictionary and discovered that it was first used in the sense used by the Minister by my noble friend Lord Dahrendorf in the 1970s. When after the next general election we take our seats on the Benches opposite, we shall say, "We are the stakeholders now" at the same time as singing "Lloyd George knew my father".

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 506</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to the Minister for the care that he took in his response. I agree that the drafting is not as good as it should be; the amendment was tabled to stimulate our debate.
<P>

<a name="30210-14_para0"></a>In moving the amendment I was telegraphic to a fault when I said that I underlined everything I had said in moving my amendment under Clause 1, because I did not make it clear that the underlying problem in Clause 1(2) was the public concern about court closures. I am grateful to noble Lords who picked up the cudgels on that point.
<P>

<a name="30210-14_para1"></a>I will not go into detail on noble Lords' responses. They were all right in some respects. I will take account of everything that was said, particularly the Minister's remarks, in order to look more carefully at the drafting. I agreed with his observations, with the exception of that on the word "community". There is such anxiety about closures and the necessity to ensure clarity in the Bill in giving reasonable powers to the Lord Chancellor that I shall return to the matter in some form on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"(c) provided with training as a fines officer by the Lord Chancellor"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30210-14_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: We come to the difficult and thorny question of fines officers. I tabled this amendment after listening to the issues raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, at Second Reading (at col. 65 of Hansard of 9th December 2002) when he posed some questions that the Minister did not fully address. First, what will be the status of fines officers; <P>


<a name="column_507"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 507</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and, secondly, from whose ranks are they likely to be drawn? The letter of the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Fines officers will largely be drawn from existing MCC staff, many of whom have long experience of dealing with defaulters. They will have training and guidance to support them in their new role and this will be developed in the course of the pilot schemes".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-14_para13"></a>But we need to ensure that the Minister puts the matter on the record at the Dispatch Box. If fines officers will "largely" be drawn from existing MCC staff, where will the minority be drawn from?
<P>

<a name="30210-14_para14"></a>As a new and difficult role in the courts' system, it is essential that the correct training procedures are put in place in order for the position to be respected. As I have previously stated, fines are the most common penalty handed out by magistrates' courts. For that reason alone, this new role will be busy and demanding. It is essential that the officers are given proper support and guidelines from the beginning. We wish to know what training they will be given. Will it be completed before the first pilot scheme is launched?
<P>

<a name="30210-14_para15"></a>We accept, as the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, says in her letter, that fines officers will not decide the amount of any increase or discount. That amount will be set down in regulations. But they will decide whether to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"vary in the defendant's favour the method and timing by which the fine imposed by the court should be paid, and to take 'further steps' to secure payments of a fine".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-14_para16"></a>So they are taking sensitive decisions. What if they mistakenly decide not to vary terms? That could have disastrous consequences for a defendant, or it might cause him or her not to bother to pay.
<P>

<a name="30210-14_para17"></a>As the Lord Chancellor will appoint the new fines officers, we feel that he should also have responsibility for their training. It would be common sense for the Lord Chancellor to provide this training in order to ensure consistency throughout the country. It would also enable fines officers to operate in any of the local justice areas, thereby providing flexibility of employment.
<P>

<a name="30210-14_para18"></a> If we are to improve the system for collection of fines, it is vital that the new system is robust and well respected&#151;otherwise people will continue to fail to pay their fines. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   This is the first amendment to raise questions about the fines officers. The issue has caused me a good deal of concern. I support the amendment. However, having considered in detail the amendments before the Committee, there are further issues which they do not raise. I intend on Report to return to some of those matters. I apologise for not addressing them in Committee. There are two aspects with which I am particularly concerned. The first is the increase in the fine. There is considerable advantage in having interest payable on default rather than having a single massive uplift in the fine. Secondly, I am concerned about the <P>


<a name="column_508"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 508</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extent to which the fines officer can take decisions to apply a clamping order. Those topics, unfortunately, cannot be discussed at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   I wish to make a point which I hope will not be regarded as what the noble Baroness would describe as a "hair-splitting" one. The proposal is to add a paragraph to what is a definition clause. We might then have the following position. If it could be shown by a disgruntled defaulter that a particular fines officer had not been provided with the training required under the Act, it might be claimed that he was not a fines officer at all. That would be unfortunate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-14_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Clause 32 provides for the Lord Chancellor to designate fines officers, whose role will be to manage the collection and enforcement of fines. I am very happy that the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, has read out much of my letter. I endorse everything that I said in the letter and I say from the Dispatch Box that we do not resile from any of it. That is our position. I hope that helps the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="30210-14_para19"></a>Amendment No. 58, tabled by the noble Baroness, proposes that a line be added to the Bill that identifies a fines officer as someone who has been provided with training by the Lord Chancellor. I entirely take the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, that that would be an additional flaw to the provision.
<P>

<a name="30210-14_para20"></a>It is in the interest of the fines collection scheme that fines officers are well trained. However, it is not the usual practice to make statutory provisions for training court staff.
<P>

<a name="30210-14_para21"></a> Clause 31(1) states that fines officers are appointed by the Lord Chancellor under Section 2(1) and are designated as fines officers by him. Fines officers will largely be drawn from existing magistrates' courts committee staff, many of whom have had long experience in dealing with defaulters. The noble Baroness asked about the minority. We are now in the days of open competition where experienced and expert people can apply. I am sure that it would be open to the courts to decide whether they were satisfied that a person applying for a fines officer's job had the appropriate understanding, experience and so on.
<P>

<a name="30210-14_para22"></a>Of course I cannot say that each and every person will be drawn from the current cadre of people who serve the courts, but the noble Baroness will know that it is more likely than not that such persons will have the ability and experience that best places them to fulfil that role. It would be quite improper on the face of the statute to exclude anyone who is not currently employed by the Court Service. The provision is framed to enable the reality of that situation to be voiced.
<P>

<a name="30210-14_para23"></a>Guidance will be given to magistrates' courts as to the specific training a fines officer will require. These requirements may be further developed throughout the pilots. The fines collection regulations will provide clear procedures for fines officers to follow. I hope that that meets many of the concerns of the noble Baroness.
<P>


<a name="column_509"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 509</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-14_para24"></a>It is also right that, as I set out in the letter, the fines officer will have no power to decide whether or not a fine should be imposed or to determine the level of a fine. The Courts Bill gives a fines officer power to vary the method and timing by which the fine imposed by the court should be paid, and to take "further steps" to secure payment of a fine; for example, issuing a warrant of distress, registering the sum due in a new combined register of judgments, making an attachment of earnings order and making a clamping order. Sanctions imposed for late or non-payment are a consequence of non-compliance with the financial sentence imposed by the court and are designed primarily to encourage payment.
<P>

<a name="30210-14_para25"></a>The noble Baroness asked what would happen if the individual applicant did not agree with the fines officer's wishes for disposal of the fines. In those circumstances there could be an appeal or a "referring back"&#151;that is perhaps more accurate&#151;to the court for it to so determine. Therefore, the person subjected to the fine would have a right of recourse if he was not in agreement with the arrangement made by the fines officer.
<P>

<a name="30210-14_para26"></a> I hope that that assists the noble Baroness with the issues that she raised. I note what the noble Lord said in relation to his further matters. If and when those are raised we shall of course respond. I also reiterate that we shall meet Front Bench spokesmen and other interested noble Lords to discuss this topic between Committee and Report. If there are any issues that noble Lords want to raise between those times, or indeed between Committee dates, I shall be more than happy to respond as best I can.

<A NAME="30210-14_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing the contents of her letter and to having them recorded in Hansard, saying that the Government's view is that there should be open competition. If that is so, it is even more essential for some form of training to be given to applicants from outside the court service. I was interested to hear that if there were a dispute between the defendant and the fines officer, it would be referred back to the court.
<P>

<a name="30210-14_para27"></a> We are grateful for the Minister's helpful assurances, but we shall read Hansard carefully and take it from there. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30210-15_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 59, I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 60 and 61, which are intended to probe a number of issues.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para2"></a>First, I refer to the statement made at Second Reading by the Lord Chancellor that on fines there will be a "framework of national standards" for fines collection to,
<P>

<a name="column_510"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 510</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para4"></a>Another issue is the statements made by the Lord Chancellor about the way in which Schedule 2 will operate in giving guidance to fines collection officers. If the officers are to be allowed to carry out the quasi-judicial functions referred to in the Bill, the regulations will need to be closely and carefully drafted to ensure that the officers can exercise their discretion appropriately.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para5"></a>At the moment the Bill gives the Lord Chancellor the power to amend the operation of the fines collection scheme, which is of course a pilot. That means that the scheme that he ultimately implements may bear little resemblance to the one that we are debating now. The amendment would delete from the Bill the power of the Lord Chancellor to modify or alter Schedule 2 without the approval of Parliament. In other words, what we see is what we get.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para6"></a>We have concerns about magistrates alone having the power to vary sentences&#151;to increase or decrease them in their judicial function. We do not want to see fines officers taking on a judicial role and blurring the line between the administration and the Bench. Surely the European Convention on Human Rights requires punishment to be imposed by an independent and impartial tribunal after a fair and public hearing. We therefore seek assurance that the Lord Chancellor will not increase or vary the powers of fines officers without leave of Parliament. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-15_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I shall reiterate the purpose of Clause 31 to put in context some of the issues. Clause 31 will give court staff&#151;the fines officers&#151;responsibility for the management and collection of financial penalties on behalf of the court, while reserving courtroom hearings as a last resort when judicial decisions are called for. That will give magistrates time to deal more rigorously with cases of persistent default. Taken together with the provisions of Schedule 2 and Clauses 89 and 90, the new arrangements will help to prevent the build-up of arrears and increase timely payments. They will do this by a system in which the outstanding financial order is constantly monitored and prompt action is taken, through the fines collection scheme set out in Schedule 2, to ensure payment.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para7"></a>As we said earlier, one of the difficulties with which many magistrates are faced is the variable quality and approach of fines enforcement. Fines are a very powerful form of sentencing tool if used correctly and if properly enforced. Obviously we want the imposition and collection of fines improved throughout the court system.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 59 and 60 would prevent the modification of Schedule 2 either before or after the pilot schemes, which Clause 31 allows. Amendment No. 61 would make the regulations setting out the detail of the fines collection scheme subject to affirmative resolution, and in the case of Amendment No. 144, would make the details of the pilot schemes subject to affirmative resolution.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para9"></a> I understand the interest in the details of the proposed arrangements that have prompted the amendments. However, I can explain why the <P>


<a name="column_511"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 511</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provision in Clause 31(5), which allows modifications of Schedule 2, is necessary if we are to get full value from the pilots. It will allow different elements of the scheme to be piloted in different areas, so that their effectiveness in improving the payment rate can be evaluated. For example, a discount for prompt payment and/or an increase for default may be piloted in one area; and wheel-clamping or registration of the debt as sanctions for defaulters may be piloted in another. That flexibility would be lost if the Government were to accept Amendment No. 59.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para10"></a>The enforcement measures, as a number of noble Lords have made plain, are a significant departure from existing practice. The Government believe that they should be thoroughly tested before implementation. There would be little merit in piloting the measures unless it were possible to change, or even abandon, elements of the package that did not work as intended. Pilots will be carried out immediately following Royal Assent during late 2003 or early 2004 with an aim to introducing the fines collection scheme as soon as possible following that evaluation.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para11"></a> The noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, will know that those who operate within the courts are best placed to tell us how effective the measures are. We are willing to accept that some of them may not work as well in practice as they appear to work in theory or on paper. We shall evaluate the position as some of these measures may be wrong. If so, we shall set them aside.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para12"></a>As the Bill stands, once the pilot schemes have been evaluated, the Lord Chancellor may make an order under Clause 31(8) modifying Schedule 2 and associated legislation in the light of experience of the pilots. That final package, which may be the whole scheme as presently envisaged, or a modified scheme, would then be put to Parliament for approval under the affirmative resolution procedure before being rolled out nationally. If it seems appropriate there is nothing to prevent that happening prior to the introduction of the unified administration.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para13"></a>This approach will enable the Government to bring forward a package of tried and tested measures, which we can be sure will deliver the improvements in performance that all Members of the Committee want to see. However, that would not be possible were the Government to accept Amendment No. 60.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para14"></a> Amendment No. 61 would make any regulations in relation to fine enforcement, including those made for the purpose of enabling the scheme to operate with existing legislation, subject to the affirmative resolution of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para15"></a>As currently drafted, the Bill provides for fines collection regulations that will flesh out the fines collection scheme. The regulations will set out the percentage level for discounts and increases; the procedures for enforcing a clamping order; and the responsibilities of fines officers. They will provide the detailed scheme to be tested in the pilots. The Government believe that the necessary level of detail and flexibility ought not to require a high level of parliamentary scrutiny. The Select Committee on <P>


<a name="column_512"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 512</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform found that the power for fines regulations to be subject to negative resolution was appropriately delegated and subject to the correct level of parliamentary control.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para16"></a>Lastly, I turn to Amendment No. 144. I think that I have the old grouping here.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   Amendment No. 144 has been returned to its natural place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-15_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I apologise to the Committee; I suddenly realised when I began to speak to Amendment No. 144 that that was under the old grouping, not the new one; it is now detached.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para17"></a> I hope that I have said enough to allow the noble Baroness to understand why we have phrased the powers for the pilots as we have. That will give us the flexibility we need.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para18"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether, if officers have quasi-judicial functions, the regulations will need to be carefully agreed, I think. Fines officers are concerned with administrative implementation of the court's decisions, not a quasi-judicial function. The scheme to be introduced will be based on the pilots; the requirement for confirmation by affirmative resolution is in place. Officers' powers are confined to what is in Schedule 2. The powers could be introduced in part, but additional powers could not be introduced.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para19"></a>I hope that I have said enough to reassure the noble Baroness on that point and that she will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-15_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   I thank the Minister for explaining her thinking on the matter. I am sure that all Members of the Committee agree that prompt action on enforcement is essential if one is to obtain a good response.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para20"></a> One issue concerns me. I should be glad to hear the Minister's thinking on increases in fines. We all understand that remission may be due to someone losing their employment or experiencing some other financial problem in the family. But would an increase be in interest on the amount? Otherwise, that appears to be a quasi-judicial function.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-15_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I hoped that I had made plain that the regulations will indicate the criteria to be applied for the increase to occur. They may specify that non-payment of the fine within a specified period will lead to a specified rate of increase. So fines officers will not be setting the level but implementing what the court has already determined.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para21"></a>I anticipate that what will happen will be similar to what happens now when a court comes to sentence. The court will tell the individual concerned that they will be fined the sum of £X and there will be the usual discussion about how the fine should be arranged over time. It may then be for the court to say, "If there are further or other difficulties, you may make application to the fines officer". I anticipate that the court would then outline the variations that the fines officer could be charged with arranging and say, "In the event that <P>


<a name="column_513"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 513</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>you do not agree with the fines officer, you may return the matter to court and we will determine it". So the fines officer will be the tool to deliver the judgment and sentence imposed by the court. Fines officers will not themselves be carrying out a judicial or quasi-judicial function.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para22"></a>We do not propose that interest will be charged in that connection. The schedule provides for a percentage increase or a discount to be set by the Lord Chancellor that will be applied universally by all courts in the appropriate circumstances. One can compare that to what happens with a value added tax return: if one does not return it within X amount of time it rises by X per cent, which tends to encourage people to pay.
<P>

<a name="30210-15_para23"></a>As I said, each pilot will trial one arrangement&#151;wheel clamping may be another example&#151;and we will see which is the better course. We may find that all are equally successful and there will then be a menu from which the court can take its delight. We shall see.

"( ) For the avoidance of doubt, where this Schedule applies, the court may reserve to itself any case which shall not then be subject to enforcement through the fines collection scheme."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30210-16_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 63. The amendments cover a subject on which I have already touched but wish to expand. We are concerned about the removal of powers from magistrates to fines officers. There appears to be no safeguard in the Bill as drafted for magistrates to ensure that they can keep control of a case and exercise their judicial function, rather than handing it over to the fines officers. We seek assurance from the Minister that the court may reserve to itself any case rather than send it to a fines collection officer.
<P>

<a name="30210-16_para6"></a>I again want to raise the issue of human rights and ensure that they will be complied with and that people will be judged by magistrates, not fines officers. It makes sense to include in the Bill provisions to enable magistrates to keep control of cases which they feel may need reviewing or changing, as they are best placed to make such decisions and have the authority to do so. On Second Reading, the Government said that the Bill allowed a court to do that, but it is not clear in the Bill. Our amendment would make it clear. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3>collection. I apologise to my noble friend for not having given her better notice of what I consider is an important related aspect.
<P>

<a name="30210-16_para7"></a>When I came to the House in 1983, a friend of mine, Mr Malcolm Hurlston, asked me to be busy on his behalf. I took a deputation to see the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham. My friend was concerned about consumer credit and a range of bodies had an interest in the matter. Eventually, with the support of Lord Hailsham and his department, a body called Registry Trust was established. The function of Registry Trust, which is a non-profit making body, is to work, by and large, on behalf of the consumer movement and consumer credit givers to ensure that the creditworthiness of people who get themselves into difficulty&#151;and are sometimes fined as a result by the courts for non-payment&#151;is codified.
<P>

<a name="30210-16_para8"></a>If not tonight, perhaps at some other time, my noble friend can say something about the relevance of Registry Trust and its valuable work over the past 15 years. In 1985, a contract with the Lord Chancellor's Department for the administration of the registry was signed. Since then, it has been a free-standing part of, but adjacent to, the credit-giving industry and the fines enforcement agency, which we are now discussing. It is self-financing, so we are discussing interlocking the various bits of the jigsaw. The revenue for the registry comes, first, from fees from members of the public, which are set by the Lord Chancellor's Department in consultation with the Treasury. Secondly, it comes from fees from the purchases of small files, which are set at 30p per judgment compared with 40p per judgment, which was the fee when the registry was operated directly by the department in 1985. Subscriptions from purchasers of the full consumer and commercial files are agreed by the Registry Trust board and vary according to the number of purchasers. There is interest income from the trust's reserves. Since then, as we know, the credit industry has grown and grown. Many good people previously not affected by it now find that their interests and those of their families and communities are affected by the impact and implications of giving credit.
<P>

<a name="30210-16_para9"></a>Can the Minister say anything about the development and the importance of fines officers as regards the current well-established and well-operated Registry Trust? Obviously, that body will be looking with some care at the burgeoning credit enforcement business, which is the fines officers. This matter has come completely out of the blue because I received the facts only an hour ago. The Minister may be able to say something which knits together these two important segments. I pray in aid Lord Hailsham who showed his interest in these matters, not by encouragement but through recognition of the valuable part that a body like the Registry Trust can play.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Jones: </B>   With diffidence, I follow the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Graham, and those of the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe. Magistrates and the courts are given targets for the collection of fines. On what do the Government base their proposals as they <P>


<a name="column_515"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 515</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>affect magistrates? What research have the Government undertaken on the collection of fines and on which they make their proposals? Is there any detail so far as regards the collection of fines, which Ministers and the department have worked on for the presentation of their proposals?
<P>

<a name="30210-16_para10"></a>Magistrates face a great deal of pressure to achieve full payment of fines. It is interesting to calculate what further pressure will come about and whether the courts' system can withstand it. The approach of various courts differs. Often it relates to the prevailing economic and social conditions pertaining to given areas. I believe I have heard employment, or the lack of it, mentioned.
<P>

<a name="30210-16_para11"></a> The work of the fines courts can create very depressing occasions. In a fines court magistrates learn the consequences of their justice. They face the reality of what they have decided. In such courts where, presumably, fines officers will attend, the lives of those fined is laid bare. The extent of poverty is sharply defined under questioning from the magistrates who are themselves under pressure to collect. It also becomes very obvious whether or not the accused has the ability to manage the debt or his or her own budget.
<P>

<a name="30210-16_para12"></a>We are discussing very sensitive and serious matters. I would like Ministers to be able to acknowledge that the relationship between the fines officer, the magistrates and their clerk will be crucial and that the proposals within the Bill will make it easier, not harder, for magistrates and others to achieve the Government's objective.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   May I hark back to the mention of human rights? At Second Reading I expressed very grave doubts as to whether the position of the fines officer was compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act. The noble Baroness wrote a letter saying that of course they were compatible. I believe that at some stage I said, I hope in moderate language, that if that was right we could abolish any independence in the High Court, the circuit courts or in any tribunal so long as there was a right of appeal. I do not take that back.
<P>

<a name="30210-16_para13"></a>There was a very significant passage in what the noble Baroness said earlier today. She referred to a right of appeal or, more accurately, a reference to the court by the alleged defaulter. I make it clear from my point of view that that is the difference. If a fines officer says that he is going to increase the amount to be paid, and if at that stage the alleged defaulter can say, "Thank you very much, but no, I wish the matter to be decided by a court", that is all right in my book. What is not all right is that the decision should be binding unless overturned on appeal. That would turn the matter into a judicial decision. I thought that this might be the opportunity to back track on the lines I have mentioned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-16_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Tenby: </B>   I wish to refer to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Jones. There are figures about the non-collection of fines, which is part of the problem. <P>


<a name="column_516"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 516</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>They are not being collected for the most part. I am sure that the Minister will confirm that. It is important that they should be collected because if the overwhelming number of disposals of cases is by way of fines, and if they are not being paid, I can assure Members of the Committee that magistrates will be tempted into passing alternative sentences, which may not be half as attractive or applicable. Therefore, it is very important that fines are collected.
<P>

<a name="30210-16_para14"></a>I say this so that I do not sound like a hard-hearted swine. It is also important that fines should be levied on the situation of the person paying them. That is absolutely critical. Even now, with all the training which magistrates receive, one still has cases of inappropriate fines being levied. For example, it may well be that a fine would be reasonable in certain circumstances if it were only £20, which would make the average man in the street gasp. But a fine of £20 on one particular person may present a mountain to climb whereas a fine of £1,000 for a city slicker would not be thought unduly harsh. I say to Members of the Committee something which I am sure they know already. Settling the issue of fines is of critical importance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   This debate has raised an important issue. I am not entirely convinced about the desirability of Amendments Nos. 62 and 63 as they stand. Their significance has been to raise the debate rather than propose an effective solution. There are concerns about the powers of a fines officer. I am not entirely sure that they are contrary to the Human Rights Act. I note that the Joint Committee on Human Rights has not raised in its report any particular concern over this issue. Nevertheless, the power of a fines officer to increase a fine by 50 per cent is serious. If it is to be exercised in that form, it might be a more appropriate task for the court rather than a fines officer. That is one of the reasons why the Government should consider seriously having a system of interest payments rather than a single, large increase. That would enable a defaulter to pay his fine at a much more reasonable rate.
<P>

<a name="30210-16_para15"></a>A point of serious importance has not been raised. Although, properly, there is a right of appeal of a fines officer's decision, it can be exercised only within 10 working days. There is no provision for an extension of that time. That will mean that if the appeal is not made within 10 working days there will be no way in which it can be brought before a magistrates' court. Where there is a time limit in the Bill, unless it also specifies that the time may be extended, there is no power to extend. It cannot be done by regulations. I may be wrong, but I see no such provision in the Bill. I intend to table an amendment on Report to allow magistrates' courts to extend the time.

<A NAME="30210-17_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I shall seek to address immediately two important questions of the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe. She asked whether there were safeguards for magistrates to keep control of cases rather than hand them over to fines officers. There are. The court may reserve a case to itself by not <P>


<a name="column_517"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 517</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>making a matter subject to the fines collection scheme, with the result that they will remain seized of it. Also, there will be nothing to prevent the fines officer referring a case back to a court, or the court stipulating at the point of sentencing that it wishes the matter to be referred to it at any stage. So the court will retain judicial oversight of the case throughout.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para0"></a>Before discussing the substance of the amendments, I shall deal with the issues that arose. I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, for generously accepting that if, as we provide, the issue is referred to the court for it to determine, that deals with his points. Respectfully I agree with him&#151;not surprisingly&#151;and thank him for the generosity that he evidenced by making that concession.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para1"></a>The issue raised by my noble friend Lord Graham will be dealt with when we consider Clause 90. It provides a single piece of legislation on the registration of judgments and fines. As the noble Lord mentioned, the register of county court judgments has operated successfully for 150 years&#151;a long time. The clause will re-enact and bring up to date Sections 73 and 73A of the County Courts Act 1984, which deal with the registration of county court judgments and extend the power of registration to High Court judgments and fines. I shall discuss the matter further when we reach Clause 90.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para2"></a>My noble friend Lord Jones discussed the performance of magistrates' courts fines collection and the sensitivity that one needs to adopt to the different economic background against which fines are made. We agree with the noble Lord that that may have been a factor. However, in our research, it was interesting to discover that the administrative acts taken to enforce fines were different and not totally dependent on the economic backdrop against which they were made.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para3"></a>That leads to the question of how we can ensure that there is enforcement at an appropriately high standard across the piece. The noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, was right in saying that the problem in setting fines is that the punishment must fit the defendant as well as the crime. He is right in saying that what may be onerous for one defendant because of the size of his pocket may be a mere bagatelle for another&#151;even a £10,000 fine, which would not be a huge impediment for some extremely wealthy defendants. Those issues must be taken into account. Again, the noble Viscount was right in saying that it is important to get the fines structure right so that a fine remains a valid sentence capable of ceasing aberrant behaviour and ensuring that people comply with their duty.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jones, asked what the Government based their proposals on, and what research had been carried out. A major report on what works in fine enforcement has been undertaken as part of the Government's crime reduction programme. It will be published next month. Emerging research findings have highlighted the importance of delegating the administrative task of collecting the money to the greatest possible extent. That view was confirmed in <P>


<a name="column_518"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 518</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the National Audit Office report published in March 2002 and the subsequent Public Accounts Committee report published in November 2002.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para5"></a>I understand why the noble Baroness tabled Amendments Nos. 62 and 63. But Schedule 2 provides for the payment and enforcement of fines, costs and compensation imposed after criminal proceedings. It provides new powers for fines officers to enable enforcement actions to be taken swiftly and without the need for a court hearing in many instances. It also gives the court additional enforcement powers on top of existing provisions.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para6"></a> I hope that, as a result of what I have said, the noble Baroness will not feel it necessary to press either amendment, and that she will be content to withdraw them.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   The Minister did not reply to the question on time limits. I appreciate why it would be difficult for her to do so. But will she look at the matter again before Report stage?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-17_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   I am grateful to noble Lords who have taken part in what has proved an interesting and wide-ranging debate. I am delighted that we were able to provide a vehicle for the noble Lord, Lord Graham, to talk about the fines enforcement agency. It has emerged that all noble Lords understand the importance of the imposition of an appropriate fine so that it does not have to be varied later. Obviously, circumstances can change; but it is important to ensure that the appropriate level is imposed at the right time.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para7"></a>I thank the noble Baroness for her detailed explanation and for undertaking to take on board what has been said. It is a serious issue, which has proved that it is even more important to return to the matter at a later stage. For now, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30210-17_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: In speaking to Amendment No. 66, I speak also to Amendments Nos. 67 and 69.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para15"></a>Amendment No. 66 seeks to enquire whether "clamping orders" will have to be enforced in accordance with the arrangements in the PSI Act&#151;clamping is a licensed activity that can only be carried out under the supervision of the new Private Security Industry Authority&#151;or whether the arrangements for clamping under Schedule 2 will be wholly separate.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para16"></a>Will the Government clarify the following points on clamping orders? Who will carry out the clamping? Will they have to be licensed under the PSI Act 2001? What consideration has been given to the interrelation between clamping orders under Schedule 2 and the provisions of the PSI Act? If the PSI Act is, or is not, to apply, and there has been a conscious decision taken to have, or not to have, it applied, will the Government explain the reasons for their decision? Such an order should be made only by the court and not by any other person. Amendment No. 67 seeks to ensure that.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para17"></a>Finally, I turn to the topic of fine collection by fines officers. The Bill states that a person commits an offence if he provides false information to a fines officer about his financial circumstances and will be liable on summary conviction to a fine. Asking for information is only valid if, in addition, it has been notified to the court which imposed the fine; the fines officer cannot go fishing for information without the court's knowledge. That would make for better management of fine collection and reinforce the general position that we have taken. The fines officer should be subordinate to the will of the court. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Amendment No. 67 is particularly important and I strongly support it. A clamping order is one which can have serious consequences&#151;in some respects, more serious than an increase in the fine. For example, it may mean that a vehicle is clamped which is needed for travel to work or to take children to school. There are many circumstances in which a clamping order on a vehicle can have serious consequences.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para18"></a>I appreciate that a person who is liable to pay a fine and fails to do so should be aware of the possible consequences of non-payment. Excuses for non-payment should not be easily accepted. However, although I am entirely happy, in principle, with the idea of the clamping order, the arguments are very strong for saying that it is sufficiently serious to require that it should be made by the court itself and not by the fines officer&#151;even though the fines officer's clamping order can be subject to an appeal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-17_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I appreciate why clamping orders have excited so much anxiety. We know that vehicles are sometimes the closest to individual hearts&#151;closer sometimes even than members of the family. Therefore, vehicles must be jealously protected.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para19"></a>The Government do not take the view that these amendments are necessary. I shall speak to them at some length in order to reassure noble Lords why the scheme should work well. Of course, I add the caveat that the pilot scheme will help us to taste whether the pudding is as good as it currently looks.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para20"></a>The amendments tabled by noble Lords and spoken to today by the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, seek to place restrictions on the sanction of clamping by preventing a fines officer from making a clamping order, by requiring proof of ownership prior to clamping and by restricting only to vehicles parked on the road. Amendment No. 69 would require the court to be notified in every case where a fines officer seeks means information from an offender. The whole purpose of the fines officer is that he or she has specific tasks delegated to them by the court and, at all times, is subject to the court's direction.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para21"></a>Amendment No. 66 adds a subsection to Schedule 2 which refers to the Private Security and Industry Act. That subsection would state that a clamping order would not be licensable conduct under the Act. The fitting of an immobilisation device is an activity liable to control under this Act, but only when fitted to a vehicle which is not on the road. Stipulating that a clamping order is not licensable conduct would effectively mean that the person instructed to enforce the clamping order could only clamp a vehicle which is parked on the road. Vehicles proved to be registered in the offender's name, but parked on a driveway, could not be clamped. Knowing that, the offender could easily evade the sanction by moving the car as the clamping enforcers arrive to prevent an immobilisation device from being fitted.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para22"></a>Amendment No. 67 alters the wording of paragraph 13(3) of Schedule 2 to restrict the making of a clamping order to the court. A fines officer would not be able to make a clamping order. The Government's view is that a clamping order is a means of eliciting payment or prompting the offender to contact the court. In that respect, it is no different from other enforcement methods. The decision on which method is the best one to employ is an administrative matter which should fall to the fines officer. However, under our proposals, the court will make the decision on the sale of the vehicle after it has been clamped.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para23"></a>The pilot schemes will reveal whether the provisions relating to clamping will cause particular difficulties. Clause 31 contains powers which will enable the fines collection scheme to be modified in the light of experience of the pilots. Should any element of the scheme fail to operate as intended, we shall take the opportunity to make any necessary adjustments.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para24"></a>Amendment No. 69 requires the court to be notified in every case where a fines officer seeks means information from an offender. The fines collection scheme set out in Schedule 2 is designed to ensure that responsibility for the collection of financial penalties imposed by the court is placed in the hands of administrative staff. That builds on the existing enforcement regime, under which administrative staff already exercise delegated powers, under the Justices' <P>


<a name="column_521"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 521</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clerks Rules 1999, to allow further time to pay or to vary the number and date of instalments. Both the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee recommend greater delegation of enforcement responsibilities to administrative staff where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para25"></a>Under the new scheme, the offender may apply to the fines officer for a variation in the initial repayment terms set by the court. The fines officer will only be able to vary the payment terms once and will not be able to determine, or alter, the level of the fine&#151;only the rate of repayment. Subsequent requests for variation must be directed back to the court.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para26"></a>In support of any application for more favourable payment terms, the fines officer will expect the offender to provide information about his ability to pay. Paragraph 20 of Schedule 2 empowers the fines officer to request that information. The Government believe that it is unnecessary to inform the court of such requests as this would waste valuable court time and delay a purely administrative task. Any appeal against the fine officer's decision or any reference back to the court, or any subsequent request for variation, will be heard by the court, which will have before it any information the offender has provided at the request of the fines officer.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para27"></a>Furthermore, there is nothing in Schedule 2 to prevent the court at any time requesting that the fines officer report back to it on a specific case should this be deemed necessary. The fines officer's powers are clearly circumscribed by the terms of the collection order made by the court, but if the court feels that a specific case should be handled by the court and not submitted to the fines collection scheme, the court can reserve the case by not making a collection order at point of sentence. That gives into the court's hands the discretion to indicate which cases it thinks may need its careful oversight and which cases may appear to be routine and have no specific evident difficulties at the time of sentencing, and allows flexibility for the fines officer, and/or the offender who finds himself in disagreement about the instalment rate of repayment, to come back to the court for it to exercise its judicial function and to determine any dispute which may arise between the parties.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para28"></a>As to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, research has shown that involving court staff to a greater extent in chasing up fine defaulters produces results. As I said, the Public Accounts Select Committee has also recommended that more should be delegated to administrative staff, and that would appear to make sense. The enforcement of court orders is primarily an administrative process. As the noble Baroness will know from her experience, the majority of cases can be dealt with in that way.
<P>

<a name="30210-17_para29"></a>But there are cases where circumstances change and unforeseen things happen, and what seemed reasonable in regard to repayment at the time of the court sentence becomes less reasonable as a result of those changes. But, to reassure the noble Lord, the <P>

<a name="30210-18_para4"></a> The Government's drafting permits the order to be made against the car of the registered keeper, who may not be the same person as the car's owner, and it could be unduly harsh on the car's owner to find the vehicle clamped because of the default of someone else. Let us take, for example, the situation where a marriage breaks up and the car is owned by the wife. She could go off with the car and then find it clamped because her husband, who is the registered keeper, is in default of fines that have nothing to do with her. What would be fair or right about that?
<P>

<a name="30210-18_para5"></a>My noble friend Lady Anelay asked about this at Second Reading but did not receive an answer on that occasion or in the letter sent to Peers by the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, during the Christmas Recess. I have tabled the amendment to give the Government an opportunity to explain why they are intent upon proceeding against the registered keeper. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   At Second Reading I suggested that as there was no necessary correlation between the keeper and the owner it would be relatively easy for a defaulter to remove his name as the car's registered keeper. The amendment is far more difficult to justify than the Government's original suggestion. I have no figures, but I venture to doubt whether more than 50 per cent of cars are owned by the people who believe they own them. Most cars are bought on hire purchase; that being so, such people are not the owners until the end of the hire purchase agreement.
<P>

<a name="30210-18_para6"></a>I was thinking of that horrible possibility while I was sitting here&#151;one of the advantages of being on the Cross-Benches and not moving amendments is that you can think&#151;and it occurred to me whether there is a case for providing in the Bill that where a defaulter has a driving licence his licence should be suspended pending payment of the fine. Where there is a family car, the children still could be taken to school and, if the wife has to drive because the husband is the defaulter, I am sure that she would join with the fines officer in trying to get the fine paid.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-18_para7"></a>I merely make the suggestion. There may be something in it because, if there are problems about the keeper, there are much greater problems about the owner.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, that there are greater problems with the amendment than with the Government's position. I respectfully adopt all the arguments that he makes about the flaws in regard to ownership.
<P>

<a name="30210-18_para8"></a>Checking vehicle registration with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority is the only means of independently establishing a link between the defaulter and the vehicle. I do not, however, suggest that that is in itself without difficulties; I acknowledge that there are the drawbacks alluded to by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, when he made his intervention at Second Reading.
<P>

<a name="30210-18_para9"></a> I would answer the point in part by pointing out that the fines collection scheme provides that a "further steps" notice will be sent to a defaulter who fails to co-operate with the court, signalling the intention to make a clamping order. The offender has 10 days in which to contact the fines officer. I believe that it is unlikely that that 10 day period will give the defaulter sufficient time to register the vehicle in another person's name.
<P>

<a name="30210-18_para10"></a>Taking the example of the noble Baroness about what may happen to the poor wife who is subject to this process, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, is right to say that it would give her an opportunity to join forces with the fines officer to ensure that proper weight is given to who should be paying the fine and the proper course to be taken.
<P>

<a name="30210-18_para11"></a>I should also point out that even if a determined defaulter manages to re-register the vehicle or takes other steps to avoid the clamping order, the fines collection scheme provides the fines officer with a number of alternative enforcement methods including ordering deductions from earnings or benefits, distraining against the defaulter's goods, and registration of the debt. The defaulter who re-registers or hides his vehicle will therefore have been put to considerable inconvenience to no purpose. As the fines officers will be persistent in chasing payment, we expect that the majority of defaulters will eventually be persuaded to take the line of least resistance and pay what they owe.
<P>

<a name="30210-18_para12"></a>Finally, as I have said already in relation to other amendments, the pilot schemes will reveal whether or not the clamping provision will cause significant problems. Speaking entirely for myself, I find terribly attractive the suggestion of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, in regard to the removal of licence. I do not know whether other noble Lords share my initial response, but it is certainly something that we should think about.
<P>

<a name="30210-18_para13"></a>Clause 31 contains powers to enable the fines collection scheme to be modified in the light of the experience of the pilots. That should be borne in mind. <P>


<a name="column_524"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 524</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>As I stated earlier, should any element of the scheme fail to operate as intended, we shall take the opportunity to make any necessary amendments.
<P>

<a name="30210-18_para14"></a>The Criminal Justice Bill re-enacts Sections 35 and 40 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and will cater for driving licence suspension as an alternative sentence on default on a fine. So there is scope for some creative thinking similar to that which the noble and learned Lord on the Cross Benches has managed to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I, too, find the idea advanced by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson of Lymington, attractive. I can see one problem; namely, if the non-payer of the fine were employed as a bus driver or HGV driver, it might be disproportionate in terms of punishment to impose an order that would mean that the person was unable to carry out that job. So the power would have to be discretionary; and any discretionary power of that kind would have to be decided by the court and not by a fines officer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-18_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I underline that the whole purpose of providing the flexibility of the different methods of enforcement is that an appropriate means of enforcement can be tailored to the particular person who appears before the court. Certain strategies will be more effective with one offender than with another. One has found in many circumstances that being able to drive and having a car is seen by some offenders as more valuable than anything else.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-18_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   The debate has highlighted the Government's problem and the fact that we all have more thinking to do before we return to this matter on Report. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30210-18_para17"></a>On Question, Whether Schedule 2 shall be agreed to?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-18_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   Earlier today, the Minister stressed the importance of fines and in particular their enforcement. As this schedule deals with the collection of fines, I should like to raise with her an issue that is causing considerable concern; namely, the non-payment of fines&#151;often very substantial fines&#151;when they have been levied on companies under the Health and Safety at Work Act etc. 1974 and under subsequent legislation.
<P>

<a name="30210-18_para18"></a>The All-Party Group on Occupational Safety and Health, of which I have the honour to be president, has on a number of occasions raised with the noble Baroness's ministerial colleagues the fact that a number of substantial fines levied on companies situated overseas have not been paid and few steps have been taken to enforce the fines. I have in mind not only the substantial fines levied in the aftermath of the Heathrow tunnel collapse, but also those following a number of similar substantial accidents. There is a <P>


<a name="column_525"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 525</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>feeling that often it is too much trouble and too difficult to levy the fines on the companies when, although they have offices in the UK, the main course of business is being pursued elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="30210-18_para19"></a>I do not want the occasion to pass without reminding the Minister of this serious concern. It may be helpful to return to this issue on Report to see whether there is a need for further legislation to make enforcement easier, either within a Bill of this nature or within the European Union. I am aware of several companies within the EU and just outside it where fines are still outstanding. Will the Minister please consider writing to me and to other Members of the Committee setting out the position. Where fines of over half a million pounds have been levied&#151;perhaps over the past few years&#151;but remain unpaid, could they be identified? It would be helpful to have that information so as to be able to consider whether any further steps need to be taken.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-18_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I shall be more than happy to write to Members of the Committee. I am not sure whether we have the data or whether it can be collected without disproportionate cost, but I shall make inquiries. One of the issues that we have been examining through the enforcement review is how to make the enforcement of fines of a consistently high quality. The whole point of debating these provisions is to make sure that the efficiency and value of enforcement of this nature tells on those against whom the courts have levied fines. I hope that the noble Lord will see that all these provisions have been brought forward in order to make the system better. I shall write to the noble Lord with pleasure if I have any useful information pertaining directly to the issues raised.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030210/text/30210-19.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart </B>   moved Amendment No. 70:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 18, line 4, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-19_para0"></a><P>

<a name="30210-19_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment takes us away from fines officers and deals with an entirely different subject. Clause 36(1) provides that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A lay justice who is a member of a local authority may not act as a member of the Crown Court or a magistrates' court in proceedings brought by or against, or by way of an appeal from a decision of . . . that local authority . . . a committee or officer of that local authority";
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-19_para2"></a>and there is a third category that I need not go into. Frankly, that seems to be a statement of the obvious.
<P>

<a name="30210-19_para3"></a>Subsection (2) goes on to apply the same principle to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A lay justice who is a member of the Common Council of the City of London",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-19_para4"></a>and subsection (5) provides that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "No act is invalidated merely because of the disqualification under this section of the person by whom it is done".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-19_para5"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to remove subsection (5). It seems to me that there can be no doubt in the mind of a justice of the peace who is a <P>


<a name="column_526"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 526</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>councillor as to whether he is disqualified or not. It must be perfectly obvious whether there is a party to whose case he should not listen.
<P>

<a name="30210-19_para6"></a>It seems to me that if a justice of the peace who is disqualified sits, the tribunal effectively cannot be impartial for the purposes of Article 6 of the Human Rights Convention. If this House took a decision in the Pinochet case to set aside a decision because a member of the Appellate Committee sat when he had failed to disclose an interest, the same principle should apply to the magistrates' court and someone who plainly has an interest should be disqualified from sitting. If a justice of the peace sits when he or she is expressly disqualified under the clause, the hearing should be treated as a nullity. Validation under subsection (5) is unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="30210-19_para7"></a>The issue was originally raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, in its first report of the Session. In the fourth report, which was published today and to which I referred earlier in another context, the committee accepted that there was no issue under Article 6.1. Paragraph 28 of the report said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In his reply, the Lord Chancellor explained that in the Government's view the word 'merely' would have the effect of still allowing an adjudication to be quashed when required by ECHR Article 6.1 or the common law rule against bias, while avoiding invalidity where the sitting of the disqualified JP was not incompatible with any other rule of law. The Government's response adequately answers our concern, and in our view means that the provision in clause 36 of the Courts Bill would not give rise to any significant risk of incompatibility with Article 6.1".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-19_para8"></a>It says in subsection (5) that no act is invalidated,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"merely because of the disqualification under this section of the person by whom it is done".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-19_para9"></a><P>

<a name="30210-19_para10"></a>I am reluctant to disagree with the Joint Committee on Human Rights on an issue of this kind, but in this case it has allowed itself to be too easily persuaded. It is extremely difficult to see how a tribunal containing a JP who has been disqualified under Clause 36(1) could ever be independent and impartial. The Lord Chancellor's letter, which is published as an annex to the committee's report, suggests that participation of a disqualified JP in an interlocutory hearing would not violate the convention, but that would surely depend on the nature of the decision that was taken at the interlocutory hearing. It could well contravene Article 6.
<P>

<a name="30210-19_para11"></a>Subsection (5) would require a party complaining about the presence of a councillor on the tribunal to bring new proceedings, which might have to investigate the circumstances of the decision in the original proceedings to discover whether the tribunal was independent and impartial. That would be complicated, expensive and difficult. How could the court, for example, investigate whether other members of the bench in the original case had been influenced by the disqualified member? It would be much simpler and fairer for all concerned to say that proceedings in which a JP sits, when he or she is disqualified under Clause 36, are a nullity.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-19_para12"></a>I hope that the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Government will reconsider the issue and conclude that subsection (5) is not appropriate to be included in the clause. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I warmly support the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in moving the amendment. One might refer to the fallacy that the amendment presents without any reference to the human rights factor that he zealously mentioned. Subsections (1) and (2) of the clause say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A lay justice . . . may not act as"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-19_para13"></a>and the reasons are given. In subsection (5), we find that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "No act is invalidated merely because of the disqualification under this section of the person by whom it is done".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-19_para14"></a><P>

<a name="30210-19_para15"></a>Therefore, subsection (5) is inconsistent with subsections (1) and (2). If it remains, we should have enacted a contradiction, which is something that one should never do. Indeed, to go a little further and borrow the phrase used by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, we would be enacting a nullity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   I support the amendment, but I have at the back of my mind a difficulty. In the rule of public law, decisions by officers who prima facie have authority to act stand until set aside. That is a valuable provision in many circumstances. I support the amendment and hope that the Government may give some thought to how they might provide that the disqualification produces an avoidable situation rather than a complete nullity.
<P>

<a name="30210-19_para16"></a>I want to change the situation. I should have looked into the following matter, but this will save me writing a letter. Will the Minister or her staff look into the question of what is meant by the court of the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Common Council of the City of London"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-19_para17"></a>I have had some connections with the court of Common Council. I knew of a lady who was elected to it as a "common councilman". That has some relevance to a later amendment. I understood that when she went to the court of aldermen, she left the court of Common Council. However, there may be some statutory provision that says that the court of Common Council for some purposes includes the court of aldermen. It must be remembered that all members of the court of aldermen are lay magistrates.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I, too, am troubled by subsection (5), which appears to be in stark contradiction to what is said before. I am sure that my noble and learned friend can draw a distinction, but I am not wise enough to see what that is at this stage.
<P>

<a name="30210-19_para18"></a>The point made by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, is profound. There is nothing here that should divide us politically, as it is purely a drafting matter. On the face of it, does not subsection (5) contradict everything said in subsections (1) and (2)?
<P>


<a name="column_528"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-19_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I shall not spoil the proceedings. I, too, support the amendment for lay reasons rather than those adduced by the lawyers who took part in the debate.
<P>

<a name="30210-19_para19"></a>We are talking about disqualification of lay justices who are members of local authorities. I make the obvious point that the Explanatory Notes state:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This clause makes the same provision as section 66 of the JPA 1997: which provides for the disqualification of magistrates who are members of local authorities from acting in cases involving the relevant local authority".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-19_para20"></a>
Is it already the case that if a magistrate acts in such cases, even though disqualified, the decision taken stands? Is it a case of repeating the current position? If that is the case, how many times has it been discovered that the rules have been broken? I am rather puzzled that no one would have noticed that situation. The court officials who make up sittings rosters would surely know who the members of local authorities were and would not roster those people to sit when a case involved those local authorities.
<P>

<a name="30210-19_para21"></a>Like other speakers, I accept that the aim is to try to avoid bad practice in these cases. A decision that is taken in a local authority case by someone who is a member of the relevant local authority may not necessarily be a bad decision, but no one knows that as no one knows the grounds on which it was taken. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, mentioned that matter. Therefore, such a decision would not earn the respect and trust of the public.
<P>

<a name="30210-19_para22"></a>I deployed a similar argument when we discussed a similar provision during the passage of the Ofcom Bill which concerned the way in which Ofcom boards operated. I lost the argument on that occasion. I hope that given the arguments deployed by lawyers such as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, we shall achieve the right result today. As my noble friend Lord Renton said, subsections (1) and (5) appear to be in conflict. I assume that subsection (1) tells us what we should not do and subsection (5) tackles the actions of those of us who are bad enough to do what we should not do. I revert to the nub of the matter; namely, that a decision regarding a local authority that is taken by someone who is a member of that local authority should not stand as it would not earn the respect of the people who use the justice system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Before the Minister replies, I hope that I may point out that the Explanatory Notes contain a very short description of this fairly long clause which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This clause makes the same provision as section 66 of the JPA 1997: which provides for the disqualification of magistrates who are members of local authorities from acting in cases involving the relevant local authority".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-19_para23"></a>However, subsection (5) of Clause 36 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No act is invalidated . . . because of the disqualification under this section of the person by whom it is done"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-19_para24"></a>We are in an absurd position.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I understand the anxiety expressed by Members of the Committee in relation to the issue we are discussing. However, I say <P>


<a name="column_529"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 529</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>straight away that I agree with the committee that has not been prevailed upon to reach the view that the provision is appropriately phrased but has reached that view because it is right so to do. I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, does not agree with the committee's conclusions but I respectfully say that the Government do. I shall explain why.
<P>

<a name="30210-20_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, rightly raised the issue as a matter of concern. I hope that I shall be able further to explain the matter. As Members of the Committee are aware, the phrase in question is a re-enactment of Section 66(6) of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997 and is a standard inclusion in disqualification clauses. The motive behind the amendment is a fear that the inclusion could be incompatible with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights which gives the right to an impartial tribunal. There may be a misunderstanding here of the effect of the phrase and the interaction between the statutes. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, the Joint Committee on Human Rights raised a similar point and we offered it reassurances which I am happy to repeat now.
<P>

<a name="30210-20_para1"></a>We respectfully suggest that the phrase should remain part of the Bill. The use of the word "merely" in the clause is crucial. If a local authority justice were to adjudicate where Article 6 of the Human Rights Act is engaged and in circumstances where that article is violated by his doing so, that would be unlawful by reason of Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. But where he or she acts in circumstances that do not engage the article, or where the participation does not violate it&#151;for example, at an interlocutory hearing&#151;the subsection provides that this action will not be invalidated merely because of the disqualification. If no violation or engagement of Section 6 occurs when a lay magistrate takes certain judicial decisions proceedings, those decisions should stand. It will always be open to a party to appeal if it is felt that Article 6 bites in any instance. But where no prejudice is caused by the magistrate's interest, it is unreasonable, burdensome and an unsound principle to invalidate judicial decisions.
<P>

<a name="30210-20_para2"></a>Clause 36(5) does not, therefore, override the requirements of impartiality imposed by Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights or by English common law&#151;I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Renton, expressed anxiety in that regard&#151;nor does it purport to do so. We are satisfied that it could not be interpreted in that manner. I hope that I have better explained why we say that there is no contradiction as between subsections (1) and (2) and subsection (5).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-20_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. Before she leaves that subject, I wish to ask a question which may have a completely obvious answer. If that is the case, I apologise in advance. The noble Baroness seeks to reassure the Committee by explaining carefully that there is a get-out provision here; that is, a process of appeal if partiality has been involved. However, decisions taken by magistrates are taken in private in <P>


<a name="column_530"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 530</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a retiring room. How do the Government anticipate that an aggrieved person will be able to produce evidence that partiality has been shown?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-20_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   It would depend on the person making the challenge. The noble Baroness will know that there may be cases where none of those participating is immediately aware that a magistrate has an interest in the case. However, everyone is content with the proceedings and there is no reason to seek to overturn the relevant decision. If, however, a party becomes concerned that a magistrate should have been disqualified, the provision we are discussing provides an avenue through which the decision is voidable but it is not void from the beginning. The provision enables the matter to be brought to the attention of the court. The court can determine whether there has been impropriety and can strike down a decision. However, there would have to be a reason for striking down a decision, not merely because technically an infringement had occurred. I must stress the importance of the word "merely" in this regard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I am persuaded by my noble friend's argument but I am not persuaded that we cannot improve on the wording of the provision. There is nothing between us. Will my noble friend take the measure away and reconsider it? That is all we ask. I shall not vote against the Government; I love the Government. I ask my noble friend to reconsider the matter. It is an important matter. There should be no room for doubt.

Members of the Committee will know that it is important that lay justices be British. That is the condition that we have at the moment. Decisions made by magistrates found to be disqualified by reasons of nationality before that discovery should stand unless the disqualification has prejudiced a party.
<P>

<a name="30210-20_para5"></a>A number of lay magistrates found themselves in that difficulty. They had lived here for many years and assumed they were entitled to be magistrates. No one for a second cast any aspersion on the nature of their <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>judgment, but they were in due course found to have been disqualified. That is a parallel position, and there is no problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-20_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   As I read subsection (5), it is a "disqualification under this section", not in the circumstances that the Minister outlined. That is why a number of us strongly support the words of the noble Lords, Lord Renton and Lord Clinton-Davis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-20_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I gave a parallel example of a disqualification that does not impinge on the quality of the decision. I simply sought to assist the Committee to understand why having a disqualification may not impinge on the decision.
<P>

<a name="30210-20_para6"></a>I understand the points made by Members of the Committee. We are content both with how the clause is phrased and that we have the support of the Committee in relation to the matter. However, nothing is lost by looking and checking to make sure that the drafting is as good as it can be, so I will happily do that. At the moment, my limited ingenuity does not let me envisage how it can be improved, but I am very fallible, and I am sure that others can do far better.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-20_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am grateful to have had support for the amendment from both sides of the Committee. I am particularly grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson of Lymington, for pointing out what was not an error in the amendment but in how I presented it.
<P>

<a name="30210-20_para7"></a>I accept that a decision taken by a disqualified justice of the peace or a tribunal that includes one should not be regarded as a nullity but as a decision that is voidable. That is in accordance with the common law principle that a decision taken by a judicial body that appears to be properly constituted is treated as valid unless and until it is challenged. However, that does not remove in any way the need for the amendment. The vice of subsection (5) would be to prevent people being able to set aside decisions taken by a disqualified magistrate or a tribunal that includes one.
<P>

<a name="30210-20_para8"></a>The Minister referred to the fact, which is of course true, that the provision repeats a subsection in the Justices of the Peace Act 1997. That is not an adequate reason to retain a similar provision in the Bill. It was wrongly conceived to start with. Let us suppose that someone had been disqualified expressly by a provision in a Bill in circumstances in which, if they were not disqualified, there would be reason to believe that they might be an interested party. In those circumstances, it is plainly right that the decision should be capable of being set aside, whether or not it infringes the Human Rights Act. The case for not including subsection (5) is made much stronger by the passage of that Act. A very large proportion of the cases in which a disqualified magistrate has sat could be set aside anyway, because of a conflict with that Act.
<P>

<P>

<a name="30210-20_para9"></a>That being the case it seems in everyone's interests if, instead of having to show that in an individual case there was some reason to believe that the tribunal was impartial, we simply recognised the fact that if a decision was taken by a tribunal that included a JP who was disqualified, it should be capable of being set aside on that ground without anyone having to undertake any further investigations.
<P>

<a name="30210-20_para10"></a>The Minister raised a point about the validation of decisions taken by a magistrate who turned out to be disqualified because of being a foreign citizen. That matter is entirely different, and is dealt with by Clause 37. We have not tabled an amendment to that clause, because we recognise that there will be no or very few cases where the disqualification would render the tribunal anything other than independent and impartial. The technicality is purely to do with the way in which the JP was appointed. It is perfectly possible that, in every such case, the tribunal would not only be but be seen to be independent and impartial, notwithstanding a technical defect in the method of appointment. The two cases are miles apart.
<P>

<a name="30210-20_para11"></a>The amendment is important, and I have every intention of bringing it back on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My view is that the chances of that are extremely remote. Although not impossible, they are so unusual that it is clearly in the public interest simply not to require applicants to set aside cases to prove an apparent lack of independence and impartiality. By far the simplest, cheapest and best course is to say that all cases that fall into the category&#151;frankly, there will not be many&#151;will be set aside if challenged.

<P>

"( ) A party to the case may appeal to the Crown Court against a ruling made under this section."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30210-21_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: We move into the third part of the Bill dealing with criminal jurisdiction and procedure in the magistrates' courts. Clause 40, upon which Schedule 3 depends, relates to rulings at pre-trial hearings in magistrates' courts.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para9"></a> I am not over-enamoured with pre-trial hearings as they presently exist in the Crown Court. There are two types: the preparatory hearing in which the decision of the judge stands but may be appealed to the Court of Appeal; and the pre-trial hearing in which the judge makes a ruling that he may alter in the course of the hearing on a further application being made or by reason of his own volition.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para10"></a>I find that there is a great waste of time, effort and expense in such pre-trial hearings. Last year I had a case for which there was a preparatory hearing: a judge ruled a video admissible; the case went to the Court of Appeal where it was considered at length; it went back for the trial with the video admitted and the defendant was acquitted. The trip to the Court of Appeal and the day spent in the preparatory hearing were a waste of time.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para11"></a>On Tuesday last week there was a pre-trial hearing in which an application was made by the Crown to strike out the defence as though it were a civil case. Of course, the judge had to make findings of fact that he could not make because there was no evidence before him, so there was a completely useless hearing on that.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para12"></a>I turn to the schedule and consider it in the light of those experiences. It extends pre-trial hearings to the magistrates' court. I believe that such a hearing is justifiable only when there are questions as to the admissibility of evidence. In a magistrates' court there has always been the problem that the justices can look at a piece of evidence, rule it inadmissible and then they hear the case, having to forget everything that they have heard in relation to the evidence that has been ruled inadmissible.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para13"></a>There is a case for one set of magistrates to rule on admissibility providing&#151;as Amendment No. 72 mentions&#151;another set of magistrates hears the case. Any other question of law relating to the case is to be the subject of a pre-trial hearing. The Government <P>


<a name="column_534"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 534</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should consider that carefully. Any question of law may be brought before the magistrates at a pre-trial hearing. In the ordinary course of events they continue to hear the case; it is summary trial. If in the course of the case on a question of law they make a ruling that is inopportune or wrong, that can be appealed by way of case stated to the Divisional Court. If the defendant is acquitted the matter does not arise.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para14"></a>It appears to me that the Bill introduces into the system an unnecessary additional burden, that any other question of law can be part of the pre-trial hearing. If that is the case, before the main trial starts it is right that there should be an opportunity to appeal that original decision. Then we are back where we were in the case in which I was involved last year: one wastes time in a pre-trial hearing, one goes to the Court of Appeal and the person is acquitted in the end anyway in what is supposed to be a summary process.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para15"></a>I disagree with those who support Amendment No. 71A in that a ruling at a pre-trial hearing should be taken on a case stated to the Divisional Court. That is hugely expensive, a waste of time for the Divisional Court and it seems to me that if we are to adopt a procedure whereby any point of law can be the subject matter of a pre-trial hearing, and there is to be an appeal, it should go straight to the Crown Court to be dealt with. That would be much more sensible. That is why we put forward Amendment No. 71.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para16"></a>I must make it clear that I believe that the Government should consider carefully whether it is worth while bringing in to the magistrates' court hearing all the paraphernalia that has existed in the Crown Court and that has not, in my view, operated particularly successfully. It appears to be a good idea&#151;let us clear everything out of the way so that when we come to trial it will not take long&#151;but in summary procedures it is just an additional hearing. As a member of the Bar, I should not complain about that as the more satellite litigation that is passed by Parliament the better, and the more we earn. But in the interests of the public, such pre-trial hearings should not be extended on any matter of law. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-21_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   In speaking to Amendment No. 71, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, I shall speak also to amendments in the names of my noble friends, Amendments Nos. 71A and 72.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para17"></a>I listened carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said. He has experience at the coal-face of criminal law. He has been through the mill in relation to pre-trial hearings. He is not too enamoured of them and he has given his reasons. In the light of that he is right to table his amendment.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para18"></a>I have problems with Amendment No. 71. It is novel. It creates the right of appeal on matters of fact and matters of law to the Crown Court prior to conviction. My questions to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, which I would be grateful if he would address once the Minister has spoken, are as follows: does he expect that the judge would sit alone or with justices and would there be an appeal to the <P>


<a name="column_535"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 535</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Divisional Court thereafter? I wonder how it will work. I quarrel not with the right of appeal but with whether it should be to the Crown Court. That would not be consistent with the rest of the current legal process where the Crown Court has jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the magistrates' court only where there has been a conviction.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para19"></a>My Amendment No. 71A is a probing amendment to provide an alternative route to that proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas. It proposes that a more appropriate route would be to the Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division. I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, said about that being expensive and a waste of time; it depends what one considers to be a waste of time considering the result of a case.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para20"></a>Surely at the preliminary hearing in a magistrates' court the matters at issue will be matters of law, not fact. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, referred to inadmissibility of evidence. If there are contested matters of fact I could understand why the Crown Court might be seen as the more appropriate tribunal to hear the appeal.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para21"></a>If an appeal is to be taken from the decision of a magistrates' court on the admissibility of evidence, surely it will happen before any decision is taken as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. Since there is not yet a decision on the facts&#151;unless we are talking about an attempt to exclude evidence on a voir dire&#151;there are problems with Amendment No. 71. Since the decision will be on matters of law, it would be more appropriate for the appeal to go to the Divisional Court, which is the more usual court to hear an appeal on a matter of law from a magistrates' court or the Crown Court when exercising its appellate jurisdiction in relation to the decision of a magistrates' court.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para22"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, referred to Amendment No. 72. I tabled it to deal with admissibility of evidence, but we have got to the core of that matter so I shall not repeat what he said. But I have a worry that where the magistrates who sit in judgment on a defendant when the case is heard have knowledge of evidence that would not be admitted at the trial itself and that may be prejudicial to the defendant, it would be difficult for them to set aside their memory of that evidence.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para23"></a> The Minister might say that at a trial hearing the same magistrates would not be empanelled to sit on the Bench as had been empanelled to hear an application at a pre-trial hearing. If we had a 100 per cent guarantee of that, the problems we are talking about would not arise. It may be good practice in magistrates' courts administration that the same panel of magistrates would not be empanelled, but there is no guarantee of that.
<P>

<a name="30210-21_para24"></a>That problem does not arise with pre-trial hearings in the Crown Court because the judge who hears the application is not both the jury and the dispenser of sentence in the court. The Bill has raised a novel problem; the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, <P>


<a name="column_536"></a>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Schedule 3 sets out the provision for making pre-trial rulings in the magistrates' court, bringing the new legislation in line with current Crown Court practice. Under Schedule 3 a pre-trial ruling can be made by judges and magistrates at pre-trial hearings in criminal cases that are to be tried summarily in the magistrates' court and will extend to issues of substantive law and admissibility of evidence.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para0"></a> Schedule 3 creates a new power in the magistrates' court aligned to that in the Crown Court to make binding rulings as to questions of law and admissibility at pre-trial hearings. Amendment No. 71 would introduce a right of appeal, as has been carefully explained.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para1"></a>At present, matters of law and evidence are considered during the course of a trial. Procedurally this is a grey area as the lay justices or district judge in a magistrates' court charged with ruling on matters such as the admissibility of evidence must also subsequently determine the guilt or innocence of a defendant and are finders of both fact and law. The impact of the ruling can lead to a trial being adjourned or aborted.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para2"></a>The intention of the schedule is to allow for issues of law and evidence to be identified at an early stage and resolved in advance of the trial. It is an important new power when considered in the light of the new integrated structure of the criminal courts to be created by the Bill and the flexible deployment of the judiciary we are seeking within the new structure.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para3"></a>If the overall sentencing jurisdiction of the magistrates' court is extended as provided for in the Criminal Justice Bill, more serious and potentially complex cases will be retained for summary trial. The power to make binding rulings will be a useful aid to pre-trial preparation and progression.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para4"></a>The Government recognise the importance of ensuring fairness in court proceedings&#151;that goes without saying. That is reflected in the safeguards contained within Schedule 3, which provide for a ruling to be varied or discharged in certain circumstances. There exist also wider avenues of appeal available at the conclusion of proceedings in the magistrates' court, particularly an appeal to the Crown Court against conviction which takes the form of a rehearing of the whole case, as I am sure the Committee will appreciate.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para5"></a>Amendment No. 71A would permit any party to a criminal case to make an interlocutory appeal to the High Court against the making of a binding ruling, such procedure currently being available only at the conclusion of the substantive proceedings.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para6"></a>As with Amendment No. 71, lay justices or district judges charged with ruling on matters such as the admissibility of evidence must subsequently determine <P>


<a name="column_537"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 537</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the guilt or innocence of a defendant and again are finders of both fact and law. The impact of the ruling can lead to the trail being adjourned or aborted.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para7"></a> Amendment No. 72 proposes a further subsection to new Section 8A, the effect of which would be to require rules of court that may provide for a differently constituted magistrates' court from that which made a binding ruling at a pre-trial hearing to hear the subsequent trial.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para8"></a>At present, a Bench that makes a substantive ruling on an issue of law or admissibility of evidence at the outset of the trial may be required by the rules of natural justice to disqualify itself from hearing the trial. Invariably, this will result in an adjournment with associated inconvenience to all parties involved. The new provisions will allow a different constitution to make such rulings at an earlier stage, meaning that witnesses will not be required to attend court unnecessarily. We argue that the amendment is unnecessary because the common law rules of natural justice would require individual magistrates acting as the tribunal of both fact and law who have heard evidence which they subsequently ruled inadmissible to disqualify themselves from hearing the trial.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para9"></a>The fact that a pre-trial hearing is separate from and does not constitute the start of a summary trial is made clear in the schedule. It is implicit that magistrates' courts, constituted differently or the same, can deal with the separate hearings, providing for the necessary flexibility in each case to be considered individually. Additional rules of court are not needed in these circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para10"></a>Our position is simple. There should be no appeal until the case is ended. I am not clear, and I am not sure that Members opposite are clear, what would be a suitable alternative and how it might work. I rest my case on that point.

<P>
<A NAME="30210-22_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, I expect, begs leave to withdraw his amendment, it may be helpful to make clear that my Amendment No. 72 answers the question posed by the Minister. If one could be sure that the same panel of magistrates did not sit to determine a person's guilt or innocence as sat for the pre-trial hearing, we might be happier. I am grateful to the noble Lord for the attention that he has paid to these issues. Certainly, I shall be looking very carefully at our amendments before we consider bringing them back on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   First, there is no justification for introducing pre-trial hearings into magistrates' court proceedings simply because it happens in the Crown Court. The mode of trial and the division of responsibility is so very different that it is quite impossible to marry the two things together just to tidy up the procedures.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para11"></a>There is a case for magistrates having a pre-trial hearing for admissibility of evidence. I can see that. It would be easy to arrange for a second and different <P>


<a name="column_538"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 538</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tribunal of magistrates to hear the merits of the case when it is finally heard. It is not entirely straightforward; there are some difficulties. Evidence may be called in front of one set of magistrates. There is no transcript of that, so it could be quite different in the main trial. There are problems.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para12"></a>As to other points of law, often it is necessary to establish a factual basis before a point of law can be considered. The Court of Appeal and the Divisional Court do not like dealing with hypothetical situations; they like to deal with facts. Accordingly, any broad question of law may require all the evidence being heard by the tribunal in the first magistrates' court in order to decide the point. However, establishing that factual nexus wastes time. The witnesses must return for the full trial. They will be troubled twice instead of once. Any discrepancies between what they say at the first hearing will be highlighted at the second, in what is supposed to be a summary procedure.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para13"></a> Therefore, I suggest that the Government think very carefully about the matter. Magistrates' courts could hear matters regarding the admissibility of evidence and the voir dire but nothing beyond that. Their proceedings should be kept as a summary trial. With the hope that the Government will rethink the matter, I withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30210-22_para24"></a>At the outset I want to make clear to the House that the Official Opposition does not oppose this order which extends for a further year the decommissioning regime and the amnesty period as set out in both the 1997 and 2002 Acts. We recognise that the amnesty is, in many respects, a necessary evil if we are ever going to achieve what the Belfast agreement describes as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the complete disarmament of all paramilitary organisations".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-22_para25"></a><P>

<a name="30210-22_para26"></a>Our concern, which we expressed forcefully when the issue was debated in your Lordships' House last year, stems from the provision in the 2002 Act extending the amnesty period for a further five years&#151;effectively providing for a decommissioning amnesty taking us up to 2007. We believe&#151;and our argument remains valid&#151;that that sent out precisely the wrong signal to the paramilitaries at exactly the time when the maximum pressure should have been exerted upon them at long last to fulfil their obligations.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para27"></a>It formed part of a series of unwarranted and one-sided concessions, principally to Sinn Fein/IRA that has regrettably and damagingly been the trademark of government policy for much of the past 12 months. So I wish to place on record again that our preference would have been for a two or three year extension, rather than the full five years, and that we hope that we will not have to wait until 2007 for decommissioning to happen.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para28"></a>The order gives us the opportunity to step back for a moment and consider where we are in Northern Ireland on the issue of arms decommissioning and what has now entered the Northern Ireland lexicon as "acts of completion". It is not an encouraging picture. Over the past year there has been one act of decommissioning by the provisional IRA, carried out in April and verified by the de Chastelain commission. That built on the earlier act in October 2001.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para29"></a>On the loyalist side, nothing has been decommissioned and the prospect of any movement there seems to be further away than ever. Not only that, the IRA broke off all contact with the decommissioning commission last October in response to the suspension of the institutions. Billy Hutchinson, representing the UVF, followed suit on 17th January this year. In addition to the failure to complete <P>


<a name="column_540"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 540</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>decommissioning, or even to signal the start of a process, there have been serial breaches of the ceasefire and the Belfast agreement by all the main paramilitary organisations.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para30"></a>We have had the IRA's adventures with narco-terrorists in the Colombian jungle. We have had the Castlereagh break-in. There has been evidence of targeting individuals and installations. There have been continual beatings, shootings and some cases of murder carried out by both loyalists and republicans. There was the orchestrated street violence&#151;again on both sides&#151;during the summer. And finally, last October, we had the evidence of the Stormontgate spy ring at the heart of government. That is not a very happy picture.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para31"></a>On the loyalist side we have also had the revolting feud between the various factions in the Ulster Defence Association in and around Belfast's Shankill Road. Obviously we all hope that the events of the past week, distasteful as they might have been, will at last bring that particular episode to a close. There obviously needs to be the closest co-operation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Strathclyde police to ensure that the feud does not simply extend to Scotland. God help us all if it does.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para32"></a>What this episode shows, however, is the nature of much loyalist violence today. It is no longer political. As The Times so accurately put it on Friday, 7th February 2003:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "It is not about devotion to Crown and country. This is gangsterism in its purest sense&#151;an entirely amoral contest for control over drugs, prostitution and protection money. It is rampant criminality occasionally wrapped in a Union Flag of convenience. It is also, unfortunately, now the dominant local industry".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-22_para33"></a><P>

<a name="30210-22_para34"></a>Those thugs terrorise the communities they purport to defend, inflicting misery and suffering in areas that already suffer some of the worst unemployment and social deprivation in Northern Ireland. So we welcome the arrests that have been made in loyalist areas and the chief constable's publicly stated determination to crack down on violence. I am sure that he has the full support of all noble Lords in achieving that objective.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para35"></a>Regrettably, all of this presents a picture far removed from the one envisaged in the agreement. It is the failure of certain parties to make the unambiguous transition from terror to what the agreement describes as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"exclusively peaceful and democratic means"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-22_para36"></a>
that caused the institutions at Stormont to be suspended and has so undermined confidence.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para37"></a>As we have said on many occasions, we hope the suspension lasts for as short a period as possible. Devolution and the exercise of local power and authority by locally elected and accountable politicians is a far better form of government for Northern Ireland than direct rule will ever be. But those responsible for the current state of affairs should be in no doubt that the obligation rests with them to re-create the conditions in which devolution can be restored and for momentum to be injected back into the political process.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para38"></a>Crucially, that means dealing once and for all with the issue of illegal weapons and explosives in a manner, as the IRA itself put it in its statement of 6th May 2000,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"designed to maximise public confidence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-22_para39"></a><P>

<a name="30210-22_para40"></a>The time has passed when we could take the paramilitaries on trust. What matters now is not what they say, but what they do. There has to be a complete end to all forms of paramilitary activity. There has to be decommissioning. And there has to be clear evidence that the organisations are being stood down.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para41"></a>That is clearly what the Prime Minister had in mind when during the referendum campaign he said on 14th May 1998 that there had to be the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"progressive abandonment and dismantling of all paramilitary structures".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-22_para42"></a><P>

<a name="30210-22_para43"></a>It is clearly what he had in mind last July when he told the other place that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it is increasingly urgent that it should be clear that paramilitary organisations are not engaged in any preparations for terrorism and that they should be stood down altogether".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 24/7/02; col. 976.)
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-22_para44"></a><P>

<a name="30210-22_para45"></a>It is clearly what he meant when he said in Belfast on 17th October 2002:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The fork in the road has finally come . . . We cannot carry on with the IRA half in, half out of this process".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-22_para46"></a>
And it is clearly what he meant in the same speech when he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It's time for acts of completion".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-22_para47"></a><P>

<a name="30210-22_para48"></a>We on this side of the House agree with all those statements. Nothing less will do. Nearly five years after the Belfast agreement, there can simply be no excuse for political parties maintaining their private armies. It is time for them to go.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para49"></a>That must be the central message of the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, when they meet the parties in Belfast on Wednesday in an attempt to achieve a breakthrough. They must not allow Sinn Fein, in particular, to muddy the waters by introducing a whole raft of secondary issues, as it has done so often before. Illegal arms and the failure of the paramilitaries to fulfil their obligations to decommission have dogged the process for too long. The paramilitaries know what they have to do. They should get on and do it.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para50"></a>In that context we back this order, which extends for a further year the decommissioning and the amnesty on the forensic testing of weapons. We fervently hope that the commission has a busier time this year than it did last and that devolved government can be restored and the agreement finally implemented in full.

<P>
<A NAME="30210-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches agree that the order must be extended. As the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said, it is vital that we have further acts of decommissioning until it is complete. I agree with much of what he said. But at this time one of the biggest dangers to any further decommissioning is the loyalist mayhem occurring in north and west Belfast. Those acts of mayhem&#151;perhaps this is the intention&#151;will inhibit any further developments on the part of the IRA.
<P>


<a name="column_542"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 542</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para51"></a>The IRA is unlikely to decommission while such lawlessness continues. Although it is largely occurring within the loyalist community, it gives no confidence that any moment things might not erupt across the communities. It is extremely dangerous and very worrying that that problem exists in the ranks of loyalism. The real problem is that there is no political leadership; there is a political vacuum.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para52"></a>There is political leadership in the case of the republicans&#151;we all believe that Sinn Fein has tremendous influence on the IRA&#151;but one looks in vain for some political influence on the loyalist paramilitaries. We desperately need to repair that by offering some real political leadership at the community level rather than simply wringing our hands at its absence.
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para53"></a>Has there been even informal contact between the IRA on the one hand and the loyalist groups on the other with the de Chastelain commission? Is there a complete cut-off, or has there been some informal contact?
<P>

<a name="30210-22_para54"></a>We believe that the Act must be continued, as the order provides. We must consider it year by year. I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said that he wanted it extended beyond that period if necessary. We need to take it year by year in the hope that we can focus attention on it.

<P>
<A NAME="30210-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, on a point of factual correction, I hope that I did not say that I wanted the order extended beyond that period.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for that intervention and apologise if I misinterpreted. We must consider the matter year by year in the hope that a time limit keeps negotiations going&#151;one hopes, progressively&#151;so that we can get an end to the ridiculous mayhem that has blighted Northern Ireland for far too long.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-23_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, I support the order. The decommissioning period must continue, sad as that is. As we have heard, that means decommissioning on both sides. Obviously, total decommissioning would be the act of completion for which everyone is looking. The Prime Minister says that he will accept an act of completion. We are aware that he is talking to Sinn Fein/IRA which wants some form of demilitarisation, a reduction in forces, and ultimately a review of the prevention of terrorism legislation. However, if the IRA is on ceasefire&#151;for one moment I shall accept the Government's point of view that it is&#151;the fact is that the threat level in Northern Ireland is higher than it has been for five years.
<P>

<a name="30210-23_para0"></a>If the IRA is on ceasefire, and if it and Sinn Fein seriously believe in the process, then quite obviously they do not control the dissident groups, which are the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA. It probably did not appear in the newspapers over here, but there was a coffee jar bomb in a police station the night before last. Two devices were found at a Territorial Army base when it was putting together support for the Gulf war. <P>


<a name="column_543"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 543</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>That happened three or four days ago. We have had numerous bombs, especially in Fermanagh, over the past 24 months. Therefore, the dissidents are there and the threat is there.
<P>

<a name="30210-23_para1"></a>If the answer is an act of completion by the IRA, be it full decommissioning or not, it is not going to reduce the threat at all because, according to the Government, the IRA is on ceasefire and it therefore does not control the dissidents. Therefore, the threat does not come from it and therefore an act of completion by the IRA has absolutely nothing to do with the present threat.
<P>

<a name="30210-23_para2"></a>If that is the situation, and if the Government are not responsible for the problems, how can they possibly treat us in Northern Ireland in such a way that they are going to reduce our protection by removing the very defences that we have against the threat? However, if they believe that the IRA is in control of the dissident groups, how can the Government accept that the IRA is on ceasefire?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Kilclooney: </B>   My Lords, when the Belfast agreement was signed and supported in a referendum by the people of Northern Ireland, they did so in anticipation that there would be decommissioning of all illegal arms by all paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. Yet five years later the Lord Privy Seal comes forward yet again to renew the order for decommissioning. In doing so in a one-minute speech he underlined his embarrassment that yet again he has to extend the order.
<P>

<a name="30210-23_para3"></a>Decommissioning of itself is not the final solution to the problem of paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. One must be careful in stating that if there is total decommissioning peace has arrived. First, how does one know what total decommissioning is? Secondly, even if it occurred, as we well know, further illegal arms can be imported into Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30210-23_para4"></a>Here I must criticise and condemn all paramilitaries, not just republican groups, but also the loyalist paramilitaries. The loyalist paramilitaries have been a disgrace to Northern Ireland over the past months and years and in particular, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said, in the past few weeks. They describe themselves as loyalists. They are not. Being a loyalist means that one is loyal to the Crown and country. I am a loyalist. The people who behave in the way they have behaved in the past few weeks have been a disgrace to loyalists. They are not unionists: they are an embarrassment to the unionist community and they weaken the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. They are certainly not Protestants, because those involved in crime, drugs&#151;as we saw this weekend&#151;and prostitution cannot be so described. I doubt whether many of them have darkened the door of a Protestant church in Northern Ireland for many years. They are an embarrassment to us as the majority community in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30210-23_para5"></a>But we must get decommissioning. For that reason, it is good to extend the process of decommissioning for another year, as the order does. But, for decommissioning <P>


<a name="column_544"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 544</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to take place, there must be sanctions to ensure that it has been carried out. It must be clear to the community in Northern Ireland that it has happened. With the exception of a few handguns decommissioned by a Loyalist paramilitary organisation, decommissioning has been done secretly, under the auspices of the Independent Commission on Decommissioning. The people of Northern Ireland do not know the amount of firearms decommissioned, where decommissioning has taken place and how many illegal firearms, bombs, et cetera still exist.
<P>

<a name="30210-23_para6"></a>Anyone who believes that further decommissioning by the IRA will bring about a restoration of devolution in Northern Ireland is ill advised. Last year I prophesised that the devolved executive and Assembly at Stormont would collapse. The Liberal Democrat spokesman described me as negative. Well, it has happened. But I live in Northern Ireland; and I know what is going on there.
<P>

<a name="30210-23_para7"></a>I must warn and advise that, in the present circumstances, there is no chance of devolution being restored simply by an act of decommissioning. To win the confidence of the people of Northern Ireland, which has now been lost, and to regain support for the agreement, which has declined, it is necessary to have not only decommissioning but real sanctions if those who decommission break the peace. By that, I do not mean simply the Prime Minister writing a few words in chalk on a blackboard and then undermining those words before the chalk has even dried.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Eames: </B>   My Lords, many words have become the vehicle for other people's thoughts on the Northern Ireland situation. "Reconciliation" has been bandied about as though it were a word of trivial meaning. I fear that the word "decommissioning" is going the same way. Clergy members who speak to me from local areas in which tension is high leave me in no doubt that one of the greatest moves towards convincing the people of Northern Ireland that a new era has come has nothing to do with the so-called decommissioning of Provisional IRA arms. It has to do with the nightly attacks and punishment beatings in both communities across the north. That is what the ordinary people of Northern Ireland see when they wake in the morning and read their papers or watch television.
<P>

<a name="30210-23_para8"></a>If I may say so to Her Majesty's Government, there is a real danger that we will run away with the idea that, if there is decommissioning in the traditional sense of the word, all will be well and the new Jerusalem will have arrived. It will be a vital, important part, but people seek the safety of their homes, their streets and their young people. There is a constant harping back to beatings, attacks and shootings. But one of the miracles of the present situation is that there have not been more deaths from that source than there have been. I beg your Lordships to realise that while decommissioning is a vital part of the panorama that we are seeking, at the end of the day, we should not lose sight of what people perceive to be peace, and the lack of it, on their own streets and in their own homes.

<A NAME="30210-23_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, I hardly like to follow the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Eames. He has said magnificently what other noble Lords and I believe. Nevertheless, I shall reinforce his comments.
<P>

<a name="30210-23_para9"></a>I recognise that the period of amnesty needs to be extended. But for how many years are we to wait for full decommissioning, without which Sinn Fein/IRA cannot be regarded as a normal political party? I hope with all my heart that the Government will cease to rest every bargain on formal acts of decommissioning of arms held by the IRA as a body and, instead, relate the assessment of true disarmament and true decommissioning to the total disarming of the paramilitaries on the streets of Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30210-23_para10"></a>Sinn Fein/IRA, which has the power, must promise the end of the iniquitous exiling of whole families to the mainland, the end of punishment beatings and the freeing of the people to speak out to both the press and the police if and when they are unlawfully injured and terrorised by people who rely on the support of the IRA to rule their communities. Who are they to claim that they are policing their society and to accuse people, who have done no wrong, of being paedophiles or drug dealers? Who are they to engage in restorative justice?
<P>

<a name="30210-23_para11"></a>The loyalist thugs&#151;I use that word as a shorthand; I recognise that it is a cruel perversion of loyalist as a word&#151;who terrorise their own people must equally be disarmed. However, the issue is what in particular Sinn Fein/IRA must deliver&#151;because they are the people with whom the bargains are being conducted&#151;before any continuing amnesty in the context of demilitarisation can continue to be on offer.
<P>

<a name="30210-23_para12"></a>Every Sinn Fein/IRA paramilitary on the streets should be required to hand in his arms as the condition of the continuation of the amnesty. It should not be related solely to the acts of decommissioning involving arms held by the IRA as part of its arsenal to use, one assumes, against the forces of law and order in any potential conflict&#151;although it is difficult to imagine how such a war could be justified after nearly five years of the peace process.
<P>

<a name="30210-23_para13"></a>Incidentally, I should like to say here that, sadly, I do not believe that dissident groups are beyond the control of the IRA. In my view, the IRA does not tolerate dissidents; dissidents get killed, but they are very convenient alibis. I read in the Irish Times of a monitoring plan to validate that the IRA is no longer engaged in paramilitary activities in the event of a major initiative by the IRA.
<P>

<a name="30210-23_para14"></a>Forget the grand and imponderable gestures. Let us begin with visible, real housekeeping on the streets of Northern Ireland. Nothing else will convince the people, whether Catholic or Protestant, that there is a real hope of peace. The cleansing of the streets must precede any possible concession by Her Majesty's Government in terms of the reduction of our military presence in what is British territory&#151;a presence <P>

<A NAME="30210-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the contributions made. The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, said that I was embarrassed because I made a short speech&#151;quite the opposite. I try to avoid ceaseless repetition of the obvious, which I regard as not particularly useful and certainly as rather disrespectful of this House.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para0"></a>I said that if we wish decommissioning to be an option, which we do, the passage of the order is a necessary pre-condition. No one who has spoken today denies the obvious nature of that proposition. So I am not embarrassed. I am perfectly capable, as my friends at the Bar will remind your Lordships, of going on for several hours, but I never think that going on has an intrinsic human or philosophic virtue.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para1"></a>I turn to the contributions that have been made. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Park, and the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Eames. He is quite right. The theme that I take from him&#151;the text that I accept&#151;is that decommissioning is one dimension only. All noble Lords who have spoken have made that point, with which I entirely agree, but we are focused today on this one dimension because that is the nature of parliamentary proceedings.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para2"></a> The noble Baroness referred to Sinn Fein/IRA punishment beatings and the driving of people into exile. She frequently refers to that issue, and she is right. But my understanding of the events of last week-end and the week-end before is that Sinn Fein/IRA played very little part in them.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para3"></a>The question is whether we want to move forward in admittedly difficult circumstances&#151;for those who live in Northern Ireland they are terrifying circumstances&#151;and the answer must be that we do. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, quite rightly said that amnesty is a necessary evil. It is required as an unusual remedy for evil, and we do not need to overlook the evil to recognise the necessary nature of the remedy. He said&#151;I remember his words plainly&#151;that he does not want to see this go as far as 2007. Nor do any of us. That is why, as the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, said, it is better to deal with this year by year.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para4"></a>The noble Lord asked specifically about contacts with General de Chastelain and his colleagues. There has been no report from the de Chastelain commission of any contact with either the IRA or the UVF since those organisations publicly suspended contact with the commission.

<a name="30210-24_para5"></a> The noble Lord, Lord Smith, spoke about a vacuum and a gap in the paramilitary, allegedly loyalist, partisans. Significantly, that may be true. There is something to be said for listening occasionally to David Irvine, who still remains part of the parliamentary process. Certainly when I have had conversations with him&#151;I do not pretend that we agree&#151;many of the things that he says are worth listening to and considering.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para6"></a>The noble Viscount asked about the IRA's control over dissidents. The noble Baroness gave her view on that issue; I do not necessarily share it.

<a name="30210-24_para10"></a>As your Lordships will see, the Government have decided to renew almost all of Part VII. When the Act was introduced it was made quite clear that the Northern Ireland specific provisions in Part VII were to be temporary. Indeed, that temporary nature is embodied in the legislation itself. So we must be in no doubt that the provisions in Part VII set Northern Ireland apart from the remainder of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para11"></a> We have a commitment to removing Part VII. It is a crucial aspect of our commitment to the Belfast agreement and the peace process which sustains it. But that obligation to remove the temporary nature of Part VII is not unqualified; we have other responsibilities. We have an unquestionable, non-negotiable responsibility to protect the people of Northern Ireland in so far as we can from violence and terror. I agree with what your Lordships said in relation to the earlier order. The police cannot do this alone. If the community does not will it, it will not come about. I suppose that we need both politics and security measures.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para12"></a>We have seen steps towards peace. The noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Eames, pointed to recent history. I agree that many aspects of it are gloomy and depressing. But I remind your Lordships of the number of those who were killed in what are <P>


<a name="column_548"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column 548</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>inelegantly called "security related incidents" last year. There were far too many; but the figure must be compared with the hundreds who were cruelly killed not very long ago in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para13"></a>We do not have a normal security situation. There are the punishment beatings that have been referred to; there is sectarian rioting, alleged intelligence gathering, and dissident groups whose purpose is to see that peace fails. We have therefore decided to offer to your Lordships the conclusion that we need to renew most of Part VII.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para14"></a> We have relied in great part on the advice of security advisers. We rely significantly on the police service and the Army. We have to pay careful attention to their careful, measured, proportionate, professional judgments about what is required.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para15"></a>Some sections will lapse, but only on the basis of a careful appreciation of the advice to which I referred. Subsections (1) and (2) of Section 97 allow the Secretary of State to confer port and border control powers on the Army by specifying members of the Armed Forces as examining officers. This power has never been used and its use has never been sought. The police service believes that in the current situation there is no operational requirement for retention, and the Army thinks that little would be lost by allowing it to lapse.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para16"></a>I turn, secondly, to paragraph 36 of Schedule 4. That allows the Secretary of State to make a restraint order in place of the courts. It is many years since this power was used and the police do not see any current operational need for it. They would seek restraint orders through the courts. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, whose work we deeply appreciate and are grateful for, has recommended that paragraph 37 also be allowed to lapse. We shall give this further thought. Some questions still remain. The Secretary of State intends to launch a consultation on that provision.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para17"></a>Likewise, paragraphs 19 to 21 of Schedule 5 allow the Secretary of State to authorise in place of the courts a search of premises in the investigation of terrorist finance or direction offences. This is in order that the police might avoid having to disclose sensitive material or techniques to the courts. It is many years since the power was used. The police see no current operational need for it. They are content to seek such warrants through the courts.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para18"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, the independent reviewer, agrees with the Government that these provisions may safely be allowed to lapse.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para19"></a>The noble Lord has also raised the possibility of allowing subsections (3) and (4) of Section 67 to lapse. These subsections set out the limitations on granting bail in terrorist cases in Northern Ireland. We want to look at the possibility. It is a complex issue and we want to avoid unintended consequences. We shall therefore consult before making a decision.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para20"></a>Other issues were raised by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, in his report which we shall want to explore with some care and caution&#151;for example, the possibility of resident magistrates granting bail in terrorist cases, and the possibility of extending the list of protected groups in Section 103 to include part-time as well as full-time prison officers. Both proposals seem to have a good deal of virtue in them, but we want to give them careful consideration following consultation.
<P>

<a name="30210-24_para21"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, will keep a careful eye on the workings of Part VII. His efforts are invaluable. They have shown the value of independent scrutiny on a forensic basis, not a partisan basis. For the moment, we come to the conclusion that these temporary provisions, subject to the lapsed provisions, need to be reviewed. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30210-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for explaining exactly what is in the order. I admire the work that has been clearly been done behind the scenes to look into the needs of this particular Part VII before formulating the order. I have nothing to say to challenge the noble and learned Lord on anything that the Government have done. I am relieved that the risk factor has been kept at a fairly sensitive level and that risks have not been taken in this legislation, in my view and in that of the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, we, too, support the order. I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for spending time on explaining what the Government will do with two recommendations in the Carlile report that they have not as yet accepted. Those recommendations relate to allowing resident magistrates to hear bail applications and the suggestion that the distinction between scheduled and non-scheduled offences should no longer obtain. Bearing in mind that the Government intend to reconsider those recommendations again and hold consultations, I am satisfied. I support the order.

However, others must also contribute to reality and face the facts. That is not the practice of a great many people in a position to influence thinking and attitudes, especially in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30210-25_para0"></a>For example, is it not passing strange that governments&#151;plural&#151;of the United Kingdom should be granting what one might call "annual last chances" to various terrorist organisations in Ireland, while the same governments in and of the United Kingdom should deal with similar terrorist organisations elsewhere in a far more robust fashion, both nationally and internationally?

<P>
<A NAME="30210-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Kilclooney: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Lord Privy Seal for his full explanation of the order. One could not detect any embarrassment about this subject. However, I should remind the House that the background is one of policing and security in Northern Ireland. Some parts of the order are not innocuous, although that impression may have been given.
<P>

<a name="30210-25_para3"></a>We work in a new background in Northern Ireland, in which there is a great shortage of police on the ground. The Patten report decimated the size of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Instead of being 12,500 or even 7,500, as Patten recommended for normal peaceful times, we are below 7,000. Therefore, the Army, which is there to support the civil power&#151;to support policing in Northern Ireland&#151;is more necessary than ever. In fact, last Wednesday night the Army had to be used in the Shankill Road, in Larne and in Carrickfergus in support of the Police Service of Northern Ireland because of the small manpower available within that police service. Therefore, I find it interesting that it has been decided that, given the strength of the police service at the ports and along the border, it is no longer necessary to have personnel within the Army specified as examining officers.
<P>

<a name="30210-25_para4"></a>The Irish Army is on the border supporting the Garda Siochana but for the first time this order states that Her Majesty's forces&#151;that includes the Royal Irish Regiment, the former UDR&#151;can no longer act as examining officers along the border because there are sufficient police in Northern Ireland to do that.
<P>

<a name="30210-25_para5"></a>There is a tremendous contradiction here. Who is getting it wrong? Has the Chief Constable said that he has adequate manpower, because he has told the Northern Ireland Policing Board that he has not? Are the Government saying that it is no longer necessary for the Army to operate along the border? Or is it simply the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, who is saying that? We need to have answers to those questions. Who will take responsibility for the decision to withdraw the Army and the Royal Irish Regiment from border areas? Will the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal tell us, as members of Her Majesty's forces will no longer be examining officers at the border, how far inside the border they still have the power to be examining officers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I must learn from the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, as the longer I speak, the shorter the debate. I shall do my best not to be seduced into the paths of unreason.

<P>

<a name="30210-25_para6"></a>It is important to bear in mind what I said about the Army. As I said, Section 97(1) and (2) allows the Secretary of State to confer port and border control powers on the Army by specifying them as examining officers. That is to say, members of the Armed Forces could be designated to stand at airports and docks examining people arriving in Northern Ireland, just as police officers and customs officials may at present. The provision is important. This power has never been used and its use has never been sought. The police service&#151;we pay the closest attention to the present Chief Constable and his predecessors&#151;believes that in the current situation there is no operational <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>requirement to retain this power. That being so, it is not a proper function of government to continue with it. It has never been necessary for the Army to have Section 97 powers to patrol the border. It can use its own stop and search powers. In fact, the Army has never used the Section 97 powers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-25_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Ampthill): </B>  Before the Minister moves that the first order be considered, it may be helpful to say a word about the procedure for today's Grand Committee. Our proceedings are essentially the same as those of the House. Noble Lords will speak standing; all noble Lords are free to attend and participate; and the proceedings will be reported in Hansard.
<P>

<a name="30210-25_para9"></a>As we are in Committee, Members may speak more than once on any Motion.
<P>

<a name="30210-25_para10"></a>Since this is a new procedure, I should perhaps make it clear to noble Lords that this Committee is charged only to consider orders, not to approve or not approve them. The Motion to approve will be moved in the Chamber in the usual way.
<P>

<a name="30210-25_para11"></a>The main difference between our proceedings and the proceedings on the Floor of the House is that the House has agreed that there will be no Divisions in a Grand Committee. Any Motion on which agreement cannot be reached should be withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="30210-25_para12"></a>I should explain that if there is a Division in the Chamber while we are sitting, the Committee will adjourn as soon as the Division Bells are rung and then resume after 10 minutes.

<P>

<a name="30210-25_para14"></a>I beg to move that the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Strategic Investment and Regeneration of Sites (Northern Ireland) Order 2003.
<P>


<a name="column_GC2"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column GC2</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-25_para15"></a>The purpose of the order is to provide for the creation of a strategic investment board and to allow the Office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister to hold, manage, develop and dispose of the transferred military and security sites. Specifically, the order takes forward the Reinvestment and Reform Initiative which was announced in May last year. It was developed jointly under devolution by the Government and the devolved administration. I hope that Members of the Committee will regard this as a key initiative.
<P>

<a name="30210-25_para16"></a>It will help the administration to take a long-term, strategic approach to investing in the infrastructure of Northern Ireland. It will offer an opportunity to turn symbols of conflict and division within Northern Ireland into ones of prosperity and regeneration. More directly, it will contribute to a tangible improvement for the people of Northern Ireland by improving public service infrastructure and the benefits to be derived for the social and economic regeneration offered by the former military and security sites.
<P>

<a name="30210-25_para17"></a>The order therefore provides for a strategic investment board which will bring a new approach to managing and financing infrastructure programmes. It should bring greater expertise and management focus to the public sector. We hope that it will provide a centre of excellence; a source of advice to the Executive as it sets its overall investment plan and to individual Ministers and departments as they procure individual projects. This must be the best way to use such specialist resources.
<P>

<a name="30210-25_para18"></a>The order provides for the Office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister to make use of the transferred military and security sites to achieve major economic and social regeneration. The Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister will work with other government departments and social partners in taking forward that regeneration.
<P>

<a name="30210-25_para19"></a>The provisions of the order were subject to a number of consultation exercises held throughout Northern Ireland and the views of local political parties, businesses and the trade unions were obtained.
<P>

<a name="30210-25_para20"></a>The Strategic Investment and Regeneration of Sites Bill reached the First Stage in the Northern Ireland Assembly. It did not receive a Second Reading. Some have said that the Bill would not have passed Second Stage in the Assembly, but I remind Members of the Committee that the Bill had previously been agreed by the Executive and had the full support of the two largest parties within the Assembly. Indeed, a project board made up of nominees of the four main political parties represented in the Executive advised both the Northern Ireland and direct rule administrations on the preparation of the legislation.
<P>

<a name="30210-25_para21"></a>The idea behind the board has wide support on the clear basis that it will add value to make investment happen and will not undermine the responsibility of individual Ministers. The section on sites does not prescribe any particular course of action, but provides a range of options. In taking this forward, plainly we will look for the widest possible consensus.

<a name="30210-25_para22"></a>We are here to carry through work previously agreed by the Executive Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly. I cannot see ultimate value in speculating what might have been, particularly at a difficult time for the institutions of Northern Ireland. I recognise that not every party in Northern Ireland supports all aspects of the order. That is not an experience I have found common in Northern Ireland at the present time. I know of the debate surrounding the need for a strategic investment board and the proposals for regeneration. I commend the order to the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   I have tabled an amendment to the order, which we shall consider when we debate the order in the Chamber tomorrow. I have two difficulties with the order, one of which was alluded to by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal. The order has had a bumpy passage in the Assembly. It was presented on two occasions and was pulled on both because the two main parties would not have been able to muster a majority in favour of it. One can put an emphasis on the wishes of the Executive, but looking at the wishes of the Assembly, which are sovereign in this matter, the order would not have been passed.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para0"></a>Therefore, we have the problem that we know the attitudes of a majority of the Assembly Members and every party, apart from the SDLP and the UUP, has raised objections to this. That is a broad, rainbow coalition. We must ask ourselves whether in its present form the order should go through, bearing in mind that it would not have received majority support in the Assembly.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para1"></a>My other problem relates to the composition of the strategic investment board. That is referred to in my amendment which we shall discuss tomorrow. It is a wide-ranging agency; it has a broad remit. The noble and learned Lord said that it would discuss and seek as broad a consensus as possible as to its mode of operation on various policies and projects it undertook. I grant that being that wide ranging has the advantage of flexibility, but the flipside is that it is ill-defined. Matters are therefore made worse by the fact that a number of key stakeholders, particularly those from the business community and the voluntary sector, are excluded.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para2"></a>That is unfortunate, bearing in mind the fact that the PPP working group in Northern Ireland forcefully suggested that business and voluntary groups should be involved in strategic policy planning. If the strategic investment board is not concerned with strategic policy planning, I would like to know what is.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para3"></a>I therefore have two problems. In relation to the first, it is up to the House to decide whether we should be pushing forward an order which would not have received majority support in the Assembly. The second is more important and deals with the composition of <P>


<a name="column_GC4"></a>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I thank the noble and learned Lord, first, for helping us to set up the Grand Committee so that we can debate the serious Bills that now come to us as statutory instruments in a two-stage manner. That will be helpful. Your Lordships would want and should have an opportunity to scrutinise the orders seriously. More importantly, the key question that we should ask in the Committee and in the Chamber, when the orders come before it to be passed, is whether we are sufficiently content that the Northern Ireland Assembly would have passed the Bills, as the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, said. We should be sure that the orders represent what the people of Northern Ireland want.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para4"></a>We should be wary of imposing laws on the devolved administration in Northern Ireland. Power may not be devolved at the moment, but I hope that we all work with a devolved legislature in mind. That is important.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para5"></a>I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, had to say, and I intend to explore it a little further. It seems to me that there is a dispute within the Assembly between the DUP and the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. As far as I can understand from the politicians from Northern Ireland to whom I have spoken, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist Party are content with the order and believe that it is the right thing to do and that this is the right way in which to manage it. Again, the emphasis is on management.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para6"></a>It is a good thing for Northern Ireland to have ownership of the sites transferred from the British Government to the Northern Ireland Government. I understand it to be an extremely good deal. Per se, it is a good thing for Northern Ireland, and it creates an opportunity for the proper development of the assets. However, I have had some happy and less happy experiences in government quasi-companies in Northern Ireland&#151;one or two officials may remember things such as Positively Belfast and the Tall Ships&#151;in which government funding got mixed up with private-sector funding and the business was run by a non-parliamentary board. I counsel caution to those responsible for setting up the structures within which the development board and the development corporations that are envisaged will manage the assets. I am nervous that there is dissent in the Assembly and, perhaps, in the Executive, although I am not sure whether that is so. I would like to be comfortable in my mind that the dissent in the Assembly was not such as to make it difficult for whatever organisation, investment board or development corporation to operate.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para7"></a>Northern Ireland is a small country. I have gained and suffered from the fact that, if two or three key people wind up a few journalists and others, a huge amount of damage can be done, casting doubt on the <P>


<a name="column_GC5"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column GC5</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>efficacy of what is being done. On one occasion, BBC news cast doubt on the accounts of a company of which I was chairman. It was a company similar to this and had £500,000 of government money&#151;not a lot nowadays, but a lot then. I did not know that this was coming. It was out of context and did a huge amount of damage to what we were trying to achieve. That can happen only too easily, so it is important that we do not impose on the Northern Ireland Assembly legislation that it does not want. Secondly, if we believe that it is the right thing to do&#151;and I believe that these projects should come under the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, covering the spectrum of the SDLP and the unionists&#151;the overseeing Minister must be certain that there can be no criticism that is not answerable in the way that the directors of these companies work, report and oversee, the input from the NAO, and so on.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   Before I speak on this, the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, prompt me to say that many of us in Northern Ireland thought that scurrilous accusations were made against him. Most of us in the business community and civic society in Northern Ireland felt, and still do, that he is a most honourable man. He behaved most honourably in what he did with regard to the Tall Ships, and I would have a clear conscience if I were him.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para8"></a>I am pleased to welcome this order. My only regret is that it must be considered here as an Order in Council, rather than in the Northern Ireland Assembly as a Bill. Your Lordships are, however, all too aware of the reasoning behind the suspension of devolution&#151;namely, the persistent, deceitful and undemocratic activities of Sinn Fein/IRA, culminating in the discovery of a spy ring operating in Stormont. Until such activities are brought to a definitive end, the responsibility for scrutinising Northern Ireland legislation will continue to lie with this Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para9"></a>This order is the result of the reinvestment and reform initiative launched last year. This initiative was born out of a realisation that Northern Ireland has suffered from a serious and severe lack of public investment in its basic infrastructure over the past 30 years. Quite rightly, the necessary diversion of public moneys for peacekeeping and security meant that progress on our roads, schools and hospitals could not keep up with investment levels in other regions of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para10"></a>The new Northern Ireland Executive estimated that some £14 billion worth of investment was required over the next 10 years. The expected growth rate in capital expenditure within the Northern Ireland budgets is just over £7 billion, leaving a shortfall of £7 billion. From the £14 billion, 70 per cent needs to be spent over the next five to six years, particularly on our ageing water service. Furthermore, significant sums must be spent in the next two years if we are to avoid significant and expensive infraction proceedings emanating from Europe.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para11"></a>Regrettably, the Northern Ireland Executive was unable to secure significant additional resources from the UK Treasury to meet this shortfall. So, in <P>


<a name="column_GC6"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column GC6</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>November 2001, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, along with the Prime Minister and Chancellor, established a task force&#151;the reinvestment and reform initiative&#151;to make substantial investment in public assets.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para12"></a>The initiative bestowed a borrowing power on the Northern Ireland Executive to enable it to add significant spending power to departments, ensure the better utilisation of existing and new assets and ensure improvements in the delivery of public services. It also required the granting of significant and strategic redundant military and security installations to the Executive. Indeed, this forms the basis for the regeneration of sites element in the order.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para13"></a>Unfortunately, there has been some reluctance among the departments in Northern Ireland to replicate the beneficial use of public/private partnerships or private finance initiatives to solve investment problems. There is also a tendency for departments to hold on to assets that are no longer central to their principal activities and functions. This has led to stagnation and a lack of projects or investments from public or private sources. For instance, the Department for Regional Development still operates and manages car parks throughout Northern Ireland. Yet that same department has not brought forward a single proposal for the investment, restructuring and refinancing of our water service, despite nearly two and a half years of accountable local government. Such department-based approaches are costly, inefficient and have led to a very poor level of deal flow.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para14"></a>To combat such examples, the strategic investment board was created to develop, implement and drive an integrated strategy on behalf of the Northern Ireland Executive, working from the Programme for Government and adopted by the Assembly as a whole. I hope and trust that this will overcome the shortcomings associated with the existing department-based approach.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para15"></a>I welcome the granting of powers to develop, where appropriate, regeneration companies that will take forward the development of sites of strategic importance. The future development of the Maze prison, the Long Kesh army base and other sites provides the opportunity for alliances to be formed between the community and the voluntary sector, government and the private sector. It will transform areas normally associated with trouble and terror into areas of productivity, economic regeneration and social enhancement.
<P>

<a name="30210-26_para16"></a>This order is one of the most important pieces of legislation to come out of the Northern Ireland Assembly. It will significantly improve our infrastructure and bring investment to Northern Ireland on a scale not previously thought possible. I commend the order to the House.

<A NAME="30210-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   Does the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, agree with me that the composition of the company leaves much to be desired in that it does not involve important social partners? Does he agree that <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>it would be much better for Northern Ireland if such an important agency were to proceed with the assistance and experience of those sectors?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   I am not aware of what the composition of the board will be. But I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, that it will be to the board's benefit if the greatest number of people throughout the community who can be involved are asked to be.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Smith, has a point when he says that this order would not have been passed if it had come before the Northern Ireland Assembly. Although the order is about regenerating Northern Ireland in every aspect, there are also political considerations. Some of the objections in Northern Ireland are about the disposal of the available military lands. Some would like to see the disposal of those establishments while others would be bitterly opposed to it.
<P>

<a name="30210-27_para0"></a>The previous speaker drew my attention to the composition of the board. The order states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The membership of the company's board will be controlled by the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-27_para1"></a>
Currently, the First Minister is a Unionist and the Deputy First Minister is a nationalist. If it is within the power of those two to appoint the board's members, what will that say about the powers of the other elected Assembly Members who do not agree with every aspect of this order? This order is so important to the whole future of Northern Ireland, and I believe that all the political parties should try their best to find an accommodation to which they can all agree.
<P>

<a name="30210-27_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Smith, said that he tabled an amendment which will be considered tomorrow in the Chamber. As we are all aware, however, those who will take part in tomorrow's debates are currently sitting in this room. Most noble Lords in the Chamber tomorrow will not be overly concerned about what happens in Northern Ireland. If they read some of the accounts of what happened last week in Northern Ireland, I could understand why they do not want to be concerned with Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30210-27_para3"></a>If this order is accepted, it will be accepted under the aegis of the presently constituted Assembly. However, there has to be an Assembly election in May, after which the composition may be totally different. The new Assembly may not wish to go along with every aspect of this order. So the question is whether it is urgent to pass this order now. If not, I believe that all shades of opinion in the Northern Ireland Assembly should be taken into account. The most important point, however, is one that I have made. As I said,

Both are highly political figures in Northern Ireland. If they were to take decisions that could in any way be interpreted as excluding other Assembly Members, it would not bode well for the future of the board.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-27_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   Although very few people are against the idea of the objectives of the order&#151;to increase opportunities, investment and development&#151;we have to consider the principle. The Government have said that they do not want the Assembly's suspension to hold up the government of Northern Ireland and that they want the passage of the legislation which was under consideration or was soon to be considered in the Assembly. However, the Government themselves admit that this order might not have been passed by the Assembly. Although I personally do not oppose the order, there is a principle here.
<P>

<a name="30210-27_para5"></a>The Government expressed their hope, which we all share, that the Assembly will soon be restarted. Nevertheless, they expressly said that they would not wait to see whether that happens. They said, "We will continue what the people of Northern Ireland started because we want to show that the Assembly is effective". Still, they have admitted that this order would not have been passed. As I said, however, I am not against the order.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   On a matter of correction, I said that at no time did I admit that it would not have gone through. I said that it was speculation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-27_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My apologies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-27_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   I have just one query to put to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal, and that relates to the transfer of the bases. I am ashamed to say that I have not been back to May 2002 and looked at the detail under which the original agreement was made. However, I live within two miles of an RAF base which was surrendered from Ministry of Defence use in 1993. Ten years later, it is still in the Government's hands. I have no criticism of that fact, which involves about £500,000 of expenditure annually. Am I right in assuming that, when the bases are handed over, all potential military damage to them will have been removed so that, although they are brownfield sites, they are free from pollution? If they are not free from pollution, on whom will the expense fall? Will it fall on the Ministry of Defence or on the new owners?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-27_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I am grateful for the contributions that have been made. I am particularly grateful for the generosity of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, in expressing appreciation for what we tried to do about producing a procedure that is quite novel in this place.
<P>

<a name="30210-27_para6"></a>It seems to me that the division of question and criticism has been twofold: one, should we be doing it; and, two, the nature and constitution of the board. The noble Lord, Lord Smith, said that the Assembly is sovereign. Speaking for the Government, we should prefer that the Assembly had never been suspended. It was suspended with great reluctance.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-27_para7"></a>Our present hope, as the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has said time and again, is that we shall have elections on 1st May. However, let us assume that we do not. Are we then to let these opportunities of which the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, spoke so glowingly dribble away? The point made by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, is a good one. He spoke of about 10 years that have been wasted or not used fruitfully. I do not think that we will discharge our duty to the people of Northern Ireland if we let these opportunities go. I am very grateful for the support that the noble Lords, Lord Rogan and Lord Glentoran, have given to this.
<P>

<a name="30210-27_para8"></a>It is possible that this order would have gone through the Assembly&#151;I do not know, and I do not think that any Member of the Committee could possibly be in a position to know with any degree of moral certainty. What I can say is that all the parties on the Executive&#151;the four major parties&#151;took part in the discussions. It is possible that the Assembly would have passed it, but it is possible that it would not have done. Are we then for the future to say either, "The Assembly might not have passed it", or even, lamentably, "The Assembly never even considered it"? Are we then to do nothing? I think not.
<P>

<a name="30210-27_para9"></a>The order has the support of the two biggest political parties, the SDLP and the UUP. All four Executive parties were represented on the project board. The Executive Committee met on a number of occasions to look at the contents of the legislation and the path that it would take. This order itself has been the subject of further consultation between the Minister, Mr Ian Pearson, and the Alliance, the Women's Coalition and the PUP. The Minister has also met the DUP and Sinn Fein. So I think that we have done our very best, and acted as honourably as we can, in taking this matter forward.
<P>

<a name="30210-27_para10"></a>A number of Members of the Committee&#151;the noble Lords, Lord Fitt, Lord Glentoran and Lord Smith, and the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough&#151;asked about composition. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Smith, talks about needing to ensure that the board would be a model of social partnership and involve key stakeholders. The noble Lord, Lord Rogan, is quite right. The membership of the board has not been set. However, it would be wrong of me not to share the current thinking with the Committee. The current thinking is that there should be one public sector representative, the interim chief executive, the chair of PUK plus three or four other experts who, of course, will be able to take representations from anyone who is interested. Quite careful thought will have to be given to who should be on the board.
<P>

<a name="30210-27_para11"></a>The real dilemma is as follows. Should we do nothing at all&#151;against which the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, has counselled&#151;or must we go forward in circumstances which we all recognise are not ideal? The circumstances are not ideal, but it seems to me that the people of Northern Ireland are entitled to our going forward with economic regeneration. Let us not forget that the history of economic regeneration&#151;investment and falling unemployment&#151;is a success story of which we should speak more strongly.

<P>

<a name="30210-27_para12"></a>On the particular point made by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, my advice is that we shall ensure that there is no contamination of the sites. The noble Lord, Lord Rogan, is quite right. We shall have to examine all the assets. Of course, the new body will have to look at the best possible asset utilisation.
<P>

<a name="30210-27_para13"></a>I shall pass on to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State the concerns expressed about the identity of the board. I think it is fair to say that Members of the Committee know him to be an open-minded person who always pays careful attention to those matters.
<P>

<a name="30210-27_para14"></a>We are faced with this problem. No one wants to be in a Northern Ireland order Grand Committee&#151;we would rather that the Assembly was doing its work. Absent it doing its work&#151;I must not use the word "absent"; the Prime Minister was criticised for being a lawyer when he used it the other day&#151;without the Northern Ireland Assembly, we must do our very best. I have no doubt that, when it comes to tomorrow, I shall be able to commend to Members of the Committee and others in the Chamber that this ought to go forward.

<H4><center>Budget (Northern Ireland) Order 2003</center></H4>
<P>

<a name="30210-28_time0"></a><H5>3.39 p.m.</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I beg to move that the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Budget (Northern Ireland) Order 2003.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para0"></a>Again, it is a matter of regret that this legislation is not being considered by the Northern Ireland Assembly. The purpose of the draft order is twofold. The first is to authorise the use of £306 million resources and £422 million cash for the year 2002&#150;03. That builds on the amounts previously authorised, as set out in the main estimates for that year, and will take the total amount authorised to £10,503 million resources and £9,320 million cash.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para1"></a>The second purpose is to authorise a vote on account to allow funds to continue to flow to public services for the early months of the next financial year until main estimates can be presented and considered. For that, the draft order seeks the authorisation of Parliament for the use of resources amounting to £4,762 million and for the issue from the Consolidated Fund of Northern Ireland of the sum of £4,195 million.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para2"></a>In general, the cash and resource required on account for 2003&#150;04 is of the order of 45 per cent of the 2002&#150;03 total voted provision and, as its name implies, the vote on account is not intended to seek final approval of the allocations for 2003&#150;04. We are simply seeking sufficient resources and cash to allow services to proceed until the detailed work on the main estimates has been completed in the late spring.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para3"></a>If your Lordships approve this tomorrow, they will not be pre-empting the decision of the Assembly on any final allocations for the 2003&#150;04 budget, as only 45 per cent of the total proposed budget is being <P>


<a name="column_GC11"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column GC11</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sought. The details are given in the spring supplementary estimates and the vote on account, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para4"></a>I shall not go through the detailed changes on a line-by-line basis as the introduction to each departmental estimate within the supplementary estimates book sets out in detail the main changes for which approval is being sought. Certainly, if Members of the Committee wish to raise matters of detail, I shall do my utmost to respond in writing at a later stage. Copies will be sent to all noble Lords who have an interest in Northern Ireland and further copies will, of course, be lodged in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para5"></a>In relation to the next financial year&#151;2003&#150;04&#151;the cash and resource totals represent a vote on account pending the bringing forward of main estimates in early summer. A vote on account at this point in the financial year, prior to the year in which the cash or resources will be used, is a normal feature of government financial management. It arises because, following the approval of the budget in December, detailed work must be undertaken by departments to disaggregate and allocate resource requirements for individual purposes&#151;often through very narrowly defined line entries.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para6"></a>There will be an opportunity for a further and full debate on the detail of the main estimates in early summer. I commend the order to the Committee.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para7"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Budget (Northern Ireland) Order 2003.&#151;(Lord Williams of Mostyn.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I thank the Minister for that explanation. I also take this opportunity to thank the officials, who were very patient in trying to explain to me, as someone who is completely ignorant of this level of national financing, how the budget may or may not work.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para8"></a>In relation to the order, ultimately I came to the conclusion that the first part&#151;the £4,195 million&#151;has already been accounted for and that decisions have been made by the Assembly as to how it should be used. As the noble and learned Lord explained, decisions are not ready to be made on the detail or allocation to departments in respect of the larger sum for the year 2003-04, and that is the sum likely to be required to run Northern Ireland for the year 2003&#150;04. That is as far as I was able to understand the national accounting procedures relating to the order. However, it seems to be very satisfactory.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   Of course, if we do not back the order, the good governance of Northern Ireland will come to a complete standstill. Tempting though that might be, we must nevertheless support it.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   My question will be an ignorant one, but it is my test of whether I have understood matters. It appears that the <P>


<a name="column_GC12"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column GC12</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>figure that appears in paragraph 8 is 45 per cent of £10,503,229,000. It appears in paragraph 8 as £4.7  billion and is the amount authorised. Paragraph 6 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Department of Finance and Personnel may issue out of the Consolidated Fund and apply to the service of the year",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30210-28_para9"></a>
the sum of £4.195 billion. Does the difference between the two figures represent accrued resources? If not, what does it represent?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The noble Lord is right, and I am deeply grateful to him. That avoids any further explanation.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said&#151;self-deprecatingly, as always&#151;that he had found this a minefield. I must join him and say that I hope that we shall not both be caught in it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I have one last question. In which budget is the money with which the previous order was concerned accounted for? Is it in the 2003&#150;04 budget, the 2002&#150;03 budget or neither?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-28_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   It will be included in the detailed figures that will be subject to the debate that I said we would be able to have on the main estimates in the summer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210-28_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   The Committee will be relieved to hear that the few remarks that I want to make will be of a less technical nature. Once again, I register my regret that the budget for Northern Ireland is being considered here as an Order in Council. Given the huge sums involved, it would have been more satisfactory if Northern Ireland Assembly committees had been able to scrutinise the budget in more detail.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para11"></a>As the order lays out, Northern Ireland can expect a fairly rapid increase in spending. In cash terms, the departmental expenditure limits&#151;the amounts allocated from the Treasury for the 11 departments&#151;will increase by 6 per cent from 2002&#150;03 to 2003&#150;04, by 5 per cent in the next year and by 6.3 per cent in the succeeding year. Some departments will receive even greater increases for the coming year. For example, the budget for agriculture will increase by 13 per cent, for health by 14 per cent, for the environment by 10 per cent and for culture, arts and leisure by 10 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para12"></a>The need to direct finances in Northern Ireland towards security and peacekeeping over the past 30 years resulted in chronic underspending on our infrastructure. Although the Assembly has sought to redress that imbalance and improve our severely run-down services, the experience of devolution so far has been that departments tend to over-bid for money, which results in money being left unspent. The Budget (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 will, I hope, go some way to reducing that underspend and encourage more efficient budget management.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para13"></a>A novel approach was taken to setting the budget for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. The DETI's 2003&#150;04 allocation, for example, was set as a range rather than a fixed figure. <P>


<a name="column_GC13"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column GC13</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Uniquely, the DETI's budget has a large discretionary element&#151;a range of £40 million&#151;to take into account the difficulties in predicting how many deals will be agreed throughout the year and at what price. The DETI will be able to draw on that range when required. Such greater flexibility is to be welcomed.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para14"></a>Despite substantially increased spending on health over the past few years&#151;by some £600 million per annum&#151;and maintaining a greater per capita expenditure on health than in England and Wales, there appears to have been little or no improvement in the services available for people in Northern Ireland. Although we clearly welcome the 14 per cent increase for the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, we seek assurances that that money will be spent appropriately, that it will be directed to where need is greatest and that, finally, it will accrue the improvement in services that the people of Northern Ireland so richly deserve.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para15"></a>The Ulster Unionist Party believes that education should be a priority area for funding. We are concerned that many schools are struggling with funding difficulties on an ongoing basis and are facing teacher redundancies to avoid going into deficit. Funding is urgently required to ensure stability and a satisfactory provision of the core curriculum to all pupils. Currently £100 million is required to bridge the funding gap between schools in Northern Ireland and those in England. We shall continue to support the use of public/private partnerships and private finance initiatives where necessary and to support the capital build programme. But we wish to ensure that in education conventional funding has primacy and will still form the most important element of Department of Education funding.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para16"></a>Investing in education and skills is one of the key priorities in the executive's programme for government. We therefore welcome the additional £10 million that was found for university research, but we ask that the Lord Privy Seal consider the problems facing Stranmillis College and St Mary's College. Neither has received funding for research. Indeed, under new regulations, they will be marked down in the next review because they do not have research facilities.
<P>


<a name="column_GC14"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column GC14</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para17"></a>The increase in funds for the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is also to be welcomed. It is long overdue and will go a long way to reviving arts and sports across Northern Ireland. We are, however, very disappointed that money has not been made available to meet the need for a film and television commission for Northern Ireland. That is despite the fact that a full economic appraisal and business plan was in place. On the other hand, money was still found for Irish language broadcasts, when there was clearly no immediate need.
<P>

<a name="30210-28_para18"></a>I very much welcome the order and the additional funding that it will bring to the departments in Northern Ireland. However, I trust that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal will be able to assure us that funding will be targeted to where it is most required and that it will bring about long-overdue improvements to Northern Ireland's services and infrastructure.

<A NAME="30210-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I am grateful for the responses that have been given. I could not agree more with the noble Lord, Lord Rogan: these are large sums of money. I agree with him absolutely, as I believe do all Members of the Committee, that we would much prefer the Assembly and the relevant committees to be discussing these matters rather than us.
<P>

<a name="30210-29_para0"></a>The noble Lord is right that there is a substantial increase in funding for education&#151;a matter on which he particularly focused&#151;amounting to 7.3 per cent. In addition to the existing service levels, the budget includes £52 million to increase the core budgets for schools over three years. It provides £19 million for priority curriculum development, £2.6 million for costs associated with a new cross-border centre for autism, and a real-terms increase of £3.8 million for the youth service across the period. However, the noble Lord is right: these are very large sums and they are most gratifying.
<P>

<a name="30210-29_para1"></a>The noble Lord raised a question which frequently arises in relation to England and Wales: will these enormously increased budgets produce real reform? Again, I believe that that should rightly rest with the elected representatives of Northern Ireland in the Assembly.

<a name="30210w01_para1"></a>As the single financial services regulator in the UK, the scope and responsibilities of the FSA are considerable. The work of the FSA will increase significantly when it takes on responsibility for mortgages and general insurance conduct of business regulation in 2004&#150;05. In light of this, it has been decided that the chairman should be supported by a separate chief executive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Crawley: </B>   My right honourable friend the Defence Secretary (Mr Hoon) informed the House on 17 December 2002 (Official Report cols. 45&#150;7WS) in another place of the receipt of a request from the United States Government to upgrade the early warning radar at Fylingdales for missile defence purposes.
<P>

<a name="30210w01_para3"></a>The Government have encouraged parliamentary and public discussion of the issues involved. On 17 October, we informed the House of current work in the US on missile defence and on 9 December published a discussion paper inviting interested parties to contribute their views. We have received a large number of responses both from individuals and organisations, and we have considered all contributions carefully. My right honourable friend the Defence Secretary visited North Yorkshire to explain what the upgrade would involve and to hear at first hand the views of local people. We have engaged in initial discusions with the planning authorities. In a Statement on 15 January (Official Report, cols. 696&#150;99) my right honourable friend the Defence Secretary informed the House in another place of the Government's preliminary conclusion that it was in the UK's interest to agree to the US request. He gave evidence to the Defence Select Committee on the same day and addressed points raised by honourable Members in the defence debate on 22 January in another place. We welcome the Select Committee's conclusion in its report published on 29 January that the UK should agree to the upgrade.
<P>

<a name="30210w01_para4"></a>In the course of these discussions we have been able to clarify that the upgrade essentially comprises computer hardware and software modification and involves no new development or change to the external appearance or power output of the radar; the radar

<FONT SIZE=3>will continue to fulfil its long-established ballistic missile early warning system (BMEWS) role; it will continue to be operated and staffed by the Royal Air Force, and we will continue to enjoy full access to its data; and the upgrade does not of itself commit the UK Government to any greater participation in the US missile defence programme. It does, however, keep open the prospect of acquiring missile defence capabilities for the UK should we desire such protection at some point in the future. We will continue discussions with the local planning authorities on the detail of the upgrade work.
<P>

<a name="30210w01_para5"></a>We are now satisfied that we have been able to take fully into account the views of all interested parties in coming to a decision. We are therefore today replying to the United States Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, conveying the Government's agreement to the US request. We are separately negotiating a technical memorandum of understanding to give British industry the best possible opportunities to win work on the US programme.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  On the basis of internationally agreed scientific principles, the same toolbox of methods is used worldwide to manage the level of exploitation of fish stocks. For example, limiting the catch, or the number and size of vessels and their fishing days, or mesh sizes, minimum sizes and various other gear restrictions. Closed seasons and areas may also help, but this depends on the biology of the fish. The EU management and stock recovery proposals for the North Sea all belong to this family of measures and are similar in concept to those that are applied in many other parts of the world. Successfully managing the international fisheries of the North Sea is particularly difficult, however, because of the numerous fishing nations and methods and the common occcurrence of migratory species of different sizes on the same grounds. Also, some key North Sea stocks have declined to such a low level that despite experiences elsewhere, there is no scientific precedent for reliably predicting how quickly and effectively they can recover, hence the harsh nature of the current scientific advice.

<P>
<UL>Further to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affair's autumn performance report 2002, what steps are being taken to improve the number of sites of special scientific interest in English Nature's control that are failing the public service agreement target; what steps are being taken to improve the areas of sites of special scientific interest under the control of the Ministry of Defence that are failing the public service agreement target; and how soon the hitherto unassessed areas of Crown land will be assessed.[HL1403]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty:  </B>  The Government are committed to their public service agreement target of bringing 95 per cent of sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) in England into favourable condition by 2010. Some public bodies, as major landowners of SSSIs, are important partners in achieving this target. Public bodies have a duty under Section 28G of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. This requires them to "take reasonable steps, consistent with the proper exercise of the authority's functions, to further the conservation and enhancement of the features by reason of which the site is of special scientific interest". By the end of March 2003, the condition of all SSSI land in England, including that owned by the Crown, will have been assessed by English Nature.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210w01_para9"></a>English Nature is directly responsible for 62,000 ha of SSSIs, as owners and managers of a large proportion of national nature reserves (NNRs). Seventy per cent of this area is currently on target. By March 2004, English Nature is committed to increasing this percentage to 80 per cent, and 90 per cent by 2006. Within the NNR management budget, money is specifically targeted at recovery projects to achieve improved condition in NNRs currently failing the PSA target. Through this, for example, fen restoration work has been funded this financial year at Bure Marshes NNR in Norfolk, and next year peat bog restoration work will be funded at Roudsea Woods and Mosses NNR in Cumbria. In 2003&#150;04 over &#163;- million will be spent on recovery projects in NNRs.
<P>

<a name="30210w01_para10"></a>The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is committed to protecting and enhancing SSSIs under its control and is currently working closely with English Nature to review factors affecting MoD SSSIs and to develop an action plan for consideration by the Minister's Environment and Conservation Advisory Group (MECAG) to meet the PSA target. This approach is supported by the joint declaration of intent between the MoD and English Nature signed in July 2002. Action has already taken place to address unfavourable condition on many sites. In the last year, for example, the MoD has been a proactive partner in the EU Life partnership on Salisbury Plain, improving the condition of chalk grasslands, and the Heritage Lottery's Fund Tomorrow's Heathland Heritage, which has enabled improvements to be made to many heathland MoD SSSIs in Hampshire, Dorset and Berkshire. Locally, the MoD has over 120 conservation groups covering the defence estate where statutory bodies such as English Nature, and non governmental organisations such as the RSPB and Wildlife Trusts are standing members. Many projects to improve the condition of SSSIs are carried out under the direction of these groups with funding from the establishment budgets or from the rural elements of the estate strategy (REES) project.
<P>

<a name="30210w01_para11"></a>Defra and English Nature will continue to work closely with the wide range of organisations that can contribute to achieving the PSA target over the period from now to 2010 and beyond.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty:  </B>  The grey squirrel is a long-established invasive non-native species which has impacted significantly on native wildlife and also causes significant economic damage. Article 8(h) of the Convention on Biological Diversity places obligations on contracting parties to take action in respect of invasive non-native species.
<P>

<a name="30210w02_para0"></a>Research was undertaken into the feasibility of using contraception to control the impact of grey squirrels, with input from the Forestry Commission and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, but this was discontinued in 2002 when the results failed to give the partners any promise of a practical application in a reasonable time-frame. Although laboratory trials of the technique had proved encouraging, enclosure and field trials were inconclusive and highlighted the enormous difficulties of putting such a method into practice.
<P>

<a name="30210w02_para1"></a>Further research on contraceptive vaccines is likely to be extremely costly and the Government have no plans to continue it at present. Nevertheless, we retain a strong interest in non-lethal and humane measures for controlling populations of wild animals that cause problems. Government scientists will keep a technology watch on developments that might offer innovative techniques of wildlife management. Departments and agencies involved in wildlife management and woodland protection have to weigh priorities very carefully among the many calls on their research budgets.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Yes. As the noble Baroness knows, the Deputy Prime Minister announced last July that we would be making an additional &#163;350 million available to local authorities over the period 2003&#150;06 to improve the delivery of planning services. We have now decided the basis on which we will distribute this new Planning Delivery Grant in 2003&#150;04 and will be informing recipients of their allocations.
<P>

<a name="30210w02_para5"></a>The grant is being paid out of additional resources from Spending Review 2002. The aim of the grant is to improve the planning system to ensure the effective delivery of our objectives for sustainable communities which we set out in the document Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future. It is specifically targeted towards meeting the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Public Service Agreements 5 and 6. PSA 5 aims to achieve a better balance between housing availability and demand. PSA 6 requires all authorities to have local development frameworks in place (in accordance with agreed local development schemes) and to meet the best value development control targets by the end of 2006&#150;07.
<P>

<a name="30210w02_para6"></a>The amount of grant distributed in 2003&#150;04 is &#163;50 million. It will be paid to local planning authorities, regional planning bodies and the Greater London Authority. The grant is a performance reward grant and rewards local authorities both for improvements towards and achievement of best value development control targets in the period June 2001 to June 2002. Those meeting the development control handling targets both at the start and the end of the year are rewarded separately for consistently high performance. No authority will receive an allocation of less than &#163;75,000 in 2003&#150;04 so that every authority has additional resources to help drive improvement in performance towards the targets. The grant allocations are enhanced for those local authorities within the high housing demand and growth areas identified in the document Sustainable Communities: Building for the future.

<a name="30210w02_para7"></a>Regional planning bodies were notified in December of their share of the &#163;6 million of existing funding which will, from 2003&#150;04, be paid directly to them.

<P>

<a name="30210w02_para8"></a>County councils will not receive direct resources from the grant. The counties' planning functions are being changed under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill currently before Parliament. Subject to Royal Assent, county councils will cease to have a duty to prepare structure plans but their resources will not be reduced accordingly. Therefore, while in some cases counties may need to continue with structure plan preparation over the next year and possibly beyond, given the transitional period set out in the Bill, as this function winds down they will be able to take advantage of freed up resources. It will be important that these freed up resources and the expertise available in county councils are retained and used to deliver other county planning responsibilities and to undertake their function as statutory consultees in the preparation of regional spatial strategies and local development frameworks. Counties can be engaged to conduct work related to regional spatial strategies on an agency basis.
<P>

<a name="30210w02_para9"></a>The criteria for grant allocations have been designed to drive up performance in the delivery of planning functions, both in respect of development control and plan making. Authorities should be aware that they will need to continue to secure improvements in performance in order to receive money in further years. Grant allocations are not ring-fenced and authorities have complete discretion in the way they spend this money. Areas that authorities may consider concentrating on include: contribution to the preparation of regional planning guidance and the future regional spatial strategies; completing current reviews of existing development plans and preparing for the new system of local development frameworks; better resourcing of IT systems; assistance from consultants; outsourcing of certain planning services; increasing staffing levels; training for staff and councillors; supporting mediation services; encouraging a more diverse planning workforce; bursaries for employees to gain planning qualifications and more use of technical staff.
<P>

<a name="30210w02_para10"></a>The amounts payable are shown in the tables below.
<P>

<a name="30210w02_para11"></a>Letters to all leaders of local and county planning authorities, chief executives of the regional planning bodies and the Mayor of London have been laid in the Libraries of the House. They set out the details of each recipient's grant.
<P>

<a name="30210w02_para12"></a>We will be laying a special grant report before the other place shortly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w03_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Amos): </B>  The Government fully share concerns about the plight of street children in Honduras. The rights of children worldwide are a central part of our human rights policy. We maintain a constant dialogue with the Honduran authorities on this issue, as does the EU.
<P>

<a name="30210w03_para0"></a>The UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights produced a report on Honduras which paid particular attention to street children. Together with EU partners we have raised the UN report and our serious concerns about child protection with the Honduran Government and have pressed for further action. President Maduro has announced a programme of action: we are monitoring this closely.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w03_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Windlesham  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Which of the main recommendations made in the review of the Criminal Courts in England and Wales by Lord Justice Auld, and of the sentencing framework by John Halliday, have been incorporated in the criminal justice legislation currently before Parliament or in administrative action.[HL1228]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w03_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor   (Lord Irvine of Lairg): </B>  As this Question covers the work of all three criminal justice departments, I am answering on behalf of my department, the Home Office, and the Law Officers' Department.
<P>

<a name="30210w03_para1"></a>Following extensive consultation with those connected with the criminal justice system and members of the public, in July 2002 the Government published their response to the Auld and Halliday reports in the White Paper, Justice for All, accompanied by an annex, Justice for All&#151;Responses to the Auld and Halliday Reports. The position set out there remains the Government's position for modernising the criminal justice system over the coming years.
<P>

<a name="30210w03_para2"></a>The Government's immediate programme for reform is clearly reflected in the Criminal Justice Bill and the Courts Bill, both currently going through Parliament. In parallel, we are implementing a number of administrative programmes across the three criminal justice departments. The main parts of the programme are as follows:
<P>

<a name="30210w03_para3"></a>Implementation of many of the 55 recommendations in the Halliday Report for review of the sentencing framework for England and Wales: most require legislation and are being taken forward in the Criminal Justice Bill. They include a new sentencing framework, a single generic community sentence, heavier sentences for persistent offending, reforming short custodial sentences, changes to the calculation of remand time, sentencers giving reasons for passing a sentence, licence conditions lasting until the endpoint of sentence, administrative recall to prison, creation of the sentencing guidelines council, and many more.
<P>

<a name="30210w03_para4"></a>Activity relating to a handful of other Halliday recommendations which do not require legislation, including: ongoing research into the effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis of community and custodial sentences; looking into how best to increase public knowledge about sentencing; an accommodation strategy review being undertaken by the National Probation Service (work has begun on two pilots for intermittent custody); improving pre-sentence reports by introducing a research based offender assessment system (OASys); and the setting up of a Home Office implementation team for the new sentencing framework.
<P>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column WA74</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30210w03_para5"></a>Reform of criminal evidence and procedures, reflecting the main recommendations of the Auld report: most of these are included in the Criminal Justice Bill and the Courts Bill. The Criminal Justice Bill includes reforms in eligibility for jury service, trial by judge alone, changes in appeal procedures, giving the police some responsibility for charging, changes in the rules for bail, changes in rules of evidence, and many more.
<P>

<a name="30210w03_para6"></a>The establishment of a National Criminal Justice Board, administratively, to replace all the existing national planning and operational bodies, reflecting other Auld recommendations. We have already simplified and strengthened the present machinery. The Prime Minister established a Criminal Justice System Cabinet Committee to oversee delivery of the Government's policies for the management and reform of the criminal justice system. This is supported by the National Criminal Justice Board, which includes representatives of all the criminal justice agencies, the police, judiciary and CJS Ministers. Local criminal justice boards are up and running in shadow form and are on target to go live in April 2003.
<P>

<a name="30210w03_para7"></a>Legislation to give effect to the Auld recommendations for unified administration of the courts and for court security is being taken forward in the Courts Bill. A programme to create the new agency has been established. Implementation is not expected before April 2005.
<P>

<a name="30210w03_para8"></a>While the Government have not pursued the Auld recommendations for a unified criminal court, we are effecting closer integration between magistrates' courts and the Crown Court through a package of measures in the Courts Bill. These will bring about the same benefits identified by the relevant Auld recommendations.
<P>

<a name="30210w03_para9"></a>Creation of a Criminal Procedure Rule Committee, taking forward the Auld recommendations, is included in the Courts Bill and administrative arrangements to set up a full time secretariat are in hand.
<P>

<a name="30210w03_para10"></a>The trilateral case preparation project to tackle the effectiveness of preparation and progression of cases in all criminal courts from charge to disposal. Many of the proposals reflect Sir Robin Auld's recommendations and are being taken forward administratively. Pilots are to be launched in the spring.
<P>

<a name="30210w03_para11"></a>Judicial personnel issues reflected in the Auld recommendations are being mainly taken forward administratively. They include a national recruitment strategy for lay magistrates to make the Bench more representative of the community it serves (a project board is being set up to take this forward and the strategy will be published shortly); plans to give the Judicial Studies Board a stronger role in magistrates' training (the Courts Bill will result in responsibility for their training reverting to the Lord Chancellor); and setting up judicial appraisal schemes in addition to those in place.

<a name="30210w03_para12"></a>We have not taken up Sir Robin Auld's proposal that we build a new integrated IT system but are pursuing an alternative approach that reflects the same objectives and advantages of integration. We are implementing over the next three years a major IT and business change programme for which &#163;834 million new money has been provided in our SR2002 settlement. Our approach will join together the existing and developing IT systems in a staged development, using an information walkway to link individual systems. This alternative is consistent with our approach to large IT programmes, as set out in the Cabinet Office report Successful IT&#151;Modernising Government in Action. This report strongly recommends a modular and evolutionary rather than a big bang approach to IT systems development and integration. Our approach will make sure that money already invested in IT systems will not go to waste and offers the best balance of benefit, cost and risk avoidance.

<UL>Further to the Written Answer by the Lord Chancellor on 22 January (WA 97), whether by parity of reasoning the system of appointment of Queen's Counsel should be extended, in the interests of consumers, to the appointment of junior counsel; and, if not, why not.[HL1301]<P></UL>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>inappropriate, as with entry to any independent profession, but would provide no added benefit to consumers. My role in the appointment of Queen's Counsel, however, is justified because it helps consumers make the best use of the advocacy services available to them. It provides a quality mark which distinguishes those barristers or solicitor advocates who possess outstanding advocacy, legal and professional skills and are specialists in their chosen field.
<P>

<a name="30210w04_para0"></a>If the noble Lord is instead referring to the appointment of junior counsel to act on behalf of the Government, then such a system already exists. My right honourable and learned friend the Attorney-General appoints two First Junior Treasury Counsels (one Common Law and one Chancery) and four panels of junior counsel to advise and represent the Government in civil cases and seven junior Treasury Counsel to do likewise in criminal cases.

<P>
<UL>
<P>
What progress has been made on the Watchkeeper project on the unmanned aerial reconnaissance vehicle.[HL1583]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w04_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Bach): </B>  The new chapter to the Strategic Defence Review set out the potential for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) significantly to improve operational effectiveness. UAVs will be a key contributor to network enabled capability and their ability to provide persistent surveillance of the battlefield or theatre of operations, without putting aircrew lives at risk has been demonstrated recently by the US in Afghanistan.
<P>

<a name="30210w04_para1"></a>The central element of the UK's current plans for acquiring UAVs is the Watchkeeper programme, which will provide UK commanders with accurate, timely and high quality imagery. Watchkeeper will be an advanced system integrating air vehicles, sensor payloads and ground control facilities. It will be joined <P>


<a name="column_WA78"></a>

<B>10 Feb 2003 : Column WA78</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to the wider command and control network through communication systems such as Bowman, allowing information to be passed quickly, providing commanders with an improved understanding of the battle space and ensuring that military effect can more rapidly be brought to bear.
<P>

<a name="30210w04_para2"></a>Four companies were invited to undertake the first stage of the assessment phase and to propose tenders for the second stage. All four submitted strong bids that demonstrated a good understanding of the programme requirements, the technical complexities and the project management requirements. Following detailed consideration of the proposals, on the basis of value for money and demonstration of the potential to deliver the best capability, we have today selected Northrop Grumman ISS International and Thales UK to take forward the remainder of the assessment phase. The Northrup Grumman team includes BAE Systems, Detica Limited, General Dynamics UK Limited, STAYSYS Limited and Ultra Electronics Limited. Thales (UK)'s team includes Aerosystems International, Elbit Systems Limited and QinetiQ.
<P>

<a name="30210w04_para3"></a>Both selected bidders have indicated that they intend to complete the bulk of work in the UK, although it is too early at this stage to be precise regarding the full extent of the industrial benefits to the UK. These will be explored further in the remainder of the assessment phase, which will culminate by mid-2004 in the selection of a single successful contractor for the demonstration and manufacture phase. As stated in the SDR New Chapter, we remain committed to accelerating the Watchkeeper programe and an initial capability is planned for early 2006.
<P>

<a name="30210w04_para4"></a>The Watchkeeper programme will be complemented by our plans to establish in 2003 a joint service UAV experimentation programme (JUEP). The JUEP will examine the potential of UAVs beyond the bounds of the Watchkeeper programme by enabling personnel of all three services to gain experience of exploiting different UAV systems with different payloads and configurations in a range of conditions.

<P>
<UL>What progress has been made with the appraisal of initial training of recruits across the armed services.[HL1585]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Mr Ingram) announced on 17 October 2002 (Official Report, col. 571) in another place that we had commissioned an appraisal of the initial training of recruits across the armed services and we undertook to publish findings. This appraisal was conducted by two senior officers from outside the personnel area and reported to Ministers. The leader of the study was given a wide-ranging remit and freedom to pursue the study.
<P>

<a name="30210w04_para8"></a>Overall, the appraisal concluded that the department can have considerable confidence in the initial training system. It is administered and staffed by professional men and women with a strong sense of duty and purpose who have proved consistently successful in providing highly effective training for 23,000 recruits a year. Two areas were judged to need addressing. First, the department as a responsible employer needs to continue to ensure that its young people are managed proficiently, treated fairly and given appropriate levels of professional and personal support. Second, the department requires more rigorous assurance mechanisms to provide regular monitoring, to expose risk and to promote best practice. The appraisal concluded that an assurance authority should be established outside the single-service chains of command. Some of these proposals will require extra investment.
<P>

<a name="30210w04_para9"></a>We are today placing in the Library of the House a copy of the appraisal, together with a departmental action plan responding to all of the recommendations and, where action is not already in hand or planned, assigning responsibility for examining the recommendation and taking it forward. The report is also available on the website: www.mod.uk.

<A NAME="30210w04_spmin3"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees   (Lord Brabazon of Tara): </B>  The proposal to establish a new visitor centre is under discussion by domestic committees of both Houses, although I can answer only for the House of Lords. The proposal was considered by the Information Commitee on 8 January and by the Administration and Works Committee on 21 January. Both committees felt strongly that visitor facilities should be located within the Palace and that a location contiguous to Westminster Hall would be the best option. However, the committees were fully aware of the consequences of losing the W Rooms and of the potential impact on the CPA and IPU. The Administration and Works Committee therefore recommended that the House of Lords should give its backing to the scheme "only on condition that satisfactory alternative accommodation was found within the Palace, and that the Committee and those concerned were given an opportunity to examine the alternative before giving final agreement". It is for the authorities of the House of Commons to find such alternative accommodation,and we await the results of their deliberations. In the meantime, the House Committee will consider the conclusions of the Information and Administration and Works Committees on 4 March.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w05_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Filkin): </B>  In July 2000 we announced that we would not be recording postal claims for asylum from persons living in any of the London boroughs and that they would be required to attend for screening before their claim was recorded and processed. Postal applications have also not been accepted in other parts of the country and alternative screening arrangements have been established. Postal claims have, however, continued to be made from some parts of the country: in 2001&#150;02 they accounted for 7 per cent of all asylum claims, and so far in 2002&#150;03 they have accounted for 8.9 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30210w05_para0"></a>As from 8 February, anyone wishing to make an asylum claim will need to do so in person, and postal applications for asylum will no longer be accepted. We expect individuals to make their claim at a port of entry, where they will be screened and any request for support will be considered. Where a person in-country writes in by post, their purported claim will not be recorded. They will instead be advised to apply in person at Croydon or Liverpool. In the very exceptional case where a person is genuinely unable to attend one of these sites, alternative arrangements will be made to ensure that person can be screened and their claim processed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w05_wqn1"></A><B> Lord Acton  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What measures they intend to take to prevent people recognised as refugees elsewhere in Europe from coming to the United Kingdom and making unfounded asylum applications using false identities.[HL1582]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin:  </B>  The Government are fully committed to maintaining effective immigration control and ensuring that access to the asylum process is restricted to those who are in need of protection, as demonstrated by the series of fundamental reforms to the immigration, asylum and nationality system over the past 12 months.
<P>

<a name="30210w05_para2"></a>Intelligence has shown that an increasing number of people who have been accepted as refugees elsewhere in the world are coming to the United Kingdom and making asylum applications in false identities. This undermines the integrity of the asylum process, places an unacceptable burden on the system and diverts valuable resources from those in genuine need. This abuse of the system is made easier as under the provisions of the Council of Europe Agreement on the Abolition of Visas for Refugees the holders of refugee travel documents issued by some 21 countries may travel to the United Kingdom without a visa. We have therefore decided to suspend the operation of that agreement. This will mean that from 00.01 hours on Tuesday 11 February all holders of refugee travel documents will require a visa before coming to the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30210w05_para3"></a>This measure will bring the holders of refugee documents issued by the 21 countries into line with those who hold refugee documents issued by all other countries. This change will not prevent refugees who are settled in other countries and who genuinely wish to visit the United Kingdom from doing so. They will simply be required to obtain a visa before coming here. What it will do is act as a deterrent to those whose sole purpose in coming to the United Kingdom is to abuse our asylum system.

<P>
<UL>Whether it would be possible under existing legislation for (a) the Secretary of State, (b) strategic health authorities, (c) primary care trusts or (d) other bodies within the National Health Service to guarantee the borrowings of National Health Service foundation trusts or whether specific legislative powers would need to be taken in the legislation enabling the creation of National Health Service foundation trusts.[HL1176]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The regime for managing financial failure will safeguard the Secretary of State for Health's overriding priority&#151;that National Health Service patients continue to have access to the healthcare they need, free at the point of delivery. The regime will not underwrite institutions that have failed to deliver under the terms of their service agreements and/or licence. There are no plans to introduce legislation on this matter.

<P>
<A NAME="30210w05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:  </B>  Arrangements for the Prudential Code for NHS Foundation Trusts are set out in paragraph 5.17 of A Guide to NHS Foundation Trusts. Under (a) the NHS foundation trust would not be able to enter into any new borrowing arrangements until its total borrowing fell within its new prudential limits. Under (b) investment plans that required future borrowing have to be deferred until it was prudent to do so.

<P>
<A NAME="30210w06_wqn4"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Before the Privy Council considers the Health Professions Council's proposed rules, whether they consider it satisfactory that no subsections are proposed for chiropody and podiatry; and whether they consider that in these cases profession-specific modalities of care should be distinguished; and[HL1291]
<P>
Whether they consider the Health Professions Council's proposed rules for its register, as they affect titles, should, in the case of chiropody and podiatry, allow for significant differences in the qualifications, knowledge, clinical expertise and experience of registered practitioners, so as to enable the public to differentiate between them.[HL1292]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The aim of registration is to assure the public of the competence of healthcare professionals and, when necessary, to protect them. The Health Professions Council consulted about which titles should be protected by law and has undertaken extensive market research to understand the public's perception of titles currently in use by health professionals. The HPC's decision to propose the protection of both chiropodist and podiatrist reflect the general public perception that these titles are used interchangeably. The HPC believes that the introduction of large numbers of subsections would be confusing and unnecessary. It is for the HPC to propose and the Privy Council to determine the protected titles that will be associated with the parts and subsections of the Health Professions Register.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w06_wqn6"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How the Health Professions Council's proposal for its key decision document that "even where an applicant does not meet the 'three out of five years' rule, they may still be eligible for registration" can be reconciled with the stipulation in the statutory order of a "three out of the previous five years" rule; and whether such a relaxation of the statutory order is in the public interest.[HL1294]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w06_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The Health Professions Order is clear that an applicant may be registered under the transitional provisions in the statutory order by either satisfying the three out of five years rule or by undergoing such additional training and experience that will satisfy the council that the correct standard of proficiency for admission to the relevant part of the register has been attained.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   On 13 December 2001 I said that the council may set up any other committees and panels that it needs. The Health Professions Order 2001 allows the council to set up professional advisory committees to advise the council or its statutory committees on matters affecting relevant professions. It is for the HPC to decide how best to obtain the necessary advice and also the mechanism for supplying it. HPC has decided to propose professional liaison groups on the basis of widespread support obtained during consultation.

<A NAME="30210w07_wqn1"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<P>
What guidance have general practitioners, hospital doctors, accident and emergency staff and other health care professionals in the North West of England received regarding patient treatment in the event of a major biological, chemical or nuclear incident; and what mechanisms are in place to enable these healthcare professionals to implement any such guidance[HL1370]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Since September 11 2001, National Health Service preparations have been stepped up to ensure we are as prepared as we can be in responding to a range of possible new threats such as the deliberate release of chemical or biological agents or incidents associated with radiological or nuclear hazards.
<P>

<a name="30210w07_para1"></a>The NHS has increased its preparedness by stockpiling medical equipment, antidotes, antibiotics and vaccines. The Department of Health has issued specific guidance to the NHS on the public health response to the deliberate release of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) incidents, mass decontamination and mass casualties. A new protective suit has been issued for use by ambulance and accident and emergency staff working on the decontamination of patients.
<P>

<a name="30210w07_para2"></a>The Department of Health has made available through the emergency planning section of its website www.doh.gov.uk/epcu a comprehensive package of guidance for clinicians on dealing with the consequences of deliberate release. This information is regularly updated. The website contains a link to the Public Health Laboratory Service website www.phls.org.uk which provides additional clinical and other information.
<P>

<a name="30210w07_para3"></a>In the North West arrangements for providing effective specialist advice to NHS responders (which include not only hospital and ambulance staff but also general practitioners, community nurses, health visitors, mental health services and pharmacists) are co-ordinated through the Regional Public Health Network, led by the Regional Director of Public Health.
<P>

<a name="30210w07_para4"></a>The network includes a regional health emergency planning team, regional epidemiologists and three zonal health protection units (HPUs), each with specialist staff including consultants in communicable disease control and health emergency planning officers, and is available to NHS responders on a 24-hour basis.

<P>

<a name="30210w07_para6"></a>At the regional level, the health emergency planning team keeps under review all hospital, ambulance service and PCT major incident plans to ensure that they are up to date and that best practice is shared across the region.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:  </B>  We received over 200 written responses to the consultation paper on the Health Protection Agency (HPA). Our decision to proceed with the agency's creation, first as a special health authority and subsequently as a non-departmental public body, takes account of the widespread support for establishing the agency.
<P>

<a name="30210w07_para7"></a>Because the consultation paper set out proposals for creating the HPA by regulatory reform order, it did not simply invite views on general principles but made relatively detailed proposals about the nature of the legislation needed. Many of the responses similarly made detailed points. We are continuing to consider these points in deciding on the details of the legislation to establish the agency. We aim to publish a report on the consultation exercise at the same time as our proposals for changes to primary legislation, since at that stage we shall best be able to show how we have taken into account the detailed points made.

<A NAME="30210w07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Our proposals for the health protection agency (HPA) offer a coherent, co-ordinated and robust approach that will ensure better public health security. We intend that from 1 April 2003 the HPA will support the United Kingdom Government in the same way as the bodies whose responsibilities we propose should transfer to it on that date currently do.

<a name="30210w08_para0"></a>The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has already issued national guidance on the anti-obesity drugs orlistat and sibutramine, treatment with which should be accompanied by appropriate advice on diet, activity and behavioural strategies. NICE has also recently issued guidance on surgery to aid weight reduction for people with morbid obesity.

The effect of the scheme is greatly to increase navigational access and, for the first time, to allow mooring in the heart of the city.

<P>
<A NAME="30210w09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn:  </B>  Both the Northern Ireland Civil Service Commissioners in respect of the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the Civil Service Commissioners in respect of the Home Civil Service are required by their respective Orders in Council to uphold the principle of selection for appointment on merit on the basis of fair and open competition.

<P>
<UL>Whether the Environment and Heritage Service of the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment was consulted about the potential effect the housing development at 10&#150;20 Bangor Road, Holywood, County Down, would have on the Priory Church and the listed houses at Tudor Park; and, if so, what was that advice.[HL1210]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn:  </B>  The Planning Service takes account of a number of factors when considering planning applications and consults the Environment and Heritage Service on any planning applications which may affect a listed building or its setting.
<P>

<a name="30210w09_para10"></a>Following consideration of a range of issues in relation to the development at 10&#150;20 Bangor Road, Holywood, the Planning Service considered that it was not necessary to consult with the Environment and Heritage Service. The issues considered included the separation distances of over 100 metres between the development site and both the Priory and the listed houses at Tudor Oaks, the intervening development and the lack of visual relationship between the properties referred to and the proposed development site.

<A NAME="30210w09_wqn7"></A><B> Lord Laird  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What steps they have taken to protect unlisted buildings in Northern Ireland which are valued by residents as contributing to the character of an area; whether consideration has been given to the removal of VAT on building renovation in contrast to new building work; and whether the increased demands on concentrated development within settlements will result in a change in the criteria for listed buildings.[HL1211]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30210w09_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn:  </B>  The Government are aware of recent public disquiet over the loss or threatened loss by demolition of a number of buildings in Northern Ireland which, while not statutorily listed, were or are valued by local residents because of their age and character and sometimes their associations with noted public figures from Northern Ireland. While such buildings situated outside conservation areas, where control of demolition exists, may not necessarily merit listing, their potential loss often causes great concern to residents. The draft Planning (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2003, currently before Parliament, which contains provisions to extend control over the demolition of buildings to areas of townscape character, will go some way to allay these concerns.
<P>

<a name="30210w09_para13"></a>The order has other provisions in relation to the protection of the historic environment, including higher penalties, possibly involving custodial sentences, for unauthorised demolition of listed buildings and the introduction to Northern Ireland of building preservation notices (i.e. spot listing) to enable the department to respond quickly to protect buildings at risk.
<P>

<a name="30210w09_para14"></a>Strengthened enforcement powers proposed in the order will also apply to listed buildings and buildings in conservation areas and will enable the department to take speedier and more effective action against unauthorised works to the historic environment.
<P>

<a name="30210w09_para15"></a>Development plans, formulated as part of the current development plan programme, may contain proposals for new or extended conservation areas or further areas of townscape character.

<FONT SIZE=3>long-standing formal agreements with our European partners. Under these agreements, we cannot extend our existing zero rates or introduce any new ones. It is therefore not possible to introduce a zero rate for building renovations.
<P>

<a name="30210w09_para17"></a>The department has authority to list buildings of special architectural or historic interest under the Planning (NI) Order 1991 and the criteria for such listing are contained in Annex C (the Selection of Listed Buildings) of Planning Policy Statement 6, Planning, Archaeology and the Built Heritage. The criteria for listing buildings in Northern Ireland are comparable with those used across the UK. The department does not envisage a change in these criteria as a result of increased demands on concentrated development within settlements.
