It is then for primary care trusts to consider whether to fund that treatment, taking into account the available evidence. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has issued interventional procedure guidance on photodynamic therapy for nine cancer indications, including oral cancer.</p>

Does he agree with me that the most important thing, whatever the type of cancer, is early detection? Will he encourage the research that I hear is being done and which we read about in all the newspapers, which entails a very simple blood test that detects cancer at the earliest stage?</p>

<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="1006214000005"></a><b><a name="100621-0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="1006214000288"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My noble friend is absolutely correct. It is now generally agreed that the most important reasons for the lower survival rates in England compared with other European countries are: low public awareness of the signs and symptoms of cancer, delays in people presenting to their doctors, and patients having more advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. We are looking very carefully at how best to achieve earlier diagnosis. There are some key messages on the NHS Choices website and the national awareness and early diagnosis initiative has been under way since 2008. As for my noble friend's second question, on the blood test, the newspaper reports in recent days have been extremely exciting in terms of the potential. However, it is clear that researchers will have to demonstrate improved clinical outcomes for patients before any large-scale rollout can be applied.</p>

<p><a name="st_5"></a>

Given the success of the previous Government in cutting the overall rates of cancer deaths, is he prepared to guarantee that the current investment and screening programme will continue?</p>

<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="1006214000007"></a><b><a name="100621-0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="1006214000290"></a>Earl Howe:</b> The noble Baroness is quite right that screening plays a very important part in the detection of cancer. However, it is not universally applicable to every cancer. In terms of oral cancer, which was the particular subject of my noble friend's Question, there are difficulties. For example, there is considerable uncertainty about how the disease progresses-its natural history-and we cannot predict which lesions will be malignant and which will not. We need clear guidelines-for dentists, for example-and we do not have those. There is also no clear evidence base for the management of malignant lesions when we find them. However, the National Screening Committee will review its position again in about three years' time and will no doubt take all the current evidence into account.</p>

Photodynamic therapy has been very useful not just for oral cancer but for skin cancers of various kinds, particularly squamous cell carcinoma. Does he accept that encouraging not just dermatologists but also general practitioners to move in this direction will mean that we can have specific, non-invasive and generally quite efficient treatment, and that that is to be encouraged by the Government?</p>

<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="1006214000009"></a><b><a name="100621-0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="1006214000292"></a>Earl Howe:</b> I am very grateful to my noble friend. It may help the House if I briefly explain what PDT is.  It is a technique that uses laser or other light sources combined with a light-sensitive drug, which in combination  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1161"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>destroy cancer cells. When the light is directed in the area of the cancer, the drug is activated. As my noble friend indicated, although this is an invasive procedure, it is minimally so; and its advantage is that, unlike radiotherapy, no cumulative toxicity is involved, so someone can be treated with PDT repeatedly. However, there are difficulties, one of which is that there is no obvious clinical leadership in this field, and that has to be addressed. There need to be centres of excellence in order for the right lessons to be learnt and the right research to be done.</p>

<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="1006214000010"></a><b><a name="100621-0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="1006214000293"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> My Lords, there is no doubt that, once patients are at the hospital, they are likely to get the treatment, but can the Minister assure us that GPs will be encouraged to make speedy referrals? In the cases that I know of, the difficulty has been in getting from the GP to the centre of excellence in order to get the treatment.</p>

<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="1006214000011"></a><b><a name="100621-0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="1006214000294"></a>Earl Howe:</b> The noble Baroness is quite right, which is why in the NHS there is such an emphasis on speed of referral when a GP first suspects that cancer may be present in a patient. This is an area to which we are very alive, and I hope that we will be able to make further announcements about it in due course.</p>

Is he prepared to guarantee that this crucial research will continue to be funded by the Government so that more deaths from cancer can be prevented in the future?</p>

This is a partnership effort, and she may know that a systematic review of PDT has been undertaken as part of the Health Technology Assessment programme, which is an element of the National Institute for Health Research. The final report on that will be published in August, but the institute has already identified that there are not enough high-quality research studies in this area. We know from experts in the field that there are at least three or four areas where further research should be prioritised.</p>

At that time its use in medicine could not have been foreseen. Does he therefore accept how important it is to enable universities to continue to do research in this field, in the hope that there will be future inventions, and not to cut them back in this area?</p>

<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="1006214000015"></a><b><a name="100621-0001.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="1006214000298"></a>Earl Howe:</b> The noble Baroness makes a crucial point. I am sure she will agree that neither basic research nor translational research should be neglected when we look at the research effort. Indeed, my own department is looking carefully at how the barriers to clinical research can be reduced. Therefore, she is absolutely right to focus our attention on the importance of continuing research.</p>

What, in  the shorter term, is going to be done to expedite the processes that can often mean that dogs have to be held for many months before a final decision can  be taken by the courts on their disposal?</p>

The Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 is not the only piece of legislation available to local authorities and others dealing with those matters. There is the Dogs Act 1871, the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and the Animal Welfare Act 2006. We will certainly consider carefully the consultation started by the previous Administration and make appropriate decisions afterwards.</p>

Thousands of responsible owners have had their pets destroyed not because of how they behave but because of how they look. Surely new legislation should concentrate on irresponsible dog owners rather than on only the breed.</p>

The ownership and movement of those dogs could be followed by a simple procedure of microchipping. It would also help to identify, as has been mentioned, whether the dogs are dangerous.</p>

I do not think that it would necessarily solve all the problems because those who possess such dogs might not bother to get them microchipped and they would still be in breach of the law. The evidence from abroad is that where there is compulsory microchipping only 50 per cent of the dogs are microchipped.</p>

It can take many months for the police to establish exactly the breed or the type of dog and at enormous cost to public funds. Some of the dogs' homes are considering refusing to take these dogs because of the time taken and the cost to the charities. Is that part of the consultation?</p>

We will certainly want to talk to colleagues in the Ministry of Justice about whether the legal processes can be speeded up so that the dogs need not be kept in kennels for so long.

I urge the Minister and his colleagues not to wait for consideration of the vast Jackson report before taking urgent action to deal with what I think is a scandal, where some fellow members of my profession charge inordinate fees through the conditional fee agreement so that the costs far outweigh any damages that NGOs, individuals or the press may have to pay.

The UK Government, the European Council and the Union well recognise that competitiveness must be improved in parallel with steps that are being taken to deal with the immediate financial situation of a number of member states. I draw my noble friend's attention to the EU economic taskforce under the leadership of the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, which will report to the October Council. As well as dealing with crisis resolution matters, it has competitiveness indicators very much on its agenda. Indeed, it considers competitiveness absolutely in parallel with crisis resolution issues, as well as more broadly as part of the Europe 2020 exercise.</p>

First, to be clear, it is the view of the UK Government that no illegal action has been taken under Article 125 or any of the other relevant articles. On the UK's exposure, we have not as a country participated in the €440 billion special purpose vehicle for assistance. We do, however, participate in the €60 billion finance facility, which is available to any member state under Article 122.2 and which we think strikes an appropriate balance between the eurozone taking primary responsibility for stabilisation within the eurozone and the important part that we have to play as part of the wider EU 27.

The Government have tried to present the Academies Bill now before us as non-controversial, as an extension of Labour policy on academies, and so as something that should be easy for reasonable people on this side of the House to support. It is to be a decentralising measure, devolving more power to local people to run their schools and making a contribution to improving the quality of teaching and learning in schools, with all the benefits to children's life chances and to our wider society that that implies. This Bill is also being presented as a contribution to the big society-the idea which the Conservatives promoted a little in the general election. I suspect that we will hear less about that as we go forward, but nevertheless it is a very interesting idea.</p>

<a name="100621-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="1006214000069"></a>I believe that the Bill is nothing of the sort. We on this side recognise it for what it may well turn out to be-highly centralising, potentially damaging to children's education, damaging to communities, and a device more to establish free schools by the back door.  The Bill does not seek to improve our education system. Instead, it may well be shown that it seeks to make fundamental and damaging changes to it. The Government would not increase the number of  Labour-designed academies, designed when we were

The schools that they would create are not necessarily appropriate to bear the name "academy". That is why we seek to deny that name to these schools. They should be called what they will be: direct maintained schools.</p>

<a name="100621-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="1006214000070"></a>Ministers have spent so many years attacking local government that they have forgotten something about which their own Conservative-controlled Local Government Association has reminded them:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="1006214000238"></a>"Councils don't run schools and haven't done for many years".</p>

<p><a name="1006214000229"></a>That is a quotation from an LGA Bill briefing. Schools run themselves, which is how it should be, but councils do have a range of statutory duties to protect the welfare of children in their area, including a duty to promote,</p>
<ul><a name="1006214000247"></a>"the fulfilment by every child concerned of his educational potential".</ul>
<a name="100621-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="1006214000071"></a>Councils make sure that there are enough school places for all the children who need them, and their top priority is to make sure that the same high standards of education are offered to all students, whether they are taught in a community school or an academy. Councils make sure that the admissions process operates fairly so that every child gets a chance to go to a good local school. They oversee the distribution of funding in conjunction with local schools in a cost-effective way. They provide support for children with special educational needs, something I know that the Committee is concerned about, and they are the champions of children in care.</p>

<a name="100621-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="1006214000072"></a>Far from being non-contentious, there are many issues in the Bill which deserve full scrutiny by the Committee. As the Bill progresses through your Lordships' House, I hope we will be able to demonstrate how potentially retrograde it could be. For now, this group of amendments concentrates on only one issue. It is not a superficial or symbolic point but a very substantive one-that the schools established under the Bill will not be academies but something else entirely, and what they are called should reflect that fact.</p>

<a name="100621-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="1006214000073"></a>The academy scheme put forward by this side of the Committee when we were in government was intended as a means by which schools which were failing too many pupils could be supported quickly, directly and effectively. Some Members of this Committee believe that the schools created under the provisions of the Bill will be comparable to Labour's academies. Nothing could be further from the truth. We need a discussion on terminology in order to highlight what is proposed in the Bill. Is it so new? In reality, it could represent a return to something remarkably similar to the grant-maintained schools of the mid-1990s. So we must first establish what we mean by an academy.</p>

<a name="100621-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="1006214000074"></a>Academies are all-ability, state-funded schools which have sponsors from a wide range of backgrounds, including universities, colleges, educational trusts, charities, the business sector and faith communities. I pay tribute to the contribution that the sponsors have made; it has been absolutely key. Sponsors establish a charity trust which appoints the majority of governors to the academy  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1172"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>governing body. The academy's programme targets areas of inadequate educational attainment and opportunity. Most academies replace existing weak or underperforming schools, and others are brand new schools in areas which need extra school places. They were a key element of the national challenge and took us to a position-from a very low start-where only one in 12 schools fell below the 30 per cent grade A to C benchmark, which half of all schools failed to do under the previous Conservative Government.</p>

<a name="100621-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="1006214000075"></a>Academies are required by law to cater for children of all abilities. The school admissions code which came into force in 2007 applies to all maintained schools and academies when setting their admissions arrangements. Academies must also have regard to the SEN code of practice and statutory guidance on inclusion. An academy is established in collaboration, not confrontation, with the local authority as a means by which extra resources can be freed up to support the most disadvantaged and the weakest. Academies are given new leadership, and some of the best heads in the country have been attracted to run them.</p>

<a name="100621-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="1006214000076"></a>Outside expertise brought in new ideas, new ways of working and a new focus on the best ways to change the culture of learning. Importantly, a role for innovation was acknowledged and, for this reason, academies were obliged to follow the national curriculum only in core subjects such as English, maths, science and information technology. With academy status came a new ethos, perhaps with a renewed focus on discipline, a new uniform and new ways of organising the school day. New buildings frequently provided the focus for this change of ethos and helped to deliver excellent discipline and the best facilities. However, just as important, academies helped to deliver to children a sense of pride in their education; that they should be proud of themselves and proud of their school in return.</p>

<a name="100621-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="1006214000077"></a>The 63 academies which have been open long enough to produce results in both 2008 and 2009 have seen, at the end of key stage 4, an increase of 5 percentage points-up to 34.9 per cent-in pupils gaining five or more A* to C grades at GCSE and equivalent, including English and maths. On the five-plus A* to C measure, the 63 academies improved by 11.7 percentage points, compared with an improvement of 5.4 percentage points nationally. The Minister has recognised the importance of that achievement. A comparison of the 101 academies that had results in 2009 and predecessor results in 2001 shows a 16.4 percentage point improvement in the number of pupils achieving five-plus A* to C, including English and maths, from 17.8 per cent in 2001 to 34.2 per cent in 2009. This compares with an average 11.9 percentage point improvement nationally, from 38.8 per cent in 2001 to 50.7 per cent in 2009. The 101 academies and their predecessor schools have also more than doubled the percentage of pupils achieving five-plus A* to C, from 26.3 per cent in 2001 to 65.2 per cent in 2009. Nationally, the increase is  22 percentage points, from 47.8 per cent in 2001 to  69.8 per cent in 2009. It is important to put these figures on the record. We on this side of the Committee are proud of what was achieved through our academies

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="1006214000078"></a>The most significant difference between the approach of the current Government and that of the previous Government relates to which kinds of school are given the greatest support to become academies. As a group, compared with the average for all state schools, academies have nearly two and a half times the proportion of pupils known to be eligible for free school meals. Academies have had a higher incidence of pupils with English as an additional language than other state-funded schools. By contrast, the present Government propose to implement a reform aimed not at improvements for these schools but at improvements for the 20 per cent of schools already rated as outstanding by Ofsted.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="1006214000079"></a>There are other key differences between these plans and Labour's radical reforms aimed at turning schools around. The Bill offers no extra resources for schools bar a small contribution to the extra paperwork that the school will be required to carry out as a result of this process. It also makes it clear that schools that convert will have to make no changes whatever; they will have no requirement to bring in outside expertise in order to open themselves up to new ideas. They will simply be absolved of any responsibilities to co-operate with the schools around them through, for example, children's trusts or behaviour partnerships, or any of the many other ways in which schools are entitled and encouraged to work together.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="1006214000080"></a>There will be no requirement of the schools to contribute their fair share of education budgets towards the education of children with special needs or behavioural difficulties in their community. Indeed, the funding allocated to educate those children will be cut back to give the academies additional funds to do with as they please. Under the approach adopted by this side of the Committee when in government, an academy was open to all, accessible to all, and intended to challenge and educate those who were most in need of support. Selection was anathema to that system, but some schools, as selective, old-style grammar schools, will now be allowed to convert to academies. By definition, their pupils will be the least likely to need the shared services of the local authority, but will still be in receipt of their share of the funding allocated to their local authority to fund these services. That does not add up. I look forward to being convinced that I have misunderstood all of this.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="1006214000081"></a>We on this side are proud of the achievements of academies. The class of school brought into being by the Bill would be free from "local authority control"-since, as I said, LEAs do not control schools now-but free also from the obligations to their local communities that all schools should have. That is why we do not wish the Bill to use "academies" in its title; it is not as clear as it should be.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="1006214000082"></a>If the Secretary of State would like to create and provide for thousands of schools that are independent of spirit and isolated in operation, he should find his own label for them. He should not use the name "academy". In our amendments, we have suggested that he should use the term "direct maintained school",  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1174"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because that is what he proposes to do-to maintain the schools directly. That is what is being proposed, and that-not academies-is an accurate description of these schools. These are not the type of school that we on these Benches made such a success. A significant and different approach has been used. That difference is significant and should be recognised in the name. I very much look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</p>

<a name="1006214000083"></a><b><a name="100621-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="1006214000352"></a>Baroness Perry of Southwark:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness rightly reminds the House of the accomplishments of the academies that were set up in the past decade. We pay generous tribute to the success of those academies. Because we have been able to observe how strongly they have raised the standards of so many young people, this Government have decided to build on that success and create even more academies and much more quickly.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="1006214000084"></a>I find it very sad that the noble Baroness, who played such a major part in the growth of the academies when her party was in power, should now seek to denigrate the attempt that is being made to spread that much more widely. I will not attempt for a moment to answer all of the very many questions that she asked and the very many criticisms that she directed at the policy, but at one point she asked whether she had misunderstood. I would like to pick on one particular area where she has misunderstood. It is perfectly true that the intention is to allow those schools that are rated outstanding by Ofsted to come through on a fast track, but the main thrust of the policy is exactly as it has been before: to establish academies in those places with the least successful schools-the most failing schools in the most deprived areas-so that the standards for those children who have been educationally so poorly served can be greatly improved. That is a misunderstanding.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="1006214000085"></a>I realise that it is a common misunderstanding because I have had it said to me by many people and many friends in the education service over the past few weeks. I am sure that my noble friend will underline the fact that it is important to recognise that just because there is a fast track for outstanding schools, it does not mean at all that schools that are educationally failing so many of their young people are not still the main focus of our policy in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_69"></a>

She makes a good case for keeping on academies. Even though one or two of them have not done quite so well, most of them have. However, she did not make any case for not allowing other schools to have the freedoms that her Government felt were so important to give to schools that needed to improve. That is what this Bill does. My breath was taken away to hear her comments about centralisation given the track record of the new Labour Government.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="1006214000087"></a>At first glance, the amendments look as though they are about labels. I have always been of the view that a label should say what is in the tin. Indeed, in the Liberal Democrat policy paper about our version of  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1175"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1175</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>academies, we decided to call them exactly what was in the tin, which was "sponsor-managed schools". Our version of academies was slightly different from the one that we are considering today, but now we are in coalition.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="1006214000088"></a>Indeed, the amendments would return us to the new Labour version of academies. In particular, Amendments 39 and 40 would remove the ability of outstanding schools to apply for academy status. When the Labour Government first introduced academies, we on the Liberal Democrat Benches asked why other schools should not have the same freedom to innovate as was being offered to these schools. We believe strongly in the importance of the professionalism of teachers, and schools have a duty to provide a curriculum that is appropriate to their particular cohort of students. Most schools actually do not use the range of freedoms to innovate that they were given in legislation passed under the previous Government. We are very much in favour of allowing professionals to innovate and provide appropriate education for their children. Those sort of freedoms should be given to all schools, but I can understand why my noble friend wants to approach first those schools that have already proved the professionalism of their leadership and their staff by becoming outstanding, to allow them to run with those freedoms and use them well in providing a good education for children. There is a lot of logic in adding to the cohort of what were failing schools, which will now get special attention under the academies scheme, those schools that have already demonstrated that they can provide an outstanding education, and in giving them the freedoms that the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, introduced in the first place.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="1006214000089"></a>I do not support any of these amendments. They are not just about labels, of course. They are about removing a very important group of schools from the Bill.</p>

As it stands, the Bill encourages her in the line that she has taken. However, as I look through the amendments tabled for us to debate in Committee, I see real potential-if the Minister is minded to accept some of them-for the Bill to enable us to recognise clearly the family resemblance between the new wave of academies and the ones that are now in existence. I await with interest the way that this debate develops. At the moment, I would find it quite easy to support the amendments, but I hope that I will find it very difficult by the end of this process.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="1006214000093"></a>My noble friend Lady Morgan raised a number of policy issues about the extension of academies, which I shall leave the Minister to respond to. However, on the specific issue about the legal name that should be given to a certain category of school, I find myself in surprising agreement with the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. She and I are survivors from the interminable debates on the Education Act 2005, on which our views did not coincide all the time, particularly on the issue of academies. But she is right that, in terms of legal category, the schools to which the Bill proposes to accord that status have all the essential characteristics of existing academies.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="1006214000094"></a>I know that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet but, for two reasons, I do not support this amendment on the name that it gives to a legal category of schools. First, the schools which we are talking about in this Bill are academies in all their essential legal characteristics. They are managed independently of the local authority, on a contract with the Secretary of State that regulates a whole host of their policies and funding and which will be similar to that of existing academies. My noble friend says that academies are schools largely in deprived or challenging circumstances, and she is correct, although I need to point out to the House that that is not the exclusive preserve of academies. A number of entirely new schools have been set up as academies in very mixed social areas and a number of successful schools, including successful independent schools, have come into the state system by using the legal category of academies.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="1006214000095"></a>The legal status is clearly set out in Section 65 of the Education Act 2002, which is cast in similar terms to Clause 1. I emphasise the fact that the 2002 Act, which was passed by the last Government, does not specify that academies, in legal terms, can only be schools that pass a threshold either of deprivation or of low achievement. On the contrary, I invite Members of the Committee to look at Section 65, which says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="1006214000239"></a>"The Secretary of State may enter into an agreement with any person under which ... that person undertakes to establish and maintain, and to carry on or provide for the carrying on of, an independent school in England with the characteristics mentioned in subsection (2)".</p>

<p><a name="1006214000230"></a>Those characteristics are that the school,</p>
<ul><a name="1006214000248"></a>"has a curriculum satisfying the requirements of section 78 of the Education Act 2002",</ul>
<p><a name="1006214000231"></a>and that it,</p>
<ul><a name="1006214000249"></a>"provides education for pupils of different abilities who are wholly or mainly drawn from the area in which the school is situated".</ul>
<p><a name="1006214000232"></a>Those provisions are almost identical to those in the Bill.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1177"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1177</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100621-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="1006214000096"></a>If there is no legal distinction between the schools that we are talking about in this Bill and those referred to under the Education Act 2002, is there another public policy reason for us to give a different label to certain schools within a similar legal category? I urge your Lordships not to do so. We already have an alphabet soup of different names for schools within the state system: community schools, foundation schools with a foundation, foundation schools without a foundation, voluntary aided schools, voluntary controlled schools, trust schools, city technology colleges, grammar schools, maintained special schools and non-maintained special schools. If the schools that we are talking about are academies, as they are in their essential legal characteristics, the right thing to do is to call them academies and not to add to the alphabet soup.</p>

He was a most excellent Schools Minister and was largely responsible for the success of the academies programme. As the Minister said, the party opposite has every right to be proud of what it achieved. I also praise the noble Lord for starting off his life as a Back-Bencher exactly as I hope he will continue, feeling free to disagree with his Front Bench. As my noble friend Lord Hill will discover, feeling free to criticise one's own side when one feels that it is getting it wrong is the mark of respect that every Back-Bencher seeks to attain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="1006214000098"></a>I feel that the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, although she was in turn an excellent Minister, is getting it wrong. It was always inevitable that the academies programme, once it had proved itself and gained momentum, would be open to existing schools. The idea that schools have to fail in order to become academies is not tenable. The substance of the amendment is political phooey and should be disregarded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="1006214000099"></a>The noble Baroness raised a number of points that I suspect I will agree with later-or at least I will share her concerns. This is a new phase for the academy movement and it raises questions which were left in abeyance when the academies were few and had strong sponsors but which need examining now. However, a change of name, with further confusion for parents and everybody else, is not required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="1006214000101"></a>I have never particularly liked the name "academy" for a school, despite my respect and affection for my noble friend Lord Adonis. To me, the term has always meant a Scottish secondary school, the garden where Plato taught or, as in the Brixton Academy, a nightclub. As I understand it, we are talking about names that have legal and constitutional significance. No doubt we will tease out some of these legal and constitutional

My noble friend is right. If these apply to what are called direct maintained schools-in other words, if they have to obey the rules I have just mentioned-the name should be looked at again. Could the noble Lord please spell out-I am sure he will-the differences between the name "academies", as referred to in the Bill, and other kinds of school which now exist, and tell us why the name should not be changed?</p>

<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="1006214000102"></a><b><a name="100621-0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="1006214000358"></a>Lord Bates:</b> I totally support the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, about the name. The name "academies" followed from the creation of the city technology colleges. Although the city technology colleges were a wonderful idea in the Education Reform Act 1988, the name was a bit of a mouthful and did not describe well what those fine institutions sought to achieve. When the Learning and Skills Act 2000 first made provision for city academies, it was a clarification. In Greek learning, an academy is a place of high education and research. That is exactly the type of name and message that one wants in our education environment. However, the term "city academies" was then changed. The "city" part was dropped, which in many ways makes the point that the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, was presenting. At that point, in the 2002 Act, when city academies were replaced by the concept of academies, there was a distinct intention that the academy movement should be broadened. I think that is right. Therefore, what is being proposed by the Government is also right.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="1006214000103"></a>I make another point in support of my noble friend Lady Perry, who spoke about the Bill's role in tackling failing schools. Clause 4 covers academy orders, which are directly targeted at the failure which exists within many local authority areas. The noble Baroness may have mentioned from the Front Bench that it is almost a divine right that every child in a local authority area will have access to good quality education. However, we know for a fact that that is not happening. That is why the Bill is necessary.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="1006214000104"></a>I register an interest as a former director of four academies. The other point is that the existing academies were invariably quickly oversubscribed. The notion that they were open to all was, again, not true. That is why we need a big expansion of the programme. We also need new schools. The other point was about ability. As I recall, there was certainly a provision, which still exists, to say that the academies could select up to 10 per cent of their pupils on the basis of aptitude in the school's specialism. Again, that element is there. I see that the Bill has merely continued that.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="1006214000105"></a>The amendment probably falls into the category of "brave try". As a former Shadow Front Bench spokesman, I know that brave tries are our lot on life. However, the term "academy" is a sound one, which should continue and be extended.</p>

We have already seen remarkable progress being made in our first academy situated in an area of great deprivation. Within four years, the Academy of St Francis of Assisi has gone from 27 per cent to 66 per cent of its pupils gaining five GCSEs at Grades A to C. The one thing that I have learnt from the academy experiment-it is now more than an experiment as it is well established-is that children's performance is improved through investing in the training and performance of teachers. There is a direct correlation between the performance of teachers and that of pupils. This surprised me, even though I began my professional career as a teacher. Investment in the head, the senior management team and the teachers in academies has made a remarkable contribution to improving people's life chances, especially in deprived communities.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="1006214000108"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, is right that under the previous Administration there was a shift from the original intention, which was to break the mould of education in deprived communities, but the policy has broadened out and schools have benefited. In the context of Liverpool, the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, made a powerful point. The Government may resist her amendment and stick with academies, but I hope that they will share the aspiration of the previous Administration to change the nature of education in our deprived communities-whatever name we choose, that is what is at stake-as the academy programme has shown that we can do that. If the Government persist with the title "academy", I hope that they will also persist with the ambition to improve the life chances of young people in our most deprived areas.</p>

Legal status and legal titles are exactly that, but at the end of the day they are not the mark of success or failure in our education system. We may disagree on whether legal status is the measure that raises standards or whether it is something other than that. I very much agree with the previous speaker that standards are raised through the quality of teaching and of leadership rather than through legal status or title. However, whatever the relevant legal status was under the previous Government, the fact was that most of the effort and resources were put into the areas of greatest deprivation. I believe that is what academies should do. Once you spread the size of the club, you make it less special and you are not able to devote the same expertise to the schools that need it most. That is the decision that the Government have to make. In that respect, I wish to ask a very specific question about the impact assessment. On page two, it is estimated that over four years the net benefit will be £1.72 billion. I am surprised at that. The relevant figure is £282 million a year. The impact assessment states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="1006214000240"></a>"Benefits are in terms of the increase in estimated lifetime earnings of the additional number of pupils attending academies and obtaining improved GCSE results ... Evidence for impact of academies on pupil attainment is based on evidence from academies that opened before 2006".</p>

<p><a name="1006214000233"></a>I find that very strange and would welcome an explanation of it. The schools that became academies before 2006 were situated in challenging areas. They were often

The minute they got the chance, their grades improved, and over 12 to 24 months some schools went from fewer than 20 per cent of their pupils getting five A to C grades to as high a figure as 40, 50 or 60 per cent. The Government have decided to concentrate their effort, time and resources on outstanding schools, which may already have 90 per cent of their pupils getting five A to C grades, including English. Given that evidence, I am surprised at the impact assessment and the amount of money that is quoted. The maximum improvement that schools could make would be to increase from 90, 91 or 92 per cent to 100 per cent of all pupils. I like to think that I am an optimist in life, but I am surprised at how that could create a net benefit to the Exchequer and the nation of £1.72 billion over four years.</p>

<a name="100621-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="1006214000110"></a>I have a further question on that. The figures relate to lifetime earnings. What measures or mechanisms are Ministers using, and in which years of these young peoples' lives might that money accrue to the Treasury?</p>

I accept that the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, has a certain logic on her side, but I do not like the logic. I rather take the point made by the right reverend Prelate-at least I think it was his point-that, whereas academies hitherto have been for underachieving and underprivileged communities, henceforth they will, as far as I can see, be at the other end of the educational spectrum. I actively dislike the prospect that they would be called something different, as if to emphasise that they are of a different "class"-a ghastly word. I like the idea of these posh new future academies being linked to the existing ones.</p>

That is the aim we should go for. I am delighted that we have had this debate. I did not consider that it would begin our debates on the Bill, but it has totally confirmed my view that, as the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said, we need to get away from this mishmash-this alphabet soup, as the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, called it-and stick to one name. Then we can get on with the business of looking at the many detailed amendments which will ensure that the Bill will achieve its purpose. We should vote here and now for the use of the name "academies"-and no other name for the way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="1006214000115"></a>Once the Bill was announced, one of our successful-indeed, our most successful-church secondary schools made a bid to become an academy.

I have been a supporter of the academies since they began.

I want to ask the Minister one quick question, which may well fall within the ambit of later amendments. I recently met a social worker, whose job is to work with and support a number of schools in the local area. I also spoke fairly recently to a head teacher, who said how helpful it was to have a social worker support her in what she does. Therefore, I would appreciate an assurance from the Minister that in this legislative process we are not going to make it any more difficult for that sort of set-up to carry on working.</p>

Before I do so-perhaps with the words of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Lincoln ringing in my ears at the beginning-I should say that I know that the whole point of Committee stage is for us to tease out misunderstandings and to try to get clarity on various issues as we go forward. I am committed to doing that during this process and shall do my best to do so in the days ahead.

I was even more perplexed when over the weekend I read the 2005 White Paper, <I>Higher Standards, Better Schools for All</I>, which clearly argued for the extension of academy freedoms. As I think we mentioned at Second Reading, the day before the launch of the White Paper, the then Prime Minister was even more explicit. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="1006214000241"></a>"We need to make it easier for every school to acquire the drive and essential freedoms of Academies ... We want every school to be able quickly and easily to become a self-governing independent state school ... All schools will be able to have Academy style freedom".</p>

<p><a name="1006214000234"></a>That, in general terms, is what the Academies Bill makes possible.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="1006214000119"></a>I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, argued that using the name "academy" for all schools converting to the programme might in some way dilute the original intentions, and she specifically mentioned grant-maintained schools. These were quite different, not least because they got additional funding and operated effectively outside the system, which is not what is proposed with academies. She spoke about the policy now being for outstanding schools, rather than the original focus of the policy, which was, she said, on the most challenging schools. That point has already been picked up by my noble friend Lady Perry. I know that there has been a lot of comment about this and I am sorry if I did not do a better job in explaining it at Second Reading. The fact is that the focus on failing schools remains and, if anything, is strengthened because the Secretary of State will be able to act more decisively without local authority consent, should that be necessary.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="1006214000120"></a>Secondly, in line with what we believe was the previous Government's intention, all schools will be able to apply for academy status, should they want to. In other words, the outstanding schools are simply a sub-set of all schools. I hope that that provides some reassurance on the point made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool. In what we propose, there is no intention that the generality of schools should be excluded from the chance to take part in this programme. Because those schools are outstanding, we believe that conversion for them should be relatively straightforward, and therefore we are saying that, if they want to convert, they should be able to go first. They would not have to have sponsors, but all other converting schools would.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="1006214000121"></a>My main argument in resisting the amendment has already been made for me by my noble friend Lady Walmsley and the noble Lord, Lord Adonis. I am particularly sympathetic to what was described as alphabet soup-what I think of as Alphabetti Spaghetti-in that, as a new Minister trying to get my head round the descriptions of all the different kinds of schools, the thought of having one more to learn would be almost intolerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="1006214000122"></a>The reason we believe the new wave of academies should be called academies is, precisely as the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said, because they are set up on the same legal basis as an existing academy with the same freedoms, duties and responsibilities. Perhaps it would help if I set those out briefly. Academies are publicly funded independent schools which do not charge the pupils to attend the school. They are not maintained by the local education authority but receive funding directly from the Secretary of State. Their curriculum must be balanced and broadly based with an emphasis on their secondary curriculum on a particular subject area. They must provide education for pupils of different abilities drawn wholly or mainly from the local area of the school. They must not charge pupils to attend the school and they can be for any age range since the Education Act 2002.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="1006214000123"></a>I understand the intention behind Amendment 39: to ensure that only schools classed as failing could convert to academy status from September 2010. In fact, the way in which the amendment is drafted, listing it as a characteristic of an academy, would have the unintended consequence of making it an obligation on the academy proprietor to ensure that the academy met that characteristic, which I cannot believe was the noble Baroness's intention. However, I shall address the substance behind the amendment. While our focus will remain on failing schools and narrowing the attainment gap, we want the best schools to have the freedom and flexibility to deliver an excellent education in the way that they see fit, within a broad framework where they are clearly accountable for the results that they deliver. These schools, as we have discussed before, will be expected to work with a weaker school to share expertise and best practice. Many school leaders have already shown a keen interest in their schools becoming academies. It is clear that they understand the benefits that that will bring and they want the liberation that comes from genuine independence.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="1006214000124"></a>While I understand the thinking behind the amendment, in order that the academy programme simply maintains its focus on failing schools, I hope that the noble Baroness will be reassured that our expansion of the academies programme will not dilute in any way our focus on failing schools. On the contrary, by saying that all outstanding schools will be expected to partner with a weaker school we hope to bring about further improvements for all concerned.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="1006214000125"></a>Amendment 40 would require all schools converting to academy status from 2010 to have a sponsor in place with whom to work. It is our intention that all maintained primary, secondary and special schools will be able to apply to become an academy, with schools rated outstanding being fast-tracked for approval. These outstanding schools will have a proven track record of success so will not be required to have a sponsor in place and will, in effect, be self-sponsoring. They will be able to work with a sponsor should they choose but there is no requirement to do so. Other primary, secondary and special schools which will be able to convert at a later stage will still be required to have a sponsor, with the final decision on which schools become academies resting with the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="1006214000126"></a>Our focus remains on failing schools and narrowing the gap, but in our view it is also right that our best schools should have the freedom and flexibility to deliver an excellent education in the way they see fit within a broad framework where they are clearly accountable for the outcomes they deliver. I think that there has been general acceptance on all sides of this House that the definition of an academy and its legal status is broadly accepted. Academies set up by the noble Baroness's party have done a great job. This is a logical next step in our view and an expansion of what has gone before. It was clearly the original intention in 2005 to move in the direction that this Government, five years late perhaps, are starting to do. I hope that that detail has clarified why the amendments are not necessary and I therefore urge the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="1006214000130"></a>This debate has been helpful and interesting. I am interested in the point about academies as defined in the Bill being exactly the same as academies defined in previous legislation. Thinking about why we need the Bill focuses on the questions: what is the difference and what is the real motivation behind the Bill? Like the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester, I want to be convinced, and hope that I will be as we go through Committee. I know that an awful lot of thought has gone into a wide range of amendments.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="1006214000131"></a>I have one question, which I hope I will learn more about in our debates today. If academy status will be exactly the same legally, I need to understand what Clause 1(2)(b) is all about. When we come to the Statement on free schools, I might understand that a bit more. Like all noble Lords, I do not see the benefit of increasing the number of letters in our alphabet soup. I am very interested in the comments that noble Lords have made. I have just learnt that outstanding schools will not be expected to have a sponsor, but those that come after will. That is a very interesting point.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="1006214000132"></a>I was also very interested in the point made by my noble friend Lady Morris about the focus of government policy. That highlights the challenge that we have when scrutinising legislation. We are looking at the Bill, but surrounding the Bill is government policy and how the Government promote their priorities. I am concerned that the Government continue to focus on poorly performing schools and coasting schools. I am very much comforted by the Minister's reassurances on that, but we will come back to the question of what the additional arrangements for academy financial assistance actually mean and whether that is a significant change in the legal instruments surrounding the legal definition of academies. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="1006214000133"></a><b><a name="100621-0004.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="1006214000369"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord Hill of Oareford):</b> My Lords, I beg leave to repeat in the form of a Statement the Answer given by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State to an Urgent Question in another place. The Statement is as follows.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="1006214000134"></a>"Thank you, Mr Speaker, for this opportunity to update the House on our progress in reducing centralised bureaucracy in the education system, giving more power to professionals on the front line and accelerating progress on the academies programme begun, with such distinction, under the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, and Tony Blair.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="1006214000135"></a>During the Queen's Speech debate, I outlined in detail our plans to extend academy freedoms. I mentioned then that we had more than 1,000 expressions of interest. I can now update the House by confirming that more than 1,700 schools have expressed an interest in acquiring academy freedoms, with more than 70 per cent of outstanding secondary schools contacting the department-a remarkable and heartening display of enthusiasm for our plans from front-line professionals.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="1006214000136"></a>As I have explained before, every new school acquiring academy freedoms will be expected to support at least one faltering or coasting school to improve. We are liberating the strong to help the weak-a key principle behind this coalition Government.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="1006214000137"></a>As well as showing enthusiasm for greater academy freedoms in existing schools, I can also report to the House that teachers are enthusiastic about the opportunities outlined in our coalition agreement to create more great new schools in areas of disadvantage. More than 700 expressions of interest in opening new free schools have been received by the charitable group the New Schools Network, the majority of them from serving teachers in the state system who want greater freedom to help the poorest children do better.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="1006214000138"></a>That action is all the more vital because we are inheriting a school system from the previous Government which was as segregated and stratified as any in the developed world. In the last year for which we have figures, out of a school cohort of 600,000 children, 80,000 children were in homes entirely reliant on benefits. Of those 80,000 children only 45 made it to Oxbridge-less than 0.1 per cent-and, tellingly, fewer than from the school attended by the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="1006214000139"></a>Given that scale of under-achievement and lack of social mobility, it is no surprise that so many idealistic teachers want to start new schools like those American charter schools backed by President Obama that have closed the achievement gap between black and white children. In order to help these teachers do here what has been achieved in America, and in order to help philanthropists, community groups and parents set up new schools, we announced last week that we would recreate the standards and diversity fund for schools started by Tony Blair and abandoned under his successor. We are devoting £50 million saved from low-priority IT spending to this fund, which is less than 1 per cent of all capital spend allocated for this year, and we are

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="1006214000140"></a>Five years ago, the Prime Minister said outside this House:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="1006214000242"></a>"What we must see now is a system of independent state schools, underpinned by fair admissions and fair funding, where teachers are equipped and enabled to drive improvement, driven by the aspirations of parents".</p>

<p><a name="1006214000235"></a>We have pushed higher standards from the centre. For those standards to be maintained and built upon, they must now become self-sustaining to provide irreversible change for the better. That is the challenge Mr Blair laid down, and this coalition Government intend to meet it".</p>

<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="1006214000141"></a><b><a name="100621-0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="1006214000370"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Answer to this Urgent Question from the other place. I have a number of questions to ask him, but before I do, I want to make the point that this Urgent Question followed a press release issued by the Minister's department on Friday about the process for progressing the coalition Government's free schools policy. Just a moment ago, we were in Committee looking at the Academies Bill, and it would be very helpful for the House if we could understand how the Government's different policies and priorities fit together so that when we are scrutinising the legislation we have a full picture of what the Government are trying to achieve. It was therefore a bit of a disappointment that the Secretary of State for Education chose to announce the process for progressing the free schools policy in a press release on Friday when we could have heard more about it in this House. However, the Minister has repeated the Statement to the House, which I very much appreciate.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="1006214000142"></a>We have heard a great deal from the coalition Government about the challenging economic times that we are in. We on these Benches recognise that and the real challenge of having to make cuts in the near future. How will these new free schools be paid for? The <I>Guardian</I> suggested, possibly on Friday, that funding from the previous Government's proposals to widen access to free school meals will be used to pay for the new free schools policy. Will the Minister explain what assessment has been made of surplus places? Surplus places might not be a very cost-effective way of funding school places. Indeed, creating surplus places through the development of a free schools policy could be quite an inefficient way of using what will be scarce resources.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="1006214000143"></a>I believe that the coalition Government are keen to broaden the number of providers that deliver education through the free schools model, and I am interested to know whether the coalition Government envisage new providers coming into education being able to make a profit from using public funds to develop free schools, or whether, under some enterprise model, any surplus that was generated through the use of public funds would be ploughed back into public benefit.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="1006214000144"></a>I was quite interested on Friday to see a little box on the form on the website that has enough space for 200 words that are designed to show what parental  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1187"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>demand there is for a new free school. For the benefit of those who are interested in taking forward an idea such as this, will the Minister say what he is looking for in those 200 words that will give a really good picture of parental demand? Will there be published criteria? I know that the Secretary of State will have to look at each of these applications, and I understand that there have been many expressions of interest. When the Secretary of State looks at these 200 words, over breakfast on Sunday morning perhaps, what will he be looking for to assess parental demand?</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="1006214000145"></a>There is also a space on the form to set out the premises that have been identified or to say what the premises would be like. The Minister mentioned planning requirements when he repeated the Statement, and I am interested to know how any legislation on this will work. Again, what is required in the box about premises? Will the new free school have disabled access, for example, or will a car park, office block or corner shop work just as well?</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="1006214000146"></a>How will local authorities be involved? The Secretary of State for Education said very clearly in a letter that he sent to directors of children's services that there would be a role for local authorities in that local authorities are central to the Government's plans to improve education. It would be very helpful to understand what that vision is in relation to free schools.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="1006214000147"></a>It is also interesting that the coalition Government have made strong statements about a commitment to fairness in approach. How will the admissions code, which I think is all about fairness for children's educational opportunities, work in the free school setting? How will vulnerable children and those with special educational needs, about whom this House cares very much, be catered for? I am aware that I have asked a lot of questions, but it is important that this House hears from the Minister the vision and the practicalities of how it will work.</p>

<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="1006214000148"></a><b><a name="100621-0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="1006214000371"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> My Lords, I will try to answer all the questions raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Drefelin. On her first point, no disrespect to this House was intended. The view was taken that this was an announcement about practicalities. The principle of the policy had previously been announced and had been long trailed. Over many years it was in the Conservative Party manifesto and it features in the coalition agreement. As the noble Baroness knows-we will be discussing it in Committee over the next three days-free schools will be set up as academies under the Academies Bill. They will have the same framework, rights and responsibilities as the academies that we have just been discussing in our first group of amendments in Committee. The view was taken that this was a practical implementation and a first step of policy rather than a new policy announcement.</p>

<a name="100621-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="1006214000149"></a>On the point fairly made by the noble Baroness about the challenging economic times, perhaps I may reassure her about the modest funding for what is, in effect, a series of pilots that we will look at over  the next year to see how this policy works out. The £50 million will not come from free school meals pilot money. As the Statement in the other place made clear, the department is basically recreating a programme  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1188"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1188</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which the noble Baroness may know-the standards and diversity fund. The money has come from the harnessing technology grant. Therefore, as the Statement made clear, it has come from money that was put aside for IT, not from free school meals.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/100621-0005.htm"/>


<a name="100621-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="1006214000150"></a>As regards the noble Baroness's question about profit, the school or trust must be non-profit making. As now under existing legislation, a school can subcontract to a provider of a service, which, if a commercial operation is providing that service, will charge what it needs in order to make a profit and a living. As now, the school cannot make a profit. There is nothing here which will enable free schools to be profit-making schools.</p>

<a name="100621-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="1006214000151"></a>As the noble Baroness will understand, parental demand, and the Secretary of State's breakfast, is work in progress. We have made clear that a demonstration of parental demand might be, for example, a petition. An interested party can make the application and then work with an official in the department who will work up the detailed application. As part of that process, some of the noble Baroness's fair questions on how these things will be demonstrated will be worked through.</p>

<a name="100621-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="1006214000152"></a>On premises, revised planning guidance will be issued by CLG in due course, which should free up and remove a lot of the bureaucratic systems that currently make the establishment of a school for anyone extremely difficult to countenance. The noble Baroness's point about precisely what the requirements will be needs to be worked through.</p>

<a name="100621-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="1006214000153"></a>On the role of local authorities, I have somewhere another letter-we in the department are busy writing letters at the moment-written by the Secretary of State to local authorities specifically on the free schools announcement, which is subsequent to the previous letter to which the noble Baroness referred. It makes clear that part of the process under which he will judge the criteria for whether an application to be a free school should be able to go forward will include consultation with the local authority.</p>

<a name="100621-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="1006214000154"></a>The admissions code for free schools will work just as the code for academies because the free schools will be set up under the academies legislation. All the safeguards and requirements that were put in place for academies will apply to free schools. That remark also applies to the noble Baroness's final and extremely important point about vulnerable children. All the safeguards, particularly with regard to vulnerable children and SEN issues, which will be discussed at greater length as we go forward with the Academies Bill, will be in place.</p>

If I may say so, that is a very good direction to be moving in. But can he offer me a reassurance on the issue of stratification? There is some risk that if a significant minority of schools opts neither for academy nor free school status, many teachers will vote with their feet and go to work in  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1189"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>these good schools. That might mean that pupils who would most need and would benefit from good teaching will actually be denied the best teachers because they will be in these other schools.</p>

<a name="100621-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="1006214000156"></a>Elsewhere, the Government have proposed the introduction of independent social work practices in the style of GP practices and legal firms. Although this has been warmly welcomed by social workers who like the idea of running their own business and not being interfered with by local authorities so much, a respectable and experienced director of social services pointed out to me that if there is one service only for children with care orders, there is a danger that all the best social workers from the surrounding fields will want to work in that area and would be creamed off. We need social workers to support families where the children are not taken into care.</p>

<a name="100621-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="1006214000157"></a>My second question is brief. Can the Minister assure the House that the complexity of taking forward these new measures will not distract him from maintaining a strong focus on the continuing professional development of our teachers and introducing the master's in teaching and learning? This point was stressed by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester.</p>

<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="1006214000158"></a><b><a name="100621-0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="1006214000373"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> I am grateful to the noble Earl and hope I can give him the reassurances he seeks. On the broad point about fears of stratification-which I am sure we will come back to as we debate the Academies Bill more generally-I understand the anxiety, but I think that quite a lot of it is misconceived. I say that because on Friday, when the department made the announcement on free schools, I was lucky enough to meet beforehand a number of the teachers and teacher groups who are most interested in taking free school status forward. I have to say that those teachers could not in any way be characterised as people who are looking for a quiet life and want to teach in a leafy suburb, or who want to turn their back on vulnerable children. They formed an extraordinarily impressive and passionately committed group of people whose reason for going into teaching-some through Teach First and some through the Future Leaders programme which, much to their credit, were set up by the previous Government, who I will load with laurels as often as I can as regards those two wonderful programmes on which we want very much to build-arises out of a strong sense of social commitment. I found it immensely reassuring that those teachers see this legislation as enabling them to do more for the neediest, most vulnerable and most left behind children.</p>

<a name="100621-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="1006214000159"></a>On the issue of CPD and the master's, as the noble Earl knows, we will have further legislation coming forward later in the year. This comes back to a point made previously by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, but I do not think that the choice is between structures and teachers. Sometimes it is caricatured that people who want structural change are crazed ideologues who do not understand people, but that is not my view at all. My view, which was confirmed by meeting those excellent teachers, is that the structural change can give them the freedom to enable them to do more for the neediest children, about whom I know the noble Earl cares most strongly.</p>

We enjoy relative freedoms in some of our schools and we would encourage those freedoms being shared more widely. However, as the Minister will recognise and the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, has indicated, we will need to see the workings.</p>

<a name="100621-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="1006214000161"></a>In relation to accredited providers, am I right in understanding that any parents or community groups seeking to establish a free school will be expected to work with an accredited provider? If that is the case, will the Minister welcome an assurance from the Church of England and other faith groups that we will make available all the experience we have as quite long-standing providers in the field of education? If accredited providers are required to co-operate with such groups, will he bear in mind the readiness of the church to co-operate? Perhaps I may go further and suggest that any prospective group of parents might be encouraged to co-operate with an accredited church provider. There will always be one near to where they are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="1006214000164"></a>My question is about money. We have heard about the changes in the planning rules, but that does not answer the money question. When will we get real details about the setting-up costs of these new schools, particularly in relation to capital? I am clear how the running costs will be met but, particularly where there is a shortage of school places and there are not obviously empty old school buildings, there is a real challenge about finding suitable building space and meeting the capital costs. We need facilities to deliver a decent curriculum, particularly for older children taking GCSE and A-level sciences, and I am anxious to know when we will have a little more detail.</p>

Can he be more specific on the issue of the creation of surplus places by the development of one of these free schools? I still bear the scars from dealing-in Lancashire County Council many years ago-with the issue of surplus places. It is no good saying that there will be the same per capita per pupil for existing schools, because if there are surplus places, the per capita will have to go up to protect the curriculum.</p>

<a name="100621-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="1006214000172"></a>Can the Minister also be a little more forthcoming about the relationship between the teachers, who he says have very good motives in setting up these schools, and potential conflicts with parents? Major parts of special educational needs in our schools are to do with behavioural problems. In my long experience of governing bodies where parents served, the parents would quite frequently wish to exclude the children with behavioural problems. This could totally wipe out the aims of the teachers whom he has described.</p>

The provisions which we will be discussing in the Academies Bill, particularly in regard to vulnerable children, and which will be delivered through the funding agreement and will give these children broadly the same protections as are delivered through maintained schools, will also have to be delivered by free schools, which will be set up as academies and governed by the same safeguards. A free school could not decide to take an approach towards vulnerable children-statemented children-that is different from the approach of any other kind of school.</p>

<a name="100621-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="1006214000174"></a>On surplus places, it was recognised as long ago as the 2005 White Paper that one of the effects of the policy was that, in some places where there was not parental demand, there would be surplus places. The whole point of the policy is to try to create something new for parents where there are surplus places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="1006214000177"></a>Perhaps I may also press the Minister a little more on local authorities. Whenever a new school is set up, it will have an effect on other schools, as no school is an island. Will the Secretary of State publish the criteria for the weighting that will be given to various consultations with the local authority, and the points that the local authority makes to him when there is an application for a new school?</p>

The funding mechanism can apply to all academies; it could well apply to free schools. The point of having a grant rather than a seven-year funding arrangement is that, particularly with a free school, which is a new and untried school, the Secretary of State might not want to be bound into an agreement for seven years and might prefer something that gives him greater flexibility. The department has entered into a contractual arrangement with the New Schools Network to provide support and advice. I will happily send to the noble Baroness the letter that sets up that arrangement. Forgive me, but I have forgotten the third point.</p>

Overall, the department intends to look at the whole set of regulations around buildings for all schools because our view is that they are expensive and bureaucratic and the process of building schools takes too long. Some of the regulations do not seem to serve any particular purpose while others serve an extremely good purpose. We will look at them all and, as part of that, we will obviously need to take into account important points about design.</p>

Is the Minister saying, in a technical sense, that the Government will issue a new planning policy statement referring to schools? Will that therefore apply to all schools, since planning clearly has to be neutral with regard to the question of who applies for a particular type of planning permission? Is it not the case that when the Victorians built a large number of new schools-first the churches and then the state-they discovered that setting up schools in odd corners of mills, factories, barns and other buildings

Is that not still the case?</p>

Our starting point in this is that every year that passes is another school year that has been missed out and another generation of children who are falling behind. I understand entirely the points that my noble friend Lord Greaves makes. However, in the balance between perfect provision, carefully planned, and giving groups greater opportunity to start the urgent work of improving the teaching for children who need it most in areas of greatest disadvantage, we come down on the side of more flexibility over premises rather than going for the full, perfect Monty.</p>

We all want parents to be involved in the education of their children, because the more involved they are the better, but I see two problems. If parents set up a school, the contract they let to a provider could be as long as seven years. Within that time, there could have been 100 per cent changeover of parents at the school. The further point is that the parents who are the original promoters of the school may not even get their children into the school if an oversubscription criterion of, for example, a ballot were used. So there could be a situation in which the original parent promoters do not have children in schools, and within three to four years the percentage of parents with any say or influence at all over how the school meets its contract is very low. Will the Minister explain his thoughts on that?</p>

The truth in this, as with a lot of these things, is that the announcement made on Friday kicked off the process. There will be all sorts of important practical considerations that that process will throw up. Officials in the department, assisted by the New Schools Network, will be thrashing through those considerations and coming to Ministers with recommendations on the back of the process. These kinds of points-which are extremely important; I do not belittle them in any way at all-will need to be thought through as part of the process.</p>

He died serving our country and our thoughts are with his family and friends. We have also heard this morning news that a member of 40 Commando Royal Marines has died from his injuries. He is the 300th member of the British Armed Forces to lose his life as a result of the conflict in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="100621-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="1006214000189"></a>When such a tragic milestone is reached, we should re-emphasise our support for our Armed Forces, and for all that they do. Inevitably some will question our mission and purpose there, and we are paying a high price. Let me be clear that we are in Afghanistan because the Afghans are not yet capable of securing their own country from terrorists. It is for our own national security that we help them. When they can do it alone, we will leave. In the mean time, we will give our Armed Forces everything they need to get the job done.</p>

<a name="100621-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="1006214000190"></a>With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement on last Thursday's European Council. It was rightly focused on securing the economic recovery, and it was unanimous that this required early action on budget deficits. The Council also dealt with Europe's growth strategy, the need to sort out the problems in the eurozone, and our approach to the G20. It also delivered important progress on Iran.</p>

<a name="100621-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="1006214000191"></a>Let me take each in turn. On deficits, the conclusions could not be clearer. Delaying action would entail 'major risk', and the Council called on member states to meet budgetary targets 'without delay'. Since the last European Council, the problems in Greece and the scale of the sovereign debt crisis have become apparent to almost everyone. That is why there is such unanimity across the EU on early action, and it is why President Barroso paid tribute to the efforts that the UK coalition Government are taking and said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="1006214000243"></a>'Consolidation is necessary for confidence and without confidence there will be no growth'.</p>

<a name="100621-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="1006214000192"></a>On growth, the Council agreed a new strategy called Europe 2020. This follows on from the Lisbon agenda, whose aim was to make Europe the most competitive market in the world. The document has some worthwhile objectives, including raising the level of research and development, and improving education. This should not interfere with national competencies. So I secured explicit agreement that the new strategy must be,</p>
<ul><a name="1006214000250"></a>'fully in line with the relevant treaty provisions and EU rules and shall not alter member states' competences'.</ul>
<a name="100621-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="1006214000193"></a>We should be clear that all the strategies in the world should not conceal the fact that EU countries all need to get to grips with the real problems that harm our competitiveness, not by endlessly setting targets but by taking action. This includes action on the extent of our debts, the affordability of our pensions, and on the scale of our welfare dependency.</p>

<a name="100621-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="1006214000194"></a>Europe has never lacked strategies, but European countries have frequently failed to deliver them. We will continue to press for the real stimulus that European economies need-more trade, more international investment and breaking down barriers to business. This means pushing for agreement on Doha, reforming and completing the single market and making the process of trade easier. Even without Doha, there is a huge amount that countries across the world can do to facilitate trade. I want Britain to be one of the driving forces in helping to bring this about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="1006214000195"></a>Next, the eurozone: Britain is not in the euro and-let me be clear-we are not going to join the euro. However, a strong and successful eurozone is vital for the British national interest. Already about half our exports go to the EU, fourth-fifths of this to the eurozone. However, as this House is aware, with the situation in Greece and the need for a support package from other eurozone members, there is no doubt that the eurozone as a whole faces real challenges. I was generally supportive of the Council's efforts to strengthen the eurozone governance arrangements, but I was equally determined to ensure that our national interests are protected.</p>

<a name="100621-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="1006214000196"></a>On budget surveillance, let me be clear: the UK Budget will be shown to this House first and not to the Commission. Of course, we will share projections and forecasts, just as we do with the IMF and other international bodies. Co-ordination and consultation, yes; clearance, no-never. On sanctions for those who breach their economic obligations, the Council agreed that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="1006214000244"></a>'Member States' respective obligations under the Treaties will be fully respected'.</p>

<p><a name="1006214000197"></a>Because of this and because of the special opt-out negotiated by the last Conservative Government, under the current framework sanctions cannot be applied to the UK.</p>

<a name="100621-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="1006214000198"></a>Sorting out the eurozone and adding to its governance arrangements are clearly vital for Europe. There may well be significant changes coming down the track. Whether they require treaty changes or not, our position will be the same. We will back measures that help to sort out the eurozone. We will not back measures that pass power from the UK to Brussels and, as we are not a member of the euro, we will not back measures that draw Britain further into financial support for the euro area.</p>

<a name="100621-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="1006214000199"></a>On the G20, the Council discussed our priorities for the upcoming meeting. As well as taking action on the deficit, the Council also agreed about the importance of reforming the financial system. It is vital that the meeting in Canada backs the right action on reserves and capital.</p>

<a name="100621-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="1006214000200"></a>On the issue of a banking levy, the Council conclusions were helpful. We wanted the European Council to endorse the idea of countries introducing a levy on financial institutions to ensure that they make a contribution to rebuilding public finances. We did not want the Council to mandate a particular form of levy or how the money raised should be used. I am pleased to say that the Council conclusions reflect that approach.</p>

<a name="100621-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="1006214000201"></a>On Iran, we have argued that it is time for actions, not just words. Following the UN Security Council's recent adoption of Resolution 1929, the Council agreed to step up the pressure, issuing an unequivocal leaders' declaration. This refers to measures including restrictions on trade, banking, transport and the oil and gas industry. Final agreement will be reached at the Foreign Ministers' meeting.</p>

<a name="100621-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="1006214000202"></a>The Council also reached important conclusions on Iceland's application to join the EU. This country should be a good friend to Iceland and a strong supporter of EU enlargement, but Iceland owes the UK £2.3 billion in respect of compensation paid by the Government to UK investors following the collapse  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1196"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1196</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of its banking sector. We will use the application process to make sure that Iceland meets its obligations, because we want that money back.</p>

<a name="100621-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="1006214000203"></a>Finally, it is important that, even in difficult times, we should be supporting people in the poorest countries suffering from severe poverty. The Council reaffirmed its commitment to achieve development aid targets by 2015 and, supported by the UK, to review this annually.</p>

<a name="100621-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="1006214000204"></a>This was a Council that delivered good outcomes for Britain. Our citizens do not want new structures to talk about things; they want a new resolve to actually do things, such as getting to grips with our massive budget deficits, developing the single market and building the conditions for strong, sustainable and balanced growth. That is what this Council was all about".</p>

As the Prime Minister said, 300 members of our forces have now given their lives in Afghanistan in the service of our country. We pay tribute to their bravery, we honour their sacrifice and our thoughts are with their families. I strongly agree with the Leader about the cause for which our soldiers are fighting in Afghanistan. They are fighting there to keep our streets safe here. That is why the Opposition is united with the Government in support of our troops and their mission. As we approach Armed Forces Day, let us remember all our service men and women, whether they are stationed abroad or at home. Their skill and courage are unsurpassed.</p>

<a name="100621-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="1006214000207"></a>I thank the Leader of the House for repeating the Prime Minister's Statement. I start by welcoming the continued EU focus and government commitment on two important issues. First, on Iran, I endorse the support for the European Council's declaration, which again shows that on issues of international concern, we who are EU member states have a bigger impact when we combine our efforts. Does the Leader of the House agree that while the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran remains a matter of utmost concern, the international community is now more united than ever before in searching for a peaceful solution; and that the very act of EU diplomacy that we have seen in recent years has played an important part in this? He says that the Prime Minister tells us that it is time for action, not just words; is there a timetable for further EU action on Iran? Can he confirm the importance, not only of sanctions and diplomatic pressure, but of international engagement with the people of Iran? Will he therefore give an undertaking that the BBC Farsi service will be protected from any cuts in the BBC World Service?</p>

<a name="100621-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="1006214000208"></a>Secondly, I also welcome the strong commitment of the EU summit to meeting the millennium development goals by 2015. The terrible crisis of drought and food shortages in Niger is a vivid reason why there must be international action on development. Will the Prime Minister be a stronger voice in the EU for the whole EU to make development a priority, if his Government

Following our Government's commitment, the European Commission recommended that all EU member states should consider legislating to enshrine the 0.7 per cent aid target, which we established. Will the Government now take forward, in this Session of Parliament, the Bill we introduced to make the 0.7 per cent legally binding?</p>

<a name="100621-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="1006214000209"></a>Is it not the case that you can only be effective in Europe if what you say and do there is matched by what you do and say at home? In that regard, I commend the Leader on the Prime Minister's reference in his pre-summit article to the shocking inequality of women in many parts of Europe, and the urgent need for change. If the Prime Minister recognises shocking inequality of women elsewhere in Europe, can the Government act on it here? Will the Prime Minister show the rest of Europe that he means at home what he says in Brussels by giving us a commitment that he will implement the Equality Act as soon as possible, and commit to pressing on with the plan to make employers publish their gender pay gap?</p>

<a name="100621-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="1006214000210"></a>I welcome the fact that the summit adopted the European 2020 strategy for growth. The summit said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="1006214000245"></a>"Priority should be given to growth-friendly budgetary consolidation strategies".</p>

<p><a name="1006214000211"></a>It also said:</p>

<p><a name="1006214000213"></a>That is what the Prime Minister signed up to in Brussels. However, he is doing something rather different at home. On growth, the Leader of the House said that the Government will continue to press for the real stimulus that the European economies need, but the reality from the Government here is very different. How does it help growth to cut business investment support? How does it help unlock the EU's growth, starting with energy, to cancel the loan to Sheffield Forgemasters to build the next generation of nuclear power stations? Does this not mean that Europe, as well as the UK, will lose out to South Korea and Japan as they take this work forward? On the important question of financial services, we welcome the intention to implement a new system of levies and taxes on financial institutions, and the intention to explore an international financial transactions tax. Will the Government commit to maintaining the UK's strong leadership in advocating these reforms?</p>

The Leader of the House, in repeating the Prime Minister's Statement, says that the Prime Minister believes that this is a council which delivered good outcomes for Britain. The Prime Minister is no longer the leader of the Opposition, grandstanding to his Back-Benchers. He is now representing our country in Europe, so perhaps it is time for him and the Government as a whole to have a sensible think about continuing to exclude themselves from the grouping of centre-right

The European People's Party includes President Sarkozy, Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Prime Ministers of Sweden, Italy and Poland. However, instead of meeting with them to prepare for the summit, the Prime Minister had a meeting with one Polish MEP to prepare for Britain's contribution to the summit. The election is over. Will the Prime Minister now put aside his pandering to his Europhobic Back-Benchers and agree with his Lib-Dem coalition partners on this vital issue of Europe? That is in Britain's interests and would be a good outcome for Europe and Britain. We on these Benches invite the Conservatives on the Benches opposite to join the Liberal Democrats on the Benches opposite-and, indeed, we on these Benches-by getting serious about Britain's interests in Europe and putting practicalities and policies ahead of prejudices and politics. That is what Europe needs from Britain. That is what Britain needs to do in Europe.</p>

However, she started extremely well by congratulating the Government and the Council on our position on Iran. She was right to do that because our position on Iran is unequivocal. It underlines the clear view in Europe that Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable. Europe has asked Iran to return to the negotiating table and has made clear that the alternative is further isolation. I am unable to give the noble Baroness the timetable that she sought, but my understanding is that we await the next Foreign Ministers' Council, where final agreement will be reached. I am hopeful that there will then be quick action to put in place the various sanctions that have been recommended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="1006214000216"></a>The noble Baroness asked me rather a good question about the BBC Farsi programme. If I had an answer to that, I would give it to her, but perhaps I can write to her on that point. The Government have rightly been congratulated on continuing with the millennium development goal commitments, as the noble Baroness recognised. In our view it is very important that these commitments talk about European countries meeting and achieving their targets by 2015. There has certainly been no slippage on that on our part. Even in difficult times when we are having to make tough decisions in our own economies, it is important that we should support people in the poorest areas of the world suffering severe poverty. It is important that we maintain that commitment. The European Council reaffirmed its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on development aid by 2015, and agreed to monitor progress towards this target annually. I cannot at this stage give a commitment on the legislative proposals that we will make as regards the 0.7 per cent target, but it is our intention so to do.</p>

The conclusions that we came to at the Council thus make clear that the strategy will not affect member states' competencies on, for example, education. However, it will help Europe recover from the crisis and come out stronger internally and at the international level by boosting competitiveness, productivity, growth potential, social cohesion and economic convergence. It was kind and thoughtful of the noble Baroness to show her concern about the EPP. I assure her that we are happy with the current arrangements.</p>

Are we to understand that there was no detailed discussion at the Council on the widespread discussions taking place outside on the possibility that some members of the eurozone might find themselves in a position whereby they have to withdraw? Indeed, it has recently been suggested that it might be disruptive in that context if Germany were to withdraw, rather than the countries in the weakest position. At all events, the scheme was designed to prevent people withdrawing and it is important that we should not hide our heads in the sand regarding that possibility and we should make contingency plans. In particular, there is a major practical problem. Is there not perhaps some case for setting up a contingency fund of what we might call euro-exit notes and coins, which would be used if a particular country had to withdraw? Surely it is better that we should plan for that possibility, whatever our position might be on whether it is likely to happen, rather than suddenly finding that we are in a situation where nothing can be done because of the practical point that I mentioned.</p>

The eurozone is of course extremely important to the British economy. We want a strong and competitive eurozone area, but it is clear to anyone who has been following this subject in recent months that there are substantial problems with the euro and, most notably, with Greece. However, I am not in a position to speculate in any way on what may or may not happen in any other eurozone country or, indeed, on what contingency plans are envisaged over the next few months. The G20 has recognised that countries with serious fiscal challenges need to accelerate the pace of consolidation. In that regard, we welcome the recent announcements of further consolidation plans by the Governments of Spain and Portugal. It is important that to rebuild confidence all Governments implement in a rigorous manner the measures that they have announced. It is that confidence which will provide strength again to the eurozone. That in the long term will be to all our benefits.</p>

He highlighted the fact that, on a number of occasions, the Prime Minister repeated that we were going to play an active and engaged role in working with our colleagues to solve the international financial and economic crisis that affects all countries. Even if, under the coalition agreement, we are not for the moment committed to joining the euro-and a lot depends of course on what happens to the euro-does the noble Lord agree that the logic of the single market means that a single currency is really necessary later on? Conservative Ministers frequently enunciated before 1997 that you could not have a genuine single market without a single currency. That reality prevails.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="1006214000222"></a>Does the noble Lord not agree that we in this country should be careful not to be too complacent or gleeful about the apparent crisis in the eurozone, given that we have the only currency that was driven out of the preliminary arrangements before the euro was created? A notable and spectacular devaluation ensued; in fact, we have had seven devaluations since the war. That was always the easy way out, rather than solving problems with a disciplined currency system. Does he agree that this is as much a crisis of the banking statistics and asset bases of the commercial and investment banks as it is of sovereign debt, and that we need to deal with both on an active basis? Will he therefore emphasise that the UK Government are supporting the suggestion of the Spanish Government that stress-test figures should be published in the second half of July showing the different states of various banks in the member states, within and without the eurozone, including, I think, five or six banks from the United Kingdom? Furthermore, as the Prime Minister was, quite rightly, warmly received in Brussels, does the noble Lord agree that that adds to the arguments for his party rejoining the EPP, as the shadow Leader of the House suggested?</p>

However, all the evidence over the past few years indicates that we were entirely right not to join the euro, as the former Prime Minister, when he was Chancellor, ensured would be the case. That was the right decision then, it is clearly the right decision now, and we shall continue with that. However, that does not mean that we should not play an active and engaged role, as my noble friend Lord Dykes said, and we will continue in the way that we started. Indeed, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister was very much welcomed in Brussels for his positive attitude and constructive approach to a whole range of extremely difficult issues that face Europe. I say to my noble friend, as I did to the noble Baroness the Leader of the Opposition, that the EPP issue is not one that we shall reopen.</p>

To give an example, Italy is cutting back on its aid. Does that not demonstrate the necessity for proper co-ordination at the European level when these commitments are entered into and the need to ensure that they are followed? Simply saying all the time that we are not going to do this or that in co-ordination has its disadvantages when we are in the lead and other people do not follow.</p>

Does he not recognise that our higher education sector is the leader in Europe, that we have four of the world's top 10 higher education establishments and that we are extremely well placed to give the lead in this essential part of making Europe more competitive? I hope that the Government will take that to heart and will see how, without transgressing any transfer of powers, we can make more of a reality of co-operation in the higher education sector and make it a more competitive part of the European economy.</p>

We would all agree that the EU has no role and no place to look at our budgetary arrangements and, indeed, our parliamentary procedures.

Neither, incidentally, is there about what the noble Lord Stoddart of Swindon, said about trade with the rest of the world. It is an important plank of British foreign policy to expand our trade beyond Europe. That is vital to our long-term prosperity and the creation of jobs in this country. We are using all the natural advantages that this country has built up over many decades-centuries even-with countries whose economies are growing extremely quickly.

It is understandable that the banks have to tighten their belts-or, perhaps, to behave themselves-but young couples are now being required to find 25 per cent of their new mortgages. For young couples with children to find £25,000 to £30,000 is very difficult. Can the Prime Minister speak to the banking sector to make the point that if young couples can buy homes, that will help the building industry and relieve tension on community-based housing associations and local authorities?</p>

The background against which we operate is now extremely different from what it was only two or three years ago vis-à-vis the whole question of mortgages and deposits. I assure the noble Lord that the President of the Board of Trade, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister himself are very involved in trying to ensure that lending is allowed and encouraged to people who can pay it back, not just in the commercial and business sector but in the domestic sector.</p>

As I said a moment ago, I am very grateful to the Minister for making the Statement repeating the Answer given to the Urgent Question asked in the other place, and for taking such a  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1205"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>comprehensive set of questions. However, the Statement has generated more questions than answers. I am sure that as we go on in Committee we will learn a lot more.</p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="10062117000022"></a>Even the disinterested passer-by cannot help but notice that free schools are a flagship policy of the coalition Government-or at least of the Conservative part of the coalition Government. The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State were clearly delighted to be photographed during the election campaign with parents celebrating their promise of a new school on demand. It was great campaigning, I am sure that noble Lords will agree. A whole page of the Conservative manifesto was devoted to a case study of the Swedish education system, the model for the Government's free school proposals. Actually, when I looked at it, most of the page was taken up by photographs-very nice too-but at least nominally there was a page on the subject.</p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10062117000023"></a>The Chancellor cited the reform as key to the Government's plans to close the deficit, as it would see free schools use money more efficiently. The Secretary of State says that he has seen the future in Sweden and it works. The Government seem to want a great deal of attention focused on this policy, but considerably less scrutiny about the practicalities of it. We may be changing that today.</p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="10062117000024"></a>Nowhere, however, in the pronouncements of the Secretary of State in connection with the Swedish-style free school reform, of which we have heard so much, has the Academies Bill been mentioned-until today. The Bill was announced under the headline, "Legislation to give more schools opportunity to become academies". The Department for Education website carries a document outlining the purpose of the Bill. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="10062117000098"></a>"The Academies Bill will enable more schools to become Academies and give them the freedoms and flexibilities they need to continue to drive up standards".</p>

<p><a name="10062117000089"></a>The document makes no mention whatever of new providers entering the school system. The Explanatory Notes to Clause 1 state:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="10062117000099"></a>"This clause replaces similar existing provisions in section 482 of the EA 1996. It enables the Secretary of State to make 'Academy arrangements' with another person, to establish and run an Academy. That person will be funded by the Secretary of State further to either a contractual agreement (an 'Academy agreement') or, by new subsection (2)(b), through grant funding under section 14 of the Education Act 2002".</p>

<p><a name="10062117000090"></a>There is no mention of new providers here either, merely an oblique reference to previous legislation and "other persons".</p>
<a name="time_25"></a>
<a name="100621-0007.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="10062117000107"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="10062117000025"></a>As the Minister pointed out just now during questions on the Statement, the clauses allow the Secretary of State to open a school, or to authorise anyone whom he sees fit to open a school, with almost no safeguards or undertakings. As the Secretary of State and the Minister know very well, that wholesale copy of the Swedish school model will not necessarily drive up standards in our schools. If the Minister has evidence that that is not the case, I would be very grateful to hear about it. I would also be interested to know where in the impact assessment evidence of the value of the Swedish model is set out.</p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10062117000026"></a>When Sweden tried the reforms on which this proposal is based, standards fell sharply. The new schools founded  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1206"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1206</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>under Sweden's reforms educate children of educated parents to a greater extent than those from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. They have opened in rented office blocks and former commercial properties. That is not just according to the critics of the scheme-that account came from the Swedish National Agency for Education, their equivalent of Ofsted.</p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="10062117000027"></a>On the financial side, creating new schools and deliberately generating surplus places-as you will have to do to make them work-costs money. Without additional funding being promised, that will take money from existing schools. We have heard about a very small amount of money, which may suggest that the scheme may be more modest than the election campaigning suggested. There is also the question of capital. We will not see great new schools coming into being without tackling the issues mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves.</p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10062117000028"></a>It is extraordinary that such a major change in approach to schooling in this country should be made in this way, where private companies will be invited to manage schools on behalf of groups of parents-although the message has now moved slightly to include groups of teachers-with no necessary regard to the well-being of children in nearby schools.</p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10062117000029"></a>At the start of Committee, we had an interesting debate about the name. Given all the PR, positioning and developing of the free school brand, it would be very helpful if we could be consistent about names here. If free schools are academies, let us call them academies, as noble Lords argued persuasively earlier.</p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10062117000030"></a>I am sure that we would all agree that there is no such thing as a free lunch or a free school. According to what I can glean from the Bill, the Explanatory Notes and so on, a free school is actually an academy without an academy agreement, so it is an exceptional academy. I would be grateful if the Minister could explain the intentions for free schools and the legislative process around the development of this flagship government policy. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="10062117000031"></a><b><a name="100621-0007.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="10062117000128"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> My Lords, Amendment 3 in this group is tabled in my name. It is similar to the amendment that the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, has just moved. I tabled this amendment because I have read the Bill several times-more times than is good for me-and I cannot work out whether the Government intend to include free schools within this legislation, and this is meant to be the legislation that will apply to free schools, or whether it is just about converting existing schools. My confusion, which is similar to that of the noble Baroness, arises because all the Government's statements about the Bill relate to converting existing schools into this new kind of academy. That is how the Bill was promoted. I read the Second Reading debate, and that was largely what it was about. So I was confused as to whether Clause 1, in particular subsections (1) and (2), could apply to free schools. The Bill states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="10062117000100"></a>"The Secretary of State may enter into Academy arrangements with any person".</p>

<p><a name="10062117000091"></a>That seemed to me to provide an ability to include any group of people who put themselves forward to set up a so-called free school.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1207"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1207</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100621-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="10062117000032"></a>Then there was the announcement at the weekend and the Statement that we have just had, and it now appears that the Bill includes free schools and that they will be set up within the terms of the Bill, if and when it becomes law. That is the real reason I put this amendment down for clarification. Will the Minister confirm that that is the case? Or do the Government think that free schools can be set up under existing legislation? In that case, they have a choice. If free schools are included in the Bill, a great deal of unanticipated extra discussion and debate is required, particularly in Committee.</p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="10062117000033"></a>I thank the Government and Ministers in both Houses for the amount of discussion they have been prepared to enter into with all Members of the House, and in particular with the Liberal Democrats, concerning the Bill. However, going over the notes I have made of meetings, I see that free schools have hardly been mentioned. The meetings have all been about conversions. Suddenly this weekend, the terms of the debate on the Bill seemed to change substantially. At this stage I do not want to enter into detailed debate about free schools. However, if there are to be free schools, the legislation and rules under which they are set up will need to be laid down at least as clearly as the rules for conversions are set out in the Bill. Given the quantity and detail of the amendments that have been tabled, we may feel that the detailed rules and regulations for conversions are insufficiently set out in the Bill and need improvement.</p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="10062117000034"></a>The system for setting up free schools does not exist in the Bill, as far as I can see, unless there is stuff that I have read without understanding what it means. This amendment is a means of getting from the Minister some clarification of these matters so that, in the rest of this debate in Committee and when the Bill goes back to the House, we can understand exactly what we are talking about. It may be that amendments that noble Lords might want to see in the Bill will be different according to the answer that the Minister gives. The basic questions are: do free schools need new legislation; can they be set up under old legislation so that the Bill does not apply to them; and, is the Bill necessary and fundamental to the setting up of free schools?</p>

<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="10062117000035"></a><b><a name="100621-0007.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="10062117000129"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> I hope the Minister will be able to confirm that entirely new schools can be set up, and indeed are set up at the moment, as academies. So, to the extent that that is true, free schools can be set up at the moment under existing academy legislation. I warmly welcome the suggestion made by my noble friend Lady Morgan that free schools should be called academies. I hope that the Minister is able to accept that suggestion, which my noble friend makes with great generosity of spirit, to make clear that we have a much more uniform nomenclature available. I am very keen to see all categories of schools that have the legal characteristics of academies called academies.</p>

<a name="10062117000036"></a><b><a name="100621-0007.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="10062117000130"></a>Lord Low of Dalston:</b> I shall speak to Amendments 13 and 76, which are tabled in my name. When we debated the Bill at Second Reading, there was widespread concern throughout the House that academies should  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1208"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have obligations to meet the needs of pupils with special educational needs that are no less rigorous than those which apply to maintained schools. The Minister was very clear that he was fully committed to this, and I am grateful to him for the trouble he has taken in meeting Peers with these concerns and also in writing to provide assurance that that is what the Bill achieves. However, there are still areas that remain unclear, where the commitment could do with being spelled out more fully or where gaps in the obligations to which academies are subject need to be plugged. These amendments are directed at remedying these deficiencies.</p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10062117000037"></a>Amendment 13 is a probing amendment with two purposes: first, to ascertain whether academies receiving academy financial assistance will be required to have funding agreements in place; and, secondly, to ascertain whether meeting the needs of children with special educational needs and disabilities will be included as a standard requirement within arrangements for academy financial assistance, just as it currently is in funding agreements.</p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="10062117000038"></a>Currently, academies are principally accountable through and governed by funding agreements signed with the Secretary of State. Clause 1(2)(b) introduces a new form of funding for academies-</p>
<ul><a name="10062117000105"></a>"arrangements for academy financial assistance".</ul>
<p><a name="10062117000092"></a>These are not found in the original academies legislation. Arrangements for academy financial assistance are a form of direct funding from the Secretary of State granted through powers conferred by Section 14 of the Education Act 2002. Arrangements for academy financial assistance are an alternative to funding through an academy agreement so that it appears possible that, where arrangements for academy financial assistance are put in place, an academy may not be required to have a funding agreement.</p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="10062117000039"></a>While it is possible to have reservations regarding the scope and effectiveness of funding agreements as accountability mechanisms, there has none the less been clarity in funding agreements signed after 2007 that academies should have regard to the SEN code of practice and use their best endeavours to ensure that special educational needs are met. There are concerns that this new form of academy funding-arrangements for academy financial assistance-will bypass the safeguards contained in funding agreements in relation to SEN provision. This amendment gives the Minister an opportunity to make the position clear and to reassure us that academies receiving academy financial assistance will be required to have funding agreements, and that meeting the needs of children with SEN and disabilities will be included as a standard requirement within arrangements for academy financial assistance. </p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="10062117000040"></a>Amendment 76 seeks to ensure that academy funding agreements are comprehensive in their coverage of the requirements that are laid on maintained schools in relation to pupils with special educational needs in Part IV of the Education Act 1996. I recognise that the intention behind the academies programme is not to weaken the SEN legal framework. The Government have stated that one of the broad principles on which  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1209"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1209</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they have approached the academies programme is that there will be no change to, or weakening of, the requirements governing SEN provision.</p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="10062117000041"></a>In response to questions asked at Second Reading about the safeguards for children with SEN in funding agreements, the Minister made it clear that the provisions of these funding agreements mirror the legislative requirements on maintained schools. Since 2007, model funding agreements, which govern academies' actions, have transposed measures from Part IV of the Education Act 1996 and made it clear that academies should have regard to the SEN code of practice. However, a contractual arrangement is one thing; a law is quite another. Contractual arrangements do not provide anything like the assurance provided by legislation. Even if we accept that funding agreements offer parents the same pathways to remedy as the law, which I question-I will have an opportunity to question this further when later amendments come up for discussion on Wednesday-existing funding agreements still do not refer to certain important aspects of SEN law that it is important not to lose.</p>

<a name="100621-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="10062117000042"></a>It is true that existing funding agreements mirror some of the duties in Part IV of the Education Act 1996, but concerns remain that other aspects of Part IV are not covered. For example, no existing academies have the same duties as maintained schools under Section 317A of the Education Act 1996 to inform a child's parents if they consider that child to have special educational needs, or to admit a pupil with a statement when both the parents and the local authority wish the child to attend that school as maintained schools are required to do by Section 324 of the Education Act 1996.</p>

<a name="100621-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="10062117000043"></a>Amendment 76 therefore seeks further assurance that the academies programme will not result in a weakening of the requirements that govern SEN provision in schools and that all funding agreements will cover all the requirements of Part IV of the Education Act 1996. In particular, it would require academy agreements to contain provisions that set out the responsibilities of academies in meeting the needs of pupils with special educational needs or disabilities. In discharging these responsibilities, an academy should co-operate with the LEA in making provision for pupils with special educational needs or disabilities. An academy funding agreement should make provision to ensure that: academies use their best endeavours to ensure that an LEA can discharge its responsibilities in making arrangements for the provision of education for a pupil with a statement of SEN; academies have regard to the SEN code of practice; academies act as if they were a maintained school for the purposes of Part IV of the Education Act 1996; SEN co-ordinators are qualified teachers; and academies make arrangements to ensure that an independent appeals process is available to parents of pupils with SEN or a disability.</p>

<a name="100621-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="10062117000044"></a>I hope very much that the Minister will be able to accept this provision. If he did so, that would put beyond doubt his desire to see that funding agreements are fully comprehensive in transposing the requirements of special educational legislation in Part IV of the Education Act 1996.</p>

I have tabled Amendment 24 in this group, and I intend throughout Committee to introduce amendments and to speak about a particular form of special educational needs: those of children who have grown up in severely disadvantaged and chaotic families and who so often end up being statemented with emotional and behavioural difficulties.</p>

<a name="100621-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="10062117000046"></a>In that context, I ask who will govern these new academies. Who will make the decisions on the ground? I fully acknowledge that parents sponsoring and running a school may be a good idea, but I am not convinced that a whole or even a majority of the governing body composed of parents of children at the school is at all desirable. My own modest experience in the independent sector has certainly indicated that short-termism tends to dominate decisions that are taken when there are too many parents with children at a school. Parent governors will obviously want the best for their children and are right to do so. Indeed, we want the stimulus of parents who push to get the best for their child, but there is a real danger that, if we get the governance of academies wrong, they will end up with the same fate that has unfortunately befallen so many of the admirable Sure Start centres which the previous Government introduced. Money was put to serving the community, the community was encouraged to consider how it wanted the money to be spent and the money was then spent in that way. What has tended to happen is that the brighter, pushier and more intelligent parents have jumped on the bandwagon and got the kind of input and outcomes that they wanted, and the parents with disadvantaged children who have no experience of addressing leadership or influencing events-the hard-to-reach parents-have gone to the bottom of the pile and the funding that was intended to go to them, if it is not wasted, at least does not reach them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="10062117000047"></a>What is the Government's intention for governance? I refer to all the different kinds of school: free schools, parent-sponsored academies or academies sponsored by existing schools.</p>

This is particularly important in early years institutions if they are to become academies. Parents on those bodies will be essential. If parents are not involved in the early years, the children and the school suffer. I  should like to ask the Minister about consultation with governing bodies. How is the future governance of schools foreseen?</p>

For the word "roles" noble Lords should read "rules" and they will get a greater, if not absolute, idea of the sense of it. I am concerned about how the governing bodies of these academies will be dealt with when they go wrong. They can get into a mess from time to time when they are captured by strong individuals with very particular ideas. They can become at odds with parents and heads, and can contribute to poor performance in the school. I understand what happens under current academies with sponsors. But in an academy without a sponsor, what process will be gone through to set the governing body back on the right path? Who complains to whom? Who reaches a judgment as to what is happening? Who takes action under what powers?</p>

<a name="100621-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="10062117000052"></a>What general powers will parents have to set things right if they see things going wrong? I do not think that there are any contractual arrangements with parents. So, if a school is failing to provide education, what is the route for the parent to enforce the right to education for their child? Finally, at Second Reading, I asked whether we might be circulated with a model funding agreement. I have not seen that yet and I am keen to do so while we are discussing these matters.</p>

It started with a clear indication that we will go down the academy route for all schools. I supported that direction very strongly before the break. To add free schools, when clearly they all fall within the same family, does not make any sense. I was slightly surprised at the amendment which the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, addressed, to replace "person" with "governing body". No noble Lord has said one word about the governing body and its role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="10062117000054"></a>I must declare an interest as president of the National Governors Association. Therefore, all these areas interest me quite a bit. Given all that and the rather confusing and conflicting view that noble Lords around the Chamber seem to have about whether governors and parent governors are a good or a bad thing, it would be extremely helpful if the Minister-to whom I also add my thanks because he gave up a lot of time before we even began debating this Bill-could indicate how important he thinks that the role of the governing body is. It will have a hugely important role in seeing that these new academies-however many of them there are-come to the conclusion that I think many of us would see as an important step in British education.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="10062117000101"></a>"Academies are independent schools that are funded directly by the Secretary of State and are accountable mainly through  the funding agreement, rather than",-[<I>Official Report</I>, 7/6/10; col. 514.]</p>

<p><a name="10062117000093"></a>through educational legislation. I am interested in accountability. I strongly support Amendment 13 because it requires that any other-to me, rather mysterious-mode of supplying financial assistance to academies should be as equally open as the contracts that are agreements between the applicant and the Government. I entirely endorse the desire that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, expressed to see a copy of one of these model agreements.</p>

<a name="100621-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="10062117000056"></a>The issue is about openness and accountability of how much money is being handed over-it will be a considerable amount-and exactly what the academy is committed to providing with that money. This is where I come to my noble friend's main interest; namely, to seek an assurance that the money must be spent on provision for children with special educational needs. I think that we will come to more detail on that later. I share his feelings that the local authority must retain a good deal of responsibility for the provision of educational facilities for children with special needs, especially in very difficult cases of rare disabilities or multiple disabilities where individual academies could not afford to spend the money required.</p>

<a name="100621-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="10062117000057"></a>There is a good deal of unclarity regarding special educational needs. Parents will be very much confused-perhaps more so if they read today's <I>Hansard</I> than they were before. Amendment 13 would clarify the position with regard to the accountability of an academy, whatever way it receives its money from the Secretary of State.</p>

We need to see this debate within that context.</p>

<a name="100621-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="10062117000059"></a>Much more seriously, I endorse the recommendations that the security of those with special educational needs be affirmed in the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Low, referred to the avoidance of doubt, and bishops are always up for the avoidance of doubt. There are some issues where it is too risky to leave matters simply to good will or mutual understanding, and special educational needs is one of them. We need to ask the Minister if he will look at ways in which that dimension of academy life can be secured clearly in the Bill.</p>

<a name="100621-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="10062117000060"></a>My third point is to do with governance-not with who can be a governor, but with the purpose of school governors in this brave new world. Many of us have lived through various recensions of governance. I go back to when I was first ordained in the early 1970s and I was a governor of a school. It seemed that the  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1213"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1213</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>main purpose of the governors was to meet quarterly, hear the head teacher tell us how good the school was, and to pat the head teacher on the head saying, "Jolly good. Keep it up". It was not long before we saw the development of teacher governors and parent governors. Governing bodies became representative bodies that articulated the range of interests of those with any connection with the school. The role of governors changed quite significantly. Then the most recent Bill of the last Government, just before the election, looked dangerously as though it was tipping towards having governors acting as the Government's narks. There were going to be requirements for governors to be able to spill the beans and blow the whistle when they thought the head teacher or someone else was not quite up to it. I am sure it will be said that that was not the intention, but that was how it looked. Certainly there was a shift going on in our understanding of governance.</p>

<a name="100621-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="10062117000061"></a>What I ask the Minister is this. Before we even start nailing down categories of people who should be governors, what will we be asking them to do? What will be the role of governors in this new world of academies that is now emerging on the back of the primary wave? I cannot make a decision about the issue of who until I have some understanding of what it is that the governance of academies will entail. What will be the function of the governors? What gifts and qualities will be required of them? We will then be able to answer the question of who might be the most competent people to fulfil that vital role.</p>

It is important that special needs are recognised. I also support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne. I have been a governor of a girls' school and am now a governor of a boys' school. As a governor of the school to which my daughter went, I was not actually asked to take on the role until she had left. That seems to be the ideal situation because you then have a parent with a real interest in the school but without the rather special interest which is local and time-limited. To have a predominance of parent governors while their own children are in the school would be a retrograde step, so I strongly support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne.</p>

I emphasise that there is much to do. Some children need smaller schools and special teachers to work with them, but others do not, even though they may face serious challenges at home. Good support can be offered in schools to include these children to the benefit of all. I give one example: the charity Voluntary Reading Help, which works in over 1,000 schools. It recruits volunteers to work for one or two lunch hours a week to work with particularly difficult or challenging children. I have seen for myself in a primary school nearby how the volunteer will sit down and read with a child for half an hour and then play a little game. The child chooses the book and they enjoy their time together. A significant number of these volunteers are men, which is particularly valuable given that we have so many

These are important relationships that can be built up over the course of a year, which is the minimum commitment. This is the sort of thing that helps to include children who might otherwise be challenging. It is important to consider who should make up the governing body and what its function is. It should take a strategic view and be able to adopt sensible approaches like the one I have outlined.</p>

<a name="100621-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="10062117000064"></a>I was encouraged when Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said last week that he intended to recruit more men into early years childcare. I hope that he will also look at primary schools and how initiatives like Voluntary Reading Help might be developed. The charity is keen to expand in order to be able to help more children.</p>

The House has been concerned about the position of children with special educational needs. It is one of the areas where a good governing body can make it very clear indeed that the school must make provision for children in this group. Indeed, the force of governing bodies has been one of the pressures that has encouraged the move towards children being educated at least partly in mainstream schools if they possibly can be. Not the least of this has taken place in primary schools, where the governing body is often a crucial factor in ensuring that these youngsters are given the education they need and deserve.</p>

<a name="100621-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="10062117000066"></a>I do not want to detain the Committee for long. First, I ask the Minister whether more assurances can be given on the position of children with special educational needs, about which we have learnt a great deal more in the past 10 years. Far more children are now helped in schools, in some cases through one-to-one assistance, to overcome the obstacles they encountered as very young children so that they often catch up with their cohort. In the long term their special educational needs are not a handicap to them. We would like to associate ourselves closely with what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Low, and of course by the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock.</p>

<a name="100621-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="10062117000067"></a>I want to make one other point quite strongly. It was the former Secretary of State for Education who brought in the requirement that governing bodies had to include representatives of parents, teachers and non-teaching staff. Will the Government consider very carefully whether we should not consider, as is implied in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, widening somewhat the requirements in the Bill so that governing bodies are rather more representative than the single parent governor that is presently required for the academies? In the country as a whole, there are some 300,000 governors, or at least vacancies for governors. This seems to be a perfect example of what the Prime Minister meant when he talked about the importance of the big society, because these are men and women who volunteer their time and energy and make a fantastic commitment to ensuring that their schools are as good as they can be. I have seen it over and again, particularly in respect of smaller primary schools through what I should declare as an interest in

Among others, we give awards directly to the governors of schools. It has been striking to see governors from often deprived parts of the country committing themselves deeply to getting their communities involved in their school. It would be a tragedy to see that go.</p>

<a name="100621-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="10062117000068"></a>With regard to special educational needs, can the Minister say a little more to ensure that such children get the care and attention they need? Given the large number of academies that are to be created, I also ask him to consider again whether we should not ensure, at the very least, representation of parents-I share the view that it should not be a majority-and staff, including non-teaching staff, on the governing body in order, to put it bluntly, to ensure that those non-teaching staff members are strongly committed to the successful outcome of the school. That is a very important part of making education responsible and responsive to the community and the country as a whole.</p>

I say that because I am disappointed that we should in any sense offer support to the idea that a governing body with a majority of parents is not a delightful and wonderful thing. I hope that the free schools will include those started by groups of parents because surely parents more than anyone else care about the welfare of their children and know what they want for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="10062117000070"></a>The commitment that you get from parents involved in the running of a school where their own children are present is one of the solid gold threads of education in this country. Many years ago I was involved in the early days of the pre-school playgroup movement. This was established entirely by mothers for their children and it was absolutely wonderful. The way in which the mothers organised themselves and their children-they wanted the absolute best playgroups and so set up training courses for themselves-is exactly what the big society is about. I hope that some of the free schools will generate that excitement again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="10062117000076"></a>The first two amendments in the group seek to amend the words at the start of the Bill:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="10062117000102"></a>"The Secretary of State may enter into Academy arrangements with any person".</p>

<p><a name="10062117000094"></a>"Any person" seems an unambitious expression and one wonders why it should not, for example, say, "Any charity". I understood the Minister to say earlier without equivocation-this is how I read the Bill-that only a charity can be "the other party" for the purposes of academy arrangements. If we were to get technical-which is what we are supposed to do in this House-we would consider the Interpretation Act, which states, I think I am right in saying, that "any person" is any corporate entity or any individual person. It does not, for example, cover unincorporated trusts-and a great many charities are just that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="10062117000077"></a>If I had been kinder I would have raised these issues with the Minister before the debate, so I do not expect him to answer directly.

It is desirable that the Bill should encompass all three types of new schools. This would, first, allow the best schools to become better by freeing them up; secondly, tackle the failing schools through the academy orders in Clause 4; and, thirdly, make provision for the new schools so that they, too, can become academies. It would be tidy if those three elements could be within the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="10062117000079"></a>We do not need to be too anxious about the burden that this will place upon the Government. Taking things in context, the brief on the Bill pack prepared by the House of Commons includes two or three helpful sections on new schools. It states that currently 19 per cent of the 3,200 secondary schools are judged to be outstanding and will qualify for the fast track. So that is potentially 600 schools out of 20,000. At the other end, depending on how you define inadequate Ofsted reports for longer than a year, there are about 100 failing schools. So, added together, that makes approximately 700 schools out of 20,000.</p>

I mention this for two reasons. First, all of the proposed changes might touch upon, potentially, 5 per cent of the total cohort of schools within the country. Therefore, the sense that this will send shockwaves through the entire system is unfounded and it is perhaps unfair to concern people about that. Secondly, the catchment areas of the new schools-</p>

I come from an inner city urban area on Tyneside and it happened quite regularly that, where you had a failing school in a suburban area, dissatisfied parents who could afford to, or opted to, would take over an old large Victorian terraced house and its grounds-we have all seen them-and set up a new independent fee-paying school. The parents who could afford to opt out of the system would then pay fees for their children to go to that school. This movement still exists and is happening within the private sector. I cannot understand how anyone who has a passion for narrowing the gap and giving greater opportunity could possibly object to it. We should do all of these things in inner city areas and make them free and available to everyone. That would be entirely laudable.</p>

<a name="100621-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="10062117000083"></a>I wish to make two other brief points, the first of which relates to catchment areas. If there is going to be a greater number of schools, broadening catchment areas would be a good thing. When the city technology colleges were established, they covered not only one entire local education authority area but often encompassed two or three. In other words, if the parents were prepared to undertake the duty of getting their child to school and it was not going to damage the child's education, it was deemed acceptable for the child to attend there. Where there is greater choice the catchment areas need to be broadened. The noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, rightly made the point that narrow catchment areas could have too severe an effect on neighbouring schools.</p>

<a name="100621-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="10062117000084"></a>The final point on which I seek clarification from the Minister concerns the properties that could be used. There are many buildings in inner city areas-including, many educational buildings-under the control of local authorities. Indeed, where they have a surplus of places they are paying additional money for them. Does my noble friend agree that local authorities should look at their existing stock of prepared educational establishments, embrace this change and, where there is a surplus, hand over existing buildings to a new school provider? That would give the authority an additional income and would mean that the provider was not forced into premises that might not be suitable.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, pointed out, we have in some ways already got on to some of the issues that we will discuss in later groups of amendments. We can pursue them in greater detail then. Given how wide-ranging the debate has been, it would perhaps be helpful if I briefly restated the amendments and their purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="10062129000003"></a>Amendments 2 and 3 would mean that academy arrangements could be made only with the governing body of an existing school rather than any other group. They are linked in this group to Amendment 24, which would mean that, for future academies, the academy proprietor would have to ensure that its governing body was not controlled by a majority of parents of pupils at the academy-which was the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne.</p>

<a name="100621-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="10062129000004"></a>Amendment 13 seeks to ensure that the SEN annex of an academy agreement, which sets out the school's detailed obligations in relation to pupils with SEN, would apply also to the arrangements for academy financial assistance. Amendment 33 seeks to prescribe in the Bill that the academy agreement includes details of the roles, composition and continuance of the governing body. Amendment 76 seeks to ensure that academy funding agreements include additional provisions on SEN, including a requirement to comply with special educational needs legislation and regulations as if it were a maintained school.</p>

<a name="100621-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="10062129000005"></a>Perhaps I may start with Amendments 2 and 3. The Government want to make it easier for teachers, charities, educational groups and groups of parents to start new academies. As the 2005 White Paper stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="10062129000198"></a>"We believe parents should have greater power to drive the new system: it should be easier for them to replace the leadership or set up new schools where they are dissatisfied with existing schools".</p>

<p><a name="10062129000187"></a>We debated that earlier. I do not feel that I need to go through much of it again.</p>

<a name="100621-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="10062129000006"></a>I should make it clear to the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan-I think that my noble friend Lord Greaves also raised the point-that a free school could be regulated either through a funding agreement or a grant under Section 14 of the 2002 Act. In both cases, similar requirements will be placed on free schools as are placed on academies which convert from a maintained school. The only difference would be more flexibility in relation to the length of the funding period, a point that I made in our earlier debate on the Urgent Question. The more flexible arrangement would be used mainly in cases where new providers did not have a previous track record.</p>

We received a letter from the Secretary of State today-I am scrambling around to find it among my papers-stating not only what he has just said but also that academies funded through grant would have the conditions of their grant outlined in a letter. It states that the provisions would be in line with those in the funding agreement, as the Minister has just said. However, there is anxiety that, for issues around SEN, vulnerable children and all the areas set out in the funding agreement, the provisions might well be "in line with" but not the same. The Minister has just made a strong statement. It would be helpful to have that more clearly set out. My noble friend Lord Adonis said that the Secretary of State can already fund schools in this manner under the 2002 Act. If that is the case, and all the instruments exist, why do we need this additional route? If all the instruments exist, are we not just confusing matters? Around the Chamber, we are starting to understand the importance of the

If we introduce another way of doing things, will it not confuse things further? Perhaps a letter would be helpful.</p>

I recognise that many Members of this Committee want as much reassurance as they can have on that. If I can help in making it clearer, I will be delighted to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="10062129000009"></a>Amendment 13, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Low, seeks to ensure that the SEN annex of an academy agreement, which sets out the school's detailed obligations in relation to pupils with SEN, would apply also to the arrangements for academy financial assistance. In a way, that is a variant of the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan. The amendment is unnecessary, because academies whose arrangements take the form of an academy agreement and those whose arrangements are for financial assistance will both be under the same obligations in relation to special educational needs. I shall pick up again on special educational needs in connection with Amendment 76, although I know that a later group of amendments has been tabled on SEN.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="10062129000010"></a>We have had a long and interesting discussion about the role of governors, with a wide range of views expressed. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Lincoln talked about concerns that governors would be the Government's narks. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, approached concerns about the number and role of governors from one point of view, and my noble friend Lady Perry approached it from the other. She made it clear that, in thinking of all these issues, we need to strike a sensible balance. We can perhaps all think of our own examples of charities which may initially have been set up by someone who had a personal interest in an issue-one might have said, "Well, that person has a personal interest in this charitable issue, so I am not sure that he or she should have too much influence"-but which, over time, became completely self-sustaining. In principle, there is no reason to think that that should be any different in the case of the schools. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, said that, from his experience of independent schools, that model has developed over a long period.</p>

<a name="100621-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="10062129000011"></a>I turn to Amendment 24. We will require through the model funding agreement with academies that the governing bodies have at least one parent governor. I know that there are those in the Chamber who feel strongly that that number is not enough. A number of later amendments will allow us to discuss that at greater length.</p>

Just to say that there will be more than one parent governor, but, apart from that, that it is a matter of chance, is not quite enough.</p>

Fundamental to the Bill are trust and the principle of freedom. Throughout the Bill, we are seeking to be as enabling, permissive and as little prescriptive as possible. That principle would obtain also in our attitude to the question of governance. Our starting point would be that people wanting to set up these schools and exercise these freedoms would have a view as to what the most sensible membership of a governing body would be. The noble Lord will know from his experience that the best kind of governing body has a broadly drawn membership, bringing in expertise and experience from many areas. I am happy to discuss with him outside this debate whether there is anything further I can do.</p>

The proposal is that there should be at least one parent governor. In practice, if one were to draw up a list and look at what happens on the ground, one would find that academies tend to have varying numbers of parent governors, often many more than one. That is because academies have worked out for themselves that having those parents involved is a good thing. Parental involvement is a good principle. It is sometimes thought that academies are conspiracies against their local area and against local people, but I have seen no evidence of that whatever. In the academies that I have seen, it has been exactly the opposite. It would be wrong if I have given my noble friend the impression that I consider one parent is correct. The statutory requirement is for at least one, but in practice it would be many more than that. However, we will return to this debate later.</p>

<a name="100621-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="10062129000016"></a>Picking up on that point, it is the Government's view that there should be broad representation on the governing body of academies. That is rightly a matter for academies. We are seeking not to be too prescriptive in setting down what those freedoms should be.</p>

<a name="100621-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="10062129000017"></a>Free schools will have to have a fair and transparent admissions policy, just like other academies. They will have to provide places to pupils of different abilities drawn wholly or mainly from the local area and we would expect parent governors to reflect that intake. The arrangement for the election of parent governors will be set out in the articles of association of the academy company. It will make clear that the election of a parent governor should be by the parents or pupils attending the academy and, once elected, they will be appointed to the governing body of the academy trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="10062129000018"></a>On Amendment 33, moved by my noble friend Lord Lucas, I first apologise that we have not yet been able to circulate the model funding agreements. I want  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1221"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1221</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to do that as soon as possible. We are proposing to be able to circulate specifically the elements that deal with admissions, SEN and exclusions, which I know are of particular concern to many noble Lords. We will do that as soon as we can and I am sorry that we have not been able to do it in time for today.</p>

<a name="100621-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="10062129000019"></a>On the question asked by my noble friend Lord Lucas about intervention powers, the Secretary of State has power to intervene when educational standards are in question, if health and safety is an issue, and where governance, including financial management, is at issue. Of course, parents can complain to the Secretary of State and ask him to intervene.</p>

<a name="100621-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="10062129000020"></a>On the substance of Amendment 33, all academies are managed by an academy trust which, before it can enter the funding agreement with the Secretary of State, must have finalised and lodged at Companies House its governing documents, with the memorandum and articles of association which set out the governance arrangements and the governing body. That prompts me to respond to a question asked by my noble friend Lord Phillips. Because of the technical detail, I feel I should write to him to follow that point up.</p>

<a name="100621-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="10062129000021"></a>In the case of outstanding schools converting, we will discuss and need to agree with the governing body of the converting school who will be responsible for establishing the academy trust and the proposed composition of the board of the governing trust. We envisage that the composition of the governing body of the trust may therefore be very similar to that of the governing body of the converting school. The effect of Amendments 2 and 3 would be to deny teachers, charities and parents the opportunity to set up new schools. It would be wrong to deny them that choice, which the previous Government themselves intended to give them and that the Conservative Party promised in its manifesto and restated in the coalition agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="10062129000028"></a>Amendment 76 in this group would ensure that academy funding agreements would include additional provisions on SEN, including a requirement to comply with special educational needs legislation and regulations as if it were a maintained school. Academy funding agreements already include and will continue to include, as will grant arrangements, provisions setting out the responsibilities of academies in relation to pupils with SEN and disabilities. These include the responsibility of the governing body of the academy trust to consult the local authority and the governing bodies of other schools in the area to the extent that that is necessary for co-ordinating provision for pupils with SEN.</p>

<a name="100621-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="10062129000029"></a>Academy funding agreements also already include provisions that require academies to use best endeavours to meet any special needs of pupils, have regard to the SEN code of practice and have an SEN policy. Academies are already required to appoint a suitable person to co-ordinate SEN provision, but they currently have the freedom to decide who that should be. Nevertheless, academy funding agreements are clear that the key elements of this role are to ensure that the special educational needs of those pupils with such needs are met, including through the co-ordination of specialist provision within the local authority. Where an academy fails to meet its SEN funding agreement obligations, the Secretary of State has the role of ensuring that these obligations are met. Academy parents and pupils also have the same rights of access to the First-tier Tribunal (Special Educational Needs and Disability).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="10062129000030"></a>I hope that the setting out of those measures will go some way to reassuring noble Lords on this issue and I know that we will return to debate it further. However, I have listened to a whole range of noble Lords speak eloquently in this House and elsewhere about the need for absolute parity between academies and maintained schools and those points have been forcefully made again this evening. I have had meetings on SEN with a number of noble Lords from the Cross Benches and all sides and I have been particularly impressed by my noble friends of the Lib Dem Benches on this issue. I am conscious that the expertise in this House on special educational needs and vulnerable children is considerable, and I am certainly not an expert in these areas myself. I have tried to approach the question of parity from first principles rather than from having the depth of knowledge that many Members of this House have. Having thought about it from first principles and reflected on the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Low, endorsed by the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, and underlined by my noble friend Lady Williams and many other Lib Dem noble friends, I can say to the House that I will commit to think about how best to achieve parity. In principle, that seems the right way to go, and I shall come back to the House on Report with proposals.</p>

My noble friend Lord Adonis drew our attention to the similarity between Clause 1 of the Bill and the relevant Section of the Education Act 2002. However, the difference between this Bill and the section devoted to academies in the 2002 Act is the scale of the new initiative and the fact that this Bill will encompass so many new schools. Therefore, it is right that there are more safeguards and stringent checks than were perhaps required in the past.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="10062129000043"></a>Amendment 3A and the first part of Amendment 4A in some ways refer back to the debate on the previous group of amendments, but they are still pertinent. It is surprising that there is no provision in the Bill for any "fit and proper person" test to discern whether a board of governors or anyone to whom they may contract the running of a school are appropriate persons to take on the role of governing an autonomous school without local authority support-and, seemingly, much reduced inspections. This lack of safeguards would be concerning, but it might be understandable were there provision that the concerns of the community were taken into consideration in conferring this significantly increased responsibility or even power on existing boards of governors. This Bill appears to compound that lack of safeguards rather than tempering it by cutting out any right of these obviously vital stakeholders to be consulted. Amendments 3A and 4A are designed to address that crucial gap in the proposals.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="10062129000044"></a>The issue of consultation should be central to the Bill. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, said at Second Reading, consultation is a serious hole in  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1225"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1225</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Bill. Amendment 101, in the name of my noble friend Lady Morgan, would ensure that the requirement to consult various interested groups in the community is in the Bill. This is not a delaying tactic-I am not attempting to put any delaying hurdles before the Bill-but I believe that consultation is an imperative.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="10062129000045"></a>The amendments are also intended to temper an effect that the Minister of State for Children and Families in the Department for Education identified some time ago, when she said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="10062129000200"></a>"Unless you give local authorities that power to plan and unless you actually make sure that there is money available ... it's just a gimmick".</p>

<p><a name="10062129000188"></a>I am sure that this Bill is not a gimmick, but local authorities have a role in planning and delivering education in the community that remains far more democratically accountable and responsive than a system that relies on the Secretary of State sitting at his desk in Whitehall. As was pointed out at Second Reading, there is difference between political rhetoric and reality in relation to the Bill. The Prime Minister said some time ago:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="10062129000201"></a>"So we will take power from the central state and give it to individuals where possible-as with our school reforms that will put power directly in the hands of parents".</p>

<p><a name="10062129000046"></a>The coalition programme-in section 4, on communities and local government-says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="10062129000202"></a>"The Government believes that it is time for a fundamental shift of power from Westminster to people. We will promote decentralisation and democratic engagement".</p>

<p><a name="10062129000189"></a>I believe that consultation is a vital part of democratic engagement. However, this Bill is not so much about decentralisation as about centralisation. Power is being taken away from the people and given to the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="10062129000047"></a>Community cohesion is dealt with in the next group of amendments, but at Second Reading the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, made the important point that the wider views of the community should be taken into consideration in relation to decisions about schools, as the education system must serve the whole community. I believe that the community should be included in any consultation. Consultation, apart from being the right course of action, enables time for reflection about governance and accountability and about how schools can best use new freedoms to their advantage but without disadvantaging the rest of the community. Local authorities, parents, children and the staff-both teaching and non-teaching-see issues in the round and, unlike the Secretary of State, are aware of local circumstances and sensitivities. They are best placed to know the needs of the community and to express concerns that might not have been considered about the consequences of a conversion. They can reflect on the impact on neighbouring schools.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="10062129000048"></a>I also believe that there must be parental involvement from the first if the schools are to succeed. That means involvement in a parental consultation process. To have one or possibly two parents on the governing body that makes an application to the Secretary of State is not enough. Wider consultation with parents is needed.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1226"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1226</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100621-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="10062129000049"></a>The Secretary of State has said publicly that he hopes that some schools will be able to convert to academy status by the beginning of the new academic year this September. Some looking at this from the outside suspect that the haste and determination with which these schools are to be converted owe more to political considerations than to any particular urgency. I believe that there is more to this issue than politics. Introducing a proper measure of consultation would enable the Government to demonstrate that this Bill is not just about politics but about improving standards and improving our education system. However, time is needed for consultation. If that means that schools that are anxious to become academies have to wait a few more months before they can do so, so be it. Consultation is important for the schools and for communities.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="10062129000050"></a>In the Statement, I think that the Minister said-I may be mistaken-that there would be consultation on the setting up of free schools. Why is there to be consultation on free schools, which will then become academies, but no consultation on academies in relation to this Bill?</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="10062129000051"></a>In my view, consultation is the key to the success of these new academies. Consultation, when properly undertaken, is a means of ensuring that the right policy for a particular school is pursued and of ensuring the wider ownership of this policy. It will engender the confidence of parents, pupils, staff and the community. This is a means of ensuring the success of the policy.</p>

I am not quite sure why Amendment 3A is in the group-I think that it should have been in a previous one-but the rest of the amendments are all about consultation. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, that appropriate consultation, over a sufficient time, leads to good decision-making. The decision that schools have to make about conversion to academy status is terribly important, so I think that they should consult.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="10062129000053"></a>I have a few words to say about the amendments tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Royall and Lady Morgan. I am not sure why they felt the need to include CRB checks in Amendment 4A. I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that all those who had dealings with schools had to have CRB checks anyway. Indeed, I know a young teacher who does both paid and voluntary work in a number of schools and has had four CRB checks. I hope that the coalition Government will smooth out that totally unnecessary duplication. Also, surely the Government normally do due diligence on anyone with whom they intend to sign a contract, so I think that the second subsection in the amendment may be superfluous, too.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="10062129000054"></a>The main point of this debate is consultation. Of course schools should consult all the relevant people and provide them with the information that they need to be able to respond appropriately. To become an academy is an enormous change in the governance and funding of a school. Indeed, I think that it is very risky, as Clause 1(2)(b) and Clause 1(3)(b) give enormous  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1227"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1227</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>power to the Secretary of State without any scrutiny by Parliament. Perhaps we will get that changed during the Bill's passage through your Lordships' House. We will discuss the merits of these arrangements later, but the fact remains that a school that becomes an academy under the Bill does so entirely at the whim of the Secretary of State, so it needs to be sure about the potential benefits of the change to the education that it provides to all the children in its locality.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="10062129000055"></a>Incidentally, I do not believe that these schools should be called "independent", as they have been described. They will be totally dependent on the Secretary of State for their funding and the terms of their operation. My noble friend Lord Greaves referred to them as "autonomous", which I believe is a better expression.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="10062129000056"></a>The difference between our amendment on consultation and those tabled by the Opposition is that we do not include the trade unions. I thought that I should explain why that is. Unions are national organisations, whereas we have proposed consulting local people or organisations that have a keen interest in the school. No national organisation can have a relevant view of the merits of the application of every individual school. The local people matter here and it is they who should be consulted.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="10062129000057"></a>That is especially true of the children. I have been in your Lordships' House for 10 years. At the start, when the Labour Government brought legislation before us, we had to put down a lot of amendments about what I call the voice of the child. Gradually, the Government got the message and, I am glad to say, such provisions started to appear in Bills, so we did not need to put down those amendments. I hope that the Minister will take into account the fact that, when you consult children about things that affect them, you get better decision-making. I also hope that, if he cannot accept these amendments, he will at least put this in guidance, so that schools have to consult the appropriate people.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="10062129000058"></a>On the matter of the documents that should be sent out to the people who are being consulted, Amendments 101 and 102 are far too prescriptive. We would leave it to the schools to judge what material it is appropriate to send out. On these Benches we intended to add something much briefer and less prescriptive but it got lost and did not go down in the end. The period suggested for the consultation is six weeks by the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, and four weeks by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. However, the school will have to make the TUPE arrangements with staff, which requires 10 weeks and should not be during the school holidays. Schools will have to take a lot longer than four weeks, and so they should. I have already urged my right honourable friend Michael Gove to hasten slowly, and I shall do the same to my noble friend Lord Hill. That should be the watchword. The decision does not need to be fast but it needs to be right.</p>

This is a very strange part of the Bill, and I am not sure what the rationale behind it is. The Bill purports to want to know the views of people in communities or schools where children's lives are affected by what legislation  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1228"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1228</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>says. However, it excludes from consultation at key points anybody outside the school. I wonder if this comes from the Government's fears over what happened when they had ballots over grant-maintained schools. If so, I well understand that. That was a procedure that ended up causing terrible arguments and distrust between groups of people and communities who should have been working together. There is absolutely no way that I would want to return to that. Indeed, in my time at the department, we did not have ballots in that manner. I am sympathetic, but the Minister mentioned in the last debate that people are somehow suspicious of academies and free schools. There is no better way of making them more suspicious than to exclude them from being consulted. If the Minister accepts that that suspicion is already there, I am not sure why he wants to risk building it up by, as I say, excluding people from consultation.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="10062129000060"></a>I have two more points. When this issue has previously been raised in the course of the Bill, the Minister said that the previous Government did not have means of consulting anyway. Correct me if I am wrong, but the essential difference was that, under the legislation used by the previous Government, one school was closed and a new one was opened. The consultation took place as part of the school closure and opening. In the Bill, the conversion of a school-as far as I can see, there is no official closure and opening-excludes any consultation at all.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="10062129000061"></a>Finally, the amendments do not seek to take away from the Secretary of State the right to decide whether or not a school should be granted academy status. You might argue that they ought to, but they do not. I cannot see that they would delay any consideration. If I was the Secretary of State in this situation, I would want to put myself in a position where I took the community with me, just to give any new school the best possible start to its life. To load a school with potential suspicion when that need not be the case is really not acceptable. To accept amendments along these lines, if not in such detail, would be very good for any schools that become academies under this legislation.</p>

I have been involved with three academies. I chaired the first and co-chaired the second. The first academy arose from community consultation. When there was anxiety in the community over the other two, there was consultation which allayed people's fears. I put it to the Government that the people who are being proposed for consultation-young people, parents, governing bodies-are the constituent parts of the big society. It seems a contradiction that if you want to build the big society, you then exclude the very people who are the essence of it. Consultation is called for here.</p>

It is interesting that several differing groups have tabled more or less the same sort of amendments, calling for much greater consultation. The differences between us tend, perhaps, to reflect  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1229"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1229</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>our own particular interests. The whole area of consultation is crucial and I agree entirely with what the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said about consulting parents, children and young people. This is crucial in today's world. They will certainly have a view. We can disagree about trade unions but they could be relevant on the ground in local areas.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="10062129000064"></a>The point I would like to stress in my amendment is that the governing bodies of other schools in the areas which might reasonably be considered to be affected by the making of an academy order, should be consulted. This comes back to the wider issue of whether the academy will advantage or disadvantage the rest of the school population in the area. The Minister stressed that he is not disallowing consultation. He is no doubt encouraging it, but he is not giving the view that it should definitely happen. It is not compulsory. I would like to see in the Bill some degree of requiring that consultation take place. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, is not very keen on the second half of our amendment. Nevertheless, if you want to set out a range of issues that need to be looked at and thought about before deciding whether to apply to become an academy, that half is important too.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="10062129000065"></a>Finally, there is the letter to Peers dated 15 June from the noble Lord, Lord Hill, in which he wrote about understanding the importance of parental engagement with the conversion process. Everybody is very pleased to see him acknowledging this in the Committee. However, the Department for Education's guidance to schools wishing to become academies suggests only that schools consider how they might wish to inform staff, pupils and parents of the intended conversion. That is not what I would call consultation before a decision is made by the governing body. It is about informing stakeholders once a decision has been made. I gather, too, that this guidance has not been changed since the letter from the noble Lord, Lord Hill, advising schools to engage with parents. I would have thought that this would be something that the department should include and send off to the various areas that need to consider this issue. On that basis, I would certainly support what the noble Baroness said in moving the first amendment. All the points that she made are very important in making a decision.</p>

One is children, who were mentioned earlier by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and the other is schools in the area. On children, Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child so beloved of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, gives children the right to express views on all matters affecting them and to have these views given due weight. Failing to consult students on matters that may alter both the character and curriculum of their school is a backward step in implementing Article 12. The Government should seriously think about consulting children.</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="10062129000067"></a>I believe that academies do not have to be part of the local family of schools and that there is no obligation to co-operate with other neighbourhood schools. Unfortunately, I cannot remember where the survey

It was taken a few years ago and involved schools situated near academies. It appears that only 27 per cent of those schools were consulted about the academy proposals, 32 per cent said that the academy specialism was not shared with them, 23 per cent said that it had a negative impact on intake and 36 per cent said that it had a negative impact on the allocation of resources. In order to remove the suspicion about which my noble friend Lady Morris spoke, to get better decisions on these issues and to move slowly, we need to take communities along. Therefore, I urge the Minister to look again at involving local schools that may be affected by the development of an academy.</p>

The first is that of good practice in the establishment of academies, which was rightly raised by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool. It is clearly good practice that maximum efforts are made to engage the local community. Indeed, it is very unlikely that an academy proposal will be a success if it does not have a very wide measure of support from the parental body, the staff body and the wider community. As the right reverend Prelate rightly says, although the statutory consultation requirements are not present in the case of academies because very few statutory requirements apply in respect to academies, an elaborate process of consultation has taken place in relation to their establishment. In virtually every case consent has been given before an academy is established. I say "virtually" because, in the case of some failing schools, it is not possible to gain the consent of the parental body or sometimes even of the governing body. However, that is distinct from the precise provisions we propose to put in the law. As soon as you read Amendment 4A tabled by my noble friend Lady Morgan, you will see the difficulty of trying to put this into legislation. Having dealt with these issues at the Dispatch Box over a long period, I can say that they are only too clear to me. My noble friend's amendment says that the groups to be consulted must include those it is perfectly reasonable to include, such as:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="10062129000203"></a>"(a) the parents of children of the school</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="10062129000204"></a>(b) the children and young people of the school".</p>

<a name="100621-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="10062129000069"></a>I entirely agree with my noble friend Lady Massey about the importance of consulting pupils. One of the things the previous Government did which I think was a big step forward was strongly to encourage pupil engagement in schools, including with school councils, which were a very worthwhile development in schools in recent years. I would certainly expect to see school councils consulted before proposals of this kind came forward. However, paragraphs (f) and (g) of the amendment move into the land of the extremely subjective and difficult to determine. Paragraph (f) refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="10062129000211"></a>"any local authority which sends a significant proportion of children to the school".</ul>
<p><a name="10062129000190"></a>What is "significant"? We shall be in the courts as soon as an application is challenged on the meaning of "significant". Paragraph (g) refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="10062129000212"></a>"the governing bodies of other schools in the area which might reasonably be considered to be affected by the arrangements".</ul>

I am sure that we very much support what the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said about the desirability of reducing the impact of litigation in this area, as that could at best produce only bitterness. Although it might provide rewards for some, it is not a particularly attractive process. Perhaps the consultation should be the responsibility of the Secretary of State rather than of one of the parties given that consultation originated by the Secretary of State, on an application being made to him or her, would be more likely to be regarded as proper consultation than would consultation initiated by the party making the application. Open-mindedness is implicit in the notion of consultation and I am not certain that a party wanting to make an application would necessarily have sufficient detachment to make the consultation effective.</p>

There has to be meaningful consultation in this regard. If we are dealing with a school judged outstanding by Ofsted, and the governing body and the head teacher have said that they wish to apply for academy status because they believe that it will give them greater freedom, then what exactly is there to consult about? There seems to me to be a strong case there. I noted the comments made about the right of children to be consulted under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, who consulted the children when a school was failing? Where was their voice then? Who came round with a clipboard saying, "Tell me what you think about the fact that you're getting 20 per cent five A to Cs when the guys up the road are getting 60 and 70 per cent"? We have to be clear about what the consultation seeks to achieve and be absolutely sure that we are not trying to delay a process. The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, and his successor wrestled with that process in relation to the academy programme. Consultation could sometimes go on for years while

Where a school body has an outstanding record, the process should be allowed to proceed on the say-so of its governing body. However, where a school is failing, in my view the governing body has forgone any rights in that regard and the Secretary of State has a right to intervene. That is in the best interests of children and parents.</p>

I discussed the matter this weekend with two chairs of school governing bodies in the area where I live. One of the schools is not sure what to do but has probably made further investigations and is therefore probably on the Government's list of those schools that have made inquiries. It would rather not take this step but is wondering whether it will be forced to do so because otherwise it will be bad for the school. However, schools should not take this step for that reason. The second school has said plainly that it will not apply, no matter how good it is, because it does not want to break its links with the local authority. That is the school's decision. Just because a school is outstanding does not mean that it is the right thing for that school to become an academy. A decision has to be made by the people connected with the school and, in my view, by the local community as a whole. As the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said, if the proposal does not have considerable local support, it is unlikely to succeed.</p>

<a name="100621-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="10062129000075"></a>I have a further amendment on this matter in the next group. As well as being confused about other things in the Bill, I am confused about today's groupings, which all seem to be mixed up. Unfortunately I was stranded in Yorkshire this morning-the overhead wires were down in the Keighley area, and now I cannot even ask the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, to intervene in the situation-so I could not get here in time to sort out the groupings in relation to my amendments. Noble Lords will therefore have to listen to me again on the next grouping.</p>

<a name="100621-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="10062129000076"></a>However, the issue of the wider community-to which I referred at Second Reading, in comments to which the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, kindly referred-is crucial and must be addressed. That would address some of the problems which the noble Lord referred to in terms of getting it right. Of course you have to get it right. However, I do not agree that the principle of consultation should not be in the Bill because the specific amendments which have been put forward are not quite right. I think that the Government will find it a great deal easier to get support for the Bill, and to get it through Parliament a bit quicker, if they are prepared to look very seriously at this issue.</p>

<a name="100621-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="10062129000077"></a>The real problem is that the Secretary of State, Michael Gove, whom I admire in many ways, is a man with a rather revolutionary mission on this and other matters. Although I am all in favour of revolution, I am a liberal, and revolution must be based on two things. First, it has to be evolutionary-however revolutionary the end product is-and you must get there slowly or fairly slowly. Secondly, you have to take people with you. A sort of Leninist revolution whereby there is a leadership which everyone follows, and if people do not follow it someone such as Stalin

You must take people with you. A good process of consultation and debate locally among interest groups such as teachers, who have a legitimate interest in the school, and the wider community, is crucial.</p>

<a name="100621-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="10062129000078"></a>The Secretary of State has impaled himself on a problem by setting September as the date by when the first new academies should be set up. Looking at the parliamentary timetable, I am not sure that this legislation can get through by September-not because it will be blocked or obstructed, but simply because of the time that it takes to reach the statute book. There is talk of bringing the Commons back, but if the Commons makes a few changes to the Bill, it will have to come back here, which would mean that it will not go through until we come back in October, unless we are all to be dragged back here screaming in September to get the Bill through in the interests of the revolution. I am not sure that the House of Lords is a body which usually marches behind revolutions-but who knows?</p>

<a name="100621-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="10062129000079"></a>The Government must get themselves off this hook on which they have impaled themselves. They should accept that to do it properly-and it has to be done properly if it is going to work-it will take a bit longer. That is not delaying the legislation by years. Clearly that would be ridiculous. We need a sensible timetable, a sensible way of doing it, and a sensible way of getting local communities-all the people involved in the school, and other schools-to understand and to come to agreements on what is going to happen. If the process is done on the basis of a school selfishly and aggressively breaking away, it will not work. If it is done by agreement among people locally that this is an evolutionary way forward that will probably lead to other schools in the area becoming academies in due course, and if it is done in a sensible and organised way, then it might work.</p>

The only disagreement is on whether one needs to legislate for consultation or whether one trusts sensible and grown-up people to behave in a way which guarantees-or provides as near a guarantee as is possible-that their move towards academy status will be a success and will be accepted. As the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, has said, there are very few examples where consultation does not happen-not because it has been legislated for, but because grown-up people have behaved in a grown-up way.</p>

They do not address the issue of creating an entirely new school, when there will be no pupils, parents or staff. Yet the need for consultation when a brand new school is created is surely pre-eminently more obvious than for even a school which is converting. I merely make that point; maybe my noble friend will provide some reassurance on that issue.</p>

Perhaps I may briefly restate the amendments.</p>

<a name="100621-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="10062129000085"></a>Amendment 3A would change who the Secretary of State could enter into academy arrangements with from a person to an individual or organisation. This is an unnecessary amendment because in law, a "person" is taken to mean either an individual or an organisation.</p>

<a name="100621-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="10062129000086"></a>Amendments 4A, 101 and 102 would require proper checks of any person who was party to academy arrangements and, with Amendment 104, require the governing body of a maintained school to consult certain persons listed in the amendments before applying to the Secretary of State for an academy order. These people would include pupils at school, parents, school staff, staff trade unions, relevant local authorities, other local schools who might be affected and any other person who it is appropriate to consult. It is important to be clear that current legislation does not address these issues. These would be additional legislative requirements that the noble Baroness is seeking to introduce, although I recognise the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, quite properly and fairly about the change in status; currently there would be an obligation to consult if the school was to close. The circumstances are different and she is right about that.</p>

<a name="100621-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="10062129000087"></a>I will first respond to the broad thrust of what the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, asked-why the urgency? Why can we not take some time? That point was in some way echoed by my noble friend Lord Greaves. I know that I have made this point repeatedly, but part of the answer to the urgency question is that, five years ago, the Government of whom she was a member set out down this path. Five years later, we are still debating it and that represents another five years of children who have not been able to take advantage of some of these freedoms that I know her party, when in government, were keen to extend. In another part of the answer to the urgency question, I underline the point that we made in previous debates that our approach to this legislation is fundamentally permissive, rather than coercive. Simply by putting a flyer there and saying to schools, "Is anyone interested in this? Are these freedoms something of which you would like to avail yourselves?", more than 1,750 schools have said that they would be interested. Thinking about the

One needs to listen to those who are clearly keen to get on and feel that there is a need for urgency. My starting point in this is not so much the question of why we need to move so rapidly as of what is preventing us getting our skates on.</p>

<a name="100621-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="10062129000088"></a>I turn to a specific point which my noble friend Lady Walmsley has already picked up on. It is already part of our process to carry out full due-diligence checks on anyone who is party to a funding agreement, and regulations also require CRB checking of all governors. I, like many Members of the Committee, I suspect, have been CRB-checked more times than I care to remember-although not because there was a particular problem, I should make clear.</p>

<a name="100621-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="10062129000089"></a>I was struck by the point that the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, made about drawing a distinction between the spirit of consultation and making it a legislative requirement. He gave examples of the difficulty of getting a satisfactory definition in the Bill within which everyone could operate-and which did not have the problem alluded to by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, of the old system of ballots, which caused acrimony-and which would not give people who, for particular reasons, might want to frustrate this policy the opportunity to do so. I think that there is broad acceptance on her side of the Committee that the policy is fundamentally good, and these are the detailed questions that we are working through. I was very persuaded by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, concerning the dangers of being overly legalistic. However, I also accept the point made by him and many other noble Lords on all sides of the House about the spirit of consultation. It is something that clearly one must take seriously.</p>

<a name="100621-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="10062129000090"></a>We certainly expect schools, in deciding whether to make an application to convert, to discuss their intention with students, their parents and the local community. A point that has been well made by a number of Members of the Committee is that that is what happens already, and it would not make sense for a school not to do so. The governing body of any maintained school that is considering converting does, and will, include parent governors, staff governors and local authority governors. These governors will all be part of the decision-making process. Currently, the employer of a school's staff would also need to conduct a TUPE consultation with all staff and the unions as part of the staff transfer process. On a small point of fact-I know that this point has been raised before-I say to my noble friend Lady Walmsley that there is not a minimum 10-week consultation period; the time is not specified in law but there would clearly have to be consultation with all staff and the unions as part of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="10062129000091"></a>In response to a point about informal consultation that I think was made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe-I hope I shall be forgiven if it was not her-I shall try to be brief as I know that supper beckons. The departmental website will make it absolutely clear that we expect teaching staff, other staff, parents,

The question with which we are grappling-the debate has grappled with it this evening-is how far this process needs to be formalised, with the risk that that might either slow it down or make the process acrimonious.

The point about whether schools will be able to convert in time for September has certainly been raised, and there has been a suggestion that the timetable has been politically driven.

Some schools may well convert in time for September, which we think is perfectly possible, as my noble friend says, but other schools will no doubt take longer, and that is also fine.</p>

As I said, I recognise the points that have been made about the spirit of consultation, and I can say to the Committee that I am willing to take that thought back to the department and consider how best we can ensure that the conversion process carries the confidence of all interested parties-a point made forcefully this afternoon. On that point, I urge the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

It is not that I do not trust people; I fundamentally trust human beings-that is my position. However, I recognise that the need for consultation was not enshrined in the previous Act and that, to date, academies have undertaken consultations because they have believed it to be the proper thing to do, which it is. However, there have been about 200 academies to date and we are now talking about a further 200, another 200 and another 200. If free schools all become academies, that will be an awful lot of schools. We are talking about a fundamental change in our education system.

The instrument that I am praying against is not of his genesis and if I get hot under the collar I hope he will accept that I am not aiming at him in any way.</p>

<a name="100621-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="10062129000100"></a>The instrument first appeared before your Lordships' Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee with a very inadequate Explanatory Memorandum. When the committee challenged them we were given more data that not only amplified what had been there before but indeed said different things. The first thing I want to say is that I very much hope that my noble friend will see the importance of making sure that Explanatory Memoranda accurately and fully reflect the intentions and details of the instruments concerned.</p>

It seems odd to be conducting research into what is effectively how to shift money from one government pocket into another. Here we are concerned with people on benefits. Even with the generosity of the past 13 years, benefits are still pretty marginal. If we consider the list of deductions that are generally allowed, such as mortgage payments, rent arrears, fuel and water charges, child support arrears, and so on, they are pretty important and essential to life. Yes, we allow fines to be deducted too, but that is when a court pronounces that there is a serious punishment involved. I do not think that debts to the Inland Revenue rank alongside that. Given that social security payments are basically set so that a person can meet life's essentials, how is someone supposed to

They can end up only in a worse position by having to rely on the state to a greater extent. Hence my feeling that this is just shifting money from one pocket to another.</p>

<a name="100621-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="10062129000102"></a>There are other problems with this. We are not looking at large debts, but what will be the cost of recovery of these debts? Are we not looking at a system that actually costs more in its administrative functions than the money that it will recover? Is that an appropriate use of time when it comes to poor people? What is a tax debt anyway? If one is moving in and out of employment, a tax debt varies with the month. You can start off appearing to owe the Inland Revenue a good deal of money because you have not paid. You are then unemployed for six months and your allowances accumulate and you end the tax year with the Inland Revenue owing you money. It is not at all clear whether we are talking about debts that are in some way established or whether they just appear to be debts at a particular moment but may well not be debts six months later. It is an odd thing to be spending time on. This is persecuting poor people when the department ought to be trying to extract money in ways that are more efficient and have less of an impact on the very poorest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="10062129000103"></a>My reason for bringing forward this Motion is the statistical inadequacy of what is proposed even with the additional explanation that I have been provided with. I know, or at least I believe I know, that the Department for Work and Pensions has a number of good statisticians-I am assured by no less than Andrew Dilnot that this is the case-but they do not appear to have been involved in the design of this research. The first thing we get is that about 5,000 tax credit customers and 5,000 self-assessment customers will be approached to volunteer to take part in the trial. Those 10,000 will then be divided into those who agree and those who do not agree. Those two groups are fundamentally different. The group which agrees will have one set of motivations and the group which does not agree will have another set. You immediately get into deep statistical water in trying to draw any conclusions when comparing two groups with different motivations. There is an attempt in the design of this experiment to compensate for that by having a third group-a control group. Presumably one could try to work out the behaviour of the first group-those who volunteer for the trial-by subtracting the behaviour of the second group from the control group and supposedly having a control for the first group.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="10062129000104"></a>Given the wide diversity of circumstances, we are looking at a sample that to my mind is far too small to allow that kind of second-hand approach to generating reliable results. It is a daft way of going about it when we have a perfectly good and statistically valid way of doing it, which is to double the number who agree to take part in the trial and then put only a randomised half of them through it. You would then have a matched group which will give some pretty statistically valid results. Even then the experimental design will tell you how well it works only for those who are motivated to take part in the trial. It tells you nothing about the behaviour and circumstances of those who are not motivated to take part in the trial. We are not

We are dealing with human characteristics and you cannot read those across from one group to another when you have already separated them on the basis of a fundamental characteristic such as motivation. If you wanted to find out something about the second group-those who refuse, who I suspect will be the large majority-you have to conduct a pilot that is not sample-based but area-based. The previous Government did that on several occasions. I can remember the pilots coming through the Merits Committee. A particular office would switch to a new system and would compare its results with a neighbouring, similarly placed office's results. If you have enough other data on your claimants, you can make that reasonably statistically reliable. You could even run a randomised control through an office. But what is proposed here would not yield any useful information on the behaviour of the second group-those who refused to take part in the trial-were they to be moved to be compelled to under the new proposed system.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="10062129000105"></a>There is no defence in the documents that I have seen of sample size, no discussion of anticipated errors, no discussion of what are the real targets, what is expected to be achieved and what are the expected problems. There is no demonstration of the validity of the methods being set out. We have here a simple case of garbage in, garbage out. A trial on those lines will not yield any useful results. If we proceed on the basis of the results that it yields, we will have no clue whether the full, scaled-up system will work. I am comforted that the Social Security Advisory Committee, at paragraph 4.16 of its report, shares my view.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="10062129000106"></a>I welcome trials-they are an excellent way to make progress in the area of benefits and social security, to find out what works before one commits oneself to a whole system-but I ask the Minister to ensure that the people who really understand what are the same sort of statistical operation as drug trials have control over what goes on, make sure that what is designed is fit for purpose and ensure that the data that the trials produce can be relied on for policy formation. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="10062129000108"></a>Before going any further, we have discovered from the response given by my right honourable friend Steve Webb to a letter from the chairman of the Merits Committee last Session that the new Government may decide not to go ahead with this pilot, but I suppose that we must carry on as though they will go ahead at this stage, unless the Minister wants to interrupt at this point to say that they will not. There is no interruption, so I shall carry on.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="10062129000109"></a>First, I am glad that the Government have listened to the Social Security Advisory Committee's recommendation, which urged them to bring the list of  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1240"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1240</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>benefits from which HMRC debt recovery repayments can be made into line with the current list of benefits from which priority debts can be deducted. In other words, any deductions would be from means-tested and not contribution-based benefits. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, about that being money from the poorest people in the country, whichever benefit it is from.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="10062129000110"></a>I am also glad that the SSAC highlighted the vital point that claimants understand the voluntary nature of the trial and the impact on their income of signing up for the trial. A lot of people will not know what "voluntary" means-although they may pretend that they do. The Government have responded positively to that point, saying that they will share copies of the letters sent to claimants with the committee, and that they will ensure that the letters, and contact centre staff, will direct the claimant, or customer, to the availability of independent advice.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="10062129000111"></a>The SSAC understandably believes that there is scope for confusion among claimants who receive letters from HMRC. Just seeing that letterhead is likely to lead to many claimants into thinking they are being hounded for recovery of their tax credit overpayments, whatever the letter actually states. If claimants then telephone HMRC, is the Minister satisfied that they will be told in every case that they do not have to repay their debts by having them deducted from their benefits? Will they be told in all cases that they might want to take independent advice, which might lead to some of their debt being overturned or even written off?</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="10062129000112"></a>Before leaving the subject of letters from HMRC, perhaps the Minister can tell us why it does not provide an explanation of a tax credit overpayment to claimants in all cases; that seems not to be provided as a matter of routine. I cannot think why not. I know that the Minister does not speak for HMRC, but as this SI is a joint project between the two departments, I make no apology for asking him that on this occasion.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="10062129000113"></a>We must remember that the Government did not agree with the SSAC that repayment should be at a lower level than they are proposing in this trial, which is three times the normal amount per week. As the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, pointed out, benefits are not generous, and there are rumours that they will not be uprated as usual-we shall hear more in tomorrow's Budget. If claimants in debt have no other source of income except their weekly benefits, many of them will suffer severe hardship if they are being encouraged to repay their tax credit overpayment from those pretty meagre benefits. I may have got the wrong end of the stick here, but I find it horrifying that the SSAC understands that HMRC staff may suggest that debtors apply for a commercial loan to pay off debts-presumably they would never suggest a commercial loan to pay off a tax credit overpayment.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="10062129000114"></a>Turning to the design of the pilot, and first, to the aim of the pilot, this appears to be twofold: to find out if there is a demand from claimants for this method of repayment-that sounds almost like an oxymoron-and to see if the scheme is cost-effective. There is more information in the answers to questions from the ever-vigilant Merits Committee about how the scheme  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1241"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1241</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will operate. As the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said, there are to be three groups for evaluation purposes. The first group will be those who volunteer to take part in the trial. The explanation goes:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="10062129000205"></a>"The evaluation will look at how much was recovered, the spread of weekly deduction rates, how long a person is in receipt of a relevant benefit and what could have been recovered had they been taking part in the trial for the whole two years taking account of expected levels of movement on and off benefit".</p>

<p><a name="10062129000193"></a>That sounds fiendishly complicated with so many permutations that you wonder whether any comparisons will really make sense. The next two groups are about those who declined to take part in the trial who will form the control group. First, they have to agree to respond to a letter asking them to take part. I wonder how many will be keen to do that. Not very many, I imagine. Therefore, a key question is: how small does the sample size have to be to produce robust data? I note that the Government say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="10062129000206"></a>"We accept that the smaller the sample, the less able we will be to draw definitive conclusions."</p>

<p><a name="10062129000194"></a>I also note what the Government say about those who go off benefit during the pilot period; namely, that there is no minimum number of weeks for which deductions have to be made in order to regard the participant and repayments made as significant for evaluation purposes. I would have thought that was a rather significant fact.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="10062129000115"></a>Perhaps the most encouraging sentence in the whole explanation is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="10062129000207"></a>"In addition the performance of new joined up operational processes between HMRC and DWP will be assessed".</p>

<p><a name="10062129000195"></a>Is the Minister really confident that this trial will produce a reliable result, in view of all the problems that the SSAC and others have pointed out?</p>

The Merits Committee reported to the House on this matter in April and again following a meeting last week. He has deployed all the considerations that we had in mind with his usual thoroughness. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, added to that. We will hear what the noble Lord on the Opposition Front Bench has to say. Whether to proceed with the trial is clearly a matter that will have to be considered in the light of, among other things, what is said tonight. A very large number of people, including the poorest people in our society, are involved in all this, and we look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say, but it is an extremely important matter.</p>

I start by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, on joining the Motion-to-regret club. The bad news for him is that the chairman is my noble friend Lady Thomas, I am the secretary, and he will now have to be the treasurer because there are only three of us who have been through this process. He is a very welcome addition to the clan. It is a very distinguished group, as my noble friend said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="10062129000118"></a>I will take a slightly wider look at the background to the order. I am very worried that it will become a default option for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs,  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1242"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1242</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which would be a very bad thing. The first thing that we should bear in mind is that we are talking about recovering overpayments that have been made by the Treasury. A number of questions flow from that if it is true, which I believe it is. Why on earth is the department rolling out pilots of this kind at a time of real stress and difficulty, with administrative cuts and all sorts of pressure on DWP staff? I make no complaint about that because I think we are all prepared for it, but these are some of the most difficult financial circumstances that low-income households have ever faced. This is a once-in-100-years event-I have certainly seen nothing like it in the 30 years that I have been in public life-and we should not start spraying letters around to people who are in debt only to the extent that the Treasury has miscalculated the amount of tax credits that they are due. We have to bear in mind the fact that this is not just debt but an overpayment; it is a function of error at the hands of Treasury officials. We have to be very careful about the context in which we are sending these letters and raising these proposals, even though this is supposed to be a voluntary scheme.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="10062129000119"></a>Incidentally, I do not expect the department to have these figures available in the Minister's brief this evening, but I would be very interested to know how many customers on benefit are affected by self-assessment error. There cannot be a big number of them across the country. Self-assessment is used mainly by people who are outside PAYE and who are self-employed and the like, so the question of self-assessment by people on benefit puzzles me, given the constrained nature of the benefits to which this order applies. How many people across the country in the system are in that position?</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="10062129000120"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Freud, cares about this and is enthusiastic about reform. The complexity of the system is part of the reason why these overpayments are made in the first place, and rolling out pilots to mitigate the damage that is done by complexity and error is the wrong way around. We should concentrate, and I believe that he will concentrate, on getting the system right first time and on not creating the overpayments in the tax credit system that create these debts. We need a root and branch review, and I hope that he will not lose his enthusiasm for that. Knowing him, I think that that is unlikely. I would strengthen his hand to get this done. It will not happen quickly, but I hope that he will use his undoubted expertise in financial systems to help to bring that about.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="10062129000121"></a>Secondly, third-party deductions are a very important part of the social security benefit system. They were contrived in 1988 and were an anti-poverty measure to protect levels of benefits. The Social Security Advisory Committee's report on this shows-at paragraph 4.4, table 1-that mortgage payments, rent arrears and fuel charges were the essential things for which deductions could be made. People needed a deduction for housing or they were evicted, and they needed a deduction for fuel charges or they became hypothermic. That was why the third-party deduction system was put into place. It has been extended as the SSAC memorandum suggests, most recently for child maintenance purposes in 2006. However, we must be very careful about why and when we use third-party deductions or we get into  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1243"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1243</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>management objectives and not anti-poverty ones. Third-party deductions should be used absolutely only in circumstances in which they cannot be avoided. Benefit levels are already at poverty levels. Measured against average median household incomes, poverty levels are built into some of the levels of benefit that we have at the moment. We should interfere with third-party deductions only with great care. The SSAC memorandum says-an occasional paper was done on this in 2008-that we should look at all these things and indicates the part that the social fund should play in dealing with anti-poverty.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="10062129000122"></a>My noble friend mentioned the hardship rules, which are important. There are some circumstances, which I came across myself not that long ago, where write-offs would have been properly argued and could have been suggested in ways that would help the households. But they are able to be determined only by people who know what they are doing. Citizens Advice and independent financial advisers who specialise in this kind of work and who know what they are doing can make recommendations which otherwise would be left unknown to the households that these things affect.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="10062129000123"></a>Thirdly, this cannot be done without safe, independent financial advice. I know that the FSA has tried to roll out a financial capability scheme-it may have been caught by purdah during the general election campaign-but we can be sure that these debts are being recovered safely, even in a so-called voluntary capacity, only if there is independent advice to which people can be referred so that they know that what they are doing is sensible in the totality of their debts.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="10062129000124"></a>The excellent recent publication, <I>State of the nation report: poverty, worklessness and welfare dependency in the UK</I>, produced by the Secretary of State, states that 79 million people in the United Kingdom are in serious debt. An independent advisory service would serve not only the purposes of these regulations but would have a wider purpose as well. One could argue that some FSA rules about treating customers fairly would require people repaying debts to HMRC to be given a statement of what their repayments are doing in terms of extinguishing the debt over a period of weeks or months, but I hope not years. There are no statements. In my experience, a lot of people have no idea of how their benefit payments are made up or of what payments are being made to other parts of the system which may also have third party deductions on their benefits.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="10062129000125"></a>The treating customers fairly rules of the FSA should be applied if this pilot ever is rolled out across the country because £9.75-the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, effectively made this point-to a household operating on a weekly cash basis, as a lot of benefit families and households are, is a huge amount of money. Many of these households have to work on a cash basis from week to week, robbing Peter to pay Paul and trying to stay out of default. It is a very difficult balancing act for them to manage.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="10062129000126"></a>As regards the timing of this, the earlier memorandum and other papers suggested that a roll-out would almost be upon us even now. The response from Steve Webb to the committee at a later stage made it clear that there was some reconsideration of whether the  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1244"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1244</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>thing would even start. This is an important moment to stop and think about whether the pilot is necessary and, even if it were was successful, whether we are creating a default option which just makes it easier for the Treasury and HMRC to correct errors that they should not have made in the first place.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="10062129000127"></a>Finally, the SSAC recommendations, taken together with the timing and the context into which these pilots are being introduced, are inimical to the interests of benefit households in the way that they are currently cast. I for one would recommend to the Minister that he suggests that this pilot is cancelled.</p>

As other speakers have said, he has joined the exclusive band of those involved in Motions of Regret, one that I myself have joined, although I have been on the receiving end of several. I should say that I find myself in the rather unusual position of dealing with regulations that were promulgated under the previous Government and for which I would have had some responsibility in terms of explaining and defending, but a responsibility from which I am now free.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="10062129000129"></a>In his introduction, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, talked about how these regulations would persecute poor people. If that was what they were about, the Government of which I was a member would have had nothing to do with them, and I am sure that that runs for the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Freud. The noble Lord also said that people can only end up in a worse position. Again, if that were the case it would not be something that I or the former Government would have wanted to have any truck with. This does not inevitably have to involve that position because it is a voluntary scheme with maximum amounts, and of course collecting debt in this way is cost-free to the individual, although there may well be administrative costs for HMRC and the DWP. One of the other ironies we are faced with is that my noble friend Lord Rosser, who joins me on the Front Bench, was previously chair of the Merits Committee. I think that he preceded the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, and in his time has been responsible for various Exocets, of which this may have been one.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="10062129000130"></a>I cannot support the Motion tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, because I do not think that he has made his case, but I accept that the explanations given in the Explanatory Memorandum and initially to the Social Security Advisory Committee and the Merits Committee could have done more to set out the detail of the proposal, especially the methodology and the evaluation, but in our view the response of Steve Webb, Minister of State for Pensions-I still have to pinch myself when I say that-to the Merits Committee has, in our view, gone some way to rectify that.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="10062129000131"></a>However, we have a timely opportunity to reflect on these regulations and to take the coalition Government's mind on them. As the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, both mentioned, Steve Webb's response indicated the possibility that the Government may choose not to proceed with the pilot at this time. Can the Minister give us an update  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1245"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1245</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on this and indicate the factors that will be taken into account in making any decision to defer? The proposed trial is of course partly focused on the recovery of tax credit overpayments. I am bound to say that, as I understand it, they do not inevitably flow from official errors-they are not necessarily the only cause-but we will have to see the extent to which the proposals might be affected by the cuts in tax credits that the Government are poised to announce tomorrow. We have heard the coalition promise to reform the administration of tax credits so as to reduce fraud and overpayments, and again we will have to see what that means in practice. If it can be accomplished in a fair way and without impairing take-up, all well and good, but the emphasis should be on the "if".</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="10062129000132"></a>It is accepted that the transition from work to benefits is a difficult one and can pose problems with budgeting for the repayment of existing debt, so these proposals offer help to those who cannot afford to settle their debts in one go. They provide a nil cost method of payment and are in addition to the other methods of payment available. Given our debate this evening, can the Minister tell us more about these other methods and whether there are any proposals to extend or restrict them? The principle of an additional voluntary method for people to repay tax overpayments has been welcomed by the SSAC and the respondents to the consultation undertaken by the committee were positive about the proposals.</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="10062129000133"></a>One of the concerns expressed by the SSAC was the proposed maximum level of deduction for tax credits-three times the 5 per cent of the single over-25 rate for income support. The committee pointed out that this was greater than the maximum individual deduction under the third party deduction scheme. Although other recommendations were accepted, this was one area where the previous Government were unable to accept the SSAC recommendation, which was to limit the maximum amount deducted to 5 per cent of the income support rate. Have the current Government a different view on this? We know from our debates on the Welfare Reform Bill that the Minister is exercised about the impact of cash deductions from benefit levels-this was in the then context of sanctions-and he hinted at the prospect of other types of sanctions, possibly vouchers. Has the thinking developed further? How would such a system sit alongside the TPD scheme and these proposals-or can we take it that vouchers have been ruled out?</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="10062129000134"></a>In its report in February to the then Secretary of State, the SSAC reflected on the history of the TPD scheme-and we have heard it from the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, today-where the type of deductions allowed from benefits has grown over the years. The last DWP response to the request for a review of the scheme was rejected, with the assertion that it had a twofold purpose: to provide last-resort rescue where a claimant is struggling with arrears of essential household outgoings, and to impose compliance with social and monetary obligations. Is this still the position of the Government?</p>

<a name="100621-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="10062129000135"></a>We would all agree, I hope, that it is important that the manner in which the trials are conducted makes it clear that it is voluntary and that participants can

It is also vital, as was envisaged when the proposals were devised, that the repayment from benefits should not be seen as the easy or default option for dealing with HMRC debts. In particular, it should not displace the HMRC code of practice which provides for overpayments to be written off in cases of extreme hardship. Access to advice therefore remains paramount. If the proposed free national advice service is to go on the back burner, then continued funding for those agencies, national and local, which work tirelessly at the moment to fill that gap will be critical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="10062129000136"></a>As we have heard, the Merits Committee under the incisive chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Rosser did not question the objective of the regulations and the proposed trials but was concerned whether the proposed methodology would deliver sufficiently meaningful data to support its extension. I think that is the thrust of the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. Concerns were expressed around the control groups, the percentage take up from those contacted, minimum levels and time spent on benefits. Like the SSAC, the Merits Committee was anxious to know what advice had been sought on the design of the pilots. Frankly, I think the reply from Steve Webb of 31 May covered these matters and should allay the fears of the Merits Committee, the SSAC and, indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="10062129000137"></a>The nature of the communication inviting individuals to participate in the trial is recognised as being critical to both emphasise the voluntary nature of the trial and to help individuals understand the impact on their income of signing up for trials. This was one of the SSAC recommendations which we accepted. We also agreed to share copies of proposed communications with the SSAC. I trust this agreement will endure with the new Government.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="10062129000138"></a>At the end of the day, whatever the methodology, what matters is implementation. Neither HMRC nor DWP lacks experience in implementing pilots, but these require resources and training. As the matters we are discussing by definition impact on the poorest and the most vulnerable-those which the coalition Government has pledged to protect-we seek reassurance that any pilot will be properly resourced.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="10062129000139"></a>Although we cannot support the noble Lord's Motion, we agree on the importance of the department providing good information, generally in explanatory memoranda, and its engagement with SSAC and the Merits Committee-which might have obviated the necessity for our interesting discussion.</p>

I take the point about the numbers in the House for this debate-this is an exclusive group-but I can claim to be a member, albeit a new one, of the DWP regret club from earlier this year. I need, however, to apologise, albeit on behalf of the previous Administration, for the fact that the Merits Committee was not provided with sufficient information when the regulations came before it.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1247"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1247</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100621-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="10062129000141"></a>I should say by way of background that the amendment to the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 2010 will enable voluntary deductions to be taken from a person's social security benefit to repay certain HMRC liabilities of under £1,000. The types of debt included are those arising from overpayments of tax credits and those arising from personal tax liability.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="10062129000142"></a>The transition from work to benefit can be difficult. Before the previous Government introduced tax credits, it was possible for overpayments of in-work benefit, then known as family credit, to be recovered from other social security benefits. Once tax credits were introduced, this option ceased, even though many customers found it an easy and convenient repayment method. The regulations reinstate this option for those who wish to use it. As well as providing a convenient method of repayment for individuals, this will help those unfortunate enough to have a debt with both the Department for Work and Pensions and the HMRC. Under current processes, both departments could seek repayment independently and both expect repayment. Under the trial process, the departments will work together and ensure that customers have only to repay one debt at a time.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="10062129000143"></a>Participation in the trial is purely voluntary. There is therefore no question of excessive compulsory deductions being taken from a customer's benefit. The option to use this form of repayment and the rate at which any deduction is made will be agreed with the customer before any repayment commences.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="10062129000144"></a>This brings me on to the issues raised by the Merits Committee and by my noble friend in this Motion. It is suggested that the trial has been based on inadequate design which will be unable to produce reliable evidence for evaluation. The real issue is perhaps rather that the Explanatory Memorandum failed adequately to explain<I></I>the design of the trial<I></I>and specifically the evaluation protocols. This is regrettable and I fully accept that the Merits Committee should always be given sufficient information in order fully to assess the validity of regulations coming before it. In fact, even before this Motion was tabled, the department had written to the Merits Committee, giving a much fuller account of the proposed evaluation methodology than was provided originally.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="10062129000145"></a>It may be helpful at this point if I give some details of how DWP and HMRC will work together to run and evaluate the trial. We intend to approach tax credit customers and self-assessment customers who are in receipt of a relevant social security benefit and have new debts to HMRC. My noble friend criticised the structure of the trial as being a case of garbage in and garbage out. I think that the issue is that it is rather more narrowly focused than a wider trial might be.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="10062129000146"></a>The aim is to assess whether voluntary deduction of debts owed to HMRC from DWP benefits is attractive to debtors and a cost-effective means of recovery. Outcomes of the trial will be compared to outcomes achieved through existing HMRC debt recovery methods. The trial will provide evidence to inform any future decisions on use of deductions from benefits. If the trial evaluation shows that this is a cost-effective recovery method for government and that it is attractive to  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1248"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1248</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>customers, it will be retained post trial. However, if that proves not to be the case or there proves to be no interest from customers, it will not be continued beyond the period of the trial.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="10062129000147"></a>The objectives of the trial are, first, to test proof of concept. By that, I mean to ensure that the deductions process is operationally effective, that customer information is safeguarded, that customer records are updated and that additional cash recoveries are accounted correctly. The second objective is to assess levels of customer take-up and the factors which motivate customers to participate in the trial or to pay directly to HMRC.  The third is to assess cost-effectiveness; that is, the additional recoveries achieved net of departments' costs.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="10062129000148"></a>There will be three groups for evaluation purposes. The first group will consist of those customers who volunteer to take part in the trial. The evaluation will look at how much was recovered, the spread of weekly deduction rates and how long a person is in receipt of a relevant benefit from which deductions can be made. The DWP and HMRC will both analyse their costs in running the trial to permit an overall cost to Government to be calculated. In addition, the performance of new joined-up operational processes between HMRC and the DWP will be assessed. As part of the evaluation, HMRC will seek feedback from its customers on the effectiveness of the trial and their overall customer experience.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="10062129000149"></a>The second group is those customers who choose not to take part in the trial. The previous material may have suggested that this group formed a control group. Apologies for that confusion, as this is clearly not a control group but a non-random sample of people who have chosen not to take part in the trial. Their data have been contaminated for control purposes. However, there are still some useful data to be obtained from this group. HMRC will therefore note these cases and then deal with them under its current recovery processes, and track whether they subsequently repay their debt or overpayment by other means. For these cases, HMRC will also assess the likely recovery over the period of the trial had the customers taken part in it, and will collect data on why the customer chose not to take part.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="10062129000150"></a>Finally, there will be a true control group who will not be approached to volunteer for the trial. Instead, they will follow the current HMRC recovery process. The control group will consist of at least 500 tax credit overpayment customers and at least 500 self-assessment debtors. These cases will be selected using a stratified sampling method. This will be performed by arranging the cases into different debt bands from £200 to £1,000 and then randomly selecting 10 per cent of cases in each band. This will ensure that the distribution of the control group represents the overall distribution. Since the overall population of cases in scope in the first tranche is not very large and the take-up rate may be low, it is better to choose a minimum control group and leave the majority of cases to go through the trial. For further tranches where more cases are available, we can increase the control-group size to give a higher confidence level in the results. The trial design has

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="10062129000151"></a>By having three customer groups, HMRC will be able to compare the recovery rates, costs and customer experience across the different groups. It will be able to ascertain how successful the recovery of the debt or overpayment from benefit was compared with current methods. HMRC will be able to compare how much debt is collected via this trial compared with current recovery routes. It will also look at the customers who declined to take part in the trial and whether being contacted regarding this additional payment option prompts any of them to repay their debt or overpayment by an alternative route, or to contact HMRC to discuss other options. If customers taking part in the trial come off benefit, they will be removed from the trial with the necessary explanations being provided. They will not be reapproached if they return to benefit.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="10062129000152"></a>The business analytics team in HMRC's Debt Management and Banking Directorate will select the control group for this trial and will analyse the data generated from it. The team is lead by a member of the Government Operational Research Service, and I am assured that the team has a good track record. A separate team in HMRC will provide quality assurance on the evaluation process to the joint DWP and HMRC project board. More generally, I stress my department's commitment to assessing what is termed as a social return on investment. That means not just looking at costs, but understanding better what is most effective in improving outcomes that matter for people. Wherever possible and relevant, we will develop evaluation methodologies that measure the wider social costs and benefits of public spending.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="10062129000153"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, asked whether the provision would cost more than it brings in. In practice, it will cost very little. It is collecting a debt by deduction from benefit, which is effectively the most economical way in which to recover this money.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="10062129000154"></a>Another question raised by a number of noble Lords was on the pressure being put on the poorest in society to repay their debts. In reality, this trial does not change anything; the debt to HMRC would have had to be repaid anyway-or it would have been chased to be repaid. The regulations apply a maximum recovery rate, and the actual rate is agreed with the customer and can be reduced. On the substantive point, if we have a welfare system, it is important that it encourages responsibility among those people who receive benefits. If we do not we are in practice being unfair to those people who do not overclaim or build up debt and pay up for others' expense.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="10062129000155"></a>My noble friend Lord Lucas asked what a tax debt was. The kind of debt that we are talking about here is established debt to the HMRC; it is not just an in-year liability that might fluctuate. He also questioned whether the sample was too small and whether it could be done on a geographic or area basis. In practice, matching the data between HMRC and the DWP cannot be done easily on a geographic basis.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="10062129000156"></a>My noble friend Lady Thomas of Winchester asked whether customers would understand the voluntary nature of the trial. There was a stakeholders' event last  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1250"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1250</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>week where the proposed letters to customers were shared with Citizens Advice, the TaxPayers' Alliance and others who were apparently pleased and said that they were "much better" than other HMRC letters. The trial staff will emphasise the voluntary nature of this. My noble friend also asked whether HMRC would advise taking out commercial loans. The answer is not in these cases.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="10062129000157"></a>My noble friend Lord Kirkwood asked about the number of people with self-assessment debts. I do not have the exact number with me, but it is around 4,000 people for the last tax year. We are talking about those who were in employment but are now unemployed. My noble friend talked about the problem being generated by the complexity of the benefit system, and I have to agree with that. I hope that we will be in a position to show the way ahead in a matter of weeks in tackling complexity, which has two effects. It disincentivises people from working and freezes people from doing anything, and they become very conservative, which is exactly what we do not want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="10062129000160"></a>My noble friend Lord Kirkwood asked when the trial was due to start. It will start next month, and the first letters will go out then. We do not intend to cancel this trial; we will go ahead with it, although we will extend it only if it is successful.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="10062129000161"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, asked whether other methods of repayment would be available. Clearly, if the customer signs up for the trial, no other method will be used. If the customer does not sign up, the repayment methods could be lump sum or instalments by direct debit or standing order. He also asked whether the new Government stand by the decision to deduct at three times the 5 per cent rate. Yes, we stand by that, but it is the maximum rate and participants can choose a lower rate. Finally, he probed the question of other ways of applying sanctions. This is, of course, not a sanction-it is a repayment of a debt-although I can tell him that we are exploring non-financial sanctions.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="10062129000162"></a>I commend the principle of the trial as a convenient alternative repayment method for those who wish to use it and as an example of joint working. The design of the trial is adequate, but I accept the criticisms of the Merits Committee and of my noble friend Lord Lucas. We need to get this right in the future. We need to make sure that all our regulatory changes meet the standard expected by the Merits Committee and that we provide all the necessary supporting information in good time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="10062129000164"></a>The Minister has made me understand one thing that I did not understand before. The trial is clearly voluntary, but is he saying that the rollout will also be voluntary, even if the trial is a success? That certainly would remove a lot of my worries. However, the effort being expended to create a control group and to look at what is happening in the second, probably larger group of those who will not take part in the trial rather suggests to me that there was an intention-noble Lords opposite may know whether this is the case-that this should be a compulsory way of reclaiming HMRC debts.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="10062129000165"></a>If you want to understand how to operate this effectively with people who volunteer, you do a randomised control trial just with those people. You go on until you have a couple of thousand volunteers and you assign them randomly-half you monitor under the current system and half you monitor under the new system. You then have a conventional and statistically robust way of comparing behaviour. It might be fun and informative, and it might have a peripheral virtue to try to understand why the people who have not volunteered have not done so and to try to find out how to encourage them to do so in future, but you certainly would not bother with this functionless control group that sits as an appendage at the bottom.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="10062129000166"></a>As I say, there is a simple and statistically robust way of dealing with this if the trial is for a voluntary system, which would not have all the characteristics of the trial that has been put in front of us. If the Minister is prepared to set up a meeting with his statisticians, I should enjoy it very much, because I do not think that they have come up to the mark on this occasion if, as I say, this is a trial for a voluntary system. If I am wrong and this was designed as a trial for a compulsory system, I come back to my old criticism that it does not function as that. You do not get enough information on the likely behaviour of the people who have declined to take part in the trial to be able to predict how they would react if they were compelled to take part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="10062129000167"></a>However, I cannot be churlish when I have received such a good reply from my noble friend, particularly if he sets me up with a tea date with his statisticians-and how could any statistician refuse tea in the Lords?

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="10062129000210"></a>"We believe that the function of the state is to promote equity ... the power of the state should be deployed vigorously to help the vulnerable and the voiceless, those who lack resources and connections, and those who are poor materially and excluded socially".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 2/6/10; col. 463.]</p>

<p><a name="10062129000170"></a>My amendment is to ensure just that-that the coalition walks that talk and exemplifies its values. It addresses the risk that the free schools-the brand new academies-do not cause undue detriment to existing neighbouring schools. I accept that that would never be the purpose of any group promoting such a new school. However, sometimes any of us-indeed, all of us at times-can so concentrate on our own children and our own back yard that we overlook the needs of others. That is a particular danger when social considerations intrude, as they too often do in this country, vis-à-vis education. At Second Reading I gave an example from my own part of Suffolk of the proposal to convert a feeder middle school into a secondary academy school. That would devastatingly undermine the really good school into which it feeds by the consequent impact on its entry numbers and all that that would mean for finances, staffing, social balance and, ultimately, morale.</p>

<a name="100621-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="10062129000171"></a>Britain is still a sorely disfigured country-disfigured by acute inequalities of life chances. That underlines, among other things, our social and law and order problems, and leads to huge financial and moral setbacks. It is against this backdrop that I very much hope that the Government-my Government-will accept this constructive amendment, which will provide an essential but practical safeguard against the unintended consequences of the Bill as it stands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="10062129000175"></a>Given the backdrop that I have described, I very much hope that the Government will accept this amendment, which does not apply, of course-I have specifically excluded it from doing so-to maintained schools converting to parallel academies, which will be by far the larger number. However, there would still be a significant number of new free academies, which must surely also be expected to serve the higher purpose of educational justice for all, not just their own pupils. A big society, surely, must be an equitable society, particularly towards its most needy. My amendment may not be perfect, but something like it must be in the Bill if we want to end what Mr Gove called in his Statement today a "segregated and stratified" school system. I beg to move.</p>

In answer to questions about the Statement on free schools, I think that the Minister spoke of pilots, although I may be wrong. The amendments to which I speak ask the Government to pilot the Bill's approach in limited areas, or initially to cap the numbers of these new academies so that the effect on nearby schools can be considered in the light of experience. It seems reasonable to me that if the effects that have been forecast of the disruption and funding shortfalls for vital services transpire, we will know that proceeding further along this road would be an error. Other amendments in this grouping discuss the need for openness and the consideration of the wider effects of this policy when proceeding with changes of status on this scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="10062129000177"></a>Amendments 119 and 177 relate to the criteria for acceptance of an application for conversion to an academy. Crucially, they relate to the need to consider the local impact of the change in the round and to consider the impact on community cohesion of the change to academy status. These constitute very real concerns. The amendment to which the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, spoke also addresses the local impact of these schools. I support the amendment. Questions need to be answered in relation to the example that he gave of a school in Suffolk.</p>

<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1254"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1254</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>courses, including sixth-form colleges and FE colleges in the area. It also seeks to ensure that academies are part of regional and subregional planning groups for 16 to 19 provision. This will ensure that there is no duplication of existing provision within an area and avoid inefficiency.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="10062129000179"></a>Local authorities currently act as commissioners for courses for 16 to 19 year-olds funded by the Young People's Learning Agency. They engage with all providers across local authority boundaries to ensure that courses are provided which meet the needs of students and provide the best value to taxpayers. We would need to be assured that that process would continue with academies, because there needs to be an overview.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="10062129000180"></a>Amendment 92A seeks to introduce a fair funding element to 16 to 19 year-old provision in academies to ensure that 16 to 19 year-olds are not treated more favourably than existing providers of education for 16 to 19 year-olds. Currently, if an academy provides or introduces new 16 to 19 year-olds' education, the funding is top-sliced from that which is given via the YPLA to other providers in the area. This funding is provided on the basis that all the places offered by the academy will be filled.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="10062129000181"></a>That is not the case for other providers, which are funded on the basis of the places that they have filled in previous years. It can also create an anomalous situation whereby, if places are not taken up at an academy, but the students instead choose to go to a sixth-form college, it is still the academy rather than the college that receives this funding for those places. That creates a financial incentive for academies to offer courses for which there is no or little new demand. I am not an expert in these areas, but when I was alerted to these specific issues, it seemed that these were the very issues that we should be probing and seeking answers on from the Minister.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="10062129000182"></a>These amendments are not designed to shackle the Secretary of State and they do not prevent him continuing with his plan. They merely seek to assure those who have perhaps been unnerved by the speed with which he is pursuing an end to any form of community accountability for schools.</p>

<a name="10062129000183"></a><b><a name="100621-0014.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10062129000287"></a>Lord Bew:</b> My Lords, I shall address some of the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, in his Amendment 4. Much of this is an issue of context. I was struck by the example of the case in Sudbury, which he gave in his speech at Second Reading. It is of concern that what we are doing with this new second phase of the academies project will leave certain schools and communities behind.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="10062129000184"></a>However, I want to suggest an angle of vision on this which I hope will be helpful in a small way to the Committee. If you look at a very traditional elitist system such as that which prevails in Northern Ireland-the grammar school system-which is different markedly from the system that is being discussed, although there is a small grammar school element to it, you will see that the results achieved at A-level and GCE are by far the best in the United Kingdom. At the bottom, the results are not so good-but nor are they now so divergent from those in England. Girls are actually doing better in Northern Ireland. Boys in Northern Ireland are doing worse than in England. However,  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1255"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1255</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>those results tell you something: the way that our system has evolved over a generation or more is that we now accept that Northern Ireland will for ever lead the academic attainment lists at the highest level in the United Kingdom unless there are changes in policies. They tell you that at the bottom level this elitist system is not as bad in relation to England as we once thought it was. It is actually very close indeed. It is bad to be at the bottom level in England and in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="10062129000185"></a>The point I am trying to make is that the Northern Irish grammar school system, for all its many joys, was not formed in a political culture whereby a Minister for Education talked, as he was talking today, about using the state as a weapon for equity. In other words, the context is enormously important. It is important that the context is right when we discuss these questions and that the policy of the Government is directed towards greater equality of opportunity, which seems to be, as the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, conceded, where the Minister is coming from. He may not be quite the Marxist-Leninist that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, talked about, but none the less that seems to be the approach. The status quo is leaving people behind. We already have a segregated system. The status quo is already having negative effects, and the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, whose point about unintended consequences I accept, is rightly concerned that they will become more marked as side effects of this new system.</p>

I should like to speak to Amendments 98, 136 and 177. I also intend to speak to Amendment 137 along with Amendment 98, as they go together. I apologise that with all the toing and froing with the groupings this morning, I did not notice that Amendment 137 had not been included in this group. However, I believe that I am able to speak to it all the same.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="10062134000004"></a>The purpose of Amendments 98 and 137 is to probe the application of the school governance procedures regulations 2003 to a resolution by the school governors to apply for academy status. The current regulations provide for special procedures for important governing body decisions about the future of a school-particularly ones such as this, which would lead to a decision by the local authority to discontinue supporting the school. The special procedures currently include a requirement that the decision cannot be delegated to a committee or individual, and the chair cannot direct that a period of notice shorter than seven days be given for a governing body meeting. Indeed, in certain cases, a second governing body meeting must be held within 28 days to confirm the original decision.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="10062134000005"></a>Therefore, can the Minister confirm that a decision to apply for academy status cannot be delegated to an individual governor or even a small committee of governors? Will the regulations require the local authority or parents to be informed of the date when the governing body proposes to make a decision? Should not the regulations be amended to this end if they do not already do so?</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="10062134000006"></a>Amendment 136 is a different way of dealing with the same matter. Clause 5(9) disapplies current legislation. Conversely, if we remove subsection (9), as Amendment 136 does, the current situation regarding consultation, safeguards and time periods and so on regarding who can make the decisions remains.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="10062134000007"></a>Amendment 177 would insert a new clause that would extend to academies a current duty on the governing bodies of maintained schools in England to promote community cohesion in the discharging of their functions. The noble Baroness, Lady Royall, touched on this in the earlier debate on consultation. I well recall our debates during the passage of the Education and Inspections Act 2006, which introduced a duty on all maintained schools in England to promote community cohesion and on Ofsted to report on the contributions that they make in this area. Both these duties have now commenced.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="10062134000008"></a>Governing bodies of existing new Labour academies are not subject to the same duty to promote community cohesion as applies to maintained schools, despite our protestations, as I recall, when the Bill went through your Lordships' House, yet from September 2008 their contribution to community cohesion has been reported on by Ofsted. I think it is vital that the new academies are also required to promote community cohesion, especially where they are located in areas where the community is very diverse. This is particularly important given the concerns that academies may increase social division and inequality, rather than reduce them, which of course is the intention of the programme. That is not how we want academies to be. They should be part of, and serve, the local community.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="10062134000009"></a>On the question of new 16 to 19 providers, mentioned by the noble Baroness on the opposition Benches, I think that if an academy extends the age range which it intends to serve beyond that which it had when it first applied to be an academy, there may very well be a case for having to go back to the Secretary of State to renegotiate the terms of the academy agreement. Can the Minister let me know whether that is the Government's intention? It would be a major change in the academy's provision and the original consultations would no longer be legitimate.</p>

<p><a name="st_218"></a>
<a name="10062134000010"></a><b><a name="100621-0014.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="10062134000116"></a>Lord Whitty:</b> My Lords, I, too, have tabled amendments in this group-Amendments 116, 117, 119 and 129. Since this is the first time that I have spoken on this Bill, I welcome and congratulate the Minister on his position and the way in which he has hitherto dealt with the Bill. However, I cannot give the same welcome to the Bill itself. He needs to know that I have fairly fundamental objections to it, which may appear from time to time. It may have a rougher ride as we go forward.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="10062134000011"></a>It is true that I also had some reservations about the previous Government's academies programme, contrary to the position of the Front Bench and other colleagues. However, it was very different-it was different in execution, although some would say that it was not that different in ambition. In execution, the Labour Government, with their fewer than 300 academies, recognised that there were failing schools, or at least schools that were underperforming in educational terms, and that there were areas of social deprivation, which  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1257"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1257</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was detrimentally affecting educational attainment. The Government used the academies as a way of compensating or intervening at the extreme end of special measures. That I can understand. In a sense, it was a comment on the failure of local authorities and the governing bodies that central government had to take them over. In general, I believe that the education of a community's children ought to be the responsibility of the local authority elected for that community. It is only in very specialised and specialist cases that you would override that.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="10062134000012"></a>That is a political and an educational principle. It is an educational principle for reasons to which the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has just referred. A change in the status and the relative resources and attention given to one school will have a knock-on effect on other schools. Sometimes it might be beneficial, but it will undoubtedly have a knock-on effect.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="10062134000013"></a>The record on Labour academies is mixed. Some have been very successful; some have improved, though it could be argued that they could have been improved by less drastic interventions; and some have failed or nearly failed. The case is not yet fully proven. To take away from local authorities the responsibility for educating their populations, which they have had for well over a century, is a very drastic move. In this short Bill we are changing the provision of education in this country.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="10062134000014"></a>This depends on initiatives being taken by the school and on the attitude of the Secretary of State to the application of the school. However, the ambition has been clearly laid out by the Minister and the Secretary of State. They want a large number of schools to opt out of local authority oversight. I say "oversight" and not "control" because local authorities have not managed schools for many years. They have supported schools and given them administrative support, help in specialist matters and special needs, and help in many other areas, but they have not managed the schools in the way which is sometimes implied by the criticism of the current system.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="10062134000015"></a>The Bill is taking a big step to remove the relationship between schools and the local authority. I appreciate that I am not going to be able to persuade the Government or the coalition-or at least most of the coalition-that this is the wrong way to go. But if we are to go down that road, it is essential to reassert the role of the local authority. We had a debate just before the break about consultation. I take some of the points from my noble friend Lord Adonis and others that to prescribe exact forms of consultation in primary legislation can lead you down difficult paths and that perhaps it is better covered by a code, guidance or, certainly, practice by the Secretary of State and those who are promoting academies and free schools.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="10062134000016"></a>The one bit of consultation that I do not believe you can escape is consultation with the local authority. The local authority might in some cases agree that it would be a good thing to have an academy. It would certainly have views on it and it would certainly have views that are informed by the impact on the rest of education in the area of its oversight. My first amendment is my ideal. Amendment 116 says that the local authorities should be consulted and should agree the proposals.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1258"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1258</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100621-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="10062134000017"></a>I appreciate that that is fairly close to cloud-cuckoo land, given the Government's intentions. In any case, if there was a disagreement between the local authorities and the Secretary of State, you would have to build in an arbitration process. I have therefore given the Government an alternative, which simply states that there is an obligation to consult the local authority.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="10062134000018"></a>Personally, I think that if that is not inserted in some form into the Bill, it will be greatly flawed. I suspect that it will make for a difficult ride in another place if local authorities are not written in, so I therefore strongly advise the Government that if they are to continue to go down that road, they ought at least to recognise the special role of local authorities in that respect.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="10062134000019"></a>I also take the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, before the break, but perhaps the obligation to consult ought to be not on the party proposing the school but on the Secretary of State him or herself. At the end of the day, the Secretary of State will have to make the judgment and explain to Parliament whether an effective consultation has taken place, so I place the responsibility not on the proposers but on the Secretary of State. That makes sense.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="10062134000020"></a>My Amendment 119 goes further to state-in a sense, with the same motivation as the noble Lord, Lord Phillips-that there should be an assessment of the effect of taking a prospective academy out of local authority oversight on the rest of the educational provision in the area. Where it differs from the intention of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, and probably therefore avoids the objection of my noble friend Lord Adonis, is that it simply states that there should be an assessment. That assessment, or at least its conclusions, should probably be available publicly-although the amendment does not state that-but it still leaves the final judgment to the Secretary of State, whereas the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, would prescribe something that is difficult to define, as my noble friend said. Nevertheless, I think that the noble Lord and I are both on the same page here: before we move to approve an academy, an assessment needs to have been made as to the effect that will have on the total educational provision in the area.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="10062134000021"></a>I hope that the Government take some notice of the amendment. Personally, I find it very difficult that in the name of removing the burdens of red tape from head teachers and governing bodies, we move from a system of local authority oversight to one of centralised funding, centrally regulated. The red tape which has undoubtedly been imposed on the teaching profession by successive Governments over the past two or three decades has largely emanated from central government and their agencies, not from local government. The relationship with local government has been, by and large, constructive. We ought to maintain that. Even if we are going for change which some local authorities may approve of, there must be a vital role for local authorities in that process.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="10062134000022"></a>My final amendment simply gives some flexibility on timescale, so I will not go into it in great detail. The key point here is that local authorities must be present under the Bill to be consulted, engaged and involved, reflecting the impact of a decision on one school on the totality of education in their area.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="10062134000024"></a>It was originally intended as an addition to the amendments on consultation in the previous group proposed and spoken to by my noble friend Lady Walmsley and the noble Baronesses, Lady Royall and Lady Howe of Idlicote. I thought that rather than tabling three amendments adding on to them, I would table just one to discuss alongside them. I failed miserably, because we have to discuss it now.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="10062134000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said that he thought that he would not be able single-handedly to persuade the coalition that this Bill should be scrapped and that we should start again. It would not take a lot to persuade me, but I do not think that I could persuade the coalition either. Even the combined forces of the noble Lord and I would not succeed in that. Therefore, we have the Bill that we have, and we have to do what the House of Lords traditionally does very well: look at the Bill, not challenge it in principle but look at how it will work, whether it will work successfully and the effect that it will have on everything else around it. That is what we are doing, and what we have to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="10062134000026"></a>The amendment is about local consultation and, in particular, it is about attempting to widen the consultation and debate to the community as a whole. At Second Reading the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, said that there should be an interactive relationship between schools and the community that they serve and in which they are situated. That is true; it has clearly got to be a two-way relationship and must continue whether a school is an academy, a maintained school or any other sort of school. The wider community therefore has a perfectly legitimate role in the debate that will take place in a lot of places about whether schools should become academies.</p>

<a name="100621-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="10062134000027"></a>If a town has one or two secondary schools, whether 11 to 16, 11 to 18 or whatever, they are important institutions in that community. They are not there to educate just those pupils who go to them at the moment; they are there to educate future pupils. Therefore, parents of future pupils, whether or not they are born, have a legitimate role in the debate. The schools may be providing community facilities-many schools do nowadays, and on an increasing scale. People who use those community facilities have a perfect right to take part in the debate. Schools very often play a role in the community in all sorts of different ways which impact on everybody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="10062134000028"></a>A primary school may be virtually the only public institution left in a village. There may be a post office, if you are lucky, and there will be a pub, which is semi-public, but the school is vital as part of that community. The future of that school is something in which everybody has a legitimate interest. Some people have a more legitimate interest than others. If you are employed there, if your children are there, if you are the children who are there, if you are the families of children there, you arguably have a more direct and immediate interest than somebody who is just resident in the village. That village school will play a vital part

Some schools cut themselves off from the community, unfortunately, a tendency that has increased in recent years because of the pressures put on the schools, but other schools look outwards. I do not think there is necessarily a difference between a primary school and a secondary school, although primary schools-by their very nature, because they take in very young children and bring mothers in and so on-are often more closely involved in the community than some secondary schools. However, I do not think there is necessarily a direct relationship between that, and I know secondary schools that are heavily involved in the community.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="10062134000032"></a>There are two principles of general consultation. They help with the difficulties, which the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, identified, of being too prescriptive about whom you consult or of trying to be prescriptive but vague at the same time and perhaps leaving things open to legal challenge. First, you must publish what you are proposing for general discussion so that anyone can pick up information about it and take part in the discussion, and you must publish the responses. That is proposed new subsection (1A) in my amendment. Secondly, once you have the responses, whether from parents, teachers, the parish council or just a group of interested people, you must obviously consider them and decide whether you want to allow them to influence your decision. If, after the consultation, you decide to send your application to the Secretary of State, you send a summary of the responses or the responses themselves to the Secretary of State alongside your application so that someone who is looking at the application can consider them at the same time. Those are the two principles of genuine public consultation and debate.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="10062134000033"></a>The argument against such a consultation might be that it will delay the process, but so long as you have a pretty strict timetable and people are fairly rigorous and efficient with it, it does not have to delay the process very much. I think there is also a worry on the part of the Government that if there is too much

They might say that it is a bit controversial and hang back a bit. However, given the scale of the interest which the Government assure us there is in these things, whether it is a free school or a conversion-they say that 1,800 schools at least have now asked for more details-the Government and the department cannot possibly deal with that very quickly and will have to go ahead with far fewer, so I do not think that the argument about putting people off carries any weight whatever.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="10062134000034"></a>I support the coalition Government, but everything that people have said and everything that they have published so far-in the original agreement and in the coalition document <I>Our </I><I>Programme </I><I>for Government</I>-talks about more public involvement, more consultation and more involvement of citizens. We are slowly learning what the big society means, but if it does not mean genuine consultation on something that is as important to a local community as the future of its school, what on earth does it mean? Something needs to be in the Bill about consultation, and it needs to involve not just particular interest groups in the school but the wider community.</p>

I particularly support Amendment 191, because it asks the Government to pilot the academy schools and I think that a conservative approach to this is appropriate. This is so significant to our children's lives. I recognise that this is an enabling Bill, but we expect many schools to buy into this programme. This is a huge experiment and it really does behove us to act in a conservative and considered way. Piloting a scheme, as the amendment suggests, would be a good step forward.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="10062134000036"></a>I have previously raised with the Minister my concerns about not only the most vulnerable children in the system but also the workforce and how these schools might cream off the best teachers and head teachers from the schools around them. I think that there is a consensus that the quality of teachers and head teachers makes the most difference to the education of children and young people.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="10062134000037"></a>To give examples from other areas, in the prison system we now have a mixed economy of private and public prisons. Private prisons are often accused of paying huge sums of money for the best executives from the public sector. The public sector trains the best prison officers, who get creamed off by private companies. They are also accused of putting junior officers in place who are underdeveloped and undersupported, and they quickly move on. I do not know whether that is a fair accusation but, from the statistics, the turnover of junior officers in private prisons is very much higher than in public prisons. There were all sorts of benefits to introducing a mixed economy in terms of breaking down inflexible practices, but I hope that the illustration shows that there is some cause for concern.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="10062134000039"></a>I have already mentioned independent social worker practices. I heard the Minister's response to that. It is super that such new models can be very attractive to people coming into social work or teaching. They see themselves gaining the autonomy they want to run their own businesses. There is great enthusiasm for that. However, Paul Fallon, who was director of social services at Barnet, reduced the level of social work vacancies in his local authority from 30 per cent to 3 per cent in three years-I hope that I have the figures right, because they sound a bit too neat. He was well respected and was asked by the Government to be part of a committee advising on independent social work practices. His main concern was that these social work practices would cream off all the best social workers from thereabouts and that there would not be the continuity of provision essential in dealing with these children to ensure that they get back to their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="10062134000040"></a>This is a bit like a game of chess and the devil is always very good at enticing us with an attractive knight, a rook or even a queen. But we have to look further down the game. When we are dealing with something as serious as this, we have to look a number of moves ahead to the end game. I am concerned about this matter. I wish to learn more. I appreciate the Minister's serious endeavours to reassure me and others.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="10062134000041"></a>I also recall the right-to-buy policy, which had many benefits for many people. Unfortunately, the need for councils to redevelop public provision-the local authority homes that were being sold off-was overlooked in that policy. I am sorry to say that in many areas this has condemned some families to sharing a kitchen or a bathroom with five other families. Many families have to live in awful conditions in poor-quality private accommodation because sufficient thought was not given to the overall impact of that policy. This is a good proposal from the opposition Benches and I look forward to the Minister's reply.</p>

It is not a question of judgments having to be made about terminology in legislation; these judgments have to be made the whole time. The problem with his amendment is that there are deeply competing interpretations within the education world as to what the words he has used in his amendment would mean. Having been on the receiving end of representations about the setting up of new schools, including schools in the county from which the noble Lord hails, I can tell him that he is setting up a procedure that will see every proposal for a new school that does not have near universal local support end up in the courts being bitterly contested because of the imprecision of language that he proposes to impose on the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="10062134000044"></a>Let me take the two specific terms he uses: that a new academy must meet "public need" before the Secretary of State is allowed to agree to it and that it should not,</p>
<ul><a name="10062134000107"></a>"cause undue detriment to any neighbouring school".</ul>

<p><a name="10062134000103"></a>King Lear got this right more than 400 years ago when he said:</p>
"O, reason not the need! Our basest beggarsAre in the poorest thing superfluous". 
<p><a name="10062134000104"></a>But when it comes to defining need in respect of new school places, two fundamentally competing views are held. One is that "need" should be defined as a numerical need for additional places, while another and essentially different interpretation is that "need" should be based on parental demand for a new type of place or, as alas is too often the case in local authorities with a large number of failing schools, for better places, which is what has driven so much of the academy movement. It is not that there have not been enough school places in a locality, but that they have not been of a quality that parents in good conscience wish their children to take up.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="10062134000045"></a>The noble Lord owes it to the Committee to be frank and direct about which concept of need he has in mind. Is need to be defined simply as a numerical need for places or is it to be defined in terms of appreciable parental demand for a type of place-it could be for Montessori-type schools with a different educational philosophy-or better quality places than those on offer in the existing schools?</p>

<p><a name="st_224"></a>
<a name="10062134000046"></a><b><a name="100621-0015.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10062134000122"></a>Lord Phillips of Sudbury:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way, but he has rather challenged me. The answer to his question is this. My amendment leaves a discretion with the Secretary of State, and it will be for the Secretary of State to decide on the two or more interpretations of need. In the same way, it will be up to the Secretary of State to come to conclusions about undue detriment. If, through guidance, the Secretary of States gives a further indication of how the two tests have been interpreted, all the better. But as the noble Lord is well aware, the only basis on which this could be challenged in a court-and challenges to ministerial discretions, which are widespread, are extremely rare-would be that the Secretary of State had acted in a way that no reasonable person could have acted.</p>

Parliament has to be clear on what it means. There are two competing notions of need here and Parliament needs to state, before it charges the Secretary of State with these responsibilities, which one it means. As for judicial reviews and legal challenges being rare, there was one point when I was in the job now being done by the noble Lord, Lord Hill, when I was barely out of the High Court and the Court of Appeal on challenges to academies, most of them with support from the National Union of Teachers and a good number with support, one way or another, from bodies associated with local authorities. So Parliament needs to be clear on what it means.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="10062134000048"></a>We come then to "undue detriment". Again, there are two competing views of what this is. It could be taken to mean making another school or schools totally non viable or it could be taken to mean that it would have a serious, definable or appreciable impact on another school or schools. Again, there is a fundamental difference between those two concepts of detriment-whether the detriment causes a school to  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1264"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column 1264</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>become non viable or whether it simply has an impact or an appreciable impact. Again, Parliament needs to be clear which of the two it means.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="10062134000049"></a>This goes to the central point about school improvements as well. The noble Lord's amendment says that the Secretary of State may not allow a new academy to be established if it causes undue detriment. I have to say that in many cases it is the dealing with the undue detriment that should be the duty of the Secretary of State or the responsible local authority using the huge array of school improvement powers available, including those that the Government of whom I was a member provided over 13 years. The idea that parents should not be able to access new or additional school places in areas where the schools are not providing good quality places simply because the provision of those places will cause detriment to other schools fundamentally ignores the interests of parents and their right to have a decent quality school to send their children to. If there is not such a decent quality school and someone is prepared to do something substantive about it, they should be applauded and not put through the legal rigmarole that the noble Lord is proposing, which will work fundamentally against the interests of parents, particularly in places where schools are not of a high enough quality. The imprecision of the language, where it is not clear what the definitions of essential terms such as "detriment" and "need" will be, will ensure that the only people who will gain from this are the lawyers, who will make huge fees while this is fought out in the courts over many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="10062134000051"></a>On listening to the debates both before and after dinner, I was struck by how similar they were to the debates on the Education Reform Act 1988, when I decided to establish two groups of independent schools-city technology colleges, which were totally independent of government and financed by business people, and grant maintained schools, which were almost independent of government-which we had to get through as a result of an elaborate electoral process which in those days your Lordships tried to hinder, restrict and limit. I was told at the time that these schools would destroy the education system, that the detriment to schools would be overwhelming and that ordinary secondary schools would be undermined and destroyed. That is not what has happened.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="10062134000052"></a>In 1988 the Labour Party objected so strongly that it said it would abolish them all; that it would destroy them as soon as it came into power. That did not happen. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, was a member of a Government who actually expanded and developed them at the expense of local education authorities, I would remind him. He was a senior member of a Government and a Minister of State who approved all this. The CTCs were not voted down. They became beacon schools which other local schools tried to emulate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="10062134000053"></a>In the early days of city technology colleges, the local education authorities opposed them so strongly that they told the other local authority schools for

The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, will remember; he was in the House in those days. The local authorities ostracised them; they said that they were the cuckoos in the nest that would destroy them. Now they tell them to co-operate with them; they are trying to imitate them and to reach the standards that they have established. That is an enormous change, as it was with the grant-maintained schools. I shall allow the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, to intervene but I want him to listen to me for a moment. Again, the Labour Party spent 10 years totally opposing the grant-maintained schools and then it reinvented them and called them trust schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="10062134000054"></a>However, let us forget all of that. I do not want to make party points tonight. This provision for alternative types of schools is good for the whole education system; it drives up standards. As the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said, if parents are dissatisfied with a local school and the local authority has tried to improve it-it has thrown resources at it and changed the head three times in two years and done everything it can-and it still has not happened, what does it do? Just let it go on to the detriment of all the pupils? I shall give way to the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, in a moment, because he is being stirred, but I shall give way to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, first.</p>

For the past three years I have been starting new schools-at first with Lord Dearing-the new university technical colleges. It is a hard row to hoe because many people do not want it. These are colleges for 14 to 18 year-olds-which is disruptive for an 11-to-18 system for a start-specialising in technological and academic subjects. When Ron and I started, local authorities were not very interested. They did not like them for all the reasons that the noble Lord gave: they hurt good schools. Now I find that local authorities are coming to my little team, saying, "We'd like one of those, please". They have seen that it is a new model that they like; it is better. I do not believe for a moment that a good school is threatened-that is rubbish, if I may say so to the noble Lord. He should not get up; he has had his go. Only bad schools are threatened; that is the problem. I can tell the noble Lord that it takes enormous effort to get a school started-to get parents together, to get teachers together. Meetings do not happen. Who is the champion? Can they bring it together? Then we have a divisive curriculum. Then they have to find support and make it viable economically: they have to find a primary school for 150 pupils and a secondary school

All the hurdles that Members of this Committee have tried to put in the way of the new schools over the past few hours is nothing compared to the task that committed groups will have to take on. That is the reality of life. It requires enormous effort and a tremendous act of corporate activity. We should not try to hobble and hinder that activity too much.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="10062134000058"></a>I prefer working with local education authorities. For the schools that I am establishing, we talk first to the local education authorities. If you are creating 14-to-19 colleges, they have to accommodate the 11-to-14 pupils. They also have to accept that it is a very different body in their school organisation. But now I am finding that local authorities like it. It is novel; it is different; and it will be effective. It will be effective, because in every comprehensive at age 12, 13 and 14, you have a vast number of disengaged pupils who do not want to continue in their local comprehensive school. We are providing an alternative which the state system has not yet provided. It provided it back in the 1950s as technical schools, but they failed because they were skill by snobbery. That is why we get a university to sponsor each of our colleges.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="10062134000059"></a>I therefore say to Members who are anxious about all this disrupting our education system that the new academies, to the extent that they will exist in the future, will improve our education system. They will improve the standards; they will get the commitment of local people, which will be very energetic. Even the Liberal Party knows how difficult it is to get local people to do anything-even to vote for them occasionally. So let us imagine how difficult it is to get local people committed to establishing a new school. That is why the Government are trying to make it as easy as possible. We should not make it too difficult for them to do so. This is a very imaginative proposal by the Government and it should be welcomed. It will be welcomed first by the Liberal Party-obviously; it will be welcomed reluctantly by the Labour Party, just as it came to welcome the city technology colleges and the grant-maintained schools. It is only a question of time. It is still in the mode of fighting the last election. When it starts fighting the next election, it will begin to realise that what we are saying is really rather attractive, responsive to the needs of people and beneficial to the education of our country. I cannot wait for the day.</p>

They should think in terms instead of the interests of parents and the pupils. They are taking too static a view of the schools system. Schools are changing and jostling for places all the time. In a town with three or four secondary schools, the least popular may suddenly get a good new headmistress who makes a great difference and the school becomes popular again. Pupils flow to her away from the other schools. This is a naturally dynamic system which can easily absorb other levels of change. As the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said, the Government have lots of levers to deal with any problems that develop as a result of change-we will come to that when we talk about inspections and how we watch the way which the

We are talking about a change which results in parents being happier, pupils doing better and provision being much more closely aligned with the best interests of pupils and parents. Yes, there may be a few bumps in the road, but if we are careful as a Government, we will make sure that they do not hurt people. That must be the way we should go, rather than sticking with what we all agree is a system with a very large proportion of unsatisfactory, or at least sub-optimal, provision.</p>

I read his article about technical colleges and I have some sympathy with it because, for the record, I am strongly in favour of local authorities. But that does not mean that I am against choice and diversity of provision. I do not think that the local authority has to provide everything or that everybody who works at the local authority school has to be employed by the local authority. That is not my position. My position is that the local authority should have oversight. The local authority is responsible for the community and the future of that community. However, the amendment that the noble Lords, Lord Phillips and Lord Greaves, and I are proposing is much more modest. It simply says that the local authority should be consulted, and that these things should be taken into account.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="10062134000063"></a>Despite a wide-ranging difference of ideological approach between the noble Lord, Lord Baker, and me, the actual answer to these amendments is relatively restricted. It emphasises the importance of local authorities. Unless the Bill keeps in mind that local authorities are big players in this game, there will be conflict and difficulties.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="10062134000064"></a>The other point that I would make to the noble Lord, Lord Baker is that much of what he was describing is not what is being proposed by this Government but what was being enacted by the previous Government. In other words, they were seeing schools that were failing and areas where the local authority was performing badly overall. They introduced academies into that context. I do not totally agree with it, but I sympathise and understand the motivation for that. But what the Minister and his boss Michael Gove are proposing is almost the opposite. They are saying that all schools can apply, but they will take the outstanding ones first. They will automatically take the outstanding schools away from the role of the local authority and leave it to manage the less good schools.</p>

<a name="100621-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="10062134000065"></a>That is an inversion of how the noble Lord, Lord Baker, described the motivation for establishing academies. To some extent, it is an inversion of what the previous Government were attempting to do with the academies that they established. That is the part of the strategy I object to. But I repeat that our amendment is much more modest. I hope that the Minister can at least accept one of our amendments.</p>

<p><a name="10062134000105"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Baker, has just spoken. Of course, the city technology colleges were successful because they did not have that restriction. There was nothing to say that they had to "wholly or mainly" draw pupils from the area of the school. Therefore, they could draw them from a wider area, which was how they became beacon schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="10062134000067"></a>From my reading, Swedish schools are not subject to the same restrictions in terms of having to draw from very narrow boundaries. There is a potential risk, particularly in the primary sector as distinct from the secondary sector, of deleterious effects on neighbouring schools. I ask my noble friend to look again at the wording of that clause and see whether "wholly or mainly" needs to be included or whether a general statement about pupils being drawn from the area in which the school is situated would suffice.</p>

Between them, they made many of the points that I hoped to make, perhaps more briefly but no doubt less forcefully and persuasively and argued with far less experience, in my case, than that which noble Lords bring to bear. Both their contributions very eloquently made the core point that I would like to make in response, particularly to Amendment 4.</p>

<a name="100621-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="10062134000069"></a>Generally, these amendments probe the Government's intentions in relation to local authorities and the effect of academy orders on local provision, particularly in circumstances in which a large number of maintained schools wish to convert within a single local authority. We also have a specific amendment to do with new schools, to which I shall come in a moment.</p>

<a name="100621-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="10062134000070"></a>We had an earlier discussion about consultation, which noble Lords will be relieved to know I do not intend to rehash. I said in the light of those comments earlier that I would ponder further and, in doing so, think about the points made to me by my noble friend Lord Greaves. We expect schools to consult parents, staff and pupils.</p>

<a name="100621-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="10062134000071"></a>I move to one general point that touches on the points made by my noble friend Lord Baker and the noble Lord, Lord Adonis. I think that it is the case-and I am discovering this already with anything to do with academy proposals-that there is no shortage of people coming forward when there are academy proposals, making their views known. The local press tend to make their views known and local groups make their views known very forcefully. Groups of parents not in favour of conversion make their views known and groups in favour make their views known. It is not as though currently these academy proposals are considered in a vacuum or in some kind of Trappist silence. I am sure that that vigorous debate in which local people, whoever they are, make their views known as widely as possible will continue.</p>

<a name="100621-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="10062134000072"></a>Our point of principle in this Bill is that schools that want to pursue academy status should have that freedom. Others have made that case far more forcefully than I am able to do or need to rehearse.</p>

<a name="100621-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="10062134000073"></a>On the point of the role of localism, which in the coalition we discuss frequently and to which the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, referred, the debate will clearly continue. People have different views on what localism means and how it should be represented and policed-if that is the right word. With the Bill, we think that individual schools-</p>

The word "police" came unwittingly from my lips. He may have sensed that I was fumbling my way through my sentence and I withdraw it unreservedly.</p>

<a name="100621-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="10062134000076"></a>It is our view that, with regard to local decision-making, involving individual schools, teachers and parents is about as local as it is possible to get. We can argue about how we make that work, but I think that that is pretty local. We think that responsibility for educating children and young people should be devolved to the most local level possible. It is that principle, which I know that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, disagrees with strongly, which has led us to decide that local authorities should not be in a position to veto academy conversions. We know that existing rights in the past has meant that that has happened. If we were to give local authorities the right to be consulted on aspects of this new conversion process, our fear would be that they would be frustrated as it has been frustrated in the past. As has already been set out very eloquently by others, the need to tackle problems of education failure is too urgent to allow that to be frustrated.</p>

<a name="100621-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="10062134000077"></a>I turn to the individual amendments. Amendment 4, moved by my noble friend Lord Phillips, would require the Secretary of State to be satisfied, before entering into academy arrangements, that any new academy met a public need in an area. We had an interesting debate in the House in which these points and the potential legal downsides were aired. I have listened with care to the points made by my noble friend Lord Phillips. He and I have discussed this issue and the specific case that he has in mind, so I understand his view. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, on the amendment. I am concerned about its wording, which could give rise to the danger that the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, pointed out. The whole point of the free schools policy is that in some cases the proposals should be able to cause detriment to a school if that school has been failing and has let children down repeatedly over a long period. Such a school should be able to be challenged and detriment should be caused to it, so that a new and better school can be established or the school ups its game and improves the education that it offers. That said-</p>

I am thinking of the leafy suburbs to which the noble Lord referred. The case that I referred to at Second Reading and tonight involves a good and improving school-indeed, it is the most improved school in the county of Suffolk-which will, according to its head and chair of governors, be mortally damaged if the new school is created. I cannot believe that that is what this coalition Government want to enable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="10062134000080"></a>The decision whether to go ahead with a free school will not be taken in isolation. The Secretary of State has the discretion to take all relevant considerations into account as part of the approval process. Those considerations would, I am sure, include the kind of issues that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, raises. I go back to my earlier point: it seems inconceivable that concerns of the kind that he has raised with me and the views that I know are held by the people concerned with this case would not be made known, not least by my noble friend. The Secretary of State would have to reflect on those in making his decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="10062134000081"></a>During the application process, proposers will be expected to discuss their plans with any local partners, including the local authority, and we will encourage them to do that. The Secretary of State has said-as I mentioned in our debate about the free schools announcement, he wrote to local authorities about this at the end of last week-that, alongside other checks in place, he will talk to local authorities to make sure that he fully understands the local context and circumstances before making a final decision on whether to support the establishment of a free school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="10062134000082"></a>I hope that these are common-sense and practical reassurances and that they will provide some comfort that the process gives the Secretary of State the flexibility to take these issues into account. As I also mentioned, these are early days of the free schools policy. Our approach is to work through the implications of the applications as they come in. I am sure that, over time, we will resolve these issues; we certainly have a willingness and desire to do so.</p>

I stand corrected. Amendments 119 and 191 propose an assessment of the educational impact of each academy conversion before it can go ahead, and a pilot process to make similar assessments over several years. Academies are not a new phenomenon. We know that that they have achieved great things over the years. They already work in partnership with other local schools. They make sensible and co-operative arrangements with local children's services. If we were newly introducing academies, these proposals might well be worth considering very carefully, but we are not. We are, therefore, not convinced that they are necessary.</p>

I hope that noble Lords will be reassured to hear that where we are being asked to fund an expansion of post-16 provision in an academy we will require the academy to make a strong case for expansion and to show that other local providers have been consulted, but we are not convinced that such a requirement needs to be in the Bill. Recurrent funding in academies, including for sixth-form provision, is formulated to ensure that academies are no better off and no worse off than maintained schools for the provision of similar services. However, as we know, they receive funding to buy in services from a local authority or another provider where these will no longer be provided free of charge to the school. A cap that prevented academies from receiving funding for these services would leave academies worse off than maintained schools.</p>

However, I am not asking him to make any commitment tonight. My noble friend Lord Bates said that the new schools should provide education if pupils were,</p>
<ul><a name="10062134000109"></a>"wholly or mainly drawn from the area in which the school is situated".</ul>
<p><a name="10062134000106"></a>That may be too narrow. If there is a wider catchment area for the new schools, the effect on the area local schools will be much less. Certainly, we have very wide catchment areas for the university technical colleges; for example, half the Black Country. This is acceptable to local authorities because no individual school is hit too much. Will he consider that before Report, please?</p>

<a name="1006212000003"></a><b><a name="100621-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="1006212000090"></a>The Minister of State, Home Office (Baroness Neville-Jones):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Theresa May) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="1006212000004"></a>Section 14(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) requires the Secretary of State to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of every relevant three-month period on the exercise of the control order powers during that period.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="1006212000005"></a>The level of information provided will always be subject to slight variations based on operational advice.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="1006212000006"></a><I>The future of the control order regime</I></p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="1006212000007"></a>The document <I>The Coalition: Our</I><I> Programme for Government</I> released on 20 May 2010 and available to view at <a href="http://programmeforgovernment.hmg.gov.uk">http://programmeforgovernment.hmg.gov.uk</a> sets out the Government's plan for the next five years. In that, the Government stated that "We will urgently review control orders, as part of a wider review of counter-terrorist legislation, measures and programmes." This review is now being taken forward as a priority. We will report the outcome of the review to Parliament in due course.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="1006212000008"></a><I>The exercise of the control order powers in the last quarter</I></p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="1006212000009"></a>As explained in previous quarterly Statements on control orders, control order obligations are tailored to the individual concerned and are based on the terrorism-related risk that individual poses. Each control order is kept under regular review to ensure that the obligations remain necessary and proportionate. The Home Office continues to hold control order review groups (CORGs) every quarter, with representation from law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to keep the obligations in every control order under regular and formal review and to facilitate a review of options for bringing each control order to an end while managing the risk to the public. During this reporting period, two CORGs were held in relation to the orders currently in force. In addition, further meetings were held on an ad hoc basis as specific issues arose.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="1006212000010"></a>During the period 11 March 2010 to 10 June 2010, two non-derogating control orders were made with the permission of the court and served. Three control orders were renewed in accordance with Section 2(6) of the 2005 Act in this reporting period. In this reporting period there was one revocation of a control order on the direction of the court on the basis that the court considered that the order was not necessary.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="1006212000011"></a>At the end of the reporting period 12 control orders were in force, 10 of which were in respect of British citizens. All of these control orders were non-derogating. Four of the individuals subject to a control order were living in the Metropolitan Police Service area; the remaining individuals were living in other police force areas. During this reporting period, one individual has

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="1006212000012"></a>During this reporting period, 43 modifications of control order obligations were made. Ten requests to modify control order obligations were refused.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="1006212000013"></a>Section 10(1) of the 2005 Act provides a right of appeal against a decision by the Secretary of State to renew a non-derogating control order or to modify an obligation imposed by a non-derogating control order without consent. Three appeals under Section 10(1) of the 2005 Act have been lodged with the High Court during this reporting period. A right of appeal is also provided by Section 10(3) of the 2005 Act against decisions by the Secretary of State to refuse a request by a controlled person to revoke their order and/or to modify any obligation under the order. During this reporting period two appeals have been lodged with the High Court under Section 10(3) of the 2005 Act.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="1006212000014"></a>One judgment has been handed down in relation to substantive judicial review proceedings under Section 3(10) of the 2005 Act during this reporting period. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v AN, handed down on 12 March 2010, the court directed the Secretary of State to revoke the control order on the basis that the court considered that the order was not necessary. No further detail can be given for legal reasons.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="1006212000015"></a>One judgment has been handed down in relation to proceedings under Section 10(3) of the 2005 Act during this reporting period. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v BX, handed down on 10 May 2010, the court upheld the decision to relocate BX on the grounds that his removal from his extremist associates was properly regarded as necessary for purposes connected with preventing or restricting BX's involvement in terrorism-related activity and proportionate.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="1006212000016"></a>Another judgment was handed down in relation to BX by the Court of Appeal, on 4 May 2010. The court dismissed BX's appeal, holding that the High Court had reached a proper decision in concluding on the material that there were strong grounds for an urgent relocation and in setting early hearings for disclosure and for the appeal. The court found that (other than in a rare case not so far identified) the proper and appropriate route of challenging a modification decision is by way of a statutory appeal under the 2005 Act and that an interlocutory application for an injunction can be made under Section 10 of the Act.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="1006212000020"></a>In the interest of the House and on behalf of government I am depositing in the Library a full list of explanatory memoranda submitted by the Government from 12 April to 9 June. This covers the period of dissolution and the subsequent weeks, during which the parliamentary scrutiny committees have not met.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="1006212000021"></a>I will also deposit a full list of EU documents deposited by the Government in the Library of the House during the same period.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="1006212000022"></a>I would invite members to examine both of these lists and to raise any questions of policy in the usual way or via correspondence. It is vital that the House has a chance to scrutinise the work of government and to consider policy; this is particularly true of our EU business.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="1006212000023"></a>As noted by the Foreign Secretary on 3 June in the House, we are looking to improve parliamentary scrutiny of decision-making in Europe and ahead of ministerial councils.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="1006212000024"></a><b><a name="100621-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="1006212000092"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Baroness Wilcox):</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (John Hayes), has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="1006212000025"></a>On 24 May it was announced that a further £50 million would be invested in further education infrastructure to support the development of new college facilities. This is in keeping with the Government's determination to make further education a key priority.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="1006212000026"></a>In that spirit, I am pleased to inform Parliament that the Government are today launching the college investment fund, and that the Skills Funding Agency will from today begin the process by which this extra resource is to be invested.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="1006212000027"></a>Many colleges up and down the country are still reeling from the effects of the crisis last year in the capital investment programme, which forced a review by Sir Andrew Foster that criticised "failures in the general management and financial management of the Learning and Skills Council".</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="1006212000028"></a>While this Government are unable to undo the previous mismanagement of the FE capital programme, I fully recognise the crucial significance of ensuring the teaching and learning facilities in our further education colleges are up to date and fit for purpose.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="1006212000029"></a>Indeed, I am determined to ensure that colleges across Britain are the best they can be.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="1006212000030"></a>That is why the Government are so keen to support those colleges that did not previously benefit from large-scale public investment. For that reason, the £50 million additional capital will be available to all those further education colleges that have received less than £5 million in total grant support from the Learning and Skills Council since 2001.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="1006212000031"></a>Today, the Skills Funding Agency will write to all eligible further education colleges and confirm that they will each receive a share of a £30-million renewal grant. This will support 153 colleges across the country that have yet to benefit from significant capital funds.  


<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2010" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS96"></a><b>21 Jun 2010 : Column WS96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Each will receive approximately £225,000. I am advised that such investment is expected to facilitate considerable additional private finance.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="1006212000032"></a>The remaining £20 million will be made available  to colleges through an enhanced renewal grant. Approximately 20 colleges will have the opportunity to add to their renewal grant, by bidding to build their total allocation to £1 million. Again it is anticipated that these grants will leverage substantial additional private finance, providing final projects of significant value.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="1006212000033"></a>Applications for the enhanced renewal grant will be assessed using key criteria, including the existing condition of bidding colleges' estates and facilities; resulting benefits to learners; and the contribution which each applicant's proposals make to the regeneration of their local community. Projects will be expected to meet exacting design standards, ensuring a built legacy of which all concerned can be proud.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="1006212000034"></a>The Skills Funding Agency and an expert panel will assess and prioritise all applications, with a view to announcing successful bids by the end of this summer. Crucially, all projects will have to be completed in time for learners to benefit from the new facilities by the start of the 2011-12 academic year.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="1006212000035"></a>I will be writing today to all Members of Parliament regarding this important announcement, and asking them to encourage eligible local colleges to apply for this new fund.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="1006212000046"></a>The main recommendations put forward by the Low Pay Commission concern the rates of the minimum wage and an apprentice minimum wage. The commission has recommended that the adult hourly rate of the minimum wage should increase from £5.80 to £5.93 and reaffirmed the recommendation in its 2009 report that the adult rate should also apply to workers aged 21. It has also recommended increasing the development rate (which will cover workers aged 18 to 20 years) from £4.83 to £4.92 and that the rate for 16 and 17 year-olds moves from £3.57 to £3.64. It recommends that these changes take place in October 2010.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="1006212000047"></a>The Commission has also recommended that there should be a single apprentice minimum wage rate of £2.50 per hour for those apprentices currently exempt from the national minimum wage; that is, all those under the age of 19 and those aged 19 and over in the first 12 months of their apprenticeship.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="1006212000049"></a>In addition, the Government accept the commission's recommendations that there should be specific guidance on the national minimum wage for the entertainment sector; and that HMRC investigates whether contract and agency cleaners in the hotel sector are receiving their entitlement under the national minimum wage for their hours worked.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="1006212000076"></a>Today I am publishing a document setting out the revisions to the <I>NHS Operating Framework for 2010-11</I>. The document has been placed in the Library and copies are available to honourable Members from the Vote Office.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="1006212000078"></a>The department will cease to centrally performance-manage the previous Government's targets on 18-week waiting times and access to primary care. More clinically relevant accident and emergency indicators will be developed for 2011-12. Locally led plans should deliver improvements in median waiting times and access.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a><a name="1006212000079"></a>The coalition Government are committed to stopping top-down reorganisations of the NHS that have got in the way of patient care. To that end, a moratorium is in place for future and ongoing reconfiguration proposals. All current and future reconfiguration proposals will need to meet four new tests as I set out in the document; and can go forward, if and when they do so.</p>

<a name="100621-wms0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="1006212000080"></a>I shall set out that primary care trusts (PCTs) should accelerate the process to transform community services with clear deadlines.</p>

The overall ceiling for management costs in PCTs and SHAs will now be set at two-thirds of the 2008-09 management costs (£1,509 million); the ceiling will therefore be £1,006 million. In aggregate, PCTs and SHAs will need to save at least £222 million in 2010-11 and a further £350 million by the end of 2011-12.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a><a name="1006212000084"></a>I announced on 8 June 2010 my intention to make hospitals responsible for patients 30 days after discharge, one of the key health commitments in the coalition agreement. If a patient is readmitted during that time, the hospital will not receive any further payment for the additional treatment. Making hospitals responsible for a patient's ongoing care after discharge will create more joined-up working between hospitals and community services and may be supported by the developments in reablement and post-discharge support. This will improve quality and performance and shift the focus to the outcome for the patient.</p>

The Government consider civil society has a very valuable role to play in delivering public services as part of our commitment to creating a big society. We will therefore be continuing to look in detail at whether a third-sector model would be appropriate for British Waterways, including the possible inclusion of the Environment Agency's navigations as the other navigation authority grant aided by government. My department will be engaging a wide range of stakeholders in this work (and liaising with the Scottish Government). However I must make clear that, given the Government's overriding objective of reducing the financial deficit, no decisions on such a change will be taken until after the forthcoming spending review. In the light of this I have also decided not to proceed now with a new government waterways strategy and I will review the situation following the spending review.</p>

EU efforts in support of the Minsk Group are rightly guided by the advice and wishes of the co-chairs and the parties to the conflict. Present efforts include the work of the EU's Special Representative for the South Caucasus, Peter Semneby. The EU has also recently launched a new €2 million programme to support people to people peace-building projects in the region.

<a name="100621w0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_15"></a><a name="10062110000059"></a>Effective use of the summary care record (SCR) depends on patients and doctors feeling an ownership of the records rather than them being perceived as something imposed by Government. We believe the current processes that are in place need to be reviewed to ensure that both the information that patients receive, and the process by which they opt-out, are as clear and simple as possible. In addition, should patients choose to opt-out they must be able to do so as early in the process as is feasible. Foremost in our minds is the need to ensure the security of the data contained in the record.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_16"></a><a name="10062110000060"></a>We intend to review the content of the record and consider whether we can improve the process whereby patients can opt-out. We will also agree with the key stakeholders what should be added to the record and over what timescale. This work will form part of a wider project to review how information and technology can be leveraged within the health service. Strategic health authorities have been informed that no further information letters should be sent out to patients about the SCR until after the review has concluded.</p>

Concerns about media freedoms were raised at both meetings. The UK and EU will continue to make clear that relations with Ukraine are built upon a commitment to shared values, including democracy and human rights, and that the erosion of media freedoms would therefore have a negative impact on relations.</p>
