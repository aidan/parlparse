<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Knight of Collingtree </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What proposals they will make following the end of the consultation period on local government takeover of privately owned homes.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the consultation on proposed secondary legislation on empty dwelling management orders ended on 14 October. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is drafting regulations with a view to commencing the provisions on 6 April next year. It is our intention to except from empty dwelling management orders all dwellings that are unoccupied for less than a time period specified by order and dwellings unoccupied beyond this period that fall within specified uses that demonstrate occasional occupation or intent to occupy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister recognise and place on record that it is an extremely serious matter to deprive an owner of any object&#151;whether it is a house, a horse or a home&#151;which that owner has bought in good faith and entirely legally? Can he assure the House that, under these proposals, no council will ever seize a privately owned home in order to put in tenants when that council already has&#151;as so many do&#151;a large surplus of empty property in which to accommodate them?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is perhaps misinformed about the real intent of the policy. It is obvious that we are trying to make sure that better use is made of empty property. The legislation was carefully argued through in your Lordships&#039; House, and at various times during its passage it attracted support from the Conservative Benches, not only in your Lordships&#039; House but also in another place. The point about local authorities&#039; management of their own properties is well made, but it remains the case that 80 per cent of empty properties are in the private sector.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </b>   My Lords, given that about one-third of a million privately owned properties in this country have remained empty for more than six months, could not building on greenfield <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_610"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 610</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

sites be significantly reduced by bringing those properties back into use, and would not that be welcome? Could not that policy be furthered by encouraging the Treasury to equalise VAT rates on new building and on renovation and repair?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am not going to be drawn into a debate on different tax regimes. However, I understand the point that the noble Baroness makes and she is absolutely right. There is a vast unused asset in empty properties. Those represent homes and we want to see that good use is made of them. This provision will provide local authorities with the opportunity, by the process of agreement in most instances, properly to manage properties that would otherwise be unused, to make them suitable for people without a home.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister think that there is a parallel here with a statement that I read in the newspaper about dormant bank accounts being taken over? How can he be sure that dormant houses are really dormant and that people are not waiting to do repairs? What sort of research will be done to ensure that that is not the situation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, an empty dwelling management order will be made only after the local authority has gone through all the proper processes and the case has been properly considered by a residential property tribunal. There are many safeguards, checks and barriers to the sort of instance which may be concerning the noble Baroness. The local authority will research and understand why the property is empty. There will undoubtedly be very full contact with the owner or the person managing the property. There is also the ultimate safeguard of the issue being heard before a residential property tribunal, so that we can be certain there will be no abuses of the system.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that, apart from gross neglect or obvious abandonment, there are very few reasons, if any, why a person&#039;s property should be expropriated? If he thinks that there are such reasons, perhaps he will inform the House.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, this is not a form of expropriation. In many instances, it is the local authority helping the private owner to manage the property better. The noble Baroness clearly does not like the provision, but John Hayes&#151;the Conservative housing spokesman in the other place when we were bringing through legislation on housing&#151;proposed a scheme to lease empty properties which is very much <br>&nbsp;<br>

like the one we are proposing in secondary legislation. So I am confused about the Conservative policy on this.

<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </b>   My Lords, what correspondence or communication has the Minister had with the Housing Corporation about the number of housing association properties currently standing empty? Will he ask the Housing Corporation to advise him on those numbers and to tell him why local authorities in cities such as Liverpool, in areas which are supposed to be subject to regeneration, have to take action against housing associations which are publicly funded for leaving properties empty for intolerably long periods?
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I was hoping that my brief contained a statistic for housing association dwellings. It has figures relating to registered social landlords, but they may not necessarily be housing associations. It is up to the Government to work with councils, housing associations and the private sector in its many and various forms to ensure that we get the best from empty properties, so that homeless people have access to a decent home and a decent place to live. That is what our policy is trying to do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister understand that in many parts of the country neglected and abandoned properties are causing blight and a nuisance and are making life difficult for otherwise good, respectable families in good, respectable houses in decent streets? This measure is well overdue and very welcome. Will he give an assurance&#151;and I declare an interest as a member of Pendle Borough Council&#151;that the measure can be used effectively by councils such as mine and that the safeguards, checks and barriers which are rightly being put in place to protect the interests of owners will not be so great that EDMOs will be useless in practice?
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, we believe that this is a practical scheme; we have consulted very carefully on it. We intend to introduce it, as I say, on 6 April next year. We have worked in close liaison with local authorities on this issue and they think that this is a workable and practicable scheme. I am sure that <br>&nbsp;<br>

the noble Lord, like other noble Lords, will welcome a measure that puts a roof over the heads of those who are homeless in this country.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spnew16"></a><b> Baroness Shephard of Northwold: </b>   My Lords, what will be the cost of this measure, and who will bear the cost? Will it be local authorities?
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, as I understand it, the scheme will be self-financing. It will be administered through the local authorities and the rental income will go back to the owner of the property.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What arrangements they have made for co-operation with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) on anti-terrorism activities; and what is their assessment in this context of the recent troubles in the north Caucasus region.

<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="51109-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  My Lords, in recent years there has been a steady increase in the exchange of information, initiatives and visits between the security and intelligence services of our two countries relating to international terrorism. The recent events in the north Caucasus, in which many innocent lives were lost, highlight the genuine security concerns faced by the Russian authorities and emphasise the need for international co-operation to combat terrorism.
</p>

<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="51109-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that while it is obviously necessary in security matters to work with all sorts of people, the length of spoon with which one sups is quite important? Is it not essential to remember that we are above all in a battle for hearts and minds if the issue of defeating terrorism and building global security is to be won? While terrible, inexcusable acts have been committed by terrorists in the Caucasus and Chechnya, does the Minister agree that the brutality, the indiscriminate nature and the ruthlessness of the Russians have driven young people, and not only young people, into the arms of the extremists? Is it not therefore essential for us to be very careful in our collaboration with Russia, so that what we are doing is not perceived by many in our own country as something about which they are alarmed?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="51109-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I acknowledge that my noble friend has a long-standing interest in Chechnya and that he was the special rapporteur on Chechnya <br>&nbsp;<br>

for the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. He speaks with great authority. We view Russia as an important partner in the international fight against terrorism. Co-operation on counter-terrorism must not be at the expense of losing our interest in human rights concerns and therefore people&#039;s hearts and minds. We have consistently said that any counter-terrorism operation in Chechnya or elsewhere should be in strict adherence to the rule of law and must respect human rights.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="51109-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the recent fighting has left a large number of victims of land mines and unexploded ammunition? What is being done to provide the necessary services for these people?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="51109-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, a number of aid programmes are being directed at areas such as education and health, and we are making a contribution to them. So long as the terrain is one in which aggressive actions between forces are taking place, the kinds of operation which would involve clearing up land mines are plainly not possible. I wish that they were.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="51109-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, while recognising the appalling behaviour of a number of Russian forces in the north Caucasus and that some of the Russian police forces are clearly penetrated by organised crime, does the Minister accept that it is useful&#151;maybe even helpful and necessary&#151;to do our best to educate the FSB in how one deals with the problems of counter-terrorism? In this respect, I was very glad to meet the FSB visiting group that has been in Britain in the past few weeks and to see that it was going to Northern Ireland to learn from British experience in dealing with complex terrorist problems. I suggest that the Government continue to attempt to explain to Russian security services the subtleties that one has to get into in dealing with all forms of terrorism and organised crime as they overlap.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="51109-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I agree that the kinds of exchange which resulted in the visit to Northern Ireland are invaluable. They certainly provide a basis for raising everybody&#039;s mutual understanding. We frequently express to the Russian authorities our belief that security measures which do not respect international and humanitarian law are counterproductive. The long-term solutions to the region&#039;s problems will be possible only once there is an end to human rights abuses. So long as those continue, a satisfactory outcome is very unlikely. The visit to Northern Ireland should underline that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="51109-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, I think that we all recognise the point that was made by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, about brutality on both sides, and that we all wish to see the FSB further reformed in the ways that Mr Putin and others have suggested. The reforms have been a bit slow. But are we in Britain being as helpful as we really should be in ensuring that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_614"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 614</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

some of the more evil terrorists and people who are in any way charged with terrorism are returned to the Russian Federation? I think the Russians wanted to see Mr Ahmed Zakayev returned. I am not sure that we have been too helpful there. I encountered fury in Moscow when it was discovered that the BBC had been interviewing Mr Basayev, the child killer of Beslan, and there are several other instances where we might be a little more co-operative. Will the Minister assure us that we are going to help the Russian authorities ensure that the really evil men are brought to justice?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="51109-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, every one of us must share an interest in reciprocity in the counter-terrorist work that we do. The murder of more than 300 children in School No. 1 in Beslan must have been one of the most shocking and horrific acts by any terrorist group at any time; we all deplore it. In the case of Mr Zakayev, who was granted asylum after due assessment by the relevant authorities of his case&#151;and of the UK&#039;s obligations under the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees and domestic law&#151;a grant of asylum should not be taken to indicate any United Kingdom approval of the kinds of views that have been expressed. It is a legal decision on an international obligation. Where people can and should be returned, I have no doubt that that is what we should do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="51109-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Rea: </b>   My Lords, can the Government somehow explain to Mr Putin that the Chechen and the other Islamic peoples of the north Caucasus have never accepted that they are part of Russia? The present conflict is, in fact, a continuation of the colonial struggles that took place in the 18th and 19th centuries. Is it not likely&#151;as in the West Bank, Iraq and any other country that is forcibly occupied&#151;that insurgent attacks, ugly as they are, are likely to continue until a firm agreement is made to withdraw the occupying forces?
</p>

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>What representations they have made to the government of Israel about the 23 square miles of land in the West Bank alleged to have been expropriated from Palestinian owners since July.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="51109-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, we are greatly concerned by Israeli expropriation of Palestinian land through settlement building and the routing of the barrier on occupied territory, particularly around east Jerusalem. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_615"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 615</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

It is contrary to international law. We regularly raise our concerns on these issues with the Israeli government. Most recently, my honourable friend Dr Howells, the Minister of State, raised our concerns with Foreign Minister Shalom and Housing Minister Herzog during his visit to the region on 27 to 30 September.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="51109-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, I am glad to hear from the Minister about what his colleagues have been doing, up until only the end of September. Can he confirm whether more land has been taken recently in the West Bank than was actually given back within Gaza? What is the quartet doing to ensure access both into and out of Gaza and east Jerusalem? Can he be a little more specific than his honourable friend was on 26 October in another place?
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="51109-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I am glad to say that the land that has been taken since the withdrawal from Gaza has not, at this stage, led to a renewal of building. The decision of the Israeli high court about the line of the fence has also adjusted&#151;albeit minimally&#151;the amount of land which falls on the Israeli and Palestinian sides of that fence. I am not aware of a direct measure being made of the acreages involved. I confirm that success in Gaza will depend on there being viable points of access, viable capacity to trade and the development of a full economic future for that part of the country. That is a project in which, I am happy to say, the Egyptian Government are also actively involved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="51109-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the purpose of the wall was to reduce the opportunities for terrorist attacks, and that since its construction there has been a substantial reduction? Would he agree, too, that those of us who wish well to both parties can best assist the peacemakers on both sides by refraining from judgmental interventions?
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="51109-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, anything that makes the peace process more difficult should certainly be avoided. It is probably true that the route of the wall and the wall itself&#151;the barrier&#151;has reduced the number of suicide bombings in Israel but we do not believe that the route is the best one for security, particularly since it divides Palestinians from Palestinians, and in many Palestinian villages it is not helping anybody in the conduct of normal life. However, we recognise&#151;I restate this&#151;the Israeli Government&#039;s right to defend their citizens from terrorist attacks, including from suicide bombings. Building the barrier on occupied territory is, however, contrary to international law. There is no right on one side of this; we seek the end of terrorist attacks and we seek adherence to international law. It is in that balance that any part of the road map has any chance of success.

press him one stage further? The Prime Minister of this country and the President of the United States have repeatedly talked about a two-nation solution with a viable Palestine surviving alongside a secure and peaceful Israel. Does he agree that at a certain point the inroads from the security fence&#151;which are very substantial, especially around the middle of the West Bank area beyond Jerusalem&#151;and the continuing settlements, which have led to another 14,000 settlers arriving to be housed in the West Bank this year alone, will eventually create a situation in which no viable Palestine is physically or economically possible? Are Her Majesty&#039;s Government making representations to the other members of the quartet about the absolute necessity of protecting the possibility of a viable Palestine?
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="51109-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, those representations are being made to other members of the quartet, and other members of the quartet have seized on the arguments and made exactly the same points. The fact is that further settlement and further building east of Jerusalem would, in effect, put a knife right through the West Bank, and a contiguous state would not be possible.

It was a brave step and it was done with a good deal of skill and it offers some prospects of further peace being achievable. I believe that the whole quartet, quite aside from us, believes that. I can understand that the Israelis will look at the recent upsurge of violence, including the suicide bombing in Hadera on 26 October, which killed five people and injured a further 55 people, some of them gravely, as being a further and major assault on the security of the state of Israel. These matters have to be kept in balance; progress must be made on both sides.

Could the Minister acknowledge that that is happening and perhaps tell this House what advice he is giving tourists who wish to go to Bethlehem this Christmastime to celebrate the birth of Christ?

doubt the noble Baroness knows. I can only repeat on the substance of the question that we believe that the barrier is illegal; it is not being built in convention with international agreements. That is something that is put to the Israelis at all times, notwithstanding their right to ensure that their citizens can go through an ordinary day without the risk of being murdered.

<a name="51109-03_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, our record on local government funding is very good, and we build on that year-on-year. Since 1997 there has been a 33 per cent real terms increase in government grant. That compares with a 7 per cent reduction in the four years prior to our coming to office in 1997, when the Conservatives were in government. The 2005&#150;06 settlement was the eighth successive year in which the Government had provided local government overall with a real terms cash increase in government grant above inflation. Government grant was up during that year by &#163;3.5 billion, a 6.3 per cent cash increase.

of the money we spent was raised locally. But the funding regime for local government has changed considerably since then and it is the case that somewhere between one-fifth and a quarter of money for local services is generated locally. That is rather different from the days when I first became a member. As to its desirability, we have a sound system now, and we aim to build on that. However, we need to keep these things under review, which is why we asked Sir Michael Lyons to carry out his fundamental review of local government financing.

However, she did not answer the question I asked her, which was whether, during the coming settlement, the Government intend to claw back any of those efficiency savings, which were made on the promise from the Government that they could be reinvested in services?

<p><a name="st_65"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 1, I wish to speak also to Amendment No. 2 with which it is grouped. At an earlier stage of the Bill, we tried to obtain an explicit reference in Clause 9 to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I set out four main reasons for doing this. The convention is the most ratified of all human rights treaties. It is one of the most comprehensive treaties covering children&#039;s rights. Children are uniquely vulnerable and easy to ignore and England&#039;s 11 million <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_621"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 621</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

children, unlike those in the rest of the UK, do not have a rights-based Children&#039;s Commissioner. On that occasion I was delighted that the Minister said that she would go away and think about how to ensure that the commission will work for children. That has always been our point&#151;to gain assurances that children will very much be part of this vital new body. The Minister well understands that we are looking for a steadfast guarantee that children will be included in the establishment, operation and review of the commission, and that that will not be left to chance or good will.
</p>

<a name="51109-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, which we are debating today, avoid the problem of lists that the Minister described in her reply. &quot;Children and adults&quot; includes everybody. It could be argued that children are implicitly covered in the legislation. However, I strongly fear that without an explicit reference to children in the Bill the new commission will focus exclusively on adults. Experience shows that, where children are not explicitly provided for in an organisation, they are ignored or given inadequate resources and attention. That is why we have <i>Every Child Matters </i>and the new roles at local authority level of children services director and lead member for children&#039;s services, to make sure that children get their fair share of attention and resources. That is the Government&#039;s own agenda.
</p>

<a name="51109-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>Are we satisfied that the existing equality bodies are working adequately for children; that children&#039;s issues are part of their strategic planning; that they regularly consult children to find out about their experiences and what matters to them; that their casework includes those under 18; and that they are working with the Government and others to bring about greater equality for children&#039;s rights? If children are missing out now, what guarantees have we that they will not be kept to the margins in the future?
</p>

<a name="51109-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>Working for children does not mean simply adapting what is written or done for adults; it means being child-focused from the start&#151;consulting them, setting priorities relating to them, and having the staff and organisational competence to work effectively and systematically to improve their lives. I am reminded that the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services states that, until recently, children&#039;s needs in the NHS were seen as no more than,

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Involving children in knowing their rights and responsibilities as young citizens can be an immense power for good&#151;both for them as individuals and also for their families, schools and communities. Only this morning, I visited one of UNICEF&#039;s &quot;Rights Respecting Schools&quot;, Kempshott Junior School in Basingstoke, and saw for myself the benefits&#151;both academic and social&#151;of incorporating an understanding of the convention into their citizenship education. That was at primary level; I was much impressed.

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has produced guidelines on establishing human rights institutions for children. It stresses the participation of children in the work of the institution, the need for tailored programmes to advance their human rights, and urges that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;The legislation (establishing the institution) should include provisions setting out specific functions, powers and duties relating to children linked to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its optional protocols&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>I accept the Minister&#039;s assurances that the Convention on the Rights of the Child is covered in &quot;other human rights&quot; in the Bill, but ask that she think again about including a specific reference to children in this Bill setting up the commission. The task in establishing this new commission is not just to make sure children are not left out; it is to plan systematically to put them in. That will mean having a fresh approach and doing some things very differently. I believe my amendments will enable this to happen and I look forward to the statement the Minister promised us at an earlier stage. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="51109-04_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   My Lords, on Report I tried to have the Convention on the Rights of the Child referred to again explicitly, because I wanted to emphasise how necessary it was to include children as central to the commission&#039;s work. To have that in the Bill would certainly have encouraged the commission to take a broad approach to children&#039;s human rights, and to have regard to all the articles of the convention as well as the general comments and concluding observations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child.
</p>

<a name="51109-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>I appreciated the Minister&#039;s point about lists. However, these amendments are a way in which the Bill can refer explicitly to children without opening up that problem. The amendment makes it clear that in promoting and protecting human rights the commission must work for and with children. The amendment ensures that no group is excluded; &quot;children and adults&quot; covers everyone.

As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, children have particular communication needs. Information must be tailored to their age and understanding, and it needs to be available in the right places such as schools and health centres.

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>A commission will do much more than raise awareness, important though that is. Children comprise one-fifth of the population. The UK has a comprehensive set of human rights obligations to them set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other instruments, and there are increasing concerns about children&#039;s asylum and immigration.
</p>

<a name="51109-04_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>The report this summer from the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, Alvaro Gil-Robles, was critical of those areas of policy, as was the European Committee of Social Rights. There remains a lot to be done to improve UK children&#039;s human rights, as demonstrated by the annual review by the Children&#039;s Rights Alliance for England and not least by ceasing to imprison children. I am glad to see a Written Answer from the Government in yesterday&#039;s <i>Hansard</i> which looks a little hopeful on that point. We hope that the equality commission will be a major force for change in children&#039;s lives.
</p>

<a name="51109-04_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>In considering whether children should be referred to explicitly in the Bill, we must ask ourselves one question. If children are not part of the legislation, will they be adequately and consistently catered for? My fear is that they will not be sufficiently central to the commission&#039;s thinking and actions unless they are in the Bill. I hope the Minister can accept the amendments, but if she is unable to do so I hope that she can set out her thinking in some detail on how she expects the equality commission to embed the rights of the child population into its plans and actions.

<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="51109-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Morgan: </b>   My Lords, I support the amendment and I have three reasons for doing so. First, the Children&#039;s Commissioner for England does not have a specific remit on human rights, as he or she should. They are circumscribed in their powers, which rest on the Secretary of State, and in their philosophy because human rights are not brought in. We found some difficulties in this area when we discussed the hitting of children and the so-called &quot;reasonable chastisement&quot; provisions, which have been condemned on human rights grounds by international bodies, particularly in Europe, and against which there was no redress. I would like to improve the situation for children who are born and reared in England.
</p>

<a name="51109-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>Secondly, I would like to safeguard the situation for children who have been born and raised in Wales. Under the Children Act, anomalously, the Children&#039;s Commissioner for England can interfere in the work of the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales. I find it in another context constitutionally bizarre that the Government who have introduced devolution should nevertheless reintroduce the well known tradition, &quot;For Wales, see England&quot;. That seems a little out of date. It also means that the role, philosophy and independence of judgment of the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales&#151;who has a human rights remit, as have the Children&#039;s Commissioners for Scotland and for Northern Ireland&#151;may be compromised. Writing children formally into the Bill in human rights terms, which is already done in so many countries across the globe, would strengthen it.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51109-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The final point is that, apart from the practicalities, it is the right thing to do. Surely human rights apply to everybody. We would rear up in protest if human rights were curtailed on the grounds of race or religion, so we should do so on the grounds of age, in terms of people being either too young or, for that matter, too old. We should have equality of treatment and fulfil those aspects of the Bill, especially towards children, who are currently gravely neglected in this area.

<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="51109-05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   My Lords, WC Fields had to be reminded that even children are human beings. Speaking as a lawyer, I am quite sure that the amendment is technically unnecessary because children are, undoubtedly, within the ambit of the Bill. However, speaking as a human being rather than a lawyer&#151;the two are not necessarily identical&#151;I can quite see the presentation value of such an amendment. I therefore support it with one caveat, which I will express to my old friend, the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote. She spoke twice of children being central to the work of the commission, but all the vulnerable groups are central to the work of the commission. I would not like the commission ever to be captured by one vulnerable group. All of them must have parity of concern, esteem and care. Subject to that caveat, I am in favour of the amendment.

<a name="51109-05_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </b>   My Lords, I suppose that being a lawyer and being a human being are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but I certainly support this amendment. It is important that children are put into the Bill. The other vulnerable groups to which the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, referred are also included, but including children is essential. After all, we have separate legislation for children and I would have thought that it was right that children should be explicitly acknowledged as the subject of these provisions in the Bill. I notice that it is proposed that the Bill will be amended later in relation to the European Community enactment. I cannot see any objection to making explicit this particular group&#151;children&#151;in the Bill on any grounds concerned with lists or the like.

Innovative techniques will be required in order to engage with young people&#151;noble Lords who have experienced working with children and young people will know that that is essential to ensure that we learn from children and young people what they want and need.

<a name="51109-05_para4"></a>

It will need to work in a joined-up way with other organisations whose remit covers children, particularly, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, says, the Children&#039;s Commissioner. We expect, want and desire a memorandum of understanding to be agreed between the commissioner and the new commission to ensure that that happens effectively.
</p>

<a name="51109-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>On human rights, the remit will embrace children and young people. For example, the commission&#039;s inquiry powers will allow it to look into general discriminatory treatment of children and failure to meet human rights standards. Similarly, the commission will be expected to work with children and young people to tell them about their rights, and how those rights can be protected.
</p>

<a name="51109-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>Noble Lords will know that we build on work that has happened with existing commissions, such as: the work of the Commission for Racial Equality, promoting youth leadership among minority ethnic groups; the EOC&#039;s work to combat gender stereotyping in children&#039;s early years; and the Disability Rights Commission&#039;s running of the educating4equality campaign, raising awareness of new rights for disabled pupils, and its work with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to ensure that awarding bodies do not discriminate against disabled pupils. I mention those because they are good examples&#151;not necessarily with the high level of publicity that I would like&#151;of how the commissions are already working. It is our intention to ensure that the new commission will do the same.

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>I will probably rue the day that I ever mentioned lists, and my phobia of lists. There is a difficulty with the amendment as it stands, however. I have had a conversation with the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, and say to her and the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, that I have tried hard to find a way that I could put this in the Bill that would not run me into difficulties because it would invite everybody to want a list&#151;an issue that we have to take seriously. Also, the difficulty with the amendment is that when I took it to parliamentary counsel, they advised me that it would cast doubt over whether children were covered in the other provisions of the Bill. I know that is not the intention of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. It could also, of course, narrow the scope of the clauses concerned, in that the commission could undertake its activities only with individuals, and not with public authorities and other bodies at a corporate level. I could not accept it if I wanted to, because it would not do.

As noble Lords will know, I take this issue very seriously. Thirdly, in the work that we do in establishing the commission, I will commit to come back to the House and ensure that we are very clear about how the commission is going to work with children.

I am grateful for the Minister&#039;s reassurances. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and I will be happy to take up her suggestion of meeting her colleague, Meg Munn. I accept what she said about the deficiencies of the amendment. The statements that she made are some of the strongest that we might have expected from a Minister on a subject such as this. We will certainly look for a review at some stage of how the commission is working for children, and the Minister has just promised us one. She will accept that it is our experience that if children have not been specifically mentioned, resources and attention have not always followed. Therefore, her invitation to review how well the commission is working on children will certainly be taken up by the children&#039;s mafia in your Lordships&#039; House.

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>I am sure that noble Lords will recall that on Report on 19 October, I moved an amendment asking the Government to look again at the possibility of extending the protections proposed for religious groups against discrimination in goods, facilities and services to the lesbian and gay community. I was truly grateful for the support I received, not just from those who spoke but from colleagues on these Benches. The Government have always maintained that it would be impossible to do the necessary consultations and <br>&nbsp;<br>

establish the need for those protections during the passage of the Bill. This amendment, which is supported by my noble friend Lord Smith of Finsbury and the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, allows the Secretary of State to make a regulation to correct this mischief on the face of the Bill while giving sufficient time for consultation.
</p>

<a name="51109-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>I do not intend to make a long speech. The Government have been most generous, and I hope that we have found a way to satisfy them as well as thousands of gay men and lesbians who will benefit from these provisions when they are eventually enacted. In anticipation of a favourable response from the Front Bench, like a Hollywood actor at one of those Hollywood ceremonies, I would like to say a few thank yous, and I may possibly shed a tear. I would like to thank my agent, Stonewall, for all its help in drafting and moving this amendment. I would definitely like to thank noble Lords on the Back Benches for their continued strong support for gay and lesbian rights. I would like to thank my noble friend Lord Smith of Finsbury who, less than half an hour after he delivered his maiden speech, stood up to speak in support of these amendments. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, who has seen this through with diligence and patience. My noble friend Lady Turner of Camden has always been in her place, not only during these debates, but during every piece of equality legislation that I have witnessed in this House. Of course, I will save the final thank you for my colleagues on the Front Bench until I have heard what they have to say.
</p>

<a name="51109-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>It has been a real thrill and a privilege to be part of this mini drama. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="51109-06_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Smith of Finsbury: </b>   My Lords, first, I support my noble friend Lord Alli in proposing his amendments. In the 21st century it cannot be right for people to be discriminated against in going about their lives, in buying or making use of goods and services, simply on the ground of their sexual orientation. Worse than facing that discrimination is the existence of discrimination in the law which gives a green light to those who seek to act out their discrimination in rather more violent ways, as sadly we have witnessed in the past few weeks. Therefore, it is incumbent on all of us to ensure that the law does not discriminate and that practice is not allowed to discriminate. These amendments will secure that objective and I strongly endorse and support them.
</p>

<a name="51109-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Secondly, as I do not have my noble friend&#039;s ability to speak after the Minister, I want to thank, in anticipation, my noble friends on the Front Bench and their right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the very constructive way in which they have sought to accommodate the principles and the feeling on these Benches and across the House.
</p>

<a name="51109-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Thirdly, in drawing up the regulations that we hope will arise if these amendments are passed, I ask that Ministers will be expeditious, that they will ensure that the consultation takes place, as is only right and proper, and that as soon as that consultation has taken place they will seize an early opportunity to put the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_629"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 629</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

regulations in place. Those ambitions have too long been unfulfilled. I look forward to the day when, with the help of my noble friends on the Front Bench, they will indeed be fulfilled.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="51109-06_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   My Lords, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Alli, will also feel able to thank me. I have every sympathy with the objectives that the noble Lord seeks to achieve with these amendments. I am certain that there should be no discrimination or harassment against anyone on any ground whatever, including sexual orientation. I also believe that the noble Lord will agree with me that respect has to be given to the susceptibilities of others on genuine&#151;I stressed the word &quot;genuine&quot;&#151;and deeply held religious beliefs. I am sure he will agree with me as his Amendment No. 41 states in subsection (3)(e):


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;provides for exceptions (whether or not of a kind similar to those provided for by Part 2 of this Act or any other enactment relating to discrimination or equality)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I very much hope that the noble Baroness will take reasonable and long-held religious views into account when drafting the regulations. While Amendment No. 41 says, in reference to regulations, that the Secretary of State &quot;may&quot; make regulations about discrimination or harassment on grounds of sexual orientation, there is clearly no compulsion. I hope that the noble Baroness is able to do that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="51109-06_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   My Lords, I am very privileged to find myself supporting the noble Lords, Lord Alli and Lord Smith of Finsbury, on these amendments. With the benefit of foresight, rather than hindsight, it was clearly a mistake for the Government to introduce religious discrimination without introducing sexual orientation discrimination at the same time. That is water under the bridge. The great virtue of these amendments is that both kinds of unfair discriminatory treatment will be covered in legislation. I hope that the Minister will be able not only to accept the amendments but also to tell the House about the Government&#039;s timetable and the consultation so that we can have some idea whether this will happen sooner or later, without committing the Government to any particular dates.
</p>

<a name="51109-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Finally, I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Alli, in the best tradition of this House, spreading flattery and adulation across the House. I remind him and the House of what happened in the 19th century. There were two great constitutional historians; one called Freeman, and the other called Stubbs. They kept writing reviews of a flattering kind about each other&#039;s books. One day a wag wrote:

<a name="51109-07_spnew0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Newcastle: </b>   My Lords, I too welcome the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and its extension into the areas of goods, services, facilities and premises. I am pleased that these amendments have been tabled today. I have one concern, which is not about the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_630"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 630</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

objective of the amendments but about the method being used. It is about the interface between the right not to be discriminated against on the one hand and the right to freedom of religion on the other. That interface can be a complex and sensitive matter. So there needs to be a careful balancing exercise. That is perhaps best achieved by having a careful period of parliamentary scrutiny.
</p>

<a name="51109-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Therefore, I wonder whether legislating by this means of simply being subject to affirmative resolution on a take it or leave it basis provides the opportunity for the kind of scrutiny which I think would be helpful. I do not question the objective of these amendments; I simply ask about the means by which we seek to achieve it. If the amendment is successful, as I hope it is, perhaps the Government will agree to engage in early discussions with the Churches and other faith communities on how their interests can be reflected in the provisions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="51109-07_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   My Lords, like the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle, I welcome the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. However, I oppose the amendments because they contain no guarantees of proper religious protections, which means that there could be alarming problems for Churches and religious organisations.
</p>

<a name="51109-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>The amendments empower the Secretary of State to use secondary legislation to address sexual orientation discrimination. Under the wording of the amendments the regulations could include religious protections, but I am told that that is not required. Maybe they will; maybe they will not. If there are protections, what will they be? We do not know. There is uncertainty on this issue.
</p>

<a name="51109-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>There might be circumstances in which a religious group may want to refuse a service because of its religious ethos. Church membership, for example, is often denied to people who do not accept the basic, ethical teaching of the Church&#151;much the same way as membership of a political party is denied. Religious groups must have protection against legal actions designed to attack their doctrinal convictions. I believe that that is a very serious point.
</p>

<a name="51109-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>I have been contacted by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester. He wanted to be here to speak to these amendments but has been unavoidably delayed in Winchester. His view is that these amendments have come much too late in our proceedings to allow proper consultation with those religious groups that would want to have their say about how this would be implemented. He is concerned that legislating by secondary legislation does not allow the opportunity for the proper parliamentary scrutiny that a Bill would allow. Here I echo what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle said.
</p>

<a name="51109-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester feels the whole thing has about it&#151;in his words&#151;&quot;the same whiff of social engineering which was present in the wording of Clause 3, which talked about the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_631"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 631</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

creation of a society&quot;. The simple fact is that these amendments do not contain any religious protections, nor do they guarantee that they will be provided. That is why I do not support them and would like to hear what the Minister has to say.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="51109-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, like the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle, I, too, am concerned about the detail that will presumably be brought in by affirmative order. It is not absolutely clear whether an affirmative order will be involved. I hope the Minister will confirm whether affirmative or negative procedure will be used.
</p>

<a name="51109-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>I believe that everybody is agreed on the principle of equality; nevertheless, the details could be very worrying indeed. It is a question not only of religion but of the operation of the regulations and laws which will come about. The law of unintended consequences could very well come into play in this field.

</p>

<a name="51109-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>For example, these laws will&#151;I am seeking information here&#151;presumably apply to people providing a couple of rooms for bed and breakfast. If I am wrong, perhaps I could be corrected. It may very well be that the person providing bed and breakfast has religious objections to people living as lesbians or homosexuals. In that case, she will presumably be criminalised if she refuses to give them a room overnight. I would like to know about that, for example, because we are talking about ordinary people now, not great hotel chains or other, larger, establishments. These are some of the problems that I can foresee.
</p>

<a name="51109-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The problem with proceeding now on the basis of this amendment&#151;which will undoubtedly go through&#151;is that when regulations come to us by affirmative or negative order, we can discuss them but we cannot amend them. We cannot add or subtract; all we can do is agree or disagree. In a matter as sensitive as this, we perhaps ought to consider whether there is another way of dealing with this problem. It is probably too late now, and I apologise for coming late to this matter. I had not wanted to intervene, but now that I have seen the amendments, I can see that there are some difficulties. I do hope that, because I have raised these difficulties, I will not be discriminated against on the basis that I might be, although I am not, homophobic.

Discrimination and harassment against groups of people on grounds of sexual orientation should be totally outlawed. I hope that we shall pass these amendments this afternoon and take a great step towards achieving that objective. I fully support these amendments.

<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="51109-07_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Ferrers: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness says that she is in favour of not discriminating against people, which is a view shared by everyone. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, made a very important point. As I understand it, these decisions will come up in regulations and cannot be amended: they can only be accepted or rejected. As your Lordships know, it is not the convention to reject orders in this House. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle correctly said that there is a right not to be discriminated against. There is also a right for freedom of belief. I believe that many people will find there are more problems in the detail than there are in a general feeling that you should not be discriminated against.
</p>

<a name="51109-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alli, said that the Government have been very generous and that many gay and lesbian people will benefit. I am sure that that is so. He had a touching catalogue of thanks for people to whom he wanted to express gratitude in the apparent belief that this matter was all over and done with. It reminded me of those people who write begging letters at the end of which, they say, &quot;Thanking you in anticipation&quot;. The noble Lord is premature in his thanks. Whatever the views of individuals about discrimination, we should give more time to considering the effects of this amendment.
</p>

<a name="51109-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>My noble friend Lady O&#039;Cathain said that the new amendment covers the possibility of religious protections, but they are not required to be protected. There are examples such as a church hall being let out to gay rights activists. The church could refuse to hire its hall possibly to a Jehovah&#039;s Witness, under exemptions in Part 2 on religion, but it could not refuse to hire it to a gay Christian group. That would be sexual orientation discrimination. Even if protections are included in the regulations, because they are only secondary regulations, gay rights groups could go to court to try to have them excised. That is unlikely to happen, but it is a possibility.
</p>

<a name="51109-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>We should think about what we are putting into primary legislation before we go that far. For example, a private hospital provides fertility services to infertile couples in line with its publicly stated Roman Catholic pro-life beliefs. It is perfectly reasonable to have those beliefs and to do that. But along comes a lesbian who applies for treatment and is refused. She could argue that the hospital has discriminated against her in the provision of services. Religious hospitals or <br>&nbsp;<br>

organisations could be prosecuted for their religious beliefs and for applying them in the way they think is correct.

<a name="51109-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>I am glad that the noble Baroness is smiling. That is always very encouraging. I really believe that there is more in this than writing, at the very last moment, something fairly fundamental into the Bill. I hope that the noble Baroness will assure us that more thought will be given to that. If we are not given that assurance, we will have to see what happens.

<a name="51109-08_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Lockwood: </b>   My Lords, I fully support these amendments. I am a little surprised at the way in which the debate is going. Perhaps I should not be surprised, because the kind of thing that is being said now is the kind of thing that has been said every time non-discriminatory legislation goes through Parliament. Fears are raised which are found to be groundless. Arguments are put forward that do not stand up to scrutiny. When an Act is placed on the statute book, we behave in a sensible way in interpreting the legislation. There is understanding that, initially, there might be a few difficulties in coming to terms with some of the minutiae. But we get over those problems. This issue has been before Parliament on a number of occasions, even before this Bill. It has been raised at every stage of the Bill&#039;s passage, and there has been ample opportunity to discuss the basic principles and some of the implications arising from it. After previous discussions in the Chamber and consultations with the Government we have come up with a series of fair amendments that meet all the objections. They will work in a practical way when the Bill is given Royal Assent.

No one who has followed the Bill&#039;s progress through the House can doubt that when legislation seeks to make discrimination or harassment unlawful very complicated issues arise. I am sure that I am not alone in worrying about an amendment dealing with such discrimination being put before the House at this late hour, and by the suggestion that the law should be changed by regulations that cannot be amended. I hope that the least we can expect from the Government is that there will be extensive consultation before regulations are brought before the House. Perhaps the matter could be dealt with in that way. Some of our fears would be alleviated if we had the opportunity to see the shape of the regulations before they are put before the House for a vote. I agree entirely with my noble friend Lady O&#039;Cathain that one would wish to see that the regulations provided some safeguards for religious communities.

is a Select Committee of the House&#151;the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, established 18 months ago. It now has significant influence. We examine every statutory instrument and bring a small number of them to the attention of the House. Departments are properly fearful of bringing forward orders that have not had proper consultation and cannot satisfy all the assurances sought by your Lordships. A couple of us from the committee are here today, and we shall look out especially for those orders to ensure that the assurances given by the Government have been fully carried out. If not, the House has the power to vote the measure down. Do not underrate the power of secondary legislation. We should support it by expressing concerns and ensuring that there is full consultation. I have every faith that that will happen, and the House has the power to ensure that it does.

<a name="51109-08_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </b>   My Lords, I welcome those developments, which make it possible to examine the provisions of subordinate legislation a good deal more fully than was possible in the past. I agree that there are difficult questions in drafting the regulations that will implement the amendments if they become part of the Bill. I assume that the Minister will undertake that nothing in the regulations will criminalise the practice of a person&#039;s faith in relation to the matters that may be the subject of the regulations.

<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="51109-08_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, this has been an interesting debate, and I could have predicted that these issues would be raised. I shall try to address them on behalf of the Government.
</p>

<a name="51109-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>There is no question of a late-hour amendment. Throughout the passage of this Bill, I have met with every noble Lord who has put down an amendment in order to make sure that we have the right kind of dialogue. I think that every noble Lord would agree with that. So, as amendments emerge during the passage of the Bill, the Government are usually fully aware of what the amendments are about and why they have been proposed. Noble Lords will know that, at every stage of this Bill, this issue has been raised on all sides of your Lordships&#039; House with real strength of feeling. I have also seen that today. Despite the reservations, the underlying principle behind the amendments commands huge support in your Lordships&#039; House, and rightly so.
</p>

<a name="51109-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>It was precisely because of the concerns that were raised that the Government were unable and unwilling to accept the amendments that came before your Lordships&#039; House at the previous stage. As the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, said, consultation is a critical part of the development of the regulations. In a sensitive area such as this&#151;we accept that it is&#151;it is very important that we make it clear that we need to consult. We need to consult those who have a religious <br>&nbsp;<br>

conviction; we need to consult those who have been discriminated against; we need to consult business; we need to consult all those who provide the services that we are seeking to regulate.
</p>

<a name="51109-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>I smiled at the comment of the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, about religious hospitals. It was not the &quot;religious&quot; but the &quot;hospital&quot; bit at which I smiled. It is difficult to imagine a hospital refusing a service to anybody. I take serious issue with that.
</p>

<a name="51109-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>It will be an affirmative process. We want the maximum amount of consultation. We are not in the business of trying to criminalise individuals for strongly held beliefs. We are in the business of making sure that people cannot be discriminated against when that is inappropriate. I am extremely grateful for the tenacity of my noble friend Lord Alli, supported by his noble friend Lord Smith, the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and many other noble Lords on our Benches and other Benches, who worked incredibly hard to see what we could do in the Equality Bill that could support our belief that it is unacceptable to discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation.
</p>

<a name="51109-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>It is the Government&#039;s intention to accept the amendment. It is an important moment because it will lead to an important change in the law. It will lead to much-needed protection against discrimination in areas of life where gay men and lesbians have suffered the kind of injustice and unfairness that can blight lives. It will lead to regulations that will mean that gay men and lesbians will no longer need to put up with discriminatory treatment in hotels or bars, in the financial services sector or in other services provided by the public and private sectors. Anyone who suffers such treatment will in future have the protection of the law. These changes can have a real impact on daily lives. They are one more step towards the society based on fairness and social justice that I believe every Member of your Lordships&#039; House and certainly every member of this Government seeks. It will be another important step on the road to the comprehensive rights that the Government have sought to provide for gay, lesbian and bisexual people.
</p>

<a name="51109-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>I congratulate my noble friend. I have listened with great care to the concerns that have been raised. We will be very mindful of the sensitivities involved. We will consult properly and widely. Your Lordships will have the chance to see what is happening for it will be done in a transparent and open way. I say to noble Lords who have concerns, &quot;Please don&#039;t have the concerns; we will do this properly&quot;. We want to do it for the benefit of our entire society, but especially for those who have been discriminated against for far too long. It is a privilege to accept the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="51109-08_spnew7"></a><b> Earl Ferrers: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may intervene before the Minister sits down. It is commendable that she said that there will be full consultation. Indeed, she has been studiously concerned with consultation <br>&nbsp;<br>

throughout. But if one consults with somebody who has one set of views and somebody who has another set of views, eventually the Government have to make their mind up. Once their mind is made up, what they decide appears in the regulations. Once the regulations are made, Parliament cannot easily alter them. Does the Minister agree?
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="51109-08_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, the purpose of the consultation is to look at why people have strongly held views, the services they provide, the way in which this would work, and to reach&#151;as far as we possibly can&#151;an appropriate and consensual approach. Eventually, Parliament will have its day to look at the regulations. I suspect that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will determine that there will not be one big group of regulations. Rather, the consultation will take place over a period of time. The timetabling issues will be for my honourable friend Meg Munn to work out. I am sure more of such detail will emerge as the Bill reaches another place.
</p>

<a name="51109-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Have no fear; we will ensure that what comes before your Lordships&#039; House is properly thought through. The Government will take a view, but Parliament will have its chance too.

<a name="51109-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Alli: </b>   My Lords, first I thank the Minister for her kind words, and reiterate how pleased we are that the Government could accept these amendments. Subject to the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, I would like to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for her contribution&#151;not just today but, in brief, on 19 October. She made her support perfectly clear then.
</p>

<a name="51109-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>In a sense, the arguments put forward today give all the justification one needs for this amendment to go through. Prejudice lives on. The argument for equality goes something like this. &quot;We all want equality; it&#039;s a great thing. But, you know, if we&#039;re a religious organisation, we should still be allowed to discriminate against gay people&quot;. That has always been unacceptable to me. The quicker it changes, the better. I understand that there are deeply held faiths, and problems. I hope that during the consultation period, those come through and are discussed. But be in no doubt; the view held, I suspect, by the vast majority of noble Lords on this side, and in my party, remains that equality is not negotiable. It is an absolute.
</p>

<a name="51109-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>I hope the Minister can pass on my thanks to her right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for his personal intervention, and the way in which he has handled this matter. I want to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, who has been at the Dispatch Box more than once to listen to our arguments with her usual courtesy and frankness. I also want to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, who, throughout the Bill&#151;not just on these amendments&#151;has listened and acted. That is an important role to play. I sense that the debate is finished.

&quot;(11)   A reference in this section to a provision of the equality enactments includes a reference to a provision of Community law which&#151;

<br>
(a)   relates to discrimination on grounds of sex, racial origin, ethnic origin, religion, belief, disability, age or sexual orientation or to equality of opportunity between men and women, and


<br>
(b)   confers rights on individuals.


<br>
(12)   In its application by virtue of subsection (11), subsection (1)(b) shall have effect as if it referred to an allegation by an individual that he is disadvantaged by&#151;


<br>
(a)   an enactment (including an enactment in or under an Act of the Scottish Parliament) which is contrary to a provision of Community law, or


<br>
(b)   a failure by the United Kingdom to implement a right as required by Community law.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_101"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the purpose of this amendment is to enable the commission to support proceedings alleging that domestic legislation is incompatible with EC law in equality between men and women, or EC legislation combating discrimination on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. This covers provisions under Articles 13 and 141 of the EC Treaty, such as the Equal Treatment Directive, the Equal Pay Directive and the race and framework directives based on Article 13.
</p>

<a name="51109-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>As the Bill is currently drafted, the commission will be able to provide assistance only where the proceedings relate wholly or in part to one or more of the equality enactments. These, as noble Lords will know, include all the domestic legislation prohibiting discrimination, such as the Sex Discrimination Act (1975) and the Race Relations Act (1976), as defined in Clause 33 of the Bill. There is therefore no provision for the commission to support an individual alleging, for example, that they have been disadvantaged by other GB legislation which they believe to be incompatible with EC equality and discrimination law. However, that is less extensive than the powers that are currently available to the Equal Opportunities Commission as a result of case law. As some noble Lords know very well, about 10 years ago a case was brought and won by the Equal Opportunities Commission. It concerned the adverse impact on women of certain employment legislation provisions that required two years continuous employment for full-timers to qualify for unfair dismissal and redundancy payments but five years for part-timers, who are of course mostly women. The courts were asked to consider whether those provisions were <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_638"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 638</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

compatible with community law. The Law Lords found for the Equal Opportunities Commission, which had brought the case for a judicial review, but expressed the view that individual claimants should bring their claims not by way of judicial review but before an employment tribunal, supported by the Equal Opportunities Commission.

</p>

<a name="51109-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a> If we do not amend the Bill in that way, the new commission will not be able to support an individual bringing a similar case. That would mean that the new commission would have fewer powers than the Equal Opportunities Commission, which, as the House will know, has never been our intention. This amendment will enable the commission to do this to support a case in which an individual alleges that they have been disadvantaged by other legislation that they believe to be incompatible with EC equality and discrimination law. I commend the amendment to your Lordships&#039; House and beg to move.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 6 and speaking to Amendment No. 5, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 7 and 8. The Minister explained clearly the object of the amendment, which I strongly support. It ensures non-regression; that is, it ensures that what the EOC can do will be able to be done by the new commission. There is just one snag, which comes from the problem of lists. I can see the Minister scowling but nevertheless I must deal with it.
</p>

<a name="51109-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>The snag is that the way in which Amendment No. 5 is drafted does not properly reflect the EU race directive or the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, so it does not properly reflect community law with regard to the other commission&#151;the CRE. That is why my Amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 8 have been tabled, to fill the gap in the Government&#039;s amendment. To be clear, under EU law, nationality discrimination is forbidden, which is why Amendment No. 6 would add the word &quot;national&quot; and Amendment No. 7 includes the words &quot;nationality (including citizenship)&quot;. That reflects both the race directive and the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. That is why my Amendment No. 8 would include equal opportunity &quot;between different racial groups&quot;, as between men and women.
</p>

<a name="51109-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>This problem goes back to the well-known problem that the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, refers to often&#151;the problem of having lists. The moment you have lists, you find that you may leave something out. It is important that the race side of the question has not been properly dealt with. I would not be surprised at all if the Minister were to say that the matter needs to be thought about further and dealt with in the other place. I should be entirely content with that&#151;but I <br>&nbsp;<br>

He and I have discussed them on a couple of occasions and he knows that I cannot accept his amendments today. It is not only the list issue&#151;and I regret having set myself up in that regard. The list in paragraph (a) of the government amendment intends to reflect the body of Community law associated with Article 13 of the Treaty of Rome. National origin, nationality and citizenship are not included in the concepts in Article 13 and thus are not included in the body of the amendments. We cannot consider them at the moment, because, as the noble Lord knows from when he tabled his amendments, I have not been able to explore and get cross-government agreement. That is why I cannot move on that at this point. I have, however, asked my officials to continue to work with the noble Lord on these matters, and they are delighted to do so. They will talk to the noble Lord, and I expect us to make progress as the Bill moves into another place. The points are well made by the noble Lord&#151;I am just not in a position to get the agreements I would need.

</p>

<a name="51109-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>I sympathise entirely with the intention behind Amendment No. 8. It appears from the government amendment that we have given undue attention to equality of opportunity between men and women at the expense of other groups. That was not our intention. We consider that the reference in the amendment I have proposed to discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial origin or ethnic origin and other factors implies equal equality of opportunity for the groups concerned. Our intention in making explicit mention of equality of opportunity for men and women is to ensure that equal pay issues were clearly included within the body of relevant Community law. I accept the point, but I cannot accept the drafting. If the noble Lord will permit me, I will take this away, and the Government will propose at a later date some alternative drafting that gives effect to the intention he is seeking. On the basis that we will certainly look at Amendment No. 8 and that we will continue to work with the noble Lord on the other two amendments, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment today.

&quot;LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOR PERSONS OR ORGANISATIONS BEING INVESTIGATED ETC. BY THE COMMISSION

<br>
(1)   This section applies where the Commission is&#151;


<br>
(a)   conducting an investigation under section 20, or


<br>
(b)   issuing an unlawful act notice under section 21, or


<br>
(c)   making an application to a court under section 22(6), or

<br>
(a)   an individual, or


<br>
(b)   a charity, or


<br>
(c)   an organisation of the type mentioned in section 57 of this Act,


<br>

<br>
(3)   The Lord Chancellor shall make regulations providing for payment out of central funds for the provision of such legal assistance.


<br>
(4)   The sections listed in subsection (1) of this section shall not come into force until the regulations mentioned in subsection (3) have been laid before and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_108"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I return briefly to my concerns about providing some form of legal aid for charities and religious groups who find themselves on the wrong end of legal action backed by the new Equality Commission.
</p>

<a name="51109-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, who took time last week to discuss my concerns. She is a brilliant Minister who makes you feel she is listening to you&#151;and I know she is. Even when she declined to amend the Bill to meet my concerns, she still managed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_641"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 641</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to make me feel as if I was coming away with something. That is quite a skill. Not only does she deserve the honorary degree she received yesterday, on which I congratulate her, but if there were such a thing as an honorary degree in diplomacy she should get that too.
</p>

<a name="51109-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>However, I remain anxious that, in a legal action over a controversial issue of religious liberties, the enormous financial and legal resources of the commission could be ranged on one side of a legal dispute, leaving a defendant on the other side with limited financial resources at a considerable disadvantage. A church or religious charity being sued would be left passing round the offering plate to raise money to pay lawyers. In these circumstances, even a bad case could make a lot of progress. It could even succeed. The inequality of resources could result in a miscarriage of justice.
</p>

<a name="51109-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, does not think that I need to be concerned about any of these things. She does not believe that the commission would ever use its legal powers other than in the most gross and obvious case of discrimination that everyone would think deserved to be outlawed. I hope she is right. But the noble Baroness came to my aid and suggested that if I tabled these amendments she would make statements on the record which would, if I understood her correctly, give a steer to the commission to ensure that it does not use its legal powers in inappropriate ways against religious charities. I am happy to do so.
</p>

<a name="51109-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>I will sit down and invite the Minister to give her reassurance before withdrawing my amendment. But before I do so, I ask the Minister to respond to a particular argument that I raised on Report. I have received legal advice which suggests that, where human rights issues are at stake, creating a massive inequality in legal resources between the parties&#151;as the Bill does by providing legal assistance to one side but not to the other&#151;may breach the European Convention on Human Rights. I should be very grateful to hear the Minister&#039;s response to that legal argument. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="51109-10_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Baroness for giving her time last week to discuss these issues. I sought to reassure her and I intend that the noble Baroness goes away with something. We do not expect the commission to pick on organisations or to deal with them inappropriately. I am determined&#151;as I am sure are colleagues across government&#151;that the way in which we set up the commission will ensure that it is very clear about its work and focus.
</p>

<a name="51109-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>The noble Baroness is absolutely right to consider that that is all well and good but to ask what would happen if the situation which she mentioned occurred and to ask what safeguards would be in place. I sympathise with the noble Baroness&#039;s concern that small organisations, whether charities, religious charities or small businesses, fear being treated inappropriately and oppressively by the commission. However, as I said, we need not fear that happening. The Federation of Small Businesses warmly welcomes <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51109-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>I asked officials to scale up what is spent by the commissions at present on supporting legal cases in employment tribunals, which is where the bulk of these issues are dealt with. The relevant figure is about 4.5 per cent, which is not huge given that supporting legal cases in employment tribunals is a core, fundamental part of the commissions&#039; work. I believe that it is about right. In a budget of &#163;70 million&#151;if the officials have done their arithmetic correctly, which I am sure they have&#151;the relevant figure is just over &#163;3 million. About 250 significant cases are supported by the three commissions every year. I believe that figure will apply also to the new commission. Therefore, we are not talking about huge resources or huge numbers of cases. However, part of the fundamental purpose of the commission is to support cases as it will tackle discrimination where it arises.
</p>

<a name="51109-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>The first safeguard is that the commission&#039;s job is to be sensitive to its stakeholders. If it fails to do that, it will lose authority and support. Sensitivity to stakeholders includes the fact that the commission needs to think very carefully about how it uses its resources. We have not set out in the budget particular sums that need to be spent on X or Y in view of the concept of independence that we discussed previously. However, it is very important that those involved in the commission, and those, including Parliament, who set it up, feel confident that it is using its resources efficiently and well. That is an important safeguard. As noble Lords will know from the Bill, the commission will need to consult on its strategic plan, including its legal and regulatory strategy. That is also an important safeguard.
</p>

<a name="51109-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>However, I recognise that a small organisation could find itself defending an action brought by the commission. However, the checks and balances in the system ensure that a body in that situation is not disadvantaged. As the noble Baroness and I discussed&#151;I know that the noble Baroness accepts this&#151;most of these discrimination proceedings are brought in employment tribunals. Over the years employment tribunals&#039; processes have increasingly been designed to ensure that the procedures which are used are very straightforward. We make formal representation unnecessary. In addition, in both the courts and tribunals clerks or judges or tribunal members themselves would seek to assist a person who was unrepresented with matters of procedure. If a case brought before the court or tribunal is vexatious, or does not disclose a cause of action, procedures exist that would allow the case to be terminated. Procedures are now in place in employment tribunals to sift out claims that cannot be substantiated. That, again, is an important safeguard. A tribunal application will be accepted only if the aggrieved party has been through the statutory grievance procedure with the employer, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_643"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 643</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as required by recent reform to employment legislation, maximising the opportunity to have a non-judicial outcome.
</p>

<a name="51109-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Similarly, there are also procedures that allow a successful respondent in court to claim the costs of their defence. The bulk of these cases are dealt with in the employment tribunal, with straightforward procedures, no need for representation, and a sifting process to ensure that these are real cases and real claims and that vexatious claims are dismissed. Where a case might go to court, it is possible to claim the cost of the defence, which is important.
</p>

<a name="51109-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>I also outlined on Report the safeguards built in when the commission exercises its other regulatory powers; for example, to compel evidence in the course of an investigation. In looking at devising these powers, we thought carefully about the need to ensure that there is a fair process for those who are subject to enforcement action. We believe that we have achieved a reasonable balance. The commission will be a public body and will be subject to review in the courts if it seeks to act unreasonably or unlawfully by the nature of it being a public body.
</p>

<a name="51109-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>As the noble Baroness is aware, legal aid will be available to any individual facing proceedings in the county court, subject to the statutory means and merits tests. The noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, referred to the case of <i>Steel and Morris </i>v<i> the United Kingdom</i>. In that case&#151;I refer to it because of the question the noble Baroness specifically asked me&#151;the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the inability of the applicant to get legal aid had breached their right to a fair trial under Article 6. The court highlighted the exceptional nature of that case: at 313 days the longest in English legal history, 40,000 pages of evidence, 130 witnesses giving oral evidence, and a 762 page substantive judgment. In this &quot;exceptionally demanding&quot; case&#151;as the court described it&#151;a fair trial was not possible if one side lacked the resources to be represented or to cover the costs of mounting a defence.
</p>

<a name="51109-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>That is why, in the Access to Justice Act 1999, the Government made exceptional funding available in cases which would normally be excluded from public funding. A grant would be made by Ministers if it was recommended by the Legal Services Commission and if the case has a significant wider public interest or an overwhelming importance to the client, or if it would be practically impossible for the client to defend the proceedings. The <i>Steel and Morris</i> decision was made in an exceptionally demanding case with an extreme disparity of resources, and we believe that the exceptional funding scheme remedies the deficiency in the legal aid regime that brought that about.
</p>

<a name="51109-10_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>I have thought carefully about the proposal for a new fund that would provide legal assistance for an individual, a charity, or religious or belief organisation, subject to the commission&#039;s powers. But as I said on Report and as I have said to the noble Baroness, there are difficulties about the proposal, not least&#151;and I make no bones about it&#151;because of the pressures on legal aid funding, the need to control that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_644"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 644</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and the other good causes that would, in a sense, come forward. It would have to be an establishment of a fund at the expense of other priorities.
</p>

<a name="51109-10_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>I hope that all the safeguards I have now outlined will give the noble Baroness some comfort. I refer to the way the commission will be set up, the way that it is meant to deal with these issues, the approach it must take to its stakeholders, the way in which we would expect it to deal with its regulatory powers and the way in which the courts and tribunals now operate. I see very little danger, but if there were a danger I have already outlined what could happen. I say categorically that it is not our intention that the commission will be able to use any of its powers to pick on individuals, charities, religious or belief organisations or small firms. On that basis I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

These two amendments seek to address the concerns expressed by noble Lords and to clarify the Disability Rights Commission transition commissioner&#039;s role.


</p>

<a name="51109-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>On Report, the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, and my noble friend Lady Wilkins raised concerns about the term of appointment of the DRC transition commissioner not being of sufficient length to allow the wealth of knowledge and expertise that the Disability Rights Commissioner has built up to be transferred effectively to the new commission. On Report, I said that I understood the case for having the term of appointment of all three transition commissioners on a common basis and that it was a matter on which, in the classic way, I volunteered to reflect further. I have indeed reflected further, and these amendments are the result.

transition commissioners nominated by the Commission for Racial Equality and the Equal Opportunities Commission. Amendment No. 44 clarifies the role of the transition commissioners, capturing the essence of the arguments put forward by noble Lords on Report, which is that the role of the transition commissioners is to ensure a smooth transfer of functions and expertise from the existing commissions to the new commission. We are ensuring that focus by precluding the possibility of the DRC transition commissioner being appointed as either a member or chairman of the disability committee. As the Disability Rights Commission has expressed it, the DRC transition commissioner is looking back, whereas the committee is looking forward exclusively. I beg to move.

Their eloquence has paid off. I shall echo the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, who has disappeared, and say that the Minister deserves a degree in diplomacy. This change is due to their eloquence and her unfailing ability to listen. She has reflected once again and has come up with the goods.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>Page 27, line 7, leave out &quot;or effect&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_117"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, it is with considerable regret that I find myself in the position of being virtually forced to bring the amendment back at this final stage of the Bill, which in general terms is accepted by all parties as being very necessary in this day and age. The amendment is the same as that I proposed in Committee. It deletes two words from Clause 45, which describes the offence of harassment as being something that is done by one person, A, with &quot;the purpose or effect&quot; of violating someone&#039;s dignity or,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;creating an intimidating, hostile . . . or offensive environment for B&quot;,</p>

</p>

<a name="51109-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>where B is another person. In the strongest possible terms, I object to the words &quot;or effect&quot;, because they mean that we are not merely banning acts that are done with the express purpose of violating someone&#039;s dignity or intimidating or degrading B, but the Government want to ban acts that a person can claim have that effect.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_646"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 646</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51109-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>The Oxford English Dictionary describes &quot;effect&quot;, among many other descriptions, as &quot;an impression&quot;, which is a purely subjective test that it is impossible to disprove. If B says something that has that effect, who will gainsay him? We have only to look at the events of the past few weeks to see what ludicrous effects politically correct opinions can have. I am not talking about the farcical decision to commemorate the Battle of Trafalgar as having been fought between the red and blue fleets, rather than between us and the French. I am talking about the nonsense of one local authority renaming Christmas lights as winter lights, about schools banning nativity plays and Christmas cribs, and about the kite flying over Bonfire Night claiming that it is offensive to Catholics. Actually, Bonfire Night commemorates the prevention of an act of religious terrorism.
</p>

<a name="51109-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>I hope that the Minister will forgive me for saying this, but I am talking about the absolute farce of the Home Office&#151;the department of one of the two Ministers conducting this Bill throughout your Lordships&#039; House&#151;threatening to withdraw support and funding for an annual carol service at St Martin in the Fields, one of the most famous churches in London, on the grounds that it is too Christian. I wonder if the Minister&#039;s department has noticed that every year, a Christmas tree is erected in Trafalgar Square just in front of St Martin in the Fields. Perhaps we will be expected to reject the Norwegians&#039; generous annual gift, on the grounds that some mischief maker might claim that, as the Bill says, it has the effect of violating his dignity or humiliating him. Worse still, some mindless bureaucrat might decide that it might conceivably do so, however remote that idea appears to be.
</p>

<a name="51109-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>The irony is that responsible spokesmen for all the major non-Christian religions have said time and again that the celebration of Christian festivals and the publication of biblical texts outside churches does not offend them in any way. Equally, I have never heard of any one person of the dominant faith complaining about the celebrations&#151;sometimes colourful celebrations&#151;of the festivals of other faiths.
</p>

<a name="51109-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>I refer to the answer that the Minister gave me when I raised this matter on Report. She said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;it would always be open to those who had the &#039;effect&#039; of discriminating&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>she probably meant harassing&#151;

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>With the greatest respect to the Minister, who is one of Her Majesty&#039;s learned counsels, I believe that that is totally incorrect.
</p>

<a name="51109-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>The clause says nothing about the necessity of proving an intention to have that adverse effect. On the contrary, the intent aspect is entirely covered by the earlier words in the same sentence, which refers to acts for the purpose of having that result. In a letter to the noble Lord, Lord Lester, dated 2 November, which has been placed in the Library, the Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;Simply removing the words &#039;or effect&#039; would mean only those actions which are carried out with the express purpose of violating another&#039;s dignity or creating an intimidating environment could constitute harassment&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="51109-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>Exactly&#151;that is precisely the result that I am trying to achieve with this amendment.
</p>

<a name="51109-11_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>The Minister also said that the same wording is found in other legislation, including that directly related to Sikhs and Jews, and that this amendment would create an inconsistency. Possibly because I found myself simultaneously coping with another major Bill and not having the benefit of flocks of paid researchers such as are enjoyed by Ministers and Members of the other place, I did not have the time to look up what she was talking about. If I had, I would have used this Bill as an opportunity to try to remove such a patronising and condescending provision at the same time. If such provisions exist elsewhere, as the Minister says, they are equally wrong. If we have not yet seen a crank or malicious claim, that does not mean that we will not in the future. It is certainly no excuse to leave a similar, objectionable provision in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51109-11_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>Earlier this evening, I said that the Minister could not accept the amendment, or did not want to. Actually, I think that it would create a considerable inconsistency, as she says in her letter to the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill. It is not that she does not think that the words should go, but rather that it is difficult to get rid of them because they appear elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="51109-11_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>The words that I object to, and wish to remove, are those that create an offence merely because a person claims that some act or other, however innocuous, has adversely affected him mentally. How is anyone going to be able to climb into the mind and see if it really did? Are we really going to have to rely on the courts to decide whether it was reasonable for him to take offence? I cannot understand why the Government are so obdurate in refusing to remove these two words. They do not prejudice the working of the clause.
</p>

<a name="51109-11_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>I commented on Report that I was not supporting the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill&#151;to delete Clause 47, as it was then&#151;because I thought the Government would except the words &quot;or effect&quot;. If you take those words out, the rest of the clause is a good one in that it stops people being harassed, intimidated or made nervous. With those words, however, it is totally unacceptable. So it is more than what I said before&#151;that I had reservations because it was, in effect, throwing the baby out with the bathwater. It was purely that I thought that there was enough left in that clause to make a good clause. I did not want to force the Government to get rid of something that might be helpful.
</p>

<a name="51109-11_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>The political correctness and cotton wool nannying that these two words generate can lead only to endless litigation. The Minister will tell me that they will not, because she can give me examples of other Bills that include them. They should not be in this Bill; they should not be in the other Bills. I am going to test the opinion of the House in a moment, and very much hope that we are going to be able to remove these two offensive words. They change what ought to have been a very good clause.

</p>

<a name="51109-11_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>If the Minister is unable to accept that&#151;I suspect that she is not, because she has been listening to me a lot and simply says no because it is inconsistent with other Acts and so on and so forth&#151;I will advise all my noble friends that they will have to vote to get rid of Clause 45. I would be sad if that is what we would have to come to, because there is value in that clause.
</p>

<a name="51109-11_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>If the Minister were able to agree with my amendment, there would be no need for the other amendment. However, the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, has kindly spoken to me at length and has suggested to me that I should not divide the House because I cannot win, and that, by advising my colleagues to vote for Amendment No. 14, that amendment could be won. I said to the noble Lord that I would think about it, and I did. Two points come to mind, however. First, if there is a wish to make this clause better, then I am amazed at what the noble Lord has said. He says that we could support him in getting rid of the whole thing, but he would not find it possible to support getting rid of the two words that make it offensive.
</p>

<a name="51109-11_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>That is one reason why I will test the opinion of the House. If the reality of the situation is that we do not win, I will support the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and would advise my noble friends to do likewise. The second reason why I am not prepared to do as the noble Lord suggested is because, although I want to get rid of those words, I believe that the rest of the clause is acceptable. I feel that when you believe in something, you have to do what you believe. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="51109-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   My Lords, first, I make it clear that in speaking to this amendment I am speaking to the entire group of amendments. I am sure noble Lords will be relieved to hear that I shall make just one speech. Secondly, what I am about to say shows no lack of support for Part 2 in relation to religious discrimination. I have no difficulty about those provisions, which are very important and which we support. Thirdly, my object is to persuade the Minister and, for that matter, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, that the right thing to do is to remove this clause from the Bill and get it sent to the Discrimination Law Review so that it can be considered in the light of everything else and then it can come back and we can have a provision of which we can be proud.
</p>

<a name="51109-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>Having said that, we have previously explained our strong objections to the way in which a broad and ill-defined tort of religious harassment has been included in the Home Office part of the Bill, creating a real risk of legal proceedings by the intolerant or the thin-skinned will be brought in the sensitive areas of housing, education or public services. I am not going to repeat them. We proposed that the complex issues surrounding this controversial tort should be removed and reconsidered by the Discrimination Law Review, and the Minister appeared to be sympathetic to that suggestion.

</p>

<a name="51109-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, mentioned, on 2 November the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, sent me the Home Office&#039;s reasons for insisting on retaining religious harassment in Part 2, rather than referring it to the Discrimination Law Review. I am sorry to have to say that it is clear from her letter&#151;this is a bit hard, but it is true&#151;that the Home Office still does not understand the most basic principles of discrimination law. I am delighted to see the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn of Hadley, in his place because I am going to refer to one of his judgments. The letter correctly states that Jews are covered by the Bill as an ethnic group but states that &quot;part of designating them&quot; as an ethnic group is &quot;that they have a shared religion&quot;. It is not clear to whom the Home Office refers as &quot;designating&quot; Jews as an ethnic group. It is not for it to do so. In any case, it is not true. The letter also asserts that the Race Relations Act protects Jews,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;from religious as well as ethnic discrimination and harassment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>I have heard similar views expressed by the Muslim Council of Britain. They are without foundation, and it is a matter of concern that they are given credence by the department responsible for the operation of the Race Relations Act.
</p>

<a name="51109-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>It has been clearly established for a quarter of a century, since the decision of Mr Justice Slynn, as president of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, in 1980 in the case of <i>Seide </i>v<i> Gillette Industries Ltd</i>, which the noble and learned Lord may remember, that Jews are included within the Race Relations Act only as victims of racial, and not religious, discrimination. That decision was followed in the case of<i> Tower Hamlets London Borough Council</i> v <i>Rabin</i> in 1989 and was relied on in the House of Lords case <i>Mandla </i>in 1983. It was also shown in the New Zealand Court of Appeal case called <i>King-Ansell</i>. Jews are protected under the Race Relations Act not because they have a shared religion but because of their shared ethnicity, whether real or as perceived by anti-Semitic discriminators. Exactly the same protection applies to Muslims&#151;I am sorry there is no Muslim Peer here today&#151;who are protected if they have an ethnic identity as well as a religious one; for example, because of their colour or national origins. The typical anti-Semite who persecutes Jews does not usually do so because of their religion but because of what he regards as their tainted ancestry and their blood. The Nazis murdered anyone with Jewish ancestry irrespective of their religious beliefs. It is profoundly dispiriting to encounter such misunderstanding of anti-Semitism and of discrimination law and it is offensive to the memory of millions of Jews slaughtered in pogroms and in Nazi extermination camps. Jews were persecuted and exterminated on the Continent because of their actual or presumed Jewish identity or origin. They were not spared because they were atheists or agnostics.

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>It has even been suggested by the Minister that Jews may be removed from the protection of the Race Relations Act altogether and given protection only on religious grounds. I cannot believe that she would really do that because that would be a regressive step <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_650"></a>

that would not only breach the UK&#039;s obligations under the European convention, the international covenant and the CERD, but it would also be deeply offensive to the victims of the Shoah and to the entire Jewish community. When the first Race Relations Act was enacted in 1965, with Sir Frank Soskice at the Home Office, it was done in part to combat an increase in racial anti-Semitism. It would be outrageous to withdraw that protection because Muslims as such are not a racial group. I hope that we shall not hear that suggestion again.
</p>

<a name="51109-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>The true position may be summed up in this way. There is religious anti-Semitism and there is racial anti-Semitism. Before the 19th century, anti-Semitism was primarily religious in nature, based on Christian or Islamic interpretations of Judaism. That form of prejudice and discrimination is directed at the religion itself and so usually does not affect those of Jewish ancestry who have converted to another religion. That form of anti-Semitism is covered by the religious discrimination provisions in this Bill, just as religious Islamophobia is covered.
</p>

<a name="51109-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Racial anti-Semitism is a kind of xenophobia rooted in ideas of race. Racial anti-Semitism became the dominant form of anti-Semitism from the late 19th century until today. It replaced the belief that the religion of Judaism was to be hated with the idea that Jews themselves were a racially distinct group regardless of their religious practice and that they were inferior or worthy of animosity. It is racial anti-Semitism&#151;will the Home Office please listen and note?&#151;that is made unlawful under the Race Relations Act, just as racial Islamophobia is covered by the Race Relations Act.
</p>

<a name="51109-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>To meet the criticism of extreme vagueness of religious harassment, the Home Office relies on the fact that similar language has been used in regulations to give effect to EU directives. That is true and it is regrettable that the Government have not exercised the option under the directives to define harassment more precisely to accord with the British legal tradition. In any event, the provisions of Part 2 of the Bill are not required by EU law; we have a free hand. The Home Office letter adds:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;If it is desirable to define harassment more closely we consider the place to do so is the Discrimination Law Review with the issue can be looked at across various discrimination strands, not in relation to one equality strand alone&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>We agree and that is why we seek to remove the tort from the Bill so that it can be considered by the review instead of being a flawed part of the law of the land.
</p>

<a name="51109-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>To meet the criticism that the Home Office has inconsistently excluded religious, unlike racial, harassment from the provision of goods, facilities and services to the public while keeping it for housing, education and public services, the Home Office has come up with an entirely new and misguided argument. It says that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;significant power is exerted in a relationship, as it is in public functions, or employment or education or in the relationship between landlord and tenant&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_651"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 651</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51109-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>That is a novel argument that I have never heard before in an attempt to justify not following the Race Relations Act in relation to racial harassment, which applies to goods, services and facilities. The first answer to that argument is that the Race Relations Act draws no such distinction based on significant power&#151;whatever that means&#151;and the Home Office cannot explain why a different approach should apply to religious harassment.
</p>

<a name="51109-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>Surely significant power may be exerted in relationships covered by Clause 46, such as between a bank and its customers, or an airline and its passengers, or a theatre and its audience, or a hotel manager and his guests. It makes no sense to exclude the tort of religious harassment from those and all other Clause 46 functions but to include the tort of religious harassment in the relationship between a landlord and his tenants, or a teacher and her pupils, or in sensitive public services such as healthcare. If legitimate concern about the harmful effects of this vague tort persuaded the Home Office to exclude it from goods, facilities and services until the review is concluded and a new Bill is introduced, surely the same should apply across the board.
</p>

<a name="51109-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a> The Government also suggest that there is &quot;a less obvious imbalance&quot; in relation to the provision of goods, facilities and services to the public but &quot;significant power&quot; may be exerted in all these relationships. If it is right to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;consider more deeply the position in relation to relations between individuals and service providers&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>as the Government say, then surely it is right to consider more deeply those matters in all contexts.
</p>

<a name="51109-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>In amendment No. 13, the Home Office now proposes to include an exception for the innocent,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;display of any material or article&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>Clause 45 covers anything done that has the purpose or effect of violating a person&#039;s dignity or creating an offensive environment. The Home Office letter obstinately refuses to delete the effect leaving only &quot;purpose&quot; as proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. The Home Office believes that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;to require proof of an intention to harass in the circumstances in which Clause 47 applies would be to go too far&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>However, the newly fangled Home Office amendment states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;Action taken in connection with the display of any material or article is harassment for the purposes of subsection (1) only if taken for the purpose of producing a result specified in subsection (1)(a) or (b)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>So the Home Office now recognises the need to prove intent rather than the effects of action taken in connection with the display of any material or object, but not for example if a landlord plays religious music at Christmas in the entrance hall of his flats in an attempt to persuade his tenants to join the church and save their souls.
</p>

<a name="51109-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>Even as amended, the religious harassment provisions would still catch proselytising by way of religious displays and materials such as posters, Bibles, crucifixes and so on because they involve deliberate <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_652"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 652</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

attempts to persuade people of a different faith or no faith to join the church and they may be interpreted as harming human dignity&#151;whatever that means&#151;or creating an offensive environment. The display of a &quot;Jews for Jesus&quot; poster to persuade me to see the light would violate the dignity of observant Jews and create an offensive environment with the necessary mental element to constitute the tort. That is why the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, is not good enough. It would be a deliberate act causing offence to many Jews. Yet why should it be forbidden by law? It was because of concern for free speech that the Home Office did not apply religious harassment to booksellers. But the same considerations apply to what remains of religious harassment in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51109-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The Government are trying at the eleventh hour to mitigate the harmful effects of the tort which suffers from the twin vices of vagueness and over-breadth. But their amendments will not remove the flaws from these flawed provisions.
</p>

<a name="51109-12_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>I will give a few examples before I conclude. Suppose the Christian evangelical owner of a block of flats illuminates his property with Christmas lights around a model depicting Jesus in the crib in the manger, and he does so intentionally to spread the good news of the birth of Christ to his tenants so that they may abandon their Jewish or Muslim faith&#151;or no faith at all. Or suppose that a secular Muslim property owner wishes to display in the entrance hall a copy of the artistic work that unfortunately had to be removed under pressure from Tate Modern showing the Koran in a broken condition and in need of repair. Suppose she does so with the intention of persuading fundamentalist Muslims to modernise their religious practices and utterances, like the editor of the women&#039;s magazine in Afghanistan who was recently given two years&#039; imprisonment for challenging a belief that Muslims who convert to other religions should be stoned to death.
<a name="time_10"></a>
<a name="51109-12_time0"></a><h5>5 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="51109-12_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>Such action in those two examples would constitute deliberate religious harassment and could give rise to legal proceedings for damages or a declaration or an injunction. That would seriously threaten free speech&#151;the very reason which prompted the Home Office to exclude religious harassment from the provision of goods, services and facilities. The exemption for religious objects would be no defence.
</p>

<a name="51109-12_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Given the undefined nature of what constitutes &quot;religion or belief&quot;, of &quot;violating human dignity&quot;, or of &quot;an offensive environment&quot; in Clause 47(1), and the absence of any filter between claimant and defendant in proceedings brought under Clause 67, the inclusion of this tort would, we believe, encourage divisions within the community and litigation that was against the public interest.

<a name="51109-13_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   My Lords, I rise to speak to Amendments Nos. 12, 13, 14 and subsequent ones. My noble friend&#039;s Amendment No. 12 would of course provide a safeguard, but it does not go far enough. Narrowing down Clause 45 to actions that have the purpose of causing harassment does not eliminate the risk of catching all kinds of perfectly sensible behaviour.
</p>

<a name="51109-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>What if a religious charity knew that some people thought that saying grace at meals was harassment? If it continued to say grace anyway a court could infer a harassment purpose on the basis of its prior knowledge of other people&#039;s sensitivities. No, these harassment provisions are just too risky whichever way you slice them. I acknowledge my noble friend&#039;s concern about this issue&#151;she is a deeply committed person. We have had discussions on the matter. But in these circumstances I prefer the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, to delete harassment completely from the Bill. I have put my name to that amendment.
</p>

<a name="51109-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>Turning to government Amendment No. 13, I am reluctant to appear ungrateful when the Government have clearly moved some way towards us on this issue. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, has applied her considerable brain to this matter and has sought to offer something which meets the problem. I appreciate that but I am sad to say that this amendment is simply not enough.
</p>

<a name="51109-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>Since Second Reading I have constantly raised concerns about how the religious harassment provisions could be used to attack our religious heritage and undermine liberty. Amendment No. 13 proves that my concerns were well founded. It now appears to be accepted that without this amendment a hospital could be sued for harassment over the placing of Bibles, a local council that holds a public meeting in a church could be sued over the presence of a cross on the wall, and, indeed, a Salvation Army hospice could be sued over a banner on a wall containing a biblical text.
</p>

<a name="51109-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>My concerns about harassment have grown as the weeks have gone by. We live in a crazy world where some individuals are litigious. We live in a country where officialdom increasingly appears to be in thrall to political correctness. That is already having a damaging effect on our heritage. Last week we had front-page newspaper headlines about officials at Lambeth council trying to ban Christmas lights; Inland Revenue officials banning support for a Christian charity that sends Christmas presents to needy children; and museum staff deleting references to Christ from exhibits. We need to be sure that the Bill does nothing to encourage this kind of lunacy. Although the government amendment addresses religious objects, I am worried that it does nothing for free speech, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said.

<a name="51109-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>On Report I tabled an amendment on behalf of the Church of England, which addressed not only religious objects but also manifestations of religion. It was intended to protect the saying of grace at meals and conversations about religion. The government amendment, to be fair, copies my amendment in some ways&#151;and I am flattered&#151;but it deletes references to manifestations of religion.


</p>

<a name="51109-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>I understand that officials felt that this area was too difficult to address, but we cannot just leave the matter to the tender mercy of hostile litigants because it is too difficult for officials to address. We cannot ignore the plight of the Christian hospice that could be sued for saying grace, or the prison chaplain who is told he cannot initiate conversations about God with inmates, or the Inland Revenue employee who is banned from wishing his clients a merry Christmas.
</p>

<a name="51109-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>I think that the whole issue of harassment is absolutely fraught and that we would be better off without it. That is why I cannot support the government amendment and instead support Amendment No. 14 and all the subsequent amendments in this grouping, to which I have added my name. I do so because I fear religious harassment could be as damaging to religious freedom and community cohesion as the religious hatred provisions that the Government want to introduce in another Bill.
</p>

<a name="51109-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Lester, perhaps I may briefly give the House some theoretical examples of the kind of mischief that could result from Clause 45. Let us imagine that a Home Office official gives a talk on community relations. Perhaps he talks about the risks posed by certain religious cults. If one of those present is a member of such a cult, an action could be launched claiming that the official created a hostile environment. What about a GP&#039;s waiting room where there are posters on the wall&#151;and I have seen these&#151;from a Government agency advertising a telephone helpline for members of ethnic minorities who are being coerced into forced marriages. If a woman comes in who believes, as a matter of faith, in arranged marriages, could she lodge a claim that the poster created a hostile environment?
</p>

<a name="51109-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>What about the case of a pagan who outwardly says he is a pagan and is in gaol for a paedophile offence? The chaplain criticises the occult and warns prisoners to have nothing to do with it. The pagan could claim harassment; he could seek an injunction. Does this case sound ridiculous? These are the facts of a real case, brought in Australia under religious vilification legislation. It did not succeed under Australian law, but it illustrates the kind of case that could be brought.
</p>

<a name="51109-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>We are not legislating in a vacuum. We are legislating in a climate where there are already some who view the equality agenda as a pretext for attacks on faith. I quote from last Sunday&#039;s <i>Observer</i>:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;A local authority is to pull the plug on its funding for festive lights because Christmas does not fit in with its &#039;core values of equality and diversity&#039;. Waveney District Council, based in Lowestoft, Suffolk, said that because Christmas focuses on the Christian faith, it had decided its &#039;equality and diversity&#039; commitments were not being met&quot;.</p>

<a name="51109-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>Sadly, even the Home Office itself is making headlines on this issue. In one of yesterday&#039;s papers it was revealed that Home Office officials are threatening to withdraw funding from a memorial carol service for the victims of crime because it is too Christian. It suggested holding the service at a secular venue. This is precisely the kind of over-sensitivity that this harassment provision will foster. Removal of the provision would remove a considerable source of uncertainty and, indeed, anxiety from the Bill. I do hope for great support for Amendment No. 14 in the Division Lobby.
</p>




<p><a name="st_120"></a>
<a name="51109-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Waddington: </b>   My Lords, two amendments in this group are directed towards mitigating the worst effects of Clause 45. I refer to Amendment No. 12, to which my noble friend spoke at the beginning of this debate, and government Amendment No. 13. So long as Clause 45 stands, it will remain all too easy for public authorities to ban religious activity on the pretext that such activity could be found to have the purpose of violating somebody&#039;s dignity or creating an offensive environment for him. So I support the amendment, which the noble Lord, Lord Lester, is going to move, to delete Clause 45 and I am afraid that I cannot support my noble friend on Amendment No. 12 is concerned.
</p>

<a name="51109-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>I want to make a general point. Of course, one should be sensitive to other people&#039;s feelings, but I think society has some reason to be worried about the gross and disproportionate way some people react to real and imagined slights and take offence at views expressed by others. It would be a great pity if by changes in the law we were to give encouragement to the over-sensitive to rush to the courts to correct real and imagined grievances. But the real worry, as many noble Lords have said in previous debates, is not that people will rush to the courts to bring actions for religious harassment; it is that public authorities will play safe and restrict the right of Christians to practise and demonstrate their faith for fear of finding themselves on the wrong side of the law.
</p>

<a name="51109-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>To that end, they may put a stop to any manifestation of the Christian faith in public buildings by, for instance, cutting funding to Christian welfare charities because they say grace before meals. One has to look only at the circumstances referred to by my noble friends&#151;the reluctance of certain authorities to celebrate Christmas and all the nonsense of the Home Office apparently threatening to withdraw funding for an annual memorial service at St Martin&#039;s in the Fields for the victims of crime&#151;to realise that the fears expressed by Christian bodies are not fanciful. They are real.
</p>

<a name="51109-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>We are being dangerously complacent if we imagine that if Clause 45 stands we will not find public authorities banning Bibles from hospitals, crosses from cemeteries and crematoria, and chaplains from prisons. Amendment No. 13 does something to protect the display of crosses and Bibles. No government amendment does anything to protect religious debate&#151;in short, to protect free speech.

<a name="51109-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>I fear that under existing law the pendulum has swung dangerously far against free speech. I do not believe that when the Public Order Act was passed in 1986&#151;I was in government at the time&#151;anyone thought that that Act would be used to punish a minister of religion for preaching against the commission of homosexual acts. Yet that happened in Bournemouth a couple of years ago. The minister preaching against homosexual acts was assaulted by a group of young men&#151;claiming no doubt that their dignity had been violated&#151;but they were not even cautioned. It was the minister of religion who was punished.
</p>

<a name="51109-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>Personally, I think that that prosecution was outrageous, but that is not my point. My point is that there are already plenty of weapons in the hands of those who wish to suppress free speech and already too many opportunities for those who want to see the free expression of religious views curtailed. I do not want to add to their armament. Most people can see the sense of legislation to prevent discrimination&#151;almost everyone does. Legislation to stop people being offended is a very different kettle of fish.

<a name="51109-14_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   My Lords, I have put my name to this group of amendments mainly because, during the passage of this Bill, I have spoken from time to time about harassment. It is repugnant to most people that anyone should be authorised in any way to harass anyone else. But I come to this issue from a different angle from that voiced by noble Lords on the other side of the Chamber. I come at it from the standpoint of someone who is secular and a member of the Humanist Association. I do so because, while I support wholeheartedly the right of religious people to practise their religion and to proselytise, I do not believe that they have a right to enforce their beliefs on people who do not share them. Neither do they have a right to impose their way of life on people who do not share their beliefs.
</p>

<a name="51109-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>As the Bill stands, in certain aspects, it could have that effect. Certainly, the Humanist Association thinks that it could, and it is particularly concerned about the effect of Clause 50(3). It says that it understands that the subsection is intended to protect the religious character of faith schools from complaints by parents of other religions or of none. Nevertheless, the wording will exempt not only legitimate religious activities of faith schools but the type of conduct by teachers towards pupils that could involve mocking or condemning their conscientious beliefs because such pupils do not share the school&#039;s beliefs. The association believes that the rights of the school must be balanced against the rights of the child.

</p>

<a name="51109-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>The concept is uncertain in its scope. One of the anxieties is that it may enable people, both of faith and of none, to take advantage of the provisions to make inappropriate claims of harassment. The provision is so widely drawn. It refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>and &quot;violating&quot; someone&#039;s &quot;dignity&quot;. That is broad and uncertain and the parameters are far from clear.
</p>

<a name="51109-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>We have considerable sympathy with the analysis of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and we are concerned that such a provision, wide and uncertain as it is, could be used to strike at religious organisations and their practices from outside the faith communities. They could also be used to encourage differences between them.
</p>

<a name="51109-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>While it is true that someone&#039;s perception that he is the subject of harassment is not enough to found a successful claim, there is always the test of reasonableness. None the less, the potential for claims to be made against religious organisations remains. The encouragement of litigation in that way cannot be in the public interest. While we strongly support the idea that no one should ever be harassed on grounds of religion or belief, which I tried to say clearly in Committee, we still find this part of the Bill unsatisfactory, and we are worried that it could do more harm than good.
</p>

<a name="51109-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>I find myself in something of a dilemma. If the harassment provisions remain in the Bill, we wish them to take a form that gives as little scope as possible for bringing claims of harassment in relation to expressions of religious belief. We believe that the government amendment helps and provides some assistance, and we welcome it to that extent. If Amendment No. 14 is passed tonight and if Clause 45 is then reinstated in another place, we would want the government amendment to be along the same lines, and extended if possible, in the final form of the Bill.

Legislating for every eventuality and nicety means that every time a criterion is put down, we are inviting people to agree or disagree, and then to litigate, or we frighten people from doing what they have always done in case somebody might litigate against them.

for what they have done, but that the local authorities would take action. Reference has been made to Christmas lights being banned and called winter lights and to Christmas cards that say &quot;Season&#039;s Greetings&quot; instead of &quot;Happy Christmas&quot; for fear of prosecution.
</p>

<a name="51109-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>People ought not to be frightened of doing something in case Big Brother gets at them. I can give noble Lords my thoughts on this matter only in a general sphere. Let us assume that your Lordships consider the general principle of the Bill, that Ministers give worthy assurances that things will be all right and that the Bill goes through. But once the Bill becomes law and officials look at what the law says, they will forget what Ministers have said and think, &quot;Goodness, we&#039;ve got to take this action because if we don&#039;t, somebody will say that we are not doing what we should have done according to the law&quot;.
</p>

<a name="51109-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>Perhaps I may give noble Lords one example which occurred to me only this past week. I received a letter from a local authority. The letterhead included the kind of thing that we are used to seeing nowadays; for example, the Metropolitan Police always has some whacky saying at the bottom of its letters such as &quot;Serving London&quot; or &quot;Creating a safer London&quot;. It is completely unnecessary, but that is what it does. The letter in question had come from Norfolk County Council and I think the words in this case were &quot;Serving the Community&quot;; in other words, doing all the things that government and people want and being non-frightening, understanding and conciliatory. But the top right-hand corner of the letter said: &quot;Farm Enforcement Team&quot;. That has all the flavour of the jackboot. There is not much community service there. It is dictatorial and it is frightening.
</p>

<a name="51109-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>That is what happens. If you go ahead putting lovely ideas into Bills, and trying to dot every &quot;i&quot; and cross every &quot;t&quot;, you will make enforcement a matter of considerable concern. My fear in general is that by trying to cater for every eventuality, we are storing up trouble for the future.

<a name="51109-14_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, like the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, I am a secularist and I see great dangers in this clause. For example, somebody might call me a heretic or an infidel, and I might very well take grave exception to that. It is very dangerous to be called a heretic or an infidel because, as a heretic, you can burn and, as an infidel, you can be stoned to death. One could therefore very easily take exception to being called a heretic or an infidel. One does not have to be of religious faith to be offended. As other noble Lords have pointed out, we are reaching an absurd situation where Christians are being penalised because they want to celebrate a Christian festival and those festivals are being put aside because of some perception that other people of a different faith might be offended.


</p>

<a name="51109-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>That is completely absurd. I will give one more example, which is that is of a fire officer going to a fire station and insisting that the cross of St George should be removed in case that offended Muslims. We really are reaching an absurd situation, and it seems to me <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_659"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 659</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that this clause, in particular the phrase &quot;or effect&quot;, will exacerbate the position rather than provide proper equality between people and religions.
</p>

<a name="51109-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>Another thing about it which worries me is that the people who are often alleged to be offended&#151;it generally happens that it is people of the Muslim faith&#151;are not offended. I am afraid that it is often white, so-called liberals who impose these restrictions, not the Muslims who might be affected. But the effect of that, when it comes through in the newspapers, is that it is the Muslims who are objecting&#151;and not that is their white, Christian compatriots who are doing this. That, in turn, leads to racial difficulties between people, and, indeed, to racial hatred. It is exactly what the Bill is supposed to eradicate.
</p>

<a name="51109-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>I really want to support both amendments, but the better one is probably that moved by the noble Lord, Lord Lester. The matter really needs to be looked at very seriously and the noble Lord, along with other Members of your Lordships&#039; House, has obviously given it considerable attention. We should be grateful to him for that. I hope that if the Minister takes no notice of what I say&#151;and she never does&#151;that she will, at least, take notice of the distinguished contributions made this afternoon, in particular by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, but by other noble Lords and Baronesses as well.

<a name="51109-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </b>   My Lords, this is my first intervention in the debate. I have been interested to consider the circumstances in which the Government&#039;s proposed new offence might be helpful. Starting from scratch, I am bound to say that I do not think it would be helpful in the kind of situation where it seems that this allegation might be most commonly made. That is where there are two communities living side by side, holding different religious views, and where the expression of their normal belief might be regarded as provocative to the other community.
</p>

<a name="51109-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>I have thought back to the case of my late father, who was indeed a religious man. He ended up by being Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, which was I suppose some recognition of that. He lived in a terraced house in Glasgow, which happened to be next door to a representative of Toc H&#151;an organisation which I have not heard of recently&#151;who was a descendant of Tubby Clayton&#039;s exercises. I remember distinctly when that organisation next door was wont to sing hymns loudly on several nights of the week. Whatever one may have thought of those hymns they became, in the mind of my father, something of a nuisance. It was a residential street, and when someone was just about to entertain some guests they would hear:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;Yield not to temptation for yielding is sin&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>That might have been regarded as mildly irritating or even possibly provocative when it was repeated. So my father, having consulted a number of other neighbours who felt exactly the same way as he did&#151;that this was a tiresome intrusion and almost too offensive&#151;decided to retaliate. He played on his large gramophone a record of Mae West singing, as the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 660</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Toc H followers arrived, &quot;I wanna be evil&quot;. There was a suit for an accommodation. If either my father or the representative of Toc H had been dragged up on a charge of harassment, it would have been a preposterous state of affairs, and I do not believe that what the Government have in mind will alleviate situations of that kind.

<a name="51109-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </b>   My Lords, I thoroughly agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said. It is interesting that Clause 52 of the Bill says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;It is unlawful for a public authority exercising a function to do any act which constitutes discrimination or harassment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>Then there are one or two exceptions, one of which, in subsection (4)(d), is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;the making of an instrument by a Minister of the Crown under an enactment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>It seems very odd, if the Government are content with the definitions of discrimination or harassment as being in respect of conduct which is undesirable, that it should be perfectly all right for a Minister of the Crown acting under an enactment to do just that. That seems a contradictory stance.
</p>

<a name="51109-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>Needless to say, that is not my main difficulty&#151;my main difficulty is the extreme vagueness of the provision. The Bill talks about &quot;violating&quot; a person&#039;s &quot;dignity&quot;. What does that mean? I find it very difficult to see precise boundaries for that&#151;but that is just one example. The whole clause is of that character, and as far as I am concerned the only thing to do is to omit the clause and leave it to be reviewed by the commission, which is engaged in a comparable activity.
</p>




<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="51109-15_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, for all the reasons that have been given, I would like the clause to be removed from the Bill, but I should like to raise a procedural matter. I understand from the Clerks that there is no reason at all why the House should not alter the clause with Amendment No. 12 and then leave it out; or accept the Government&#039;s amendment, which certainly ameliorates the clause, and then leave the clause out if the House so wishes. This is very important, and I hope that the Minister can confirm that that is correct on the procedural point. Should the House fail to remove the clause, it would be very good to ameliorate it. I hope that there is no misunderstanding about that, and that I am right in what I am saying, as I did ask and thought I understood the answer. Perhaps we could have it confirmed by the Minister.

<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="51109-15_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lyell of Markyate: </b>   My Lords, I am a latecomer to this Bill, because it had its Second Reading before I was introduced. However, when you come to analyse it, you find that it makes a deep-seated attack on freedom of speech and on freedom of religion. We fought over the centuries for freedom of religion. We did not have it in the 17th century; it was not until the 1820s that we got Catholic emancipation and it was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_661"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 661</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

not until well into the 19th century that we got religious freedom. Now we are making a move through this Bill&#151;not deliberately, but this will be the effect&#151;of actually restricting religious freedom very tightly and in very remarkable ways.

</p>

<a name="51109-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>Under this Bill, John Wesley would have been prevented from preaching in most open-air areas. Biggleswade marketplace or the Marlowes in Hemel Hempstead are places where people go and speak and express their opinions, and are owned by the public authorities. There is a serious danger that people might be restricted in what they are seeking to do. People set out their stalls for different religions&#151;principally Christian religions, but they might well be Muslim religions. As many noble Lords have said, not only the possibility of prosecution is at issue; it is the much wider risk of what public officials will believe that it is their duty to do to restrict free speech and free activity.
</p>

<a name="51109-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>I praise my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon because she has made the most constructive effort to improve this Bill by removing the words &quot;or effect&quot;. There is no doubt that removing those words would represent a significant advance, because at least that would bring the Bill closer to requiring deliberate intent. But having listened to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and others, including my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay, one has to wonder whether removing those words would go far enough, because purpose is not quite of the same nature as intent. After all, it is an essential of freedom of religion that you preach your religion with the purpose of saving the soul of another person. You must be entitled to do that in a free society, whether you are a Muslim, a Christian, a Sikh or a Jew, or of any other religion&#151;or, indeed, a humanist or secularist&#151;because you profoundly believe that to be the truth and that you will improve the world and the lot of your fellow men and women if you do that.
</p>

<a name="51109-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I shall say just one word about the sheer importance of freedom of speech. One cannot believe that the Government have lost sight of it. On &quot;Thought for the Day&quot; there is a regular Muslim speaker, and there is Indarjit Singh of the <i>Sikh Messenger</i>&#151;and there you find enormous wisdom expressed. We have reached a very dangerous situation, in which we have what my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay rightly referred to as something like &quot;distorted religions&quot; or mistaken ideas of religions&#151;probably referring to the Muslim religion. Let us suppose that there is a publicly owned block of flats in north London and that some of the Muslims who speak there wish to hold a meeting in which they wish to say, &quot;We must uphold our faith but we must be careful of distortion&quot;. Will they be allowed to hold that, when they will be criticising fellow Muslims of a different type of that faith, just as we Christians sometimes criticise each other for different approaches to our own faith? They may be doing it in ways that would transgress this Bill.

If that is his view, I must tell him that I very much regret it.

However, it is true that I rarely have the joy of agreeing with him&#151;but there was one occasion that stands for ever in my mind, when the two of us were at one, and I shall never forget it.
</p>

<a name="51109-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>We are faced with a very interesting position. I first thank the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, because she makes it plain that she supports the purpose behind Clause 45 but has trouble with two words&#151;&quot;or effect&quot;. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, says this is unripe time&#151;that the debate we need to have should more accurately and properly be carried out in the much-anticipated discrimination law review. The noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, says that this part of the Bill should not be there at all. So there are three different stances, and other noble Lords and the right reverend Prelate have made variations on those themes.
</p>

<a name="51109-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a> For the purposes of clarity, I make it plain that what we are dealing with in this part of the Bill is how harassment will impinge on the way public services are provided. That is the context in which we speak. I shall start, although I appreciate it may take a little time, by dealing with the proper concerns raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. I accept her passion about the improprieties of &quot;or effect&quot;, which she maintains should be removed, not just from the provisions that relate to Clause 45, but also from all other parts of legislation where they appear.

<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="51109-16_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   My Lords, I was making the point that if the only way we can delete this is because it is written in stone, we should get it out of stone so we can do what is right with this Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="51109-16_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I understand that. Let us look at why the provision is there. It does have, if I may respectfully say so, a purpose. The amendment would remove it. As I have made plain before, those words are used in other key pieces of discrimination legislation. It is there in the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Employment <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_663"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 663</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003 without causing problems in those areas. It is a principle of discrimination law that you need to show that the actions of a person were intended to discriminate or harass. That is clear.
</p>

<a name="51109-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>For example, if the police were to adopt a policy that led to discrimination or harassment of Asians, it would not matter that they did not intend that to be the result. What is important is that their actions have in fact led to discrimination or harassment. The Government think the situation should be the same in the case of discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief. It should not be acceptable, for example, if the Prison Service were to adopt a policy that created an offensive environment for Muslims, that it could simply claim that that was not its intention.
</p>

<a name="51109-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>It is also important to bear in mind that one has to look at not only Clause 45(1), but also Clause 45(3). That makes it clear that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;Action by A shall be regarded as having the effect described in subsection (1)(a) or (b) only&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>I emphasise &quot;only&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;if it should reasonably be regarded as having that effect having regard to&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_5"></a><br>
(a)   B&#039;s perception, and

<br>
(b)   all the other circumstances&quot;.</p>



<p><a name="st_134"></a>So when we consider the concern that has been expressed about a capricious or irrational situation, I respectfully suggest that Clause 45(3) deals with that concern.
</p>

<a name="51109-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>We have brought forward our own amendment to the harassment clause, which we will debate further in a moment. We believe this goes a long way towards addressing the concerns the noble Baroness had&#151;as did others, such as the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain&#151;about accidental harassment or something that was not intended. The amendment centres on religious material or articles, but does not include religious practices. This is because religious practice is a very wide concept, and to say that a religious practice could never constitute harassment unless that was the intended effect is too much.
</p>

<a name="51109-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>In most cases, if a person receiving a public service felt harassed by religious activity, the solution would lie in simple practical measures, like making it possible to opt out of that practice in some way by doing something different so they do not feel so negatively about it. That is what the normal remedy would be, and what we believe would actually happen in most circumstances when dealing with people providing a public service. However, we recognised that it may not be so easy to adapt a physical environment, particularly where there are many different uses, perhaps including worship. It should be possible to adapt religious behaviour, though&#151;even religious practice&#151;in the context of the delivery of a public function. There has been a lot of debate in the House this afternoon that does not go to the public function <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_664"></a>

but to the general expression of what people feel, but we have to concentrate on the fact that we are dealing with the exercise of public function.

<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="51109-16_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, and I am grateful to her for allowing me to do so. She keeps referring to public function, but, as she knows, this refers not only to public function but to housing and private education.
</p>




<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="51109-16_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, it refers to housing. Noble Lords will know that the whole issue of what public functions are and what other issues are involved was dealt with when we talked about them earlier. It seemed to me that part of the discussion was not in terms of exercising a public function or providing accommodation, or those other matters. It was put in a very general way. It is important that we concentrate on what we are talking about in this part of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51109-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>While I am on harassment and the nature of this part, there is a difficulty regarding what has been said about what defines and does not define a religion. I hope I will be able to say a little more about that in a short while.
</p>

<a name="51109-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>Who could say that it is right to harass on the grounds of someone&#039;s religion or belief in areas such as the provision of services by prison officers to those imprisoned, or immigration officers, or other dischargers of public functions? To say we will not act against such behaviour now in a Bill that&#151;with considerable Cross-Bench support&#151;tackles discrimination on grounds of religion or belief would send the wrong message about what is and is not acceptable, particularly to those communities that are most likely to suffer from this form of discrimination.
</p>

<a name="51109-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester, suggested on Report that the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 provides sufficient cover in respect of harassment so that a separate provision in discrimination law is not necessary. I make it plain that we do not agree. The 1997 Act essentially covers behaviour that causes alarm and distress, that is unacceptable between any two individuals in our society, and that may be thought to be the precursor of violence. The use of the Act may have broadened from stalkers, its initial target, but does not cover the same range of behaviour as discrimination law. I understand what the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, has to say about the fact that it was never intended so to do, but it has developed, although it has not quite developed this far.
</p>

<a name="51109-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>In Part 2 we are concerned to protect individuals due to the specific relationship between them and a harasser because the harasser is providing a public service or other service that they need, or is involved in providing them with education or vocational training, or is their landlord, or is providing a roof over their head. We think it right to consider more deeply the position between individuals and service providers in the area of goods, services and facilities where there is a less obvious imbalance, and where the recipient or the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_665"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 665</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

customer frequently has more choice in how they are obtained. It is for that reason that we have put those matters into the discrimination review.


</p>

<a name="51109-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>We recognise that concerns remain around this issue&#151;this debate itself demonstrates that&#151;and that there are particular concerns to ensure that faith groups providing public functions do not by accident find themselves subject to a claim. We have said that we are willing to discuss the details of exemptions in all the areas affected. We have laid a further amendment to that end today, which I have already discussed. We will continue to consider these issues as these proposals are further discussed and implemented. But to remove the prohibition on harassment altogether from the Bill now would in our view fail those who may currently be suffering injustice in these areas.
</p>

<a name="51109-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>If it passes into law, we will have no power other than by use of primary legislation to change the definition of harassment in this Bill but it is right that it should be reviewed across the piece in the Discrimination Law Review rather than introducing a separate definition for this one strand at this point. In addition, we have a power to create new exceptions in the area of public functions or to vary the exemptions elsewhere in Part 2, if we do find that these provisions cause us unexpected problems. If some of the fears that have been expressed in this House prove to be correct, we have a vehicle with which to address them.
</p>

<a name="51109-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>I turn to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lester. I understand what he says about it. He asserts that we have misunderstood the definition of religion. I hope to clarify our definition. The noble Lord quite rightly referred to the House of Lords&#039; decision in <i>Mandla </i>v<i> Dowell Lee. </i>In that judgment Lord Fraser said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;For a group to constitute an ethnic group in the sense of the 1976 Act, it must, in my opinion, regard itself, and be regarded by others, as a distinct community by virtue of certain characteristics . . . The conditions which appear to me to be essential are these: (1) a long shared history, of which the group is conscious as distinguishing it from other groups, and the memory of which it keeps alive (2) a cultural tradition of its own, including family and social customs and manners, often but not necessarily associated with religious observance. In addition to those two essential characteristics the following characteristics are, in my opinion, relevant: (3) either a common geographical origin, or descent from a small number of common ancestors (4) a common language, not necessarily peculiar to the group (5) a common literature peculiar to the group (6) a common religion different from that of neighbouring groups or from the general community surrounding it . . . A group defined by reference to enough of these characteristics would be capable of including converts, for example, persons who marry into the group, and of excluding apostates. Provided a person who joins the group feels himself or herself to be a member of it&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>That is why, using that definition, the Government believe it is right that an ethnic group is not defined by its religion but that it can in part be so defined. We believe that definition is helpful.

<a name="51109-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her lecture on <i>Mandla</i>. However, she needs to read the judgments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, and the others to which I referred which deal with the point that was not dealt with in <i>Mandla</i>; that is,<i> </i>whether Jews are covered <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_666"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 666</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

under the Race Relations Act on the basis of ethnicity or religion. The law clearly states that they are covered on the basis of ethnicity. It was that point I was trying to deal with. The <i>Mandla </i>case does not deal with that as such at all.
</p>




<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="51109-17_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, as the noble Lord will know, we are dealing not simply with the Jewish community but also with the Sikh community. <i>Mandla </i>dealt directly with the Sikh community and its definition. That definition sought to distinguish the kind of issues which can identify people as a group. That by no means undermines the fact that those two groups have a different history but it clearly uses the definition I mentioned, which we consider is a helpful definition.
</p>

<a name="51109-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>I understand absolutely that the noble Lord would prefer this whole issue to be included in the discrimination review. However, we cannot accept that. If that were to be done, there would be no provision which referred to harassment in relation to this category, which is dealt with quite properly under Clause 45. It is simply not a satisfactory solution to say that these provisions can work. As regards the whole issue of discrimination law, the Discrimination Law Review may well come up with a construct that is significantly different from that which we currently have in relation to a number of species of discrimination. The law that we have in each of these areas may change, and change significantly, once that review is complete. However, we have to deal with the situation until the conclusions of that review are issued. We seek to give appropriate protection to all those who may be significantly disadvantaged and discriminated against in relation to the way in which public services are given to them, and in relation to education and accommodation. All of those things are fundamental to the way in which people lead their lives. I respectfully suggest that it would be unjust not to deal with this wrong in a similar way to all the others.
</p>

<a name="51109-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>I say with all the gentleness which I can muster that if one looks at the provisions which were mooted on behalf of those who are discriminated against on the ground of sexual orientation, and one compares those provisions with all the other provisions in this area, one sees that they are almost identical, and not significantly different from that which we wish to implement in relation to religious belief. The difference is that we have not extended the provision to goods and services for the reasons that we have given. Therefore, I invite noble Lords to think very seriously indeed before expunging&#151;because that is what it would amount to&#151;from the Bill an opportunity to prevent people being seriously disadvantaged and to give them better protection. I understand what the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said in relation to those two words. However, I reassure her that those will be exactly the issues in relation to all the species of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_667"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 667</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

discrimination that the Discrimination Law Review will consider. We will not have to wait very long for that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="51109-17_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, before the noble Baroness sits down, is it possible for her to answer my point about procedure?
</p>




<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="51109-17_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, as I understand it, the amendments will be dealt with in order. I believe that the vote would be taken first on the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. If that amendment were carried, I believe that the vote on the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, could still take place, but votes could not be taken on the other amendments as they would all fall away. That is my understanding. I am sure that someone will correct me if I have misunderstood the procedure.
</p>




<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="51109-17_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, could the vote on the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, take place if Amendment No. 12 were passed?
</p>




<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="51109-17_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, that is right and I can see various people around the House nodding in agreement. However, the other amendments would fall away, because that part would no longer be there.
</p>




<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="51109-17_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   My Lords, I listened very carefully to the Minister with real regret&#151;not just mild regret, but real, passionate regret&#151;because I feel that the Government are making a great mistake. Having said that, I would like to thank my noble friend Lady Carnegy and my noble and learned friend Lord Lyell for the support that they gave to my amendment. But the hour is late and, despite the fact that I said I would definitely divide the House, the truth is that the Government are against me, the Liberals will not vote on my amendment at all, and if I delay the House even longer, I understand from the noble Lord, Lord Lester, that he would have great difficulty in keeping his troops for the next amendment.
</p>

<a name="51109-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>I make those points because I feel very strongly about this issue. On the other hand, with those two words left there, I cannot possibly accept that Clause 45 should stay in the Bill. Under those circumstances I am pleased to agree with what the noble Lord has said to me and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.
</p>

<a name="51109-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_7"></a><br>
   &quot;MONITORING OF EXCEPTION IN RELATION TO IMMIGRATION CASES

<br>
(1)   The Secretary of State shall appoint a person who is not a member of his staff to act as a monitor in relation to immigration cases.


<br>
(2)   The person so appointed shall monitor in such manner as the Secretary of State may determine the operation of the exception in section 52(4)(f).


<br>
(3)   The monitor shall make an annual report on the discharge of his functions to the Secretary of State.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_672"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 672</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(4)   The Secretary of State shall lay a copy of any report made to him under subsection (3) before each House of Parliament.

<br>
(5)   The Secretary of State shall pay to the monitor such fees and allowances (if any) as he may determine.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_158"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 29 refers to Clause 52, which deals with public authorities. The purpose of that clause is to ensure that in exercising their function public authorities do not do any act that constitutes discrimination or harassment. Subsection (4)(f) provides prohibition, but it does not apply to a decision taken in accordance with rules under Section 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971. These grounds are clearly defined, and they apply mainly to refuse entry clearance or leave to enter the United Kingdom on the grounds that the exclusion is conducive to the public good. We agree with that.
</p>

<a name="51109-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>The same applies to a decision to cancel leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. There are further powers, which include a decision to refuse an application to vary leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom on the grounds that it is undesirable for a person to remain in the United Kingdom, or a decision to vary leave to enter or remain in the UK on the same grounds.
</p>

<a name="51109-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>But we have introduced new grounds as well. Clause 52(4)(g) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>&quot;that a person holds an office or position in connection with a religion or belief or provides services in connection with their religion or belief . . . that a religion or belief is not to be treated in the same way as certain other religions or beliefs, or . . . that the exclusion from the United Kingdom of a person to whom paragraph (i) applies is conducive to the public good&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>Those are some of the grounds that have been introduced, and on that basis, we felt that it was appropriate to have a system of monitoring. The amendment in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Lester deals with this matter.
</p>

<a name="51109-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>I will spell out what we propose. In our amendment, we suggest that it is appropriate to have monitoring of exception in relation to the cases that I outlined, particularly on matters that relate to religious exception. We suggest the appointment of a person who is not a member of the Home Office staff to act as a monitor in relation to immigration cases. The purpose behind this amendment is to ensure that there is public confidence in the way that the system operates.
</p>

<a name="51109-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>At Report, I mentioned that we were grateful to the Government for ensuring that the exceptions to immigration rules were limited. We tried to achieve the same aim during the passage of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. Unfortunately, despite our various efforts, we were not successful then. There can be mistrust, particularly in the way that rules apply on the basis of religion and belief. Proper monitoring would remove any suspicion and the independence of the monitor would ensure that the provisions of Clause 52 are properly applied.
</p>

<a name="51109-18_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>Immigration officers have wide powers&#151;in many cases the same powers as police officers. The police are subject to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. We believe that that if we need to safeguard both the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_673"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 673</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

way in which immigration rules are applied and the interests of individuals, the appointment of an independent monitor is important. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_159"></a>
<a name="51109-18_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I regret to say that I have to resist this amendment in the same way that we resisted it on Report. I said we would continue to consider the matter and we have looked into it with some care. On balance, we do not feel that it is right to reproduce the arrangements in the Race Relations Act 1976, to which the noble Lord referred.
</p>

<a name="51109-18_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>The exception that is now provided for immigration at Clause 52 is relatively narrow in comparison with that which is provided in Section 19D of the Race Relations Act 1976. The exception to the Race Relations Act potentially affects a large number of nationalities and a great many people: it may apply wherever there are objective grounds for believing that it is reasonable to subject people of different nationalities to different treatment for the purposes of immigration control. Such treatment must be authorised by a Minister and those authorisations are reported on by the Independent Race Monitor. A dozen or so are in force. In this case, a relatively small number of authorisations may affect a great many individual cases spanning a large number of nationalities.
</p>

<a name="51109-18_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>The situation in the case of the exception provided in Part 2 of this Bill is different. The discretion to discriminate on grounds of public good is likely to be exercised with regard to individuals rather than groups, and is unlikely to be an everyday occurrence. A remedy for failure to exercise this power correctly is available either through appeal&#151;if the conditions for appeal are satisfied&#151;or through judicial review.
</p>

<a name="51109-18_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>To the extent that the exception allows a determination that a particular religion is not to be treated in the same way as other religions&#151;because it encourages children to renounce contact with their families, for example&#151;leading to a refusal to grant recognition for the purpose of admission as a religious worker, then it is in any case not analogous with the power to authorise discrimination in respect of nationality.
</p>

<a name="51109-18_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>I know that the way in which this suggestion was proposed is that it would be a relatively easy thing to do, that it would not take much time and that it would be an add-on, which could be easily accommodated. That view was carefully explored with those primarily responsible for discharging this matter. The view that was taken, for the reasons that I have just given, was that it was neither possible nor appropriate for us to accept the proposal because it would be far too burdensome. For those reasons, and for those that I have already given, I must resist Amendment No. 29.

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 674</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

whether such a decision was taken on a race basis, but we know that race and religion are intertwined in this area. Why would it be impossible or onerous for the race monitor not to be able to give public confidence to Muslims, Pakistani Muslims and ethnic minorities generally, by at the same time monitoring the religious as well as the racial aspects? I cannot understand that. The proposal would not cost much money&#151;the same person could perform both roles and we know that it is hard to disentangle religious and racial grounds. That is what I cannot understand from the Minister&#039;s answer.
</p>




<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="51109-19_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the noble Lord&#039;s agreement that race and religion are difficult to disentangle. That is a contrary argument to the one that was made for the better part of this afternoon&#151;that the two were easy to separate. That being the case, the view that has been taken is that there would have to be a different monitor for this as opposed to the other role and that the measure would be too bureaucratic and too difficult to deliver. I can assure the noble Lord that this matter was energetically pursued to see whether it would be possible to do what the noble Lord would like; especially bearing in mind that the noble Lord thought it would be simple and easy to achieve. For the reasons that I have given, the view was clearly taken that it would not be simple: it would be extremely bureaucratic and difficult and that when one looked at the consequences, it was not appropriate. That is the decision that the Government took. I can assure the noble Lord that the issue was fully explored.

<p><a name="st_166"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I will also speak to Amendments Nos. 36 to 39 in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Marsh. They follow discussions with the British Humanist Association and I declare an interest as vice-president. I also very much appreciate the Minister&#039;s discussing the amendments with me. The essential point is that religious organisations, as defined in Clause 57 (1) and charities as defined in Clause 58 (1) may be carrying out options of a public nature&#151;delivering services on behalf of local or national government or the national health service, for example. When they are thus acting as agents for public authorities, they should not be allowed to discriminate on religious grounds. We need to make it clear that they will not be so allowed.
</p>

<a name="51109-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>Clause 52 (1) states that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;It is unlawful for a public authority exercising a function to do any act which constitutes discrimination or harassment&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>but Clauses 57 and 58 both state that &quot;nothing in this Part&quot; shall be held to restrict religious organisations and charities. The problem is, if a public function is being exercised by a body as defined in Clauses 57 and 58, will they be caught by Clause 52 (1)?
</p>

<a name="51109-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>The question is complicated by the current controversy since the Leonard Cheshire case over precisely what a public authority is. What we need to be assured of is that Clause 52(1) would trump Clauses 57 and 58 in any future case. The amendments would achieve that.


</p>

<a name="51109-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>Finally, consistently with this approach, the words &quot;reasonably justified&quot; should be substituted for &quot;imposed&quot; in Clauses 57, 58 and 59, because &quot;imposed&quot; is far too weak a trigger for exemptions from the new and welcome duties in the Bill. The proper test for licence to ban membership, ban the provision of goods, facilities and services, ban the use of premises, is surely the reasonable justification. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>As I said on Report, the draftsman has given us a good set of words with the wording he provided&#151;which this House then approved&#151;which requires that there must be a causal connection between the purposes of the organisation and the restriction. It does not, however, go so far as to require that the restriction is necessary. This test is well balanced between the strict necessity and expedience, but should be easily understood by the courts. The words proposed by my noble friend in Amendments Nos. 35, 37 and 39 would provide a test which would be less easy to apply. For that reason the wording provided by the draftsman is, in our respectful view, to be preferred.
</p>

<a name="51109-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>Amendments Nos. 36 and 38 seek to prevent organisations and charities relating to religion or belief discriminating when providing a public function. I cannot accept these amendments. There will be occasions when a particular group has a specific need best met within the context of their own religion and when we might positively encourage an organisation to discriminate to ensure that need was met. An example might be a women&#039;s group catering specifically for the needs of Sikh or Muslim women, or a care home for Jewish people that received some public funding. These amendments would place too high a barrier in the way of service providers, who undertake valuable work, and for that reason we cannot accept them.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>I can assure my noble friend that that provision prevails in relation to those acts which are outside the exemption. For instance, although in many instances there will be materially different circumstances which would justify discrimination in public functions, these would be liable for challenge in ways that are provided by the clauses as we have them. To reduce the protection provided by the clauses would risk increasing the chilling effect. If they stepped outside the specific exception that we provided, those issues could be challenged.
</p>

<a name="51109-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>My noble friend was concerned about bullying. What if someone was bullied in a school because they did not adhere to certain views? These provisions would not allow a school inappropriately to bully a child. It would be bound by the same rules against that sort of activity which apply now. It is the specific exemptions, and specific exemptions only, which would enable them to have advantage in that way.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_174"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I said on Report that I was aware of the Equal Opportunity Commission&#039;s concerns about Clause 81. I was grateful to my noble friend Lady Lockwood for raising this question. That clause brings in a prohibition on sex discrimination and harassment in the exercise of public functions, through inserting a new section in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. I take the opportunity to address one of the concerns raised, which can be dealt with appropriately in this Bill. This concerns the compatibility of the exceptions to the new provision in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 with the gender directive, which will need to be implemented by December 2007. These exceptions are set out in a table of exceptions in Clause 81.
</p>

<a name="51109-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>The EOC is concerned that the implementation of the gender directive may require changes to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 soon after the provisions of this Bill are brought into force. We have looked carefully at the points raised and the requirements of the gender directive, and we are sensitive to the need to minimise the disruption arising from changes required by Community law and to the need for clarity in advance.
</p>

<a name="51109-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>While there is in our view no conflict between the public functions provisions of this Bill and the requirements of the gender directive, we are anxious not to create in this Bill provisions that will conflict with the requirements of the gender directive or any other existing or future community law. Consequently, we propose Amendment No. 42 to make it clear that nothing in the table will permit anything which is prohibited by any Community law relating to discrimination. We agree we should make this clear beyond doubt.
</p>

<a name="51109-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>The EOC has other concerns relating to these exceptions but, as I indicated on Report, I believe the broader question of definitions and exemptions in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 needs to be looked at more deeply in the discrimination law review. The review will provide full opportunities for the deep and detailed consideration that is needed. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_175"></a>
<a name="51109-20_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   My Lords, since the noble Baroness, Lady Lockwood, is not a free woman but is sitting on the Woolsack, I hope that she will not mind my speaking in her name and saying that, if she were free, she would say what I am about to say. We are grateful to the Government for having tabled and moved Amendment No. 42. As the Minister said, it ensures that the very broad exception in the table must be read subject to Community law relating to discrimination. It is put very neatly in that way. It means that, for example, the proportionality test in the gender directive will have to apply.
</p>

<a name="51109-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>As the EOC has indicated, there are other, wider structural problems with dovetailing between this Bill and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. However, it would be beyond the scope of this Bill, as the Minister has said, to seek to deal with those sophisticated and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_679"></a>

complicated matters now. They will be dealt with, as I understand it, by the discrimination law review, which is entirely sensible.
</p>

<a name="51109-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>Finally, since this is probably my last opportunity to say this, I want to pay tribute to the Minister, without whom it would have been impossible to make the Bill into what it now is, that is, a Bill of which we should all be proud when we send it to the other place. I know that she has had a difficult time because she has had to deal with so many different departments and issues. It has been an enormous pleasure to me to work with her, and what she has done is quite remarkable.

<a name="51109-21_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy </b>   moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a>Page 17, line 12, after &quot;appointment&quot; insert &quot;and re-appointment&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_184"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in speaking to Amendment No. 1 I shall speak also to Amendment No. 2. These amendments are intended to draw attention to the difference between this Bill and the children&#039;s commissioner Bill, which includes details of the term of appointment and reappointment. In short, such matters were decided in primary legislation in that case.
</p>

<a name="51109-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>The provisions for appointment in the Bill differ from those in the children&#039;s Act in that this Bill reserves details of appointment and possible reappointment to the National Assembly and secondary legislation in the form of regulations. I recognise the arguments for this change of legislative approach: if the Assembly pays for the office of commissioner, as it will, it should make the appointment and settle its terms and conditions; the commissioner is the Assembly&#039;s employee, is responsible to the Assembly; and so on. But there are drawbacks of which we should be aware. As I mentioned in Committee, in a public consultation on this matter, the advisory group to the National Assembly found that 59 per cent of respondents opted for a four-year term of appointment and a similar term for reappointment, and I dare say that further consultation and discussion is likely before the final figure is decided upon.
</p>

<a name="51109-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>The whole process seems rather long drawn out and almost time wasting when the issue could be settled here and now in primary legislation, rather than being prolonged, as appears to be inevitable. Secondly, there is a hint in the Bill of what has become known as &quot;creeping devolution&quot;. Your Lordships should be aware of the nature of that beast, especially in view of the devolution Bill that lies ahead of us later this Session. In the White Paper, <i>Better Governance for Wales,</i> we find a commitment to what is referred to as &quot;framework legislation&quot;. Indeed, the style of appointment of this commissioner for the elderly seems to be typical of that kind of legislation. The change should not pass unnoticed. I do not intend to make a mountain out of a molehill, but I wonder whether the Minister can give us some indication of how long the appointment is to last and whether there will be a set term for reappointment. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="51109-21_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment No. 1 before turning to Amendment No. 2. During the discussion of this <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_681"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 681</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

matter in Committee, I explained that the term &quot;appointment&quot; would also encompass the possibility of reappointment. I can assure noble Lords that the Assembly intends to make provision about this matter in regulations. Moreover, I refer noble Lords to the statement of policy intentions submitted by the Assembly in which it states its intention to specify an initial term of four years, renewable once, in line with the views expressed in the public consultation.
</p>

<a name="51109-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>Amendment No. 2 places in the Bill a requirement that the initial term of office of the commissioner is a period of five years. I acknowledge the instant clarification on this matter that such an amendment would bring. However, in our view, the appropriate term of office for the commissioner is quite properly something for the Assembly to determine. Giving the Assembly its own regulation-making power for the appointment of the commissioner will allow it to cater for any necessary changes to ensure that secondary legislation continues to fit closely the needs of older people in Wales. I hope that with this reassurance the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="51109-21_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his comments on these two amendments. I said at the outset that my prime purpose in tabling the amendments was to draw attention to the differences in the appointment of the commissioner for the elderly and the commissioner for children in Wales. The Minister has given us all the details that we require about the likely term of the appointment and reappointment. Of course, it begs the question of why these details have not been put into the Bill at primary stage and why we have to await secondary legislation before these matters are incorporated. Nevertheless, we have now had an explanation and the Government&#039;s intention is clear. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>




<p><a name="st_188"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we welcome government Amendments Nos. 4 and 5, which arose out of discussion in Grand Committee. The Government have certainly listened and &quot;good&quot; has been replaced by &quot;best&quot;. However, &quot;may&quot; has not been replaced by &quot;shall&quot;. If a commissioner may do something, that means it is at his discretion and he has a let out. If he &quot;shall&quot;, &quot;will&quot; or &quot;must&quot; do something, that is far more positive and it is an affirmation of something that he is obliged to do. Some say that one cannot oblige the commissioner or put a duty on him, but we believe that we can. The appointment is so important and it means so much to many people. If someone &quot;may&quot; do something it means that perhaps or possibly he will do something. An elderly person may think that he or she &quot;may&quot; achieve redress or &quot;may&quot; <br>&nbsp;<br>

have a problem sorted out, but that is not what the Government are saying. They are sticking firmly to the word &quot;may&quot; and will not give us &quot;must&quot; or &quot;shall&quot;. I suggest that the Government should consider this and say, &quot;Yes, we agree that it must be far more positive, far more affirmative and that &#039;shall&#039; or &#039;must&#039; will replace &#039;may&#039;&quot;. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_189"></a>
<a name="51109-21_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Prys-Davies: </b>   My Lords, the problem with a discretionary function is that, in practice, it can mean anything or nothing. If the commissioner decides not to exercise a discretionary function, it seems to me that he cannot be challenged on that. Perhaps the Minister will explain why in Clause 2 the general functions of the commissioner cannot be expressed in terms of duties which he must discharge rather than powers that he may exercise.
</p>




<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="51109-21_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment No. 3 before turning to the two government amendments. Amendment No. 3 seeks to replace the commissioner&#039;s power to undertake his general functions in Clause 2(1) with a duty. That would remove the discretion of the commissioner in relation to the exercise of his powers. That discretion was included in the Bill to ensure that the commissioner would be able to discharge his functions as he or she considers most appropriate and in accordance with his or her priorities.
</p>

<a name="51109-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>The view of the Assembly&#151;I stress the Assembly&#151;shared strongly by the Government, is that it is essential to secure statutory independence for the commissioner so that he should have the freedom to choose when, in what instances, and how he will exercise his functions. I also remind noble Lords that the commissioner will have to operate within a fixed annual budget, negotiated by him with the Assembly, and we do not want to introduce, as this amendment would, any constraints on his freedom to decide how to match his resources with the priorities that he has identified. Moreover, the amendment would also increase the potential for any individual or body to institute judicial review proceedings against the commissioner if there is disagreement with the priorities that the commissioner has set.
</p>

<a name="51109-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>Let me assure the House that the Government and the Assembly expect the commissioner to undertake all these general functions, and to do so in a proactive and vigorous manner to maximum effect. Listing them expressly in this clause makes it clear that there is an expectation that the commissioner will use these powers on an on-going basis in the interests of older people. That expectation is not an idle one. It has sanctions at its back. If there were to be a persistent, significant and perverse failure by the commissioner to exercise his powers in Clause 2, it is the view of the Assembly, shared by the Government, that that would amount to a basis for his removal on grounds of misbehaviour.
</p>

<a name="51109-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>I turn next to government Amendment No. 4. In Grand Committee, noble Lords expressed clearly their wish to see the term &quot;safeguarding&quot; included explicitly within the description of the commissioner&#039;s general <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_683"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 683</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

functions at Clause 2. While the Government still contend that the Bill as drafted already gives the commissioner the power to take specific action to ensure that the interests of older people are safeguarded, we have listened to the views of your Lordships that this should be made explicit. I have therefore tabled government Amendment No. 4, which will achieve that clarity and will further ensure that there is consistency in the terminology used across Clauses 2, 3 and 5.
</p>

<a name="51109-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>Similarly, in Grand Committee the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, proposed an amendment that sought to enable the commissioner to use his general functions to encourage best practice, rather than good practice, in the treatment of older people in Wales. I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, as well as to my noble friend Lord Prys-Davies for the arguments they put forward. In particular, the discussion drew our attention to the fact that some difference in standards might be inferred from the use of &quot;good practice&quot; in Clause 2 and &quot;best practice&quot; in Clause 11.
</p>

<a name="51109-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>In the interests of consistency we have consequently tabled government Amendment No. 5 to ensure that the commissioner encourages &quot;best practice&quot; in the treatment of older people in Wales. I think all of us would recognise that &quot;best practice&quot; is a subjective concept in the context of a general matter, such as the overall treatment of older people in Wales. But we believe that the commissioner is well placed to exercise his judgment about what it constitutes, just as he will when issuing &quot;best practice guidance&quot; under his Clause 11 powers.

</p>

<a name="51109-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>With these amendments, I hope that the noble Lords, Lord Thomas of Gresford and Lord Roberts of Llandudno, will feel able to withdraw their amendment.

<a name="51109-22_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, I welcome government Amendments Nos. 4 and 5, which, as the Minister acknowledged, derive from our discussions in Committee. I am delighted that the Government have been open-minded enough to accept the substance of the changes that we called for and have altered the Bill accordingly. Best practice is certainly better than good practice and is the only acceptable practice. The meaning of &quot;safeguarding&quot; older people&#039;s interests is well understood by us.
</p>

<a name="51109-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>I have great sympathy with the Liberal Democrat Amendment No. 3; the performance of statutory functions should not be optional. As the Bill stands, it is a power rather than a duty and we would like to transform it into a duty. However, I also have sympathy with the Government&#039;s view that the commissioner should have discretion in the exercise of such a broad spectrum of functions as those described in Clause 2(1). He will certainly need to prioritise as regards performing those functions. While I have great sympathy with Amendment No. 3, I fear that I cannot support it more strongly than that.

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>I have always been under the impression that it is up to Ministers to decide what further laws or changes to laws are necessary. The idea that the commissioner should have a hand in the making of new laws is a new concept to me.

I also believe that it is a <i>sine qua non</i> that he should be able to check on the implementation of such laws. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_685"></a>

I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment and those related to it in the light of those key points. I beg to move.

<a name="51109-22_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, Amendment No. 6 is grouped with Amendments Nos. 8 and 9, although they deal with a separate matter.
</p>

<a name="51109-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>In Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 we return to the well trodden path of devolution. The answer given by the Minister in Committee to amendments dealing with similar matters was that we were revisiting the devolution settlement. &quot;Devolution settlement&quot; is a favourite term of the Government. I have always thought of it as a phrase designed to placate English Members of Parliament and English noble Lords with some view that Welsh devolution had finished. But I have always borne in mind&#151;and emphasised on a number of occasions&#151;the words of the Secretary of State at the time of devolution, Ron Davies. He said that devolution is not an event but a process. It is a process which will continue.
</p>

<a name="51109-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>The Commissioner for Older People is the creature of the Westminster Parliament. The noble Lord, Lord Evans, said in Committee that it would not be appropriate for a commissioner established by the National Assembly for Wales to exercise his general functions under Clause 2 in relation to non-devolved matters. This commissioner is not established by the National Assembly for Wales but by this Westminster statute. Consequently there is no reason why the commissioner&#151;who is independent of the National Assembly&#151;should have his remit limited to devolved matters. He should be able to look at the interests of old people generally.
</p>

<a name="51109-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>I visited these matters when we discussed the position of the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales. When a Children&#039;s Commissioner for England was proposed, problems arose over the overlapping functions of that commissioner with the existing Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales. We heard the views of the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales about the problems of an English commissioner coming into his territory.
</p>

<a name="51109-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>When dealing with children, we were concerned with Home Office affairs such as juvenile crime and juvenile prisons. With old people we are concerned with much wider non-devolved matters. These do not divide neatly into devolved and non-devolved matters. We are concerned with pensions, social security benefits, tax and social services. Many of those matters are not part of the National Assembly&#039;s responsibility.
</p>

<a name="51109-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>In addition, when dealing with elderly people with problems, their particular difficulties in these areas are exacerbated by frailty and by the impatience and frustration that is sometimes caused by a lack of understanding of what can be very complex matters. Clause 2(3) contains the compromise that we arrived at with Lord Williams of Mostyn in relation to the Children&#039;s Commissioner&#151;namely that the commissioner could consider and make representations to the Assembly about any matter relating to the interests of older people in Wales. But the commissioner has to go through that channel.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_686"></a>

</p>

<a name="51109-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>It is interesting to see how the Children&#039;s Commissioner has coped with non-devolved matters since his office was founded. Mr Peter Clarke gave evidence to the Welsh Affairs Committee on 22 April 2004 and was asked how he was dealing with non-devolved matters. He was asked what his powers were over judicial processes and whether he was able to intervene or report on these issues. He said that he could make representations to the Assembly and that he had approached the Minister for Health and Social Services on two non-devolved matters, the functioning of the Criminal Records Bureau and CAFCASS. He said that he had found,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a>&quot;a number of informal ways of being able to advocate on behalf of children and young people . . . I have been invited regularly to speak to magistrates&#039; benches, family court judges and other judges within Wales; I have been invited into two or three prisons in Wales; I have meetings regularly with operational commanders in South Wales Police and I have had contact with other police authorities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>These are all non-devolved matters. Mr Clarke continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a>&quot;The only place I found my current powers a serious impediment has been in the conduct of the Clywch Inquiry where I would have liked to have had access to a police report but I was not able to demand it, whereas I could demand documents from every other party&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>When questioned further by Mrs Julie Morgan, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74"></a>&quot;I do not have my strongest powers in the areas of non-devolved matters. I cannot require documentation to be given to me, I cannot require the attendance of witnesses to give evidence on oath if I am conducting an inquiry. From the point of view of being the most powerful children&#039;s champion possible it would be good from my perspective if the current Children Bill were amended to extend my powers over those matters&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>So the experience of the Children&#039;s Commissioner is that of being limited in the inquiries that he can make in relation to non-devolved matters. Yet here we are some time later setting up an admirable position of a Commissioner for Older People, but a commissioner without the necessary powers that he requires.
</p>

<a name="51109-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>When I look at Clause 9(2) I note another matter. The Commissioner for Older People cannot examine the case of any particular person in non-devolved matters at all. I see the Minister shakes his head. Am I wrong about that?

<a name="51109-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I am not shaking my head. I simply make the point&#151;and I probably should not&#151;that we discussed these matters very fully in Committee and at Second Reading. I really do not think that we need another lecture on them from the Liberal Democrats on Report.
</p>




<p><a name="st_198"></a>
<a name="51109-23_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, I thought we were reporting to this House, sitting in the Chamber, on what had been discussed in Committee.

be considered by this commissioner. That is why I intend to move Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 in due course.
</p>




<p><a name="st_199"></a>
<a name="51109-23_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   My Lords, I want to tell the noble Lord why I shall be opposing his amendment if he presses it. There are two reasons. First, the continuing success of the devolution settlement has been its clarity of accountability. The commissioner may be created by Westminster statute, but it will be wholly and totally paid for by the Assembly. The Assembly&#039;s budget will carry the cost of the commissioner.
</p>

<a name="51109-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>Secondly, the agencies and the departments that the noble Lord wishes to bring within the scope of the commissioner&#039;s powers are United Kingdom agencies and departments which have their own very clear lines of accountability. They have lines of accountability to UK Ministers, to the Houses of Parliament through Select Committees and through questions and answers, and to Members of Parliament. The things that the noble Lord spoke about were the meat and drink of my 30 years&#039; worth of parliamentary experience. That is the job of a Member of Parliament; that is the job of a Select Committee investigating at national level the role and the way all these agencies perform their duties in respect of older people, or, indeed any other clients of theirs.

<a name="51109-23_time0"></a><h5>7.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="51109-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>I have always sought to achieve equality of service across the United Kingdom. I do not want older people in Hertfordshire to have different benefits from older people in Monmouthshire. I do not want different rights for older people on each side of Offa&#039;s Dyke. I do not think that that is the way forward. I believe that this is a genuine United Kingdom interest and that we should sustain and maintain the quality of benefits and treatment. I certainly do not think that we should confuse the line of accountability. There is a very clear line of accountability for UK departments. They are accountable to the Parliamentary Ombudsman, to Select Committees, to Members of Parliament and to Ministers.
</p>

<a name="51109-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>Since the devolution settlement in 1998 communication between the Assembly, United Kingdom Ministers and officials at Whitehall has grown very successfully. Commissioners have to go through the Assembly. The Assembly will create this office by funding it and promoting the Bill, and I do not think that it should be bypassed in any way. Therefore, I do not believe that the noble Lord&#039;s amendment, which would allow the commission to have the right, presumably to go to UK Ministers&#151;I think that is the logic of it&#151;is the right way forward. I hope therefore that he will think about the matter. I also want the devolution settlement to work. I do not see this provision in terms of English Members at all; I see it as part of a growing process. The Assembly has grown. All the Richard commission evidence has demonstrated that. One of the ways it has grown is the way that we have maintained clear systems of accountability between ourselves and Westminster <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_688"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 688</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and between UK Ministers and Assembly Ministers. The Assembly is the best conduit through which this kind of representation should be made. I therefore will not be supporting the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas.
</p>




<p><a name="st_200"></a>
<a name="51109-23_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, the effect of Amendment No. 6 would be to replace the wide powers the Bill gives the commissioner to review the effectiveness of legislation with a rather narrower power merely to review its implementation. That would mean that the commissioner would be unable to review the effectiveness of existing or proposed legislation, and would not, for example, be able to look at whether proposed legislation would be effective in achieving the policy aims that it was designed to fulfil. In the Government&#039;s view, that would restrict rather than enhance the commissioner&#039;s powers, whereas the clause as drafted would encompass all that the noble Lord seeks to include.
</p>

<a name="51109-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>During our consideration of this amendment in Grand Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75"></a>&quot;we are faced with a new concept of the role of the commissioner in law&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 18/10/05; col. GC 214.]<i> </i></p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>I can reassure noble Lords that similar powers to review the adequacy and effectiveness of law have a precedent in other commissioner legislation&#151;in the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland, and the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People.
</p>

<a name="51109-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 8 and 9. These seek to extend the devolution settlement by giving the commissioner a power to exercise his general functions in Clause 2 in respect of matters that are not devolved to the National Assembly for Wales. We discussed this matter at great length in Grand Committee where I hope I made the Government&#039;s position quite clear.
</p>

<a name="51109-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>The establishment of the commissioner and the functions of that office must be consistent with the existing constitutional settlement. We absolutely agree that devolution is a process and not an event. That is why the Government will be bringing forward a Bill to address the future directions of the devolution process. I have made the Government&#039;s position absolutely clear on this, and we must wait for the new Bill to debate that direction.
</p>

<a name="51109-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>Non-devolved functions, as we know, are the responsibility of the UK Government and not the Assembly. It simply would not be appropriate for a commissioner established by the Assembly and for Wales to exercise his general powers in relation to non-devolved matters in the way that these amendments propose.
</p>

<a name="51109-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>The proper constitutional route, within the devolution settlement as it currently exists, is for the commissioner to make representations on non-devolved matters via the Assembly, as the elected body with democratic responsibility for the people of Wales. The Government hold firm to that view. I stated in Grand Committee that the Assembly Government <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_689"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 689</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

understand and accept that position, although presumably they&#151;and we&#151;are looking forward to the new Bill, when published.
</p>

<a name="51109-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>Furthermore, the recent exchange of letters between the Wales Office and the Assembly Ministers, copies of which have been placed in the Library, show the commitment of both to ensuring that the process of dealing with the commissioner&#039;s representations is very effective. For the reasons I have explained, the Government cannot accept the amendment and I invite the noble Lord to withdraw it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_201"></a>
<a name="51109-23_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, was quite right in saying that there are two very separate subjects within this group of three amendments. Amendment No. 6, which I moved, deals specifically with the interpretation of the commissioner&#039;s function in keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law affecting the interests of older people in Wales. What concerned me&#151;a concern shared, I think, by the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, in Committee&#151;was precisely what was meant by the process of checking on the effectiveness of law.
</p>

<a name="51109-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>We now know that if Amendment No. 6 were to be implemented, it would give the commissioner a narrower power and he would not be able to look as closely as the Government would wish him to at proposed legislation. The Minister has given us precedents for commissioners looking at proposed legislative developments and I accept the point that he made. At the same time, I wish to stress how important it is that the commissioner should be able to check thoroughly the effectiveness of the operation of the law, in so far as the interests of older people are concerned. That means law and its practice in Wales.
</p>

<a name="51109-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>The other two amendments, tabled by the Liberal Democrats, deal with the scope of the commissioner&#039;s powers and, personally, I do not think that one can have one&#039;s cake and eat it. The commissioner is very much an appointment of the Assembly and an employee of the Assembly; his office is financed by the Assembly. Therefore, it is understandable that this Bill should confine his functions and his powers to areas in which the Assembly also has functions. I am sure that this is not the last time that we shall be debating this issue. Nevertheless, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_203"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I have been made aware by Age Concern, Help the Aged and the Law Society of a general discontent with the lack of powers that the commissioner will have. Amendment No. 7 is made in response to those fears, as well as my own, that the commissioner will lack teeth, as we put it colloquially. The same concern permeated our earlier <br>&nbsp;<br>

debate on Liberal Democrat Amendment No. 3, on the question of &quot;shall&quot; as opposed to &quot;may&quot; in the performance of functions under Clause 2.
</p>

<a name="51109-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>Before I move on, I must acknowledge the potential of Clause 13, which provides for further supplementary functions for the commissioner. That clearly anticipates that the commissioner may have further functions conferred on him. I can think of no better function to be conferred on him than the power of enforcing his own recommendations, which is what we propose in Amendment No. 7.
</p>

<a name="51109-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>Amendment No. 26 is also included in this group. That, again, is concerned with the examination of cases and action to be taken. The amendment is intended to ensure that the examination of cases is implemented thoroughly. As Clause 9(6) stands, examinations are closely governed by regulations, but it is not clear what happens if an examination results in a recommendation that is not then complied with. It seems to me ludicrous to have regulations relating to compliance with recommendations that do not cover situations arising in the event of non-compliance. Amendment No. 26 seems to me necessary in order to ensure clarity and consistency. I shall, at a later stage, return to comment favourably on the government amendments included in this group. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_204"></a>
<a name="51109-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, we support this amendment in giving additional and important power to the Commissioner for Older People. I refer to the views of Mr Peter Clarke in relation to his powers as the Children&#039;s Commissioner, and I shall return to that when Amendment No. 8 is called shortly. It is obviously important that recommendations made by the Commissioner for Older People should not lie on a shelf, gathering dust. Rather, they should be implemented and the commissioner should have the power to do so.


</p>




<p><a name="st_205"></a>
<a name="51109-24_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   My Lords, when the debate on this amendment took place in Grand Committee, I raised with the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, the issue of its budgetary consequences. I was waiting to see whether he had found a way of addressing the question that I put to him then, so I repeat: commissioners&#039; recommendations could lead to considerable pressure on budgets. For example, it would be within the commissioner&#039;s responsibilities to make recommendations to a local authority&#151;not necessarily one local authority, but all local authorities&#151;about the services that it provides in certain respects of dealing with elderly people. The same is true of health trusts and even of those services directly budgeted for, funded and delivered by the Assembly itself. Recommendations of that kind could have serious budgetary implications for the organisations concerned.
</p>

<a name="51109-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>We are not talking about the enforcement of a particular recommendation. The commissioner could&#151;would, I hope&#151;identify areas where there was inequality of service delivery in a health trust, between health trusts or between individual local authorities and then recommend to the Assembly delivery of a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_691"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 691</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

uniform service. For example, as I said in Grand Committee, there could be a recommendation that physiotherapy be delivered for female incontinence sufferers across the board, as opposed to the current patchy delivery of that service from one health trust to another. That is exactly the kind of thing that we want the commissioner to highlight, but I question whether he should have a right to enforce a recommendation of that kind, which could have a considerable impact on the budgets of a local authority, a health trust or the Assembly.
<a name="time_18"></a>
<a name="51109-24_time0"></a><h5>7.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="51109-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>How will we marry the enforcement of an identified grievance of an individual, as opposed to a commissioner recommending as a result of his inquiries and services that a major new service should be provided for elderly people right across Wales, with considerable budgetary implications? Ultimately, in those instances, it has to be the responsibility of the Assembly, the local authority or the health trust to decide whether that would be the priority. Otherwise, the commission, in a curious way, will begin to assert the democratic rights and responsibilities of people elected at various levels to make decisions on priorities. That is my major query. I was waiting with some interest to hear whether the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, would respond to the point that I made to him.
</p>




<p><a name="st_206"></a>
<a name="51109-24_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Prys-Davies: </b>   My Lords, in Grand Committee I very much understood and sympathised with the thought behind Amendment No. 7, although I cannot go along with it as it is drawn. The amendment draws attention to the position that will arise where the provider simply refuses to implement the commission&#039;s recommendation. The Bill simply ignores that possibility. We are making a mistake in designing a Bill that is silent on that issue.
</p>

<a name="51109-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>The provider may refuse to comply for one of a number of reasons. My noble friend indicated one good reason why an objector might not be prepared to go along with a recommendation, but there can be others&#151;for example, wilfulness on the part of the provider. We know of damaging cases in the past few years where the provider was not prepared or willing to implement recommendations. I am not sure of the answer, but it should be possible to design a procedure where the recommendation and the objection to it can be referred to a third party for a decision that would be binding on the commission and the provider. That is an issue of considerable importance, and the Government should give it further thought.
</p>




<p><a name="st_207"></a>
<a name="51109-24_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I shall speak first to government Amendments Nos. 20, 21 and 27, before turning to Amendments Nos. 7 and 26, which stand in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Roberts of Conwy, Lord Luke, Lord Thomas of Gresford and Lord Roberts of Llandudno. In Grand Committee, noble Lords stressed the fundamental importance of the commissioner not only looking into <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_692"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 692</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

matters of concern to older people and making reports and recommendations about those matters, but being able to pursue his recommendations and hold bodies to account for their actions in response to his reports.
</p>

<a name="51109-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>We expect the commissioner to be proactive in his approach to making and following up recommendations. To make that absolutely clear in the Bill, we have tabled Amendments Nos. 20 and 21, which extend the regulation-making powers in Clause 6(5) to enable the commissioner to require prescribed persons to provide him with information for the purposes of determining whether a recommendation made in a report, following a review of arrangements, has been complied with. Furthermore, Amendment No. 27 provides that, where a person fails to comply with such a request for information, that will be dealt with by means of the existing obstruction and contempt provision in Clause 10.
</p>

<a name="51109-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>Amendment No. 7 would allow for the commissioner to be given the power to enforce any recommendations that he might choose to make in connection with his general functions. Compliance with those recommendations would be obligatory. However, providing for such an enforcement power in respect of the discharge of general functions would mark a significant extension of the commissioner&#039;s powers and would go far beyond the powers of any other commissioner or ombudsman.
</p>

<a name="51109-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>Such a power could also cut across the work of regulatory bodies, such as the Care Standards Inspectorate for Wales, create duplication and cause confusion about who is in the lead on regulation and enforcement. In the Government&#039;s view, therefore, the Bill, strengthened by the government amendments, strikes the right balance by providing an appropriate level of follow-up action according to whether a specific or a general function has been discharged. The Assembly Government share that view.
</p>

<a name="51109-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>Similarly, in considering Amendment No. 26, the Government and the Assembly Government are of the view that the addition of such a power would be inappropriate and largely unnecessary. With his existing powers the commissioner is able during an examination to request information, explanations and assistance for the purpose of identifying individual responsibility. That information will allow him, as part of the process of drawing up his recommendations, to determine what person or body is responsible for taking action on those issues. Furthermore, the commissioner will be able to identify responsible individuals in his reports and recommendations, if he considers it to be in the public interest. In such cases it would be evident on whom responsibility for implementation rested.
</p>

<a name="51109-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>I now turn to two questions asked by my noble friend Lord Prys-Davies. First, is there an appeal against the commissioner&#039;s recommendation? No, we do not think that it is appropriate for the Bill to make provision for appeal mechanisms in the event that the commissioner&#039;s recommendations are not complied with. It would not be appropriate for any third party, such as another ombudsman, to pass judgment on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_693"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 693</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

whether the commissioner&#039;s recommendations were reasonable or had been adequately complied with. That would create a hierarchy of commissioners and ombudsmen, thus undermining their status as independent officers and a point of final recourse.
</p>

<a name="51109-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>If a public body is not complying with the recommendations of the commissioner or any other ombudsman, the only way that that decision could be challenged would be in the courts by way of judicial review. Any review proceedings would not be against the commissioner&#039;s decision but against the decision of the body that is not complying with the commissioner&#039;s recommendation.

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>My noble friend also asked what would happen if a body refused to implement the commissioner&#039;s recommendation. There would be a number of avenues open to the commissioner in such a case. He may, for example, decide to review the discharge of functions of that body and produce another report with further recommendations. For example, if a decision had been taken not to pursue a recommendation because the necessary funding was not available, the commissioner could make a recommendation that the Assembly, or another appropriate body, should meet the cost or redefine the relevant policy priorities. In the light of those explanations, and with the three government amendments, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.

<a name="51109-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, I welcome Amendments Nos. 20, 21 and 27. They are improvements to the Bill. The commissioner should be enabled to require people to provide him with information so that he may decide whether a recommendation has been complied with. That is certainly a step forward. It is also right that, where a person fails to comply with such a request, the commissioner should be able to issue a certificate to the High Court so that proceedings for contempt of court may ensue. Those changes certainly help to ensure that the commissioner&#039;s recommendations are taken seriously and are on no account to be disregarded.
</p>

<a name="51109-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>I must answer the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, as I tried to do, if I remember correctly, in Committee, when he raised the question of resources that lay behind the enforced implementation of the commissioner&#039;s recommendations. This is the second time this evening that the issue of adequate resources for the commissioner has been raised. It was mentioned when we discussed Amendment No. 3 and the question of whether the functions should be powers or duties. The question of resources dictated that the commissioner should have some latitude to prioritise and perform according to the resources available to him.
</p>

<a name="51109-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>Again, the question of adequate resources for the commissioner arises in the implementation of a recommendation, as per my amendment. That, too, comes under the &quot;may&quot; category, and it would be up to the commissioner to decide what recommendation to highlight as not being adequately complied with. Some <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_694"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 694</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

discretion still rests with the commissioner in putting forward what are after all his own recommendations following on his functions under Clause 2.
</p>




<p><a name="st_209"></a>
<a name="51109-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising the point, but I do not think that we are talking about the commissioner&#039;s resources. The commissioner&#039;s resources are modest by comparison. It is his recommendations about the use of other people&#039;s resources that raises the issue of enforcement, not the resources that he will have at his disposal. He will not have the resources to provide new services for elderly people throughout Wales but will recommend the utilisation of services and how resources will best be deployed. He may be entitled to make a recommendation, but he should not be able to enforce other people&#039;s resources to be used in the way that the noble Lord suggests.
</p>




<p><a name="st_210"></a>
<a name="51109-25_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, I take the noble Lord&#039;s point, but I have argued that it is entirely up to the commissioner what recommendation he makes. In making recommendations, he will have to take into account the resources issue, not just those available to him but the resources of those who are subject to his recommendation. In support of my interpretation of the commissioner&#039;s power to issue recommendations and the fact that he must be aware of his resources, I cite the fact that we have made his functions permissive rather than statutory in the strongest sense.
</p>

<a name="51109-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>I certainly take the noble Lord&#039;s point. It is clear that the resources available in Wales and to those subject to the commissioner&#039;s recommendations are highly relevant. If the debate has done no more than try to ensure that those subject to the commissioner are adequately resourced, we shall have done something by tabling the amendment, which I now beg leave to withdraw.

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>The amendment is not so much concerned about reporting to the Minister as to the inquiry that the Commissioner for Older People can carry out under Clause 2(3). It is a fact that the commissioner has strong <br>&nbsp;<br>

powers to deal with devolved matters, but when he is considering non-devolved matters under Clause 2(3), his powers, like those of the Children&#039;s Commissioner, will not be the strongest. In carrying out an inquiry to report to the National Assembly, he will not have powers to summon witnesses and to examine documents. Clearly the reports that he can make on non-devolved matters will be that much weaker as a result.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>The Minister should appreciate that I have not come here without having read the entire Committee deliberations, and I read what the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, said.

It seems to me that the grounds for the amendment in Grand Committee have now disappeared in the light of the Government&#039;s amendment. Nevertheless, &quot;monitoring&quot; is still the correct word to use in certain circumstances and I would have thought that it was right to use it in the circumstances of Clause 5.
</p>




<p><a name="st_218"></a>
<a name="51109-25_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I shall speak first to Amendment No. 10, before turning to Amendments Nos. 17 and 18. We discussed in some detail in Committee the issues raised in Amendment No. 10. I explained at that time that the Government&#039;s view is that both Clauses 3 and 5 already enable the commissioner to undertake review and monitoring activity. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, for looking up the definition of &quot;monitor&quot; in the Oxford English Dictionary. I understand that the dictionary makes a distinction between &quot;review&quot; and &quot;monitor&quot;, but that distinction has no legal significance here as the terms used in the Bill must be interpreted in the context in which they appear. The term &quot;review&quot; in Clauses 3 and 5 includes monitoring activity and the Bill makes it clear that the purposes for which the commissioner may review functions and arrangements are safeguarding and promoting the interest of older people in Wales.
</p>

<a name="51109-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>However, the Government have reflected on the concerns that were put forward by your Lordships, in particular those about the difference in terminology used in Clauses 3 and 5, and, as the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, has said, they have therefore brought forward Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 to address these concerns. These amendments align the terminology used in the Bill by removing the reference to monitoring in Clause 5, while making it clear that the term &quot;review&quot; would include the process of monitoring over time. We may not agree on this, but I hope that noble Lords will be reassured to some extent by these amendments and feel able to withdraw their own.

(   )   The Assembly or appropriate body investigated by the Commissioner shall publish a response within six months.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_221"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is about the publication of the annual report by the Commissioner for Older People in Wales. We had this discussion in connection with the Public Services Ombudsman and it was agreed in that case that a report would be produced. For transparency&#039;s sake, we need to know exactly what the commissioner is doing. We need to know how the resources are being used and whether this post is resourced adequately. We also might want to find out whether the commissioner feels that his hands are tied behind his back because he cannot deal with so many problems. He might say, as the CAB tells us, &quot;We had 88,000 queries regarding pensions, but I couldn&#039;t deal with that: it wasn&#039;t in my remit&quot;. Or he might say, &quot;We had 6,000 questions regarding taxation for elderly people, but I couldn&#039;t deal with that: it wasn&#039;t in my remit&quot;. If we have a report, it will show the weaknesses and the strengths of this particular post at this particular time. As has been said many times, justice must be seen to be done. We therefore ask the Government to agree to an annual report which will show the experience of the post and how it can be increasingly effective as the years go on.
</p>

<a name="51109-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>Similarly, the next part of the amendment would require the publication of the response of those who are investigated by the commissioner. They should be given an opportunity to admit their faults, or even to justify the action that they have taken. I beg to move.

<a name="51109-26_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, I support that part of the amendment which would require an annual report to be published. I am not sure about the second part of the amendment because all kinds of questions arise; for example, if a body has been investigated by the commissioner, is a response to be published within six months regardless of whether the investigation is adverse or favourable? The second part of the amendment requires rather more definition, but the annual report aspect is certainly very important.

<p><a name="st_223"></a>
<a name="51109-26_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I was a little surprised to see that this amendment had been tabled because I explained during our discussions in Committee that the Assembly has made clear its intention to make regulations requiring the commissioner to produce an annual report, using its powers in paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 of the Bill. This was set out in the statement of policy intentions produced by the Assembly and placed in the Library of the House in June.

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>We think that it is appropriate that the making of reports to the Assembly should be provided for in regulations to be made by the Assembly. I covered this point in some detail in my memorandum to the DPRR committee. It also mirrors similar provisions in the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales legislation.
</p>

<a name="51109-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>These regulations will contain detailed administrative provisions which we think would be suitable for inclusion in regulation rather than the Bill. This will allow the Assembly greater flexibility in the future in terms of the reporting requirements and will give the opportunity for detailed consultation as part of the Assembly&#039;s procedures for making regulations.
</p>

<a name="51109-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>I turn to the second part of the amendment. The Government&#039;s and the Assembly&#039;s position on this has not changed since our discussions in Committee. We do not feel that it is appropriate to place a requirement on the Assembly or any other person to respond to the commissioner&#039;s annual reports.
</p>

<a name="51109-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>The annual reports will be concerned primarily with action that the commissioner has taken and intends to take in fulfilling his remit. They are less likely to deal in detail with what action other bodies might or might not have taken. However, as I explained, a mechanism is in place for considering the observations and recommendations that will be contained in the reports in the form of a plenary debate of the Assembly. In this way, the Assembly can be held publicly accountable for any perceived inadequacies in its policies for older people that are raised by the annual report. In the light of my comments, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

</p>

<a name="51109-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>First, under Amendment No. 13, it seems right to add to the list of health bodies the air ambulance in Wales, ambulance services and trusts, and a voluntary organisation. It is proposed that they be put within that category. Amendment No. 14 refers to particular United Kingdom-wide services; pensions and benefits, jobs&#151;in particular, job discrimination&#151;and the criminal justice system.

<a name="51109-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>There seemed to be an element of doubt among your Lordships about that in Committee, but I can assure you that it is definitely the case. Therefore the amendment is unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="51109-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>I absolutely accept that voluntary organisations are important, and particularly relevant to older people. However, the point I made during Grand Committee still stands. To add &quot;voluntary organisations&quot; in general to Schedule 2 or Schedule 3, as Amendment 23 proposes, would significantly alter the scope of the Bill. It would also be at odds with other commissioner or ombudsmen models, which are focused upon the accountability of bodies and persons who provide <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_700"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 700</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

statutory services. Introducing this level of accountability and scrutiny into the voluntary sector inappropriately may discourage the provision of some voluntary services, which is certainly not our intention.

<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>Amendment No. 15 seeks to insert police authorities into the list of bodies in Schedule 2. While I fully acknowledge the role that police authorities play in safeguarding the health and safety of older people in Wales, policy responsibility for policing in England and Wales lies with the Home Office, which also provides a substantial proportion of the funding for police authorities. As with Amendment No. 14 it would not therefore be appropriate, under the terms of the existing constitutional settlement, for police authorities to be included in Schedule 2.
</p>

<a name="51109-26_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>The requirement that Amendment No. 16 seeks to remove is not just about making a distinction between devolved and non-devolved organisations. It is about defining the type of organisation that should be brought within the commissioner&#039;s remit, based on the financial contribution that comes from the Assembly. Removing the requirement would enable the Assembly to add to Schedule 2 an organisation, devolved or non-devolved, that received at least half its funding on the discharge of its function in Wales from the UK Government without any requirement for consent from the relevant UK department. It would also make Clause 4(3) redundant. I hope, in the light of this rather lengthy explanation, that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<p><a name="st_234"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I see that Amendment No. 19 is grouped with Amendment No. 28. In fact they have nothing at all in common, so I will speak to Amendment No. 19. Clause 5 provides that the commissioner may review the three arrangements which are referred to in subsection (2). They are the advocacy arrangements, the complaints arrangements and the whistle-blowing arrangements. The purpose of Amendment No. 19 is to expand the clause to empower the commissioner to review the arrangements for the implementation of the guidance on best practice. Having regard to the fact that the guidance on best practice will play a key role in promoting and maintaining high standards of service, I suggest that the arrangements for its implementation are just as important as the three arrangements referred to in subsection (2), if not more so. Prevention is better than cure; and if the guidance is being implemented, it is reasonable to conclude that there will be less demand on, or need for, advocacy, complaints and whistle-blowing arrangements. That is the case for Amendment No. 19. I beg to move.

I shall speak to that, or reply to the Minister, when that amendment is called.

The first enables the commissioner to check whether his guidance has been complied with, so that he may issue a further report if necessary, and provides some much-needed strengthening to the whole process of issuing guidance. Some of us would have liked to see the guidance given statutory force, but that is not regarded as appropriate&#151;and one can understand why. Nevertheless, the power in the new subsection is a strong hint that when the commissioner issues guidance he means it to be followed, and that he is not without remedy if his guidance is disregarded.

<p><a name="st_242"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the value of the research is not doubted, and the lack of any specific reference to research in the Bill is worrying. In Grand Committee on 18 October my noble friend the Minister readily agreed that research was an important tool for the commissioner in connection with any of his functions, not only for the general functions set out in Clause 2 and referred to in my amendment. He gave four examples of when research would be required or necessary, which was helpful. But then he opposed the amendment, saying that it was not necessary; he said that the commissioner could undertake research under paragraph 19 to Schedule 1. But when you read that paragraph, you find the power expressed subject,

If the commissioner were given the specific responsibility for undertaking research of this kind to identify areas of health inequality, it would help to highlight and promote the debate and ensure action. My noble friend is right in asking the Government to make this a specific duty or responsibility of the commissioner, because it could be central to the valid work that he or she could do in addressing issues of health inequality.

We are in full agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, that it is vitally important that the commissioner should be able to undertake such research or educational activities. We have complete confidence that the Bill already allows for the commissioner to do this via his supplementary powers in paragraph 19 of Schedule 1, which provides that the commissioner may do anything that is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or instrumental to, the discharge of his functions. This would include such activities such as commissioning or undertaking research or engaging expert advice, and could be done in connection with any of the commissioner&#039;s functions, not just those in Clause 2.

research.

However, given that these points have been forcefully made by my two noble friends, I will reflect on what they have said between now and the next stage of the Bill to see whether any strengthening is needed in the Bill.

&quot;(   )   Regulations may make provision for the examination by the commissioner of a complaint made by a member of the public who claims that it is in the public interest that the situation described in the complaint be examined and the commissioner is satisfied that it should be examined in the public interest.&quot;

<p><a name="st_248"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the drafting of this amendment may well be defective. It became clear during the course of the discussion in Grand Committee that there is no provision in the Bill as it now stands for a third party to make a complaint to the commissioner about a matter that is in the public interest, unless the elderly person concerned consents to the making of the complaint. We have a duty to protect the public interest, even though the elderly person directly concerned may be unable or afraid to consent to a complaint being lodged with the commissioner.
</p>

<a name="51109-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>The need for the power, assuming I have correctly understood the Bill, could arise when the commissioner receives a complaint from a member of the public setting out the circumstances, which should be examined by the commissioner in the public interest. I should not like to tempt case histories in anticipation of anything of that kind, but it could arise where the standards of service for the elderly provided by a named authority are seriously depressed, and the complainant provides supportive evidence, but the complaint is not made with the consent of an elderly person who receives the service. The complainant is induced to make the complaint as a matter of public interest. That is the reason for the amendment. I hope that my noble friend will also be sympathetic to this amendment.

<a name="51109-28_para6"></a>

It seems to me that the commissioner ought to have power to investigate individual cases even though the matter relates to a non-devolved issue. I have already outlined the other weakness that we discussed earlier, and I shall not return to that. It seems to me that if the commissioner cannot examine an individual case relating to a non-devolved matter his powers are very considerably restricted. Your Lordships will recall that I pointed out that many of these non-devolved issues such as pensions and benefits are the cause of the greatest worry to older people.

<a name="51109-28_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, I rise to express my support for the thrust of Amendment No. 24. Indeed, I have a great deal of sympathy with Amendment No. 25. It seems to me that if the commissioner is to have any real standing in Wales, he should be able to examine any defect, any disturbance, or any matter that is in the public interest. Once we deny him the right to examine a matter that is in the public interest, we depreciate him and his office enormously.
</p>




<p><a name="st_251"></a>
<a name="51109-28_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, Amendment No. 24 relates to Clause 9. This clause and the regulations which it enables the Assembly to make concern the examination by the commissioner of an individual&#039;s case, or of a group of linked cases. It therefore makes sense that at the heart of an examination made using these powers there must be a specific case to be examined.
</p>

<a name="51109-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>The Government consider that, logically, this must mean that the individual whose case it is must give their consent. Alternatively, if perhaps they lack the mental capacity to do so, consent ought to be obtained from someone who the commissioner considers to be an appropriate person to give it.
</p>

<a name="51109-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>It is difficult to see how the commissioner could investigate a case thoroughly when the subject of it refused to give him information about it. If, as I think my noble friend envisages, a scenario arose where an issue of concern was identified by a concerned relative or even a member of the general public, but the older person whose situation had given rise to the concern refused to give his consent for his case to be examined, the commissioner could still decide to take action. He would, for instance, be able to use his powers under Clauses 2 and/or 3 to investigate issues of wider concern and to make a report about them, or issue best practice guidance if he thought that was warranted. Therefore, while I understand the sentiment behind Amendment No. 24, the Government cannot accept it. It would not be right for the commissioner to be able to disregard the wishes of an older person and to examine their case when they did not want him to do so.

<p><a name="st_258"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I start from the standpoint that the guidance on best practice is potentially an enormous and important tool for the commissioner. It is my understanding of general law that the commissioner could issue a non-statutory code of practice without being empowered to do so in any Act of Parliament; it is an implied power.
</p>

<a name="51109-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>I am pleased that the guidance is to be issued on the exercise of a power in the Bill. I think that will help greatly to increase the legitimacy of the court but it would be an even greater enhancement if it was issued in pursuance of a duty.
</p>

<a name="51109-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>The impact of the guidance on best practice will be at least twofold. I envisage that it will set out in some detail the general principles and standards which the commissioner will endeavour to promote and facilitate in all parts of Wales, subject obviously to local circumstances, so that we can have the best possible service. Secondly, the guidance will be readily available to the elderly and to members of the public, who are entitled to know what standards of service should be available to them in their own community. Those two benefits, taken together, indicate the need for &quot;may&quot; to be replaced by &quot;must&quot;. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_259"></a>
<a name="51109-29_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, the amendment seeks to replace the commissioner&#039;s power to issue best practice guidance in Clause 11 with a duty to do so. That would oblige the commissioner to produce and issue best practice guidance in connection with any matter relating to the interests of older people in Wales. It would be a substantial and onerous duty with significant cost and capacity implications. Our aspirations for the commissioner&#039;s guidance are very much in tune with those of my noble friend. It is an important function, which must be discharged effectively. But the Government consider that it is best achieved by providing the commissioner with the discretion to decide how, when and on what subjects he should issue best practice guidance.
</p>

<a name="51109-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>We do not want to oblige the commissioner to flood the prescribed bodies with guidance on everything and anything that he looks into; that would surely be unworkable and undesirable. Furthermore, the commissioner will have to set a budget each year, and he will need to make decisions on the most appropriate use of his resources in accordance with his priorities. I hope that what I have said will reassure my noble friend, and I invite him to withdraw his amendment.

<p><a name="st_264"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in trying to insert here the right of the commissioner to intervene in the life of a person who is cared for in his or her own home we have a fundamental decision to make. The whole ethos and force of this measure is to ensure that no single elderly person anywhere in Wales suffers any harm at all. So many elderly people suffer in their own homes because of inappropriate care, or even sometimes because of people&#039;s deliberate actions to make their lives a misery. We know from the Health Committee that 500,000 elderly people suffered abuse the year before last. That number is colossal, and many suffer in their own homes. What we are asking here is that no person, wherever he or she is residing, should suffer harm in any way at all.
</p>

<a name="51109-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>Most families and carers, as we know, are doing a remarkable job, and we often say how much we appreciate the work that is being done by so many of them. But now and again the newspapers report an account of neglect or deliberate harm to an elderly person. How do we prevent that? As we mentioned in Grand Committee, we have adult protection co-ordinators appointed by the various councils. They can get a magistrate&#039;s order and enter a home. The police can also do that. However, surely in cases of domestic violence, it should be possible to enter a home&#151;if a child is going to be hurt it is possible to enter the home. All we ask is that it should be possible for the Commissioner for Older People to enter homes and make sure that, in cases of suspected abuse, he is able to look after and care for the person who is suffering. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_265"></a>
<a name="51109-29_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I understand and sympathise entirely with the reasons behind this amendment. None of us would want to think that an older person might be left to suffer unnecessarily behind closed doors. However, the simple and compelling fact remains that to give the commissioner the power to enter an individual&#039;s private home would be a disproportionate interference with an individual&#039;s right to privacy and in breach of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_709"></a>

the Human Rights Act. It would also set a precedent among other commissioners and ombudsmen, none of whom has such a power.
</p>

<a name="51109-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>If the commissioner had concerns about the personal safety of an older person, he would be able to pass those on to the appropriate authorities, such as the police or social services, for action. It would not be for him to try to deal with such situations himself. For example, if the police believed that an older person was in danger, they would be able to enter premises using their wide investigatory powers. A crucial point is that we must remember that the commissioner will not be working in isolation, but operating within an existing framework of legal protection for vulnerable people. Having said that, I hope that the noble Lord will agree that the clause must remain as drafted.

<a name="51109-29_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno: </b>   My Lords, I have heard the Minister&#039;s response.

&quot;(   )   interview the older person in private in the presence of an independent advocate.&quot;

<p><a name="st_268"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment arises from submissions by the Law Society and Age Concern. Age Concern is worried that people interviewed in their own homes could be under undue influence from members of the family or others in the home. It wants the person who has called for someone to intervene in a nursing home or residential home to be able to have an advocate appointed&#151;someone who can be independent of any allegation of abuse or ill treatment. This amendment should be made to the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51109-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>Age Concern is worried that an elderly person might depend on a care worker or family member and might be reluctant or afraid to offend that family member. Pressure might be brought to bear&#151;intentionally or unintentionally&#151;on the older person not to consent to an interview in private. Age Concern suggests that there should never be any case where an older person is unable to shout for help or make his situation known to others. So, as with the organisations that have submitted their evidence, we ask that wherever there is an interview with an older person there is always the opportunity for an independent advocate to be present.

<a name="51109-30_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, as we have heard, this amendment seeks to enable an older person to have an independent advocate present when being interviewed by the commissioner in connection with his functions under Clauses 3 and 5 of the Bill.

</p>

<a name="51109-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>I made it absolutely clear in Committee that, although not specifically stated on the face of the Bill, an older person may be interviewed by the commissioner with a third party present if they so wish. There may be circumstances in which an older person may wish to give their consent to be interviewed only if an independent advocate is present. Clause 12(1)(b) would enable this to happen without the need for any amendment. If an older person does not wish to have an independent advocate present they may make that decision for themselves.
</p>

<a name="51109-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth, asked in Committee what might happen in a situation where an older person was unable to give their consent to being interviewed. The basic position is that there will be a presumption that a person is capable of giving their consent unless the contrary can be shown. The question is whether the person is capable of giving their consent in relation to the specific matter for which consent is sought. The issue of capacity and consent is a very difficult legal area and I think it is an area where the commissioner would have to tread very carefully and in accordance with legal and medical advice.
</p>

<a name="51109-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>The need for consent is an important principle here, and in circumstances where an older person lacks capacity to give that consent, it would normally not be appropriate for the commissioner to undertake an interview. Neither would it be appropriate for an independent advocate or another third party to give consent on behalf of the older person. I emphasise again that an independent advocate should only be present where the older person wishes this to happen.
</p>

<p><a name="st_272"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment pursues a point that I raised at the end of Grand Committee, when the Government introduced what was then their new Clause 19, dealing with the complaints procedure in respect of the commissioner.
</p>

<a name="51109-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>This clause is about complaints against the commissioner, the possibility that the commissioner may not have discharged his or her duties properly, and the procedures that would be required if an individual thought that the commission had failed him <br>&nbsp;<br>

or her. It is a question not of the commission&#039;s independence but of who should finally approve the procedures of complaint against the commissioner.
</p>

<a name="51109-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>In this clause, the commissioner must consult the Assembly and, having amended the complaints procedure in the light of such consultation, send a document to the Assembly, as in subsection (5). I suggest that there is a case for the Assembly having greater responsibility for these procedures. They are drafted to ensure that the individual has a right to complain against the commissioner&#039;s performance of his or her duties. I do not believe that, in that instance, the commissioner should be the final arbiter. What if, for example, the Assembly did not think that the commissioner was bringing forward procedures that were robust and rigorous enough to deal with the complaints against him or her?
</p>

<a name="51109-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>What if the Assembly found itself at loggerheads over these procedures? Under this provision, the commissioner could stick to his or her guns and establish a procedure for complaint about him or herself. It is not the case&#151;as my noble friend indicated very briefly at the end of our discussion we had&#151;that an amendment of this kind would somehow impinge upon the commissioner&#039;s independence. This is nothing to do with the discharge of the commissioner&#039;s functions in, for example, pursuing grievances. Of course he or she must have total independence in that respect, but I doubt he or she should have total independence in dealing with developing a complaints procedure against him or herself. In this case, there is a strong case for the commissioner to seek the approval of the Assembly when establishing such procedures. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_273"></a>
<a name="51109-30_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Prys-Davies: </b>   My Lords, I warmly support the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Rowlands. As he has so clearly explained, under the Bill the procedure for the investigation of complaints against the commissioner is designed by the commissioner himself. It is designed by the person against whom the complaint is made. Unless the procedure is approved by an independent third party or the Assembly, there is at least a possibility of a suspicion that the commissioner will be regarded as a judge and party in his own cause. Indeed, it is equally in the interest of the commissioner himself, and of all other parties, that the procedure should command confidence. The more thought that the Government can give to this matter, the better.

<p><a name="st_279"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a very contentious issue. The Government&#039;s strategy document for older people, <i>Opportunity Age&#151;Meeting the challenges of ageing in the 21st century</i>, which has been my bedside reading for the past few weeks, was referred to by the Minister and me in Committee. It sets the starting age limit at age 50. In Committee, the Minister agreed with me that from the age of 50 serious issues of disadvantage and discrimination affect some people as they move towards old age. The noble Lord&#039;s argument for maintaining the threshold at 60 in the Bill&#151;and not moving to 50&#151;is that the commissioner&#039;s primary duty is to protect those who receive services as older people in Wales. Generally, the provision of services begins at that age.
</p>

<a name="51109-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>The needs of those aged between 50 and 60 will be provided for, I assume, by the general developments within that strategy document. The Minister acknowledges the importance of supporting the over-50s as an age group that is vulnerable to the onslaught of what one might call the concomitant disadvantages of old age. It is an age-group that the White Paper acknowledges has, for example, a lower than average level of employment. My argument is that once the strategy starts providing for people&#039;s needs, by definition, it is a service. Such provision would fit very snugly under the commissioner&#039;s remit in Wales without argument about devolved or non-devolved areas. If the strategy does not serve a purpose, we may well wonder what it does, apart from being a statement of intent.
</p>

<a name="51109-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>Another point that arises is the tremendous emphasis in <i>Opportunity Age</i> on 50 as the starting age. Would it be fair to Welsh people who are over 50 if <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_713"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 713</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

their English neighbours of that age are entitled to different and special support and treatment? England may well decide to give over-50s special services. Would the Welsh qualify? If not, would that put the commissioner in Wales, and the Welsh people, very much out of kilter with those in England? Surely that would be an undesirable effect of devolution. Addressing the needs of those aged 50 and over is a matter of anticipation and it is written into <i>Opportunity Age</i>, which is a key government document. To take a decision that goes against the content of that White Paper is asking for trouble. I rest my case, and ask the Government to consider again the starting age of 60 and to replace it with 50, as England has already done. I beg to move.

<a name="51109-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, this amendment was discussed at some length in Grand Committee and at Second Reading. I will avoid going over old ground today.
</p>

<a name="51109-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>As I said in Grand Committee, our primary concern is the greatly increased workload that the amendment would place on the commissioner. This would in turn reduce the effectiveness of his role. Setting the age threshold at 50 would provide the commissioner with too broad a remit, covering one-third of the population of Wales.
</p>

<a name="51109-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>I would also like to address the concerns that were voiced in Grand Committee that older people in Wales would somehow be disadvantaged in comparison with those in England. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, returned to this point this evening. I can clarify that the strategy for older people in Wales&#151;like its sister strategy Opportunity Age&#151;has an age threshold of 50. Both documents set out a way forward for planning for old age. The new age equality regulations which will apply equally in England and Wales set no qualifying age and safeguard people of any age from unequal treatment at work. The Commission for <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 714</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Equality and Human Rights will likewise operate in Wales as well as in England to promote human rights and enforce the age equality and disability legislation.
</p>

<a name="51109-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, that there will be nothing available in England which will not be available to older people in Wales, all from the age of 50. The sole difference between the two countries is that there will be a Commission for Older People in Wales that will offer additional support to people aged 60 or more in Wales. In Grand Committee the noble Lord made the point that needs cannot be defined purely by age. He talked of people aged between 50 and 60 who may be experiencing health problems and queried whether there would be some flexibility for the commissioner to operate on their behalf. Of course there will be deserving cases&#151;no doubt along the lines that the noble Lord indicated&#151;that the commissioner will not be able to involve himself in because the person concerned is under 60. But we have to draw a line somewhere and we believe that 60 is a sensible and pragmatic choice.
</p>

<a name="51109-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>A number of the issues that the commissioner uncovers that are problematic for people aged 60 or more and then addresses will have a positive effect on the experiences of people who are slightly younger and share similar difficulties. Standards will be raised for a wider age group than just those of 60 or more. I hope that with this explanation the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, will be able to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_2"></a>The noble Baroness said: We are debating the functions of commons associations. It is important that we get this right if commons associations are to be successful. Amendments Nos. 149, 151 and 162 have been grouped because the same theme runs throughout them, although arguably they could be dealt with in three separate points.
</p>

<a name="51109-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>The functions of an association, as dictated in subsection (3)(a) and (b) and subsequently subsection (4)(a), all seem to override the common law rights of the landowner to manage his own land in accordance with his land ownership rights. I also believe that still to be the case despite the recent amendments tabled by the Government to subsection (3)(a). I recognise that in some cases owners are uninterested or unidentifiable, but where they are interested, I argue, it is a significant issue.
</p>

<a name="51109-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>Subsection (3)(a) effectively hands over the rights to manage vegetation, traditionally a role of the owner&#151;although I accept that some ask commoners to fulfil it&#151;to the association. Will the association, in respect of all the points that I am about to make, have to obtain permission or consult the owner before any decisions are taken or changes made? Although I recognise that there are problems of both under-grazing and over-grazing to address, there could also be conflict between the owner and the association regarding the management of vegetation; for example, for sporting activities, grouse or, more controversially, as we heard at an earlier Committee sitting, a golf course.
</p>

<a name="51109-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>Paragraph (b) provides the power for an association to limit, or to impose conditions on, rights to use the surplus land, which is the absolute property of the owner. The grant or exercise of such power would be, according to various lobby groups,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;a basic infringement of the owner&#039;s rights&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="51109-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>Some have even said that those powers go against the owners&#039; human rights. There is a balance to be struck. For example, in some cases the owner and his tenants exercise more than half the grazing on the common&#151;although it is called surplus, the issue needs to be seen in that context. Any fetter on the rights of the owner to use that surplus or to let it either in the long or short term is a fundamental limitation on the owner&#039;s right of management, which has preserved the ecological value of commons to date.
</p>

<a name="51109-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>We accept that if an association is formed to deal with good agricultural practice upon the common, the rights exercised by the owner, tenants, licensees and so on, should be subject to the same rules as affect the commoners, so that if stock is to be reduced, all should abate pro rata. Equally, if there were to be a reduction, it would be unreasonable to allow the owner to take the benefit of the reduction and then re-let it. This is very much a probing amendment. It would be equally unreasonable for commoners to decide that they would like to enter into a scheme and that the owner&#039;s tenants alone should bear the reduction because their rights arise from the surplus while the commoners take the benefit of payment.
</p>

<a name="51109-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>The National Sheep Association, in its briefing to us on Clause 30 in particular, pointed out that although commons associations are set up specifically for agricultural management of the common, they appear to have limited ability to influence non-agricultural activity, which could compromise sustainable agriculture. That seems an unreasonable omission that should be corrected. I beg to move.

<a name="51109-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I should like to comment briefly on all three of the amendments in the group. Amendment No. 149 addresses the function of commons associations to make,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;rules relating to the agricultural use of the land for which the association is established&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="51109-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>Perhaps I will be corrected if I am wrong, but the effect of the amendment is that a commons association would be unable to make rules about the agricultural use of land on its own common. Whether I am right in that, I am not sure, but that is how I interpret it.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>Amendment No. 151 would remove from commons associations the function of,

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>and thus would protect landowners from rule making. It seems inequitable that commons associations would be subject to rules, but landowners who lease or license grazing rights would not be.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>The final amendment in the group, Amendment No. 162, seeks to leave out subsection (4)(a), which addresses the right of commons associations to use grazing surplus land for which the association has been established. Removing the paragraph would leave surplus land entirely with the owners of the land. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC183"></a>

While I realise that that is traditional in common law, there are a few fundamental issues here which perhaps need further explanation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="51109-32_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b>  We are still discussing the role of commons associations in Part 2. Commons associations are of course a new form of managing body for common land. I would like to go into the history of this, but I heard the Lord Chairman&#039;s strictures when we started our proceedings this afternoon. Let me move forward.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>By the time we entered the Common Market in 1973 and the common agricultural policy was introduced, we saw the hastening decline that led to problems such as over-grazing with which we are still grappling today. We are now dealing with a changed approach to agricultural policy, which in some places is leading to under-grazing on commons. We have all become aware of the special nature conservation value of common land, much of which is now designated as sites of special scientific interest. However, the potential pressures on common land continue to grow as the demand for land increases for recreation purposes, for new development, as sites for wind turbines and as key areas for managing water catchments and so forth. Yet the vast majority of commons have no formal management arrangements. Sometimes grazing activity is influenced by voluntary commons associations which may or may not operate on democratic lines, while sometimes the owner may take a strong interest. But often there is no management system of any kind.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>We are now putting into place the means by which agricultural activity and the key resource, the vegetation, can be effectively managed. We are providing for flexible, modern organisations with statutory powers that can be adapted to the circumstances on any common or set of commons. We are providing for all agricultural interests to be represented in an association, which is by no means the case with some voluntary associations, and for decisions to be made by majority voting mechanisms.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>In order to achieve this, we must confer some functions and powers on these new bodies. Their key functions will relate to the management of agricultural activities, the management of vegetation and the management of rights of common. In order to carry out these activities, commons associations will need to make rules, and Clause 30(3) specifically highlights the making of rules as a vital function of any association. To be effective, the rules must be able to control agricultural activities undertaken by any person on the common, to control the leasing and the licensing of the rights of common and, where necessary, to control the use of rights.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>Commons associations must be given those powers to make rules to promote further improvement in agricultural and vegetation management. That will help to meet the target of getting 95 per cent of sites of special scientific interest into favourable condition by <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC184"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC184</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

2010. Without such rule-making powers, statutory commons associations would be no more effective than any voluntary commoners&#039; association, which are unable to impose their management objectives on anyone. There would be no point in any group of commoners expending time and effort to establish a commons association under the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>I turn to the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness. Amendment No. 149 would effectively stifle a key role of a commons association, which is to make rules about the agricultural use of the land for which it is established. The primary aim of enabling the establishment of commons associations is to allow common rights holders and others engaged in agricultural activity on common land to regulate themselves to benefit from the improved management that will result.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Rules made by an association regarding agriculture, for example, must be binding on all those using the common for agricultural activities, including the owner of the common. Otherwise, the association will be ineffective in achieving its aims of improved management. For example, an association entering into an agri-environment agreement requiring the maintenance of a specific level of grazing over a number of years will need to be able to make rules that regulate the activities of all those grazing on a common. Otherwise, the commoners might regulate their own stock numbers only to see the owner turn out additional animals to take advantage of the temporary surplus in grazing capacity.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>That does not mean that the rights of others in a common can be ignored. I point out that it is by no means inevitable that all the functions listed in government Amendment No. 142 , which we debated last week, will be given to every association. The national authority can determine which functions should be conferred, based on the circumstances of each association. For example, where it is not appropriate for a commons association to have a rule-making power on management of vegetation, it need not be given one.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>A number of safeguards are also built into the rule-making procedures of a commons association. First, rules will be made by majority voting and local interests may propose at the establishment order stage the size of the majority required for the adoption of any particular rule or class of rules. Secondly, any rule creating a criminal offence will require approval by the Secretary of State. Thirdly, the national authority may revoke any rule made by an association if it is deficient or harmful in some way. Finally, the Secretary of State may impose more rigorous rule-making procedures in the establishment order if there are good reasons for that.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>The aim of rule-making for a commons association is to control and regulate the exercise of rights on a common. So, for example, it may control the stocking densities of livestock on a common, or determine the periods when animals must be cleared from the common. Those rules must therefore apply to all those using the common for such purposes, including <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC185"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC185</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

landowners and other interests, such as sporting interests. I emphasise that that does not mean that associations can impose arbitrary rules that require actions causing harm to the interests of others. Rules will be made within the limited framework imposed by the national authority. Making rules binding on all those involved in management of vegetation and agricultural activities on a common is an essential function for any commons association that hopes to improve the management of a common. We believe that sufficient safeguards are built into the rule-making procedures to protect minority interests within an association and the broader public interests in the common that may be affected by any rules adopted.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Amendment No. 151 leaves out any reference to the function of making rules relating to leasing and licensing of rights of common. The list of functions in subsection (3) is only illustrative of the sort of functions that can be given to an association, so the removal of any specific item from the list would not necessarily prevent an association from being given such a function if the national authority felt that it was necessary for the effective operation of the association. A prime function of commons associations will be to manage grazing. For that management to be effective, the association must be able to make rules about leasing and licensing of rights of commons.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>On some commons, inactive rights holders lease out their rights either to commoners on the same common or to outsiders who seek additional grazing. It is important for an association to be able to manage this activity in order to control both the level of grazing and the hefting practices that exist on a common.
<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="51109-32_time0"></a><h5>3.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="51109-32_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Mention has been made of the impact of a rule on the owner&#039;s use of his surplus grazing. I should stress that this rule-making power extends only to making rules about rights of common and not to other grazing rights, such as the owner&#039;s surplus grazing. We do not see it as necessary or appropriate for the commons association to interfere in the licensing of the owner&#039;s surplus, although, as I have said, the association may well wish to regulate the use of the surplus if, for example, there is an over-grazing problem on the common. I think that that makes sense.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Amendment No. 162 would remove the provision which enables rules made by a commons association to have the effect of limiting or imposing conditions on the exercise of rights of common and the rights to use surplus grazing on a common. These powers are fundamental to the ability of a commons association effectively to manage grazing on a common. An association will need to be able to make rules capable of controlling grazing by any person on a common, whether they are a commoner, an owner, a tenant of the owner or a licensee.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Subsection (4)(a) certainly restricts the powers of the soil owner to use the surplus grazing as he sees fit. I should point out that our Amendment No. 163, which we shall come to shortly, clarifies the situation with respect to management of surplus grazing. That <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC186"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC186</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

amendment makes clear that the rules made by a commons association may limit or impose conditions on the exercise of rights, not the rights themselves, to use the surplus grazing, just as they will apply to the exercise of commons rights, too&#151;not the rights, but the exercise of those common rights. But the rules will not be able to control or influence the management of the surplus by the owner in terms of his ability to lease or to let as he wishes. That is one of the issues that the noble Baroness was concerned about.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Identifying whether there is a surplus on the common is a matter more of art than science. We certainly believe that it is possible that grazing numbers on a common may need to be reduced, even though the owner is grazing the surplus. Some commons which have been overgrazed need dramatic, if temporary, reductions in grazing numbers to enable recovery of the vegetation and would wish to ensure that associations are empowered to reduce both the commoners&#039; and the owner&#039;s grazing activity for such a reason.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>That is all I wish to say in reply to these probing amendments tabled by the noble Baroness. Perhaps I may also refer to our new consent clause&#151;Amendment No. 182A&#151;which I hope we will reach shortly, if I do not speak at such length. That will require a landowner&#039;s consent for any activity taken on the land where no rights of common exist to do that without consent. We shall hear more about that later.
</p>

<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="51109-33_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I thank the Minister for that comprehensive reply. When we reach my own Amendment No. 164A, I shall feel that he has already given me an encouraging response&#151;but perhaps we should wait until that time for a definitive response.
</p>

<a name="51109-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Returning to the amendments spoken to by my noble friend Lady Byford, I did not think that there were problems here, but having listened carefully to the Minister, I have a feeling that one or two difficulties could arise out of his answer. I have spent a great deal of the past 30 years trying to balance the grazing rights on commons between shooting interests, conservation interests and farming interests. It is not always an easy task, but by and large I would like to think that I was successful. But there is no getting away from the fact that what I or English Nature, or another individual, may regard as being a correct grazing level may not be the same as that which a farmer would agree to.
</p>

<a name="51109-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>So if I have spent many years trying to negotiate a sensible grazing outcome on a common and a commons association is then formed, and that common association decides that it wishes to increase the grazing on the common or on certain parts of it, much of the effort that I and, perhaps, English Nature have made will be undermined. This seems to me to be quite wrong.
</p>

<a name="51109-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>I acknowledge that most commons associations will be formed for the purposes of trying to engage in an agri-environment scheme. If that is the case, clearly English Nature&#151;or Natural England, as it will be by then&#151;will act as the referee. It would not allow a commons association to engage in a scheme in the first <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC187"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC187</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

place if there was not going to be a sensible level of grazing. But in the absence of an agri-environment scheme, which is not a compulsory part of the formation of a commons association, if that association decided that it wished to up the grazing it could have a detrimental effect on a common&#039;s nature conservation value or, indeed, on its value to the owner of a grouse shoot, where heather is clearly important. If the heather was to be debilitated by increased grazing, such interests would begin to suffer.
</p>

<a name="51109-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>From what the Minister said, I have a feeling that we may have some difficulties, which my noble friend Lady Byford has quite rightly raised.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="51109-33_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Tyler: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for taking a robust attitude towards these amendments. My fear is perhaps the opposite of that of the noble Earl, Lord Peel, because the balance to which he referred could become an imbalance if these amendments were carried. They would effectively emasculate the role of the commons associations.
</p>

<a name="51109-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>I admit that I do not have great experience of the situation throughout the whole country, but the commons associations of which I am aware&#151;Cornwall and south-west England&#151;would feel betrayed if they did not have these powers in place on the face of the Bill. They would feel it was driving a cart and horse, if that is the right expression&#151;or perhaps a 4x4&#151;through the whole purpose of the Bill if the commons associations were not given these responsibilities. As the Minister said, it is not compulsory for all associations to have these explicit powers, but to have them removed in the way suggested by the amendments would be extremely unfortunate.
</p>

<a name="51109-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>As the noble Earl said, the majority of commons associations will seek agri-environmental schemes. That was certainly the case with the Bodmin Moor commoners when I, with colleagues in the other place, sought to bring forward a Bill to ensure that we had orderly management of the commons on Bodmin Moor. It is certainly the case with commoners within a national park area, and I have already referred in Committee to Dartmoor. Given that there will be very careful monitoring&#151;&quot;policing&quot;, perhaps, is the right word&#151;by the appropriate national bodies to ensure that an excessive power is not being used, that is the best safeguard we can expect.
</p>

<a name="51109-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>My fear is that if we were to give too little influence, responsibility and power to the new associations we would be back where we started, with minority users&#151;or even individual rogue users&#151;effectively cocking a snook at the new associations as a worthless new invention without any influence or power to ensure that the commons are being managed in the interests of all. I hope the Minister&#039;s explanation and robust defence will satisfy the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, that this is not an unnecessary power but one which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC188"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC188</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

will be treated flexibly. I very much hope the amendments will not be pursued, either now or in the future.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="51109-33_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Before the noble Baroness replies, I have spoken at some length on these issues and, as the noble Earl suggested, that may suffice to shorten what I have to say on later amendments. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, that we expect statutory commons associations to seek agri-environment agreements to underwrite a reduction in grazing activity, not the increase feared by the noble Earl. I can reassure him to some extent that if a statutory commons association wishes to increase grazing levels above those covered by the right of common, the owner of the land must consent to it. We shall come to the issue of consent in government Amendment No. 182A, which is a rewriting of a part of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="51109-33_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I am very grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in this debate, which has been slightly longer than I thought it would be. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, that these are probing amendments, and it is important to have had this debate on them. As I said at the beginning, if we do not get it right for the commons associations, they will fail, and all of us here wish them to succeed. Even if we move other amendments that cause alarm bells to ring, the noble Lord should not always assume that we necessarily want to force them through, rather that we seek clarification.
</p>

<a name="51109-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for his very long response. As the proceedings continue, we shall try to shorten our contributions, otherwise we shall be covering the same ground twice. The noble Lord highlighted the six functions in paragraphs (a) to (g) but then said that the list was only illustrative. That made me even more nervous, because it makes me wonder what else will be added, in a flexible way, over the years, to suit commoners. But I shall not go down that road today.
</p>

<a name="51109-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>We shall come to the clarifying of &quot;surplus&quot; later; I have no difficulty with that. Given what other Members of the Committee have said, I, too, assume and hope that the graziers and all who have commoners&#039; rights will apply for agri-environment schemes. That is the whole purpose of setting them up. The Minister said very clearly that it will be done according to majority voting. I assume that he means more than 50 per cent will be the majority. We discussed this earlier and, unless I am wrong, I have to assume that out of 24 people, 13, say, would be enough to approve the scheme going through. We can return to this at another stage; I am quite happy about it.
</p>

<p><a name="st_11"></a>The noble Baroness said: Government Amendment No. 150 expands the functions which can be given to an association to include the making of rules on agricultural activities, the management of vegetation and the exercise of rights of common. This is to make it consistent with the list of functions which can be given to an association under government Amendment No. 142. The list of functions in subsection (3) illustrates the functions, as my noble friend has just said, that can be given to an association. It is not intended to be, nor should it be, comprehensive.
</p>

<a name="51109-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>Amendment No. 142 enables associations to be given functions related to the management of agricultural activities, vegetation and types of common. Subsection (3) highlights that one function will be the making of rules relating to these three broad areas of activity. As my noble friend said, rule-making is an essential function of a commons association. To improve management of the common, an association must be able to make rules binding on all those using the common for agricultural activity. Associations will be given functions relevant only to the reasons for which they are established. I hope that that reassures the noble Baroness. Rules may be made only in relation to the functions given to an association. And, as has just been confirmed, rules will be made by majority voting, numerically, in an association. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>Once we get into the management of vegetation, we get in to all kinds of possibilities. Therefore, my noble friend is proposing not merely &quot;agricultural use&quot; but also &quot;agricultural activities&quot;, whatever they may be. It is a very important amendment.

<a name="51109-34_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Williams, makes an important point. I want to focus on the word &quot;vegetation&quot;. The agricultural activities associated with vegetation mean that a balance must be struck in its management. That is different from what is currently in the Bill. The provision also impinges on the issues mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Peel, when achieving the right level of management in certain circumstances.

<a name="51109-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>I trust that we will secure a balance which will not go against agricultural interests, or overrule them, and that we reach a broad consensus on how the best vegetation management is secured in certain circumstances.

<a name="51109-34_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   The kind of activities we have in mind in &quot;agricultural activities&quot;, other than grazing, referred to by my noble friend Lord Williams, are grouse rearing, mentioned in relation to Amendment No. 149 by the noble Earl, Lord Peel. Sheep hefting would be another example of an agricultural activity. I feel as though I am about to be trapped into saying, &quot;It means what we say it means&quot;. It means what it says.

<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="51109-34_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Inglewood: </b>   Is the noble Baroness saying that shooting and shooting interests are contained within the definition of &quot;agriculture&quot; for the purposes of this Bill? That is an interesting point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="51109-34_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   No, my understanding is that grouse rearing would be included but shooting would not.

<a name="51109-34_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   Yes, but we are not talking about killing sheep; we are talking about hefting sheep. It is the activity on the land and not some other result at the end of the process; for example, shooting. I hope that I have understood the point. There seems to be a little concern, so I shall write to Members of the Committee with a more comprehensive answer if they feel that it would be helpful.

&quot;(   )   claiming entitlements to environmental and other payments available from local, regional, national or European bodies;&quot;

<p><a name="st_21"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 152 refers to the power of commons associations to claim entitlement. We have discussed their ability to claim money under agri-environment schemes, but I was prompted to table this probing amendment as a result of guidance published by the Rural Payments Agency. It was written before the Bill was published and I am sure that it will be reissued in the light of it.
</p>

<a name="51109-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>The guidance states,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;exceptionally a commons association may be able to establish a claim against entitlements on common land&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>There is then a series of conditions which a commons association must fulfil and I believe that they would do so under the Bill. However, I want the Minister&#039;s reassurance that the guidance will be written the other way round; that normally, a commons association will be able to claim such payments if its members decide <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC191"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC191</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to claim them as a whole body rather than individually. That will make agreement over the management of the common, for example, potentially much easier.
</p>

<a name="51109-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>As it stands, if a member of the commons association wants to claim a single farm payment and includes in that his part of the commons right, the single farm payment can be withheld if Defra, presumably having been advised by English Nature, believes that it is excessive&#151;English Nature saying that he has too many animals on the common. I understand from commoners that the single farm payment can be withheld for the whole of their farm because they are not meeting the cross-compliance rules. The previous debate was interesting, but the single farm payment scheme has overtaken some of the arguments on over-grazing because Defra has the power to withhold payments from the whole farm. Individual members have found it hard to come to terms with the fact that they can lose the payment for their entire farm because the common is not being managed in a way that satisfies Defra. Individual members often feel that they do not have the power to deal with that, whereas the commons association dealing with the whole may be a much easier route. Indeed, that is the hope of those to whom I have spoken and the commons associations will need the power to make it work.
</p>

<a name="51109-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>I want to speak also to my Amendment No. 160, which enables a commons association to form a trading arm. I hope that the Government will accept it in some form. The thought behind it is that more local lamb, in particular, can be satisfactorily marketed under the name of the area in which it is raised; for example, salt marsh lamb or Dartmoor lamb. It would therefore be useful for the commons association to be able to apply for a designated area mark under which to market the produce of those who have grazing rights on the common and to be able to exploit the link between the locality and the meat that comes from it.
</p>

<a name="51109-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>Defra has been encouraging such an approach and it fits in well with the sustainable food and farming agenda. I therefore hope that the Government will look favourably on the amendment and I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="51109-34_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Williams of Elvel: </b>   I support Amendment No. 152. It is clear that a number of commons associations will apply for Tir Gofal, a considerable amount of money which could come into commons associations. I want to speak, first, to the second half of my Amendment No. 161 on,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;making rules for the distribution of surplus finds accruing to the common land as a result of grants for sustainable agriculture&quot;.</p>

<a name="51109-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>A commons association is a group of people with different interests. When such schemes are approved for a commons association, it seems appropriate for the association to decide who actually gets the money. These are important schemes and a lot of money is involved. It must be right for members of the commons association at least to have the power to determine, along with their colleagues, who is in receipt of these monies.

</p>

<a name="51109-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>I return to the first part of my Amendment No. 161. This raises an enormous problem which, I am afraid, is present throughout common land in Wales and possibly elsewhere. I recognise that there are provisions in the Road Traffic Act, as amended by the CROW Act. Nevertheless, in Radnor there are only two police vehicles for the whole county, and there is no way that the provisions of the Road Traffic Act, as amended by the CROW Act, can possibly be enforced.
</p>

<a name="51109-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>On the other hand, some commoners like the idea of having rallies across their common, and we must recognise that. Therefore, there must be some sort of balance, and it seems to me that a balance can be struck only by introducing rules made by the commons association. If the commons association wants a motorbike rally, or whatever, across their common, they will need a licence from the local authority, but they must make the rules. If they want to protect their vegetation from unauthorised motor vehicle access, they should have the right to do so. Now that protection of vegetation has been introduced into the Bill by my noble friend, that is a very important point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="51109-34_spnew9"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   Perhaps I may follow up on what the noble Lord, Lord Williams, introduced and also speak to our Amendment No. 159. As I understand it, in most cases commons are owned but they are subject to the rights of the commoners and, now, to access under the CROW Act. So the owners presumably have some say over questions of access. At the same time, in an earlier amendment we dealt with the matter of commons associations having powers to control agricultural activities.
</p>

<a name="51109-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Amendment No. 159 relates to controlling access to the land by persons or animals who have a right of common, and it does not merely refer to external people. There is one point of which I am not entirely sure. If a farm or agricultural unit has a right of common, that does not necessarily mean that only the owner can go on to the common; presumably he can send a stockman or a variety of people to whom he has given permission. Following on from the thoughts of the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, if the owner or his colleagues on the common decided that they would like to have a quad bike competition, or something similar, perhaps they could give permission to all the people involved to have access to the common. So the kind of body that the Government are trying to set up would probably in be a better position if it was able to control the access of people who have rights of common.
</p>

<a name="51109-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>Although the Government have, through Amendment No. 157, removed the requirement to manage heather, gorse, grass and other vegetation, they have introduced the concept of management of vegetation by Amendments Nos. 142 and 150. In the circumstances, it seems unreasonable not to give the association a further function of controlling access, if it should prove necessary, by those who have rights of common. It should be possible, for example, to close the common for a couple of weeks under the terms of the CROW Act to carry out management activities, such as bracken eradication. A serious programme <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC193"></a>

would require that no one or any animal should traverse the land under treatment until it was safe to do so. A commons association should have the power to ban both members of the public and commoners and to round up and remove horses, ponies or sheep, even if they belong to the commoners. We know about the problems of bracken. A lot of bracken has spread wildly in many areas and strong remedial action will be required in the near future. Another issue, which none of us can foresee, may arise in future. If climate change produces more pronounced excesses, commoners may have other things with which to deal.

<a name="51109-35_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I shall speak to Amendment No. 154, the second amendment listed in this group. It relates to subsection (3)(e) and concerns removing unlawful boundaries and other encroachments. It would be helpful if &quot;unlawful boundaries&quot; were defined by the appropriate national authority in regulations.
</p>

<a name="51109-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that boundaries are properly defined by the Secretary of State and the Minister in the National Assembly for Wales, that those boundaries are agreed with the specific commons associations and, indeed, with owners, who have to maintain and establish those boundaries. That would tighten things up considerably where there may be disagreement about whether a boundary was unlawful. So I hope that the amendment is helpful in that respect.

<a name="51109-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>Amendment No. 161 should mean that commons associations and owners receive a fair share of the grant aid. It is extremely constructive. On the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, about the number of police cars in Radnorshire, without diverting the Committee&#039;s attention too much, I suspect that if we have an all-Wales police service, we will have only one.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="51109-35_spnew1"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I shall speak briefly to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, because it gives me a chance to have a whinge. I have a great deal of sympathy with what the noble Lord said and see no problem with the commons association getting involved with organised clubs. Indeed, on the commons that I own and manage, twice a year we have a rally. It is all organised by a club. It works extremely well. Everyone enjoys themselves, there are no environmental problems and everyone is happy. The difficulty is with those who come who are not invited and are not members of clubs. With the greatest will in the world, the commons association and the owner can set what rules they like, but they will not stop those people unless the police start taking greater action than they are at present. That is becoming an ever-increasing problem.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="51109-35_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Williams of Elvel: </b>   I must seriously disagree with the noble Earl about what would happen if a commons association, properly formed, set down rules. Most of what we call the cowboy bikes come from their neighbours. They do not come from <br>&nbsp;<br>

Birmingham, they come up from Llandrindod Wells. If the commoners set out to monitor that, that will have an enormous effect. I disagree: it is not a police problem in our part of the country; it is a neighbourhood problem.
</p>

<a name="51109-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>I am sorry to expand on this, but we had a lot of problems in Gilwern Hill with bikers coming up from Birmingham. It was a marvellous drive across big country for them. I took the initiative and got in touch with the mid-Wales bikers&#039; association, or whatever, and said, &quot;Look, if you go on like this, I will have to get the police, at enormous expense, to monitor it&quot;. Mr Parker, who was then the secretary of the mid-Wales bikers Association said, &quot;Leave it with me&quot;, and we have not had a bike on the common for the past 10 years. So monitoring by those involved, rather than police action, is the right way forward.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="51109-35_spnew3"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   As the owner of a common, I have had similar conversations with various clubs and they have assured me that they have informed their members that anyone who is contravening the law as it stands will not be welcome. The difficulty is that those individuals are not members of clubs at all and come up willy-nilly when they feel like it. The rules are there; the rules are in place. Those people are wantonly breaking the law. I am sorry to disagree with the noble Lord, but it is a police matter and the police are simply not dealing with it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="51109-35_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I have three amendments in this group: Amendments Nos. 158, 161A and 164, which return to the management of vegetation. Government Amendment No. 157 would delete the paragraph that defines specifically the management of heather, gorse, grass and other vegetation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="51109-35_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Perhaps the noble Lord will forgive me if I explain. That is because of the changes introduced by government Amendment No. 142.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="51109-35_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   As the Minister said, that is to be replaced with the catch-all phrase of &quot;vegetation&quot;. That is the same catch-all phrase that appears in the draft statutory instrument for the rules of West Barsetshire&#151;on which there is an Ambridge Common. The Government seem to be mixed up with their fictional names, with Ambridge in Barsetshire, not Borsetshire. I considered tabling an amendment on that, but I thought that we should not waste time.
</p>

<a name="51109-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>I shall move two amendments to a paragraph which the Government intend to remove and another that adds something more specific. So these are probing amendments in relation to certain types of undesirable vegetation. Regarding Amendment No. 161A, Section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 makes it a criminal offence to plant or allow the growing of a number of plants listed in Schedule 9, of which the one that we know best and hate most is Japanese knotweed, which frequently provokes discussion in your Lordships&#039; House. Does the Minister believe that commons associations more specifically should be made to take action against those particularly obnoxious and invasive weeds?
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC195"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC195</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51109-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>The other two Amendments Nos. 158 and 164 refer to bracken, which is not legally regarded as being in the same category as Japanese knotweed, but nevertheless is a huge and growing problem, particularly in upland areas and commons. It spreads rapidly; the rhizomes churn up the subsoil and the soil; it suppresses other vegetation and, therefore, reduces biodiversity. There are a number of reasons why it is spreading, but one is that there is less trampling by those animals which would most effectively trample it, such as pigs and cattle. In many places bracken is not being effectively controlled. People just shrug their shoulders and say, &quot;Yes, it&#039;s spreading&quot;. It harbours ticks which carry diseases such as louping-ill and Lyme disease and is said to be carcinogenic. It is a disaster for recreational use of the countryside and spoils it for quiet uses such as walking.
</p>

<a name="51109-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>One of my most horrific experiences in the countryside was on the North Yorkshire Moors&#151;in Farndale, I think&#151;when I was trapped in a thick, wet fog and decided to get back down to the valley. I was ploughing down through bracken that was taller than me. I was soaked through and it was horrible. None of us want bracken. It endangers archaeology, because it disturbs the subsoil and is difficult to control. There are machines such as bracken bruisers and crushers, but you really have to keep at it. There is no point clearing it once; you must clear it time and time again to get rid of it. The kind of animals that will trample it and help to keep it under control are often not there nowadays. Indeed, selective sheep grazing can sometimes help the spread of bracken.
</p>

<a name="51109-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>The Open Spaces Society suggests that we need a coalition of all sorts of groups&#151;landowners, graziers, animal welfare groups, nature conservation groups, recreational users, archaeologists and others to promote solutions. My amendment is more modest, but it is an opportunity to ask the Government what is their overall view on bracken. The Minister may be unable to comment today in great detail. However, do the Government believe that we need a strategy across the country to tackle this weed, which is not quite as pernicious as other weeds, but is none the less invasive and unpleasant, but, if under-grazing is going to be the order of the day, will probably spread even further?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="51109-35_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Tyler: </b>   I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this group of amendments&#151;which are, as the noble Baroness said, related to an important part of the Bill. It is tempting to speak to every one of them, but I wish to concentrate on one or two.
</p>

<a name="51109-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>First, Amendment No. 159, to which the noble Duke has spoken, leaves me in a quandary. I think I understand its purpose&#151;indeed, it reflects a concern I expressed at the previous sitting of the Committee about the role of the commons associations in relation to some important issues of access&#151;but I do not know what animals have rights of access. An &quot;animal&quot; with a right of access would be a new creature. If the amendment is referring to persons who have rights of access and are accompanied by animals&#151;I gave the <br>&nbsp;<br>

example of dogs at the previous sitting&#151;it is an issue of considerable importance. I hope the Minister will respond to that.
</p>

<a name="51109-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Amendment No. 161B, which is also in this group, has been tabled by my noble friends Lord Livsey and Baroness Miller. There is a mistake in the printed version of the amendment&#151;I expect the Minister is aware of it&#151;in that it should read,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;Page 16, line 25&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>The amendment has been tabled in an attempt to tease out the role of the new associations as consultees on extremely important issues. The Committee will recall that there has been considerable discussion about this issue and that at our last sitting the Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;Commons owners can apply under CROW for restrictions where necessary and it would not be the intention not to allow commons associations to be consulted&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 2/11/05; col. GC 125.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>This is less than clear. The Minister has a considerable reputation for clarity and I hope that he will be able to improve on that double negative, which is far from satisfactory.
</p>

<a name="51109-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>The same applied to further discussions we had at that sitting about the natural habitat. Again, we surely need to spell out in words of few syllables precisely what the role of the associations will be when important issues such as access under the CROW Act, biodiversity and the natural environment and its protection arise in the future. As has been said more than once, both at Second Reading and in Grand Committee, we hope that the Bill, when enacted, will last for a long time. No doubt there will be other changes in legislation during the period which will touch on these important aspects, and it surely would be quite ridiculous if, having by statute given new form and new substance to commons associations, we did not state very specifically that they must be consulted on such issues. They may not wish to be consulted in all circumstances&#151;they may not wish to take up the invitation&#151;but effectively to neglect that right and responsibility would be entirely wrong. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure the Committee on those points.

<a name="51109-36_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I support the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, about bracken. I declare an interest as, to the best of my knowledge, I am the only person in the country who is involved in the Countryside Stewardship Scheme expressly to get rid of bracken. So I have some first hand experience in dealing with this pernicious weed. It is prodigiously expensive to deal with.

Gorse is included in the Bill, and I should have thought that bracken was much more important. The way that bracken is increasing, even with the older stocking rates, is pretty appalling. It will become a very serious problem in the years ahead.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="51109-36_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Williams of Elvel: </b>   The problem is that on Gilwern Hill farmers have a right to take bracken out for the sheep for the winter. When the sheep go indoors into the barns, you see tractors coming across even now, apart from when it rains. So I am all in favour of some idea of what that might mean and what the commons association might do, but bracken has played a very important part in upland farming in Wales.

<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="51109-36_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   When I was a farming student, new chemicals were on trial to get rid of bracken, and they did. That was a long time ago. My noble friend Lord Greaves mentioned Japanese knotweed. I am a keen fisherman, and some common land abuts quite a lot of streams and rivers. Knotweed is a massive problem along riverbanks; it is spread by the flow of the river downstream. It is a plant that is designed to multiply rapidly. Something has to be done about it because in some places the whole river system will be completely stopped up.

</p>

<a name="51109-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Amendment No. 152, moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, would enable the commons association to be granted the function of claiming entitlements to environmental and other payments from organisations and bodies from the local to the European level. Amendment No. 160 would include in the illustrative list of functions that can be given to a commons association the ability to form a trading arm. Presumably that could be to allow an association to market produce from the common which may assist in supporting agricultural activity on the common.
</p>

<a name="51109-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>These two amendments add extra activities to the illustrative list of functions that can be given to an association in subsection (3). In our view, these two forms of activity are better regarded as the type of action which a commons association might be able to undertake under its ancillary powers in Clause 31. It is a slightly technical point, particularly as these are probing amendments, as the noble Baroness said, rather than being additional core functions of an association, which is where Clause 30 comes in. Core functions tend to relate directly to management of the land, where ancillary powers are actions that facilitate&#151;that is the crucial word for Clause 31&#151;the operation of an association or are conducive to its aims.
</p>

<a name="51109-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Clause 31 allows an association to undertake a wide range of activities that will facilitate it in carrying out its functions. They include activities that we will come to, such as raising money and employing staff. The creation of a trading arm, or distributing money from an agri-environment scheme, might well be activities conducive to the functions of an association. If they are, they can be undertaken under Clause 31. Clearly, we do not need to add this to Clause 30. Therefore, both the items covered in the two amendments tabled by the noble Baroness are possibilities for Clause 31, depending on what the statutory commons associations decide they want to do.
</p>

<a name="51109-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Amendment No. 154 would require the national authority to make regulations defining the types of unlawful boundaries and encroachments which a commons association may be given power to remove. Part 3, which replaces Section 194 of the Law of Property Act 1925&#151;which, perhaps more in hope than expectation, we will come to soon today&#151;will make clear the types of works which cannot be carried out on common land without the consent of the national authority. This will include the erection of fencing or other boundaries which have the effect of preventing or impeding access to or over common land. In addition, some local Acts or provisional order confirmation Acts contain prohibitions on works on particular commons. In this clause, what we mean by &quot;unlawful boundaries&quot; are fences and other boundaries which have been erected in breach of statutory provisions. By &quot;unlawful encroachments&quot; we mean, for example, the situation where an owner of land adjoining a common has extended his garden on to the common without any right to do so.

<a name="51109-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>We believe that this provision is sufficiently clear and does not need any further explanation in regulations. We do not want to increase the regulation-making powers of the national authorities any more than is necessary.
</p>

<a name="51109-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked about the single farm payments. Her point applies to any farmer who does not comply with the cross-compliance regulations&#151;whether they be farmers on common land or on other land. She also talked about marketing produce under local labels. I want to encourage very much what she said on that. I entirely agree with her. It is just the sort of initiative and outcome to which statutory commons associations might rightly aspire. Of course, funding is being provided by the ERDP for just such marketing initiatives.
</p>

<a name="51109-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>Amendment No. 161B includes in the illustrative list of functions that of acting as a consultee on issues related to rights of access and nature conservation. We do not believe that commons associations should be in the business of providing advice on nature conservation or access issues. Nature conservation is the province of Natural England and the Countryside Council for Wales. For the most part, commons associations will be made up of common rights holders, landowners and holders of other rights in common land such as sporting rights. They are being established to manage agricultural activities, vegetation and common rights, not to manage access. We do not think they are suitable bodies for consultation on access issues as they will not have the necessary skills and expertise which one would expect a consultee to have on such issues. We would expect that, once an association is established, other bodies will naturally want to engage with it on a variety of issues affecting common land, as it will represent the views of some of the key interests in the common. That does not preclude an association from voluntarily responding on such issues, as an association does not require a specific function on the face of the Bill&#151;or even in its establishment order&#151;to engage in such discussions.
</p>

<a name="51109-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>We believed that Amendment No. 161A was a reference to Section 13 rather than Section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, which makes it an offence for any person to damage, remove or sell any plant listed in Schedule 8 to the Act. However, I am told that, whichever one it was, my answer would be the same. If that person can show that the action was an incidental result of a lawful operation and could not reasonably have been avoided, no offence is committed. A commons association must comply with the requirements of all statutory regimes that affect its activities or the land over which it operates. Thus, Sections 13 and 14 of the Act already apply to them, and we do not think that there is need to refer to it in the Bill.

<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="51109-37_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Government Amendment No. 142 allows an association to be given functions related to the management of vegetation. Thus, we see no need to include bracken in the illustrative list of functions in subsection (3). Amendment No. 164 goes further and allows an association to make rules that may require a certain area of bracken to be cleared from a common each year. That might place an intolerable burden on members of an association, which might involve significant cost. Examples of the cost are the purchase of a bracken-crusher&#151;I have never seen such an implement but the noble Duke obviously has&#151;labour to operate machinery and disposal of the cleared vegetation. There would be nothing to prevent an association deciding to clear certain areas and control the growth of bracken if it were given functions relating to the management of vegetation. However, that decision must be made locally through majority voting where the other costs and implications are made clear. We do not want to impose that burden.

<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="51109-37_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Chorley: </b>   I do not understand why subsection (3) includes gorse and not bracken, which is a far more significant problem. Why not leave out gorse?

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>Amendment No. 159, to which the noble Duke spoke, includes in the illustrative list of functions given to a commons association the power to control access of common rights holders and their animals to a common. That is not necessary, as subsection (3)(a) and subsection (1) as amended by government Amendment No. 142 would allow commons associations to be given a function of making rules relating to the management of agricultural activities. Limiting periods when rights-holders can de-pasture their animals on a common will be a key management tool for any association, so we do not see the need to express that as a separate function in the Bill.

<a name="51109-37_spnew7"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   The amendment is very specifically drawn. It is not to do with access for the purpose of agricultural activities but would cover cases where commoners decided off their own bat to flood the place with people.

<a name="51109-37_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I think that it would be best if I wrote to the noble Duke on what his amendment suggests.
</p>

<a name="51109-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>Amendment No. 161 includes in the list of functions that can be given to a commons association the power, first, to make rules to protect agricultural activities from damage by motor vehicles, and, secondly, to make rules for the distribution of funds that may go to an association for grants for sustainable agriculture.
</p>

<a name="51109-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>We believe that making rules to protect agricultural activities from damage by motor vehicles goes beyond the functions that can be given to a commons association. We are aware&#151;and it was pointed out at Second Reading of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill on Monday&#151;of the problems of illegal motorcycles and four-wheel drive use on commons and the damage that can be caused by such activity. Existing laws make those activities illegal on common land, and it is the role of the police to enforce them. For example, under Section 34 of the Road Traffic Act 1984, it is an offence to drive a vehicle on common land without lawful authority. Section 193 of the Law of Property Act 1925 relates to the driving of vehicles on urban and dedicated commons without lawful authority.
</p>

<a name="51109-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>Such motor activities are not related to the management of agriculture, vegetation or common rights and so we do not think that such a function can, or should, be given to an association. It is not appropriate for an association to take that sort of enforcement action under other legislation. With no disrespect to them, members of the association may not have the skills or training to engage in such enforcement activities, and potential problems related to health and safety would be likely to arise were they to try. Where damage is being caused by motor vehicles, a commons association will undoubtedly require the assistance of the police, and that can be done under existing legislation.
</p>

<a name="51109-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>We do not think it appropriate for there to be rules to regulate non-agricultural activities such as rallies. They could impose criminal sanctions on those who have no connection with the management of the common and no say in the making of any such rules. We accept, and regret, that existing laws on vehicle use on commons are being broken, but we do not think that making similar laws through rules is likely to be any more effective. Perhaps we need to look to the police to deal with the matter.

<a name="51109-37_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Williams of Elvel: </b>   I am grateful to my noble friend for giving way. I find his response unsatisfactory.

So it is fine if the owner decides that he wants a rally and <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51109-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>I can only speak for Gilwern Hill. The 28 commoners do not like bikes and four-by-fours being driven across the common but they are frightened at the idea of ringing up the Llandrindod Wells police station and getting the two cars from Newtown, 30 miles away, by which time everyone would have left the common. I hope that my noble friend will listen very carefully to what I am saying in this amendment: if the commons association, together with the owner, had certain rules, the owners would ensure that, at least in part, their livelihood&#151;agricultural activity&#151;was protected.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="51109-37_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   How are the commoners or the landowners expected to enforce any rules there might be? The law is already on their side. If they are wise, they will probably not seek to enforce the law; rather, they will call the local constabulary, even if it is 30 miles away, to enforce the criminal law, which is being breached.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="51109-37_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Williams of Elvel: </b>   The commoners on Gilwern Hill know pretty well everyone around Llandrindod Wells, Builth Wells or wherever. They know the people driving up to the common and are perfectly capable of saying, &quot;We don&#039;t want you here&quot;, but they will not do so at the moment. They say, &quot;Actually, they are our cousins&quot;. That could only be done formally. It is a question not of employing a special constable or warden but of getting across the message that commoners do not want such unauthorised access to the land on which they have common rights, and that it is part of their livelihood.

<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="51109-37_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Inglewood: </b>   I have some sympathy with the predicament of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, and his neighbours. Is not the problem that, so long as motor vehicles on the common do not directly affect commoners&#039; exercise of their common rights, they have no standing <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> this&#151;let us use a neutral word&#151;&quot;invasion&quot; by others from outside? Given the world in which we are now living, it must be asked whether it is in the best interests of all concerned that that state of affairs and relationship should continue.

<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="51109-37_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I support the noble Lord, Lord Williams. I can cite a case in which 1,500 people and 500 vehicles illegally used a common, resulting in a police cost of &#163;350,000 to eject them over a period of two weeks. The commoners could not leave their houses, and some family members who had diversified could not get to work. It can be an enormous problem. That rave was an illegal invasion. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, referred to people from the locality coming on to a common for just a short period. Commons associations have to pick up the pieces. Enormous damage can be done in a very short time. Surely they should have some rights to resolve those problems.
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="51109-37_spnew14"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   Further to what the noble Lord, Lord Williams, said, it would be inconceivable that the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="51109-38_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   It comes back to the question of enforcement. It cannot be a duty or expectation that commoners or owners will enforce the law. That is not what they are there to do. In the example of the rave with 1,500 people on the common, it is simply not realistic to think that a statutory commons association could deal with such an invasion. That must be a matter for the police, who have powers to deal with such events.
</p>

<a name="51109-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>I remind the Committee that anyone can prosecute for offences regarding vehicles on common land because <i>prima facie</i> a criminal offence has been committed. The statutory commons association could do so under existing law; it does not need new rules to do that. If the owner holds an event on the common that interferes with rights of common, the statutory commons association may be able to take action to stop it through the courts&#151;through the civil courts, if need by, by way of injunction, to ensure that it does not happen again, or perhaps through other remedies. We are not persuaded that it would be right to give powers to the commons associations beyond those which already exist in the criminal law. We have dealt with the issue for the moment but we may return to it.


</p>

<a name="51109-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>I turn to the second part of Amendment No. 161, to which the noble Lord spoke. There is no need for a particular power, but in principle we do not object to what he suggested. We believe that it can be achieved under Clause 31, which concerns ancillary powers, as I said earlier when I spoke to amendments moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller.
</p>

<a name="51109-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>I almost forgot about government Amendment No. 157. This amendment removes a reference to managing vegetation from the illustrative list of functions in subsection (3). Managing vegetation was included in that list to illustrate that an association could manage the vegetation on a common other than by grazing, albeit within the constraints of other statutory requirements. The reference to management of vegetation is no longer required due to changes introduced by Amendment No. 142, which makes it clear that an establishment order may confer functions relating to the management of vegetation. As we have already discussed, the main effect of this change is to enable associations to be established on commons when no agricultural activity is taking place.

<p><a name="st_56"></a>

</p>

<a name="51109-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>However, between now and Report, perhaps the Minister would give further consideration to, and perhaps write to me about, the issue of the holding that claims a single farm payment. The holding has rights of common and has animals on the common. It also has its own farmland. What would happen if it continued to have too many animals on the common but the commons association also tried to claim a payment, as the noble Lord said it would be entitled to do? Under the scheme as it stands, if someone does not cross-comply on his entire holding, he forfeits his payment. In this case, would the commons association have to forfeit its payment because of one rogue commoner, for example? Can the Minister explore in writing what would happen with the cross-compliance measures in such a scenario?

<p><a name="st_60"></a>The noble Lord said: The government amendments in this group are aimed primarily at enabling a commons association to manage horses, ponies and other animals that may not come under the generally accepted definition of the term &quot;livestock&quot;. The amendments all replace the word &quot;livestock&quot; with the word &quot;animal&quot; to ensure that rules related to grazing made by a commons association can be applied to any animal de-pastured on the common. That is necessary to ensure that commons associations are able effectively to manage grazing on the land.
</p>

<a name="51109-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>In summary, the amendments allow a commons association to: maintain a register of all animals grazing on a common; remove any animals found to be unlawfully grazing on the common; dispose of any animal that it removes from the common; and recover costs from the owner of removing an animal from the common and disposing of it. The amendments are required in order to enable associations to deal with any animal de-pastured on a common and not just those categorised as &quot;livestock&quot;, which in some instances can be interpreted narrowly to mean animals kept for agricultural production purposes.
</p>

<a name="51109-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Horses and ponies are a significant presence on some commons&#151;particularly in parts of Wales and the south-west of England.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;removing livestock unlawfully permitted to graze&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>I want to question the Minister a little further on this. I understand that at the moment it is not possible to remove a pony or horse from a common if the animal does not have a passport. This is a specific situation because all horses have to have passports. However, if an animal finds its way on to a common and does not have a passport, it cannot be removed. The Minister has said that it is normal practice to remove horses and other livestock, very often sheep, which are illegally grazing on a common. Usually an advertisement is placed in a local newspaper and, after 40 days, the animal is sold. But it is now impossible to remove a horse if it does not have a passport.
</p>

<a name="51109-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>The only solution we can see is to enable the commons association to obtain a passport for a horse which is grazing illegally so that it can be legally removed and sold after a 40-day period.

<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="51109-38_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I thank the Minister for bringing forward these government amendments. Obviously they were introduced after our amendments had been tabled. We have no quibble with that and we are grateful for them. The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, has raised an issue that we want to echo. All horses now require a passport, and this requirement gives rise to two problems. The first is how to get over the difficulty if an animal does not have a passport. How is the association to catch it, corral it, advertise and sell it? Secondly, and more important, is a point that the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, did not touch on. If a horse needs veterinary treatment, technically a veterinarian cannot administer such treatment because the animal does not have a passport.

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>The two major issues here are that at the moment, commoners can handle horses and ponies on commons because the requirement for passports was not in force, but now that it is, certain points arise. I understand that commoners are allowed to defray the costs of corralling animals and so forth, but who is to bear the cost of veterinary treatment if there is no passport? Is it to be the responsibility of the commons association? This is a point to which the Government may need to give further consideration.

activity: to apply for horse passports and to remove horses from the common. However, in the light of our proposed amendments, we do not think that these amendments are necessary. Commons associations will be able to make rules relating to the management of horses and ponies. This will include the removal and disposal of animals found to be grazing unlawfully. The ancillary powers of commons associations set out in Clause 31 would enable associations to apply for horse passports where necessary.

<p><a name="st_69"></a>The noble Lord said: Government Amendments Nos. 163 and 180 clarify how certain rules and fees levied by an association can relate to the exercise of an owner&#039;s right to use the surplus. The change in wording clarifies that rules made by an association which relate to agricultural activities, vegetation management or the exercise of rights of common, can have the effect of limiting or imposing conditions only on the exercise of an owner&#039;s right to use the surplus. Such rules cannot, for example, have any effect on an owner&#039;s right to lease or license out his right to use the surplus.
</p>

<a name="51109-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>It may be worth pointing out that the power conferred in Clause 30(3)(b) to make rules to control the leasing and licensing of rights of common has nothing to do with an owner&#039;s leasing or licensing arrangements of the surplus grazing. In a similar manner, the power to require payment of fees under Clause 31 can relate only to the exercise of rights to use the surplus, irrespective of who is actually exercising the right. It could be the owner himself, his tenant or his lessee. Fees cannot be levied in relation to any surplus rights not being exercised.

<a name="51109-39_spnew3"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   I rise to speak to Amendments Nos. 163A and 180A in this group. In the first instance I am slightly curious about the wording used in the Government&#039;s amendment. It may be only for reasons of economy, but Amendment No. 163 would mean that Clause 30(4)(a) would read &quot;or the exercise of rights&quot; to use any surplus of land, whereas in the previous line it states, &quot;on the exercise of rights&quot;. Perhaps the Minister would like to look at that again.
</p>

<a name="51109-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>I shall explain the purpose behind Amendment No. 163A. Defra has said that these clauses have been designed to address landowners&#039; residual grazing rights. Commentators state that generally, landowners&#039; surplus rights are equivalent to residual grazing rights, but that terminology is vague. To avoid confusion and to bring clarity to this, these clauses should be amended so that they refer specifically to &quot;surplus grazing rights&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="51109-39_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   Amendment No. 164A tabled in my name is also included in this group. However, I do not think that there is much need for me to speak to it because the Minister has more or less given me the answer I was hoping for. If he can confirm that my amendment is not necessary because there will be no restriction on the ability of the owner of the common to lease or license his surplus rights&#151;one has to be absolutely clear about this&#151;I shall be satisfied. I think that that is what the Minister has already said.
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="51109-39_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I can give the noble Earl that reassurance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="51109-39_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Inglewood: </b>   I assume that the Minister will not dissent from the proposition that the way in which these fees are charged must be even-handed in respect of all rights regarding surplus grazing rights for owners, as well as the different categories of rights on a common.

<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="51109-39_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   That is right and I do not dissent from that proposition. This is easy.

But I congratulate the noble Duke on having spotted that detail. I hope that he is able to get out sometimes.
</p>

<a name="51109-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>On the noble Duke&#039;s point about inserting the word &quot;grazing&quot;, we think the government amendments demonstrate that there is no need for such an insertion. Our intention is to ensure that while the rules made by an association will be able to affect the grazing surplus, they will not have any effect on the ability of the owner <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC208"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC208</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to lease or license the use of that surplus. In other words, the owner will be free to manage the surplus as he sees fit. It is only when a person actually utilises the grazing that the rules will apply. Therefore we do not think that anyone could misread the word &quot;surplus&quot; so as to need the word &quot;grazing&quot; before it.

I want to take the opportunity to listen to what other noble Lords have to say when speaking to their amendments before I return to my own. At an earlier sitting we had a long debate about the public interest, so I shall not repeat that conversation. However, I seek clarification on the use of the phrase in subsection (6)(b). Amendment No. 169 is a probing amendment to ask the Government what they mean by the term &quot;public interest&quot; here. Does it refer only to the commoners, to those living within the common area, or does it cover the wider public interest? I am not clear when the subsection starts with the words:

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 172. In this country a number of householders have had to buy the right to access their own homes by vehicle. In the main these are people who have acquired properties situated on the edge of village greens or on common land where property developers had gained permission to build, but for some reason no one had thought about vehicular access.

<a name="51109-40_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   I shall speak to Amendment No. 170A. It proposes a defined description of nature conservation in relation to the common land. Clause 30 makes provision with regard to the functions of commons associations. The functions must relate to the management of agricultural activities on designated land. Subsection (7) requires the commons association to have regard to the public interest as defined in,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;nature conservation; . . . the conservation of the landscape; and . . . the protection of public rights of access to any area of land&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>That is too ambiguous and gives no standing or recognition as to how the land has been managed in the past by the landowners and commoners, which has often created the desirable state of a SSSI. This is a testament to the commoners and their management techniques.
</p>

<a name="51109-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>The amendment proposes a definition of &quot;nature conservation&quot; in relation to common land and recognises that one of the prime functions of a commons association is the management of land for livelihoods and the long-term viability of the common. Therefore, the amendment assures that public interest in common land includes nature conservation, but in the perspective of land management.

<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="51109-40_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   Amendment No. 169 takes out the functions for the commons association to have functions for the public interest, as specified in Clause 30(7). The question in my mind is whether the commons associations will have the resources to perform that function. It is not a popular function with some of the associations, but I shall listen with interest to the Minister&#039;s reply.
</p>

<a name="51109-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>We would agree with Amendment No. 170, and the objectives of Amendment No. 170A are good. However, it is a complex amendment which, although well-meaning, is difficult to interpret when compared with Amendment No. 142, which was agreed on the previous sitting. However, I accept many of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick. Amendment No. 171 deals with archaeological remains, which is important and we agree with that. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC210"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC210</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Amendment No. 172 seeks to protect the rights of private access. We feel this is necessary for the housing to which the noble Baroness referred and the historic rights of access to it. There are a number of problems on that front which need to be resolved.

</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="51109-40_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Tyler: </b>   I warmly welcome government Amendment No. 171. I contemplated tabling a similar amendment and I notice that my noble friend Lord Greaves has also endorsed it. It refers to issues relating to archaeological remains and features of historic interest. I know that there is widespread concern that the original Bill, as published, did not include this provision, and it is obviously very welcome.
</p>

<a name="51109-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>While on the subject of features of historic interest, I must apologise to the Committee for leaving briefly to witness a feature of historic interest when the Government were massively defeated at the other end of the building.

<a name="51109-40_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Chorley: </b>   I, too, wish to refer to Amendment No. 171, which the Minister has not yet moved. I raised that point at Second Reading, so I am delighted that the Government have taken it on board. The amendment is more or less in the terms that I had in mind and I thank the Government for it.

<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="51109-40_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I am quite sure that the Committee does not expect me to comment on current historical activity.
</p>

<a name="51109-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, I am advised that nothing in Part 2 affects private vehicular rights of way over a common. Such rights will continue to be exercisable. The more longstanding legal right issue was resolved by the House of Lords last year in <i>Bakewell Management Limited </i>v <i>Brandwood and others</i>, where their Lordships clarified the circumstances.
</p>

<a name="51109-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>On Amendment No. 169, I should say to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, that we do not want commons associations to ride roughshod over the wider national concerns and public interest in common land as places for recreation, reservoirs of biodiversity and highly valued landscapes. While the appropriate national authority is able to give guidance on such issues as broader national interests in commons, it is also important to require associations to have regard to these. Otherwise an association could completely disregard the potential effect of the way in which it uses its new statutory powers on the wildlife interest or natural beauty of the commons. The Bill does not make these overriding considerations but it requires them to be taken into account.
</p>

<a name="51109-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>Amendment No. 172 would extend the definition of &quot;public interest&quot;, while Amendment No. 170A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, offers an alternative definition of the term. We do not see the need to change the &quot;public interest&quot; definition beyond our Amendment No. 171, which expands the definition to include the protection of archaeological remains and historic features. The proposed amendments tend to mix private interests with public interest in their expansion or change of the definition <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC211"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC211</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of the term &quot;public interest&quot;. We do not feel it appropriate for a commons association to have the same level of regard for these private interests as for broader public interests in the common land. Most, if not all, of the concerns expressed by the movers of these amendments can be managed through rules made by an association under its functions in this clause.
</p>

<a name="51109-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>In essence, Amendment No. 170A sums up the very reasons that we are creating commons associations&#151;to allow use of natural resources, to take account of access and to have regard for the protection of the natural environment. I agree with the noble Lord that in many cases, over hundreds of years, it is agricultural activity that has created many of the aspects we cherish. Our approach here has been to strike a balance between the different interests of a common. We must provide for associations that can manage the agricultural activities on a common while having regard to these wider interests.
</p>

<a name="51109-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>We are also aware that not every common is subject to agricultural activity, so we have broadened the functions of associations in our amendments to this clause.

<a name="51109-40_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   I am sorry to interrupt the noble Baroness, but I did not want to mention this until she had responded to Amendment No. 170. I was under the impression that anything of archaeological significance or historical interest was probably already listed by English Heritage. That being so, is that not already catered for? Who would define what is an archaeological remain and what is relevant as being of historical interest? What to one person is of historical interest might be nothing more than a bit of junk to someone else. That is why I thought that English Heritage was listing things that were of proper historical interest. Why is this necessary when there is a system already in place?

</p>

<a name="51109-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>Amendment No. 170 would require a commons association to have regard to the property or other rights over which the association exercises its functions when carrying out those functions. Amendment No. 173 would insert a provision that prevents anything done by a commons association from affecting or prejudicing the property or other rights of an owner of common land.
</p>

<a name="51109-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>These amendments are concerned with the property and rights of those on common land over which an association may be able to make rules. In many cases, it is the persons with property and other interests in the commons who will make up the association. If there is not enough support from such interests in the <br>&nbsp;<br>

management of rights and property, then it is extremely unlikely that an association would be formed.
</p>

<a name="51109-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>Government Amendment No. 182A, which we shall be discussing shortly, will clarify the situation with regard to the rights of others on the common. It provides that an association will not be able to do anything on the land without the consent of the person whose consent is required. There are some exceptions to this; I know that my noble friend will be interested to know that, for example, an association could make rules that would control the grazing rights of all those on the common, but the new consent clause in Amendment No. 182A aims to strike a balance between functions given to an association to manage a common and the rights of those with property interests in that common. We believe that the new consent provisions will provide adequate safeguards for the property and rights of others on commons, about which my noble friend Lord Williams is concerned.

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Government Amendment No. 171 expands the meaning of the term &quot;public interest&quot; to include the protection of archaeological remains and features of historical interest. I am pleased that we have had recognition from the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, that we are addressing the concerns raised by his noble friend Lord Greaves and by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness. I hope that the Committee will recognise that the amendment responds to concerns raised. Following discussions with a range of interested parties, we are convinced that we have made a significant omission by leaving out protection of archaeological remains and historic features.
</p>

<a name="51109-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>Further, I can confirm to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, that nothing in the Bill takes away any private rights acquired. Some people have purchased easements, but Section 68 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act reflects the understood position of the law at that time. Where easements were purchased unnecessarily, I fear that that is a matter for the property owner and landowner concerned, but I can give the noble Baroness the assurance that she sought that people will not lose rights as a result of anything in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51109-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, raised the issue of resources to carry out functions. It is not an obligation on the association to undertake costly management measures in the public interest but, to the extent that such measures are desirable, they are likely to be the subject of agri-environment agreements, as he will recognise. The duty to have regard to the public interest is intended to protect the common from any damaging management changes.

<a name="51109-41_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   Inspiration has struck.

<a name="51109-41_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Caithness: </b>   That saves me making that point, because that is exactly the sort of case that I had in mind when I raised the issue at Second Reading. I am just grateful that the Government have now seen sense.

<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="51109-41_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I thank the Minister for her response. To take the easy bit first, which is our Amendment No. 172, the Minister assures me that there is no problem with access for people to their own homes. She mentioned the Bakewell judgment, which, as we know, had implications for the CROW Act&#151;both of us having worked on the CROW Act at some length. Has that yet been rectified in law or is it still outstanding? It seems a shame when we have the opportunity with a Bill before us not to address that and rectify it. I am not expecting a response to that now, but if it is evolving that far, perhaps it should be written into the Bill on Report. Otherwise, it is left to whether the person knows that the judgment exists. That is the easy part, as far as I am concerned, and I can give the noble Baroness time to think about that.
</p>

<a name="51109-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Although I listened to the Minister carefully, I am still concerned about where the public interest comes. The functions in the clause are for the management of agricultural activities on the land for which the association is established. It then lists those functions. Then subsection (6) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;A commons association must discharge its functions for the purposes specified in subsection (2) having regard to . . . (b) the public interest in relation to the land for which it is established&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>I do not understand. What happens if the public interest does not agree with what the commoners are doing? Where is the public interest? Is it restricted merely to the commoners, or can members of the public be critical of what the commons association is trying to do? Who is defined in the public interest? I did not fully understand the Minister&#039;s response.
</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="51109-41_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My understanding is that the &quot;public interest&quot; is the general areas of recreation rather than &quot;the public&quot;, a defined group of people. If I am wrong about that, I will write to the noble Baroness. The association must have regard to that factor, but we are not seeking to make it an overriding one. The association has a duty to consider it.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;as long as it does not remove, infringe or impede the owner&#039;s rights&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>This is a probing amendment intended to clarify the extent of the powers of commons associations and to raise important issues of owners&#039; rights. It seems to me that landowners&#039; rights are assumed rather than provided for in the Bill. Existing legislation protects those rights, but they are, nevertheless, a vital ingredient in dealings with common land and should not be overlooked.
</p>

<a name="51109-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>Earlier in the debate, the Minister said that the Government had deliberately designed the Bill to enable the national authority to take account of all the various interests that might be affected by an application. Of course, they include the interests of the owners of the land involved and also of those holding common rights. Given that commitment, I find it strange that the owners&#039; rights are not mentioned in the Bill.


</p>

<a name="51109-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>Amendment No. 175 makes an important point about the use of common land. It suggests that it is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC215"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC215</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

important for the commons association to keep tabs on its members as a point of land management. If 100 people own rights to a common but only 50 use those rights, then a problem could arise with regard to under-grazing. If commons associations had the power to keep a register of those who were using their rights, it would be possible to approach commoners who were neglecting their rights and perhaps arrange for the rights to be returned either to the landowner or the commons association or for a loan to be arranged. This is a question of setting out the best possible circumstances for efficient land management.
</p>

<a name="51109-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 177. If commons associations are to have the power to acquire land that they will need, they will need to have the ability to pay for it. We do not know the circumstances in which they will want to purchase it but presumably on occasion there may be time constraints. Even if the intention is ultimately to use public subscription or even private funds, it may be necessary to borrow in the short term. I do not suppose that Defra is proposing to set up a common land fund, such as we have in Scotland, where grants are given to purchase land using public money. The power in paragraph (c) to raise money needs clarification. Will the Government accept that commons associations may borrow to supplement their funds? If so, will there be any restrictions on either the source or the rate charged?
</p>

<a name="51109-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment No. 179, which draws attention to Clause 31(3) concerning the ancillary powers of commons associations. I was alarmed to read that the Bill proposes to levy fees on commoners exercising their statutory rights. Paragraph (a) details that the exercise of rights of common and the right to use the surplus of the common may lead to a charge from the local commons association under the conditions of subsection (3). Can it be right for commoners to pay a toll to activate their statutory rights? Is there not a possibility that some people could find themselves excluded from their rights due to the level of financial demand?
</p>

<a name="51109-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>With regard to paragraph (b) of the same subsection, I want to call into debate the question of fees levied by way of membership of commons associations. Would this encourage people to become members of the association? Would the fees be expected to exceed the running costs? Would the fees levied be put back into management? Who would audit the whole process? Let us suppose that fees are introduced. Would the &quot;appropriate national authorities&quot; set a cap on the amount that could be charged? How would the commons association publish the fees, once agreed? Would a percentage have to go to the landowner, and would fees increase with interest rates? Those questions will cause great difficulty in the future if they are not properly debated. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="51109-41_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Williams of Elvel: </b>   It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I speak to my Amendment No. 176. Broadly speaking, it follows the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC216"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC216</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

line taken by the noble Duke. I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 178 and 179, to which I have added my name.
</p>

<a name="51109-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>We need a little clarification on the issue of a commons association raising money. Raising money presumably means that you have to borrow or, as I understand it, it may perfectly in order to ask the commoners for funds. But to borrow from, say, a bank, a commons association must have a legal entity. Will the commons association be a company? Will it be a legal entity that can enter into a loan agreement with the bank? If so, will it be able to offer commons as security to the bank or to any other lender? What kind of interest rate is a commons association liable to bear? What will be the liabilities of the members of the association if they enter into such contractual arrangements with a bank or another lender? A whole raft of questions can be asked on the issue of a commons association being allowed to raise money in the furtherance of its activities.
</p>

<a name="51109-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>Then there is the question of acquiring or disposing of land, which comes under Amendment No. 178. I am not sure what that means and I should be grateful if my noble friend could advise me. I do not understand how a commons association can acquire or dispose of a common if the land has an owner. Therefore, I would welcome advice on what that means and on whether the provision needs to be in the Bill, given the new consent clause which the Government are to move.
</p>

<a name="51109-41_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>Lastly, I turn to the whole question of raising money under subsection (3). There are a lot of problems here which we need to explore.

<a name="51109-42_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   These amendments have created much interest. Amendment No. 174 would add the words,

<a name="51109-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>However, Amendment No. 176, proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, would leave out paragraph (c) of Clause 31(2), which concerns the ability of a commons association to raise money. There may well be occasions when a commons association may wish to raise money. There may be issues on the common which need to be put right, with the agreement of members by a majority vote, and that might involve the use of resources. Also, under grant aid schemes one often has to find collateral moneys in order to achieve the grant&#151;particularly with social funding, Objective 1 or Objective 2 funding, or something of that nature. So the ability to raise money is useful in developing facilities on a common to assist the well-being of the commoners and, indeed, perhaps to enable them to benefit from an income that they would not otherwise receive. Of course, there is the whole question of environmental schemes and whether they would be funded 100 per cent, and so on. All those issues need to be examined closely.

</p>

<a name="51109-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>Amendment No. 177 would enable a commons association to borrow money, and that would certainly be an extremely useful facility. The whole issue of acquiring and disposing of land in Amendment No. 178 needs further explanation. Like others who have spoken, I am not sure exactly where it would leave us.
</p>

<a name="51109-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>Amendment No. 179 seeks to leave out subsection (3), which enables a commons association to charge fees. I agree that the issue of fees for rights of common and surplus grazing is contestable, but surely raising membership fees should be allowable because, again, the commons association may wish to achieve certain objectives. If it has a membership mainly made up of active graziers, not having such a facility might well hamstring the association, and I am not sure that that is desirable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="51109-42_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Chorley: </b>   In support of the query raised by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, what will be the tax status of a commons association? If it is to dispose of land, there may be a capital gains tax issue. If there is capital gains tax, how will it be divided? One can foresee a variety of issues which will provide a field day for accountants.
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="51109-42_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Caithness: </b>   I add my voice to those who have raised concerns about Clause 31(2)(c) and (d). I am especially exercised by paragraph (d) concerning the acquisition and disposal of land. As I mentioned at Second Reading, I see that as one of the key ingredients for making trouble for commons associations, bearing in mind that a commons association can be set up by a minority of commoners or those with interests in the land. For them to have the power to acquire and dispose of land raises serious concerns. I hope that the Government will be able to explain exactly what they have in mind under the clause.
</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="51109-42_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Inglewood: </b>   As we have come in this direction, once a commons association is established&#151;my understanding is that it is a body corporate&#151;can it wind itself up and either put itself into voluntary liquidation or close itself down?

<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="51109-42_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I am not a lawyer&#151;I enter that caveat.

</p>

<a name="51109-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>Amendment No. 174 would make commons associations less effective and efficient in carrying out their powers and functions. For example, if a commons association decides through majority voting to enter into an agri-environment agreement, this amendment would mean that a single individual in the form of an owner could prevent such an agreement being made if it impeded his rights. Preventing an association from entering into an agreement of that nature would thwart the association in achieving improved management of the common, which is of course one of the main reasons for their establishment. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC218"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC218</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I remind the Committee of our Amendment No. 182A, which we shall come to presently. It will make the position regarding owners&#039; consent of common much clearer and will ensure proper protection for the rights of landowners and others who have a right or interest in the common.
</p>

<a name="51109-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>Amendment No. 175 deals with Clause 30(3), which already makes it clear that one of the functions that can be conferred on a commons association is that of preparing and maintaining a register of grazing. In some cases where the level of agricultural activity is low, the appropriate national authority may decide that the keeping of a live registry is unnecessary and would not confer such a function on the association. In other cases, the authority might decide that such a register is vital to the effective management of the common and require such a register to be kept as an essential management function rather than an ancillary power. Of course, even if the establishment order did not confer such a function, an association could set up a register under the ancillary powers given to it in Clause 31 if it considered a register to be conducive to carrying out any of its functions.
</p>

<a name="51109-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>Amendments Nos. 176 to 178 either add or remove specific elements from the illustrative list of ancillary powers in Clause 31(2), which sets out a wide range of ancillary powers that a commons association may exercise, depending on its circumstances, to enable it to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible in discharging the functions that it will be given in its establishment order.
</p>

<a name="51109-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>I must stress that the list is purely illustrative and the clause allows an association to do anything it considers will facilitate or is conducive or incidental to the carrying out of its functions. We think it right to include the power to raise money. A commons association will need a small amount of money for standard administration purposes&#151;for example, sending out letters, paying phone bills and hiring rooms. Most voluntary commons associations charge their members a small annual subscription fee for those and similar purposes. The amendment, which would add the power to borrow at standard rates, is unnecessary because the power to raise money itself includes the power to borrow at such rates. We also think it right to include in the illustrative list the ancillary power to acquire or dispose of land. That is not to say that acquiring land is something that we expect commons associations to do routinely. I reassure the Committee that we envisage associations raising funds through subscriptions paid by commoners and other participants at a modest level to meet their running costs, not amassing large cash reserves to fund land purchases.
</p>

<a name="51109-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>My noble friend Lord Williams of Elvel asked about the power to dispose of land being given in the Bill. The new consent clause does not refer to landowners&#039; land but to other land that the association may acquire&#151;such as a building for an office or land that is left to it in a will. The association cannot dispose of the common itself&#151;I reassure the Committee of that. My noble friend also raised the issue of security of loans. If an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC219"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC219</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

association owned property, it could offer it as security for a loan, but it could not offer the common itself as security.
</p>

<a name="51109-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, raised the question of fees. The setting of fees is primarily a matter for the association. Rules will be able to require the payment of fees by, for example, all commoners exercising rights&#151;perhaps in proportion to the number of rights exercised. If commoners do not want to pay the fees set, presumably they will vote for a new board of management if they object to how it is run.
</p>

<a name="51109-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>My noble friend Lord Williams also expressed concern that the power to dispose of land in Clause 31(2)(d) might be interpreted as a power to dispose of land belonging to others. I hope that I have totally reassured him on that. Of course, an association could benefit from a bequest or grant and may want to use the funds for other purposes. It could be left property in a will.
</p>

<a name="51109-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>We cannot support the amendment removing the specific reference to a commons association having power to raise money. We resist Amendment No. 179 because levying fees for the exercise of rights of common and of rights to use the surplus, all requiring an annual subscription from members of an association are considered to be the two main ways in which such an organisation will raise money. They will have operating costs, so they must have a source of income. That is not a new concept. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, is an expert on Devon. We are aware that a small fee for the exercise of rights has been used successfully on Dartmoor for 20 years. Many voluntary commons associations, such as the Federation of Cumbria Commoners, also require members to pay small annual subscriptions.
</p>

<a name="51109-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>I was asked about tax. I understand that capital gains tax becomes due only if capital is coming in. If capital is coming in, it will be used to pay the tax. If I am wrong on that, I will write to noble Lords. Individual members would have no liability. An association is a body corporate, as noble Lords know, unless of course they were voluntarily to give personal security for borrowing.
</p>

<a name="51109-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>I think I have covered the questions that have been asked. If not, I will write to noble Lords.

When she mentioned commons associations buying land, I was not sure whether she meant that in the layman&#039;s sense or in the lawyer&#039;s sense, because real property includes rights. One of the provisions that the Government are introducing, as the noble Baroness knows, is the power for the commons association to have severed rights as an alternative to selling them to Natural England or selling them to the owner of the soil of a common who will then absorb them so that they become surplus rights.

You then get on to the problem of whether an association can borrow money; what sort of security it can give, if any; and what is the liability of the members of the association if it defaults on a loan, which may be set up without all members agreeing. My noble friend said that there was no liability but, if I am the banker, who would I look to if there was a default on the loan?

<a name="51109-43_spnew4"></a><b> The Earl of Caithness: </b>   On the question of acquiring or disposing of land, does the noble Baroness know of any commons associations that currently own land? I do not think she gave any good reason why this should be an ancillary power of a commons association. Its job is to manage the land, the vegetation and the agricultural operations&#151;or the grazing operations, as they are now called. It is not a question of acquiring and disposing of capital assets such as land.

<a name="51109-43_spnew5"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   The Minister said that Amendment No. 174, in the name of my noble friend Lady Byford, was not satisfactory because it would impede the effectiveness of a commons association. What would happen if, through the formation of a commons association, the owner was disenfranchised or disproportionately out of pocket? Presumably, the payment scheme installed by the association would have to take that into account. So it would not necessarily be across the board; it would have to be pro rata according to the losses incurred by each individual party.

corporate no individual liability arises on the part of a commoner because the body corporate does not incur liability on members of the association. I am advised that that is the legal position.
</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="51109-43_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Williams of Elvel: </b>   I am sorry to interrupt. There is a borrower; there is a bank; the borrower contracts with the bank. If the body corporate is the contractual party to a loan, somebody must be liable if there is a default on that loan. I do not know who that somebody is. That is why I am interested in the response.

<a name="51109-43_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   Surely the somebody would be the bank manager who had lent money on the basis of no security. When there is no security on a project, which bank would lend money to members of an association who are not liable to pay it?
</p>

<a name="51109-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>I remind noble Lords that the kind of issue to which I referred was one whereby a bequest could be left in a will to an association which, for very good reasons, might wish to dispose of an asset it had acquired in order to do something else with the money. This was what we had in mind, not raising lots of money from people in the open market. In the whole of my life, I cannot remember meeting a bank manager who would lend money to a group of people who had no means of repaying and no liability to repay if they did not do so. I think that my noble friend is worrying about this unnecessarily.
</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="51109-43_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   Under &quot;Ancillary powers&quot;, the Bill clearly states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;(c) raise money&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>It does not refer to raising money per headage or for whatever purpose. So the noble Lord, Lord Williams, is quite right. Whether he wishes to give the Government time to think about it is another matter, but the noble Baroness cannot argue both ways when paragraph (c) quite clearly states that its power is to raise money.
</p>




<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="51109-43_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   But it is not an obligation. When one is setting a framework in a piece of legislation, it is wise, if at all possible, to cover certain unusual circumstances that may occur. The Bill would enable an association, in certain circumstances, to raise money. Noble Lords now appear to envisage associations going to slightly incompetent bank managers to raise a lot of money. That is certainly not the intention.
</p>




<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="51109-43_spnew11"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   I wish to come back on something that the Minister said in reply to some of my amendments. Of course, in the first instance, I am disappointed in her reply to Amendment No. 174. I can see that the Government might disagree with the wording, but they have said that they do not agree with its purpose. I will probably need to look with more interest at government Amendment No. 182A, when come to it, to see what we might bring back on Report.
</p>

<a name="51109-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>In our debate on Amendment No. 179 we examined the small amounts that commons associations might wish to raise and the fact that if, say, three-quarters of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC222"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC222</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

its members were well-heeled and decided that membership should cost &#163;100 per head, the other quarter might be unwilling to pay that. We were exploring the point to see whether there might be some way in which some members of the commons might try to exclude other members by putting up a financial hurdle.
</p>

<a name="51109-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>But the Minister has taken us into a more difficult area, simply by mentioning the question of bequests or grants. My mental processes are taking me back home to the exact parallel situation in Scotland, where all those who have common grazing rights have the pre-emptive right to buy the commons. I am not saying that some future government might not raise this matter, but the Scottish Parliament, in its wisdom, has provided a &#163;10 million fund that it hopes to keep constantly topped up with money from the lottery in case it is expended, from which it is prepared to dole out for commons associations to buy their common grazings. Bequests have been given in other circumstances where people have thought it was an excellent idea that the common people who have rights of common grazing should be able to buy their commons. Even without the right of pre-emption, they have found occasion when it was opportune for them to do so.
</p>

<a name="51109-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>So commons associations, even under the Bill, could become powerful bodies. They will not necessarily be there just to collect small amounts of money to pay small expenses that they come across. We must look at what possible powers are hidden in this Bill with regard not to the circumstances of how commons are run at the moment but of how some future government might consider they should exist and be administered. In that light, I wish to withdraw my amendment and perhaps come back to the matter.

<p><a name="st_119"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendments Nos. 181 and 182A are further examples of the many steps that we have taken since Second Reading to respond to the concerns expressed to us, inside and outside the Chamber, about the Bill as introduced.
</p>

<a name="51109-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>Those representing owners of commons and holders of sporting and similar rights pointed out to us that subsection (4) of Clause 31 would substantially change the status quo on common land. To take one example, on a managed grouse moor the subsection would potentially have allowed an association to begin burning the heather itself instead of, or in parallel with, those currently entitled to do so&#151;and without their consent.

</p>

<a name="51109-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>At Second Reading, the noble Lords, Lord Livsey and Lord Inglewood, and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, identified potential difficulties in protecting the owner&#039;s rights. An establishment order could have avoided such an outcome by making particular provision about consent, as subsection (6) enables. But, understandably, people said to us that the Bill itself should prevent such an outcome arising at all. We gave careful consideration to that point and concluded that those arguments had a lot to be said for them. The result is these two government amendments.
</p>

<a name="51109-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>Amendment No. 181 removes subsections (4) to (6) of Clause 31 to pave the way for its being replaced with a new clause that deals only with consent provisions. I commend my noble friend Lord Williams for his foresight in proposing the deletion of those subsections.
</p>

<a name="51109-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>The second government amendment, Amendment No. 182A, outlines the revised consent regime for commons associations. It is very different from the one in the current version of the Bill. Its effect is that a commons association must now obtain the consent of any person for undertaking activities on the land wherever the consent of that person would normally be required were it not for Part 2 of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51109-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>There are two qualifications to that. The first is that a commons association does not have to get the consent of any common rights holder for doing anything on the land. Secondly, where an activity can be undertaken by a common rights holder without the consent of any other person, an association will also be allowed to undertake that activity without the need for consent. What we have in mind is this: if, for example, there is a custom that the commoners may cut or treat bracken without the need to seek the agreement of the owner&#151;this is quite topical to today&#039;s debate&#151;the association may also undertake that activity without consent. Where consent is required for an activity, the association may serve notice on the person whose consent is required. If no response is received within not fewer than 28 days after the notice is served, that person is regarded as having given his consent and the association may undertake the activity. If the person refuses to give consent for that activity, the association may not do it&#151;let us be clear about that.
</p>

<a name="51109-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>Where the owner or other person whose consent is needed cannot be traced, the association may seek consent through posting notices on the land. Again, if no response is received within not fewer than 28 days, consent is treated as having been given. That aspect of the consent regime will enable a commons association to manage unclaimed common land. I know that that is an issue of some concern, expressed in particular through Amendment No. 85, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey. The Government&#039;s amendments offer an important but practical approach to improving the management of unclaimed commons where an association has been established. This new consent clause protects the owner&#039;s interest in the land by restricting the activities that can be undertaken by an association without the owner&#039;s permission.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC224"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC224</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51109-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>Our starting point is this. Where a commoner can currently undertake some activity on the land without any person&#039;s consent, the association should be able to do that thing without consent. If there are no commoners, the association will not be given this dispensation. Where an association may want to undertake some activity on the land&#151;such as burning the vegetation&#151;which is not part of the exercise of a right of common, the consent of the owner would normally be required for that activity. The procedure for obtaining consent would have to be followed and, if consent was not forthcoming, the association would not be able to undertake the activity. In this way, the rights of owners and other interests will be protected.
</p>

<a name="51109-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>Amendment No. 182 tries to ameliorate the effect of the consent regime in the Bill as introduced. I congratulate the noble Baroness on that. However, I would argue that it has essentially been superseded by our amendment, which goes further in terms of the consent obligations placed on an association. Her amendment means that an association would have to obtain the consent of a person only where there are five or more persons whose consent is required. Thus, on commons where there might be a small number of owners, the association could then undertake many activities without the consent of the owner, which would be inequitable.
</p>

<a name="51109-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>I hope that in the light of what I have said, the noble Baroness will agree that her amendment is not needed. I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="51109-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>I have one question which I hope the Minister can answer. In the Bill as printed at Clause 31(5)(a), (b) and (c), a distinction is drawn between those who are entitled to exercise a right of common over land and those entitled to exercise any other rights over land in the context of those who may be required to give <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC225"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC225</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consent. In the revised new clause, that is set out differently. Subsection (9) of the new clause refers to the person who,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;owns the land; or . . . is entitled to exercise any right over the land&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>Will the Minister explain what other rights he has in mind, other than the right of common. For example, if we are now straying to rights of access, this would cause considerable confusion in the Bill. With that one qualification and concern, the general principle is that a commons association should be able to undertake anything that a commoner was able to undertake. It will be able to act without consent if that is currently common practice, but if that consent is currently necessary for a commoner, it will be necessary for a commons association in the future.
</p>

<a name="51109-44_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I hope that I am right because that seems a practical approach. Perhaps the Minister will explain the difference between the two approaches.

<a name="51109-44_spnew3"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   Returning to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, who referred to past practices as determining whether the commons association or the owner should continue to carry out those practices, I am curious as to what determines which particular practice is vested in the owner and which in the grazier. Yes, there are traditional management practices and standards which have built up over the years, but if a conflict were to arise, how would it be determined?

(1)   Subject to subsections (2) and (3), nothing in this Part authorises a commons association to do anything on the land for which it is established without the consent of a person with an interest in the land, where that person&#039;s consent would otherwise be required.

<br>
(2)   A commons association does not need the consent of a person who has a right of common over the land for which it is established in order to do anything on the land.


<br>
(3)   A commons association does not need the consent of any other person with an interest in the land for which it is established in order to do anything on the land where what is proposed to be done could be done without that person&#039;s consent by any person who has a right of common over the land.


<br>
(4)   Where a commons association wishes to obtain the consent of any person with an interest in the land for which the association is established in respect of anything it proposes to do on the land, it may serve a notice on him.


<br>
(5)   A notice under subsection (4) must specify&#151;


<br>
(a)   what the commons association proposes to do;


<br>
(b)   the time within which the person on whom it is served may object (which may not be less than 28 days after service of the notice); and


<br>
(c)   the manner in which he may object.


<br>
(6)   If the person on whom a notice under subsection (4) is served does not object within the time and in the manner specified in the notice, he is to be regarded as having given his consent in relation to the proposal specified in the notice.


<br>
(7)   Where a commons association proposes to serve a notice on a person under subsection (4) but is unable after reasonable enquiry to ascertain his name or proper address&#151;


<br>
(a)   the association may post the notice on the land; and


<br>
(b)   the notice is to be treated as having been served on the person at the time the notice is posted.


<br>
(8)   An order under section 25 may make further provision as to the form and service of notices under subsection (4).


<br>
(9)   For the purposes of this section, a person with an interest in any land is a person who&#151;


<br>
(a)   owns the land; or

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>Amendment No. 184 is grouped with Amendment No. 183 and is a probing amendment designed to test the latitude the Government intend the court to have. Would it be possible, for example, under this legislation for the court to refuse to make an order on the grounds that the rule in question was itself unreasonable? Would it be possible for the court to have regard to other legislation in reaching its decision?
</p>

<a name="51109-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>Hence, once the Bill is law, will it be possible for a commons association to make a rule that no one other than a person named by the association may remove stolen, strayed or abandoned animals&#151;an issue we discussed earlier&#151;from the common and to specify that contravention is an offence? Would it then be legal for the association to pursue through the court any organisation or individual who came on the common with the intent of &quot;rescuing&quot; such animals?
</p>

<a name="51109-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I raise this issue because when I was in Wales&#151;lovely Wales&#151;on the Brecon Beacons in September, an example of such a scenario was recounted by a representative of a commons association management committee. Some people from what I would class as a welfare group came and scooped up and removed&#151;&quot;rescued&quot;&#151;an animal. This kind of action can cause great distress to both the rescued animals and wildlife in general. The rescuers claimed that their efforts were legally justifiable, and in that situation, which involved horses, the police agreed. A number of issues are raised in a situation where someone who is not involved in the day-to-day running of a common takes such actions, and that is why we have raised the matter.

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>If it is an issue which requires more and wider thought, I am quite happy for the Minister to come back to me later.

It is not clear from the amendment which will be the appropriate national authority&#151;I presume it will not change from time to time&#151;but I believe the Minister said it will be the Secretary of State. Might it not be simpler if the appropriate national authority were to draw up a large number of rules, from which menu commons associations could pick the ones they require and not have to apply every time they wish to make a rule?

<a name="51109-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>If, under an exceptional circumstance, there was a requirement for a rule that the appropriate national authority had not entered on its menu list, it might be reasonable that the commons associations should have to apply. But for them to have to apply every time they wish to make a rule is contrary to the spirit of the better regulation streamlining effort.

<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="51109-45_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   Dealing with the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, we have decided to require the prior approval of the appropriate national authority where the breach of a rule results in a criminal offence being committed. We think that is a reasonable requirement.
</p>




<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="51109-45_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I understand that. But there will not be many such rules, so a list could be drawn up. If a commons association required a rule that was on the list, they could adopt it without having to go through an application procedure.
</p>




<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="51109-45_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   It would be possible for a national authority to draw up a database of standard rules&#151;for example CCW or Natural England could produce a model series&#151;so there is nothing between us there.
</p>

<a name="51109-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>I am slightly surprised by the line taken by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, because the result of Amendment No. 184 would be to remove Clause 32(7). We believe it is important that where an association has applied to a county court to secure compliance with one of its rules, the court is given complete flexibility to decide on the most appropriate form of order&#151;for example, an order ensuring that all animals on a common are marked with the owner&#039;s mark. The association needs the option to pursue enforcement through a county court, and the court needs the flexibility to decide how that compliance should be secured. It could require the animals to be marked within a specified period or ask for the stock to be removed until they are.

</p>

<a name="51109-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>The effect of the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment would be to prevent the association being able to apply to the county court, and that would constrain its options. It might have to make a rule subject to a criminal offence&#151;and therefore prosecute for a breach in the magistrates&#039; court, which is a very difficult step among people who, in almost all cases, are going to be neighbours&#151;or it might be able to arrange for an appointed reeve to resolve the matter.
</p>

<a name="51109-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>As to the question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, we agree with the DPRRC that rules which apply criminal sanctions must be tested by the national authority. A statutory commons association must not be able to make its own criminal offences without any oversight. After listening carefully to what the noble Baroness said, I think she would agree with that. The national authority is clearly defined throughout the Bill and it is always the Secretary of State in England and the National Assembly in Wales.

<a name="51109-46_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   Before the Minister sits down and the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, replies, I should point out that one of the most common events on hill land is for someone from outside the area to find a lamb which they think is abandoned although the mother is grazing 20 yards away. It is quite a common experience for such lambs to be picked up by people who think they are not being looked after. It causes a huge animal welfare issue which I wish to draw to the attention of the Committee.

<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="51109-46_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I am aware of that. In my case it was not a lamb frisking to get back in; it was a rather elderly mutton and it was the wrong way up.

<a name="51109-46_spnew4"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister. I presumed that that was the intention all along and it is very helpful.
</p>

<a name="51109-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>I wish to speak to Amendments Nos. 186 and 188, which are in our names. Amendment No. 186 illustrates our concern that a national authority, deemed appropriate by whomever, may step in and revoke a rule made by a commons association. To me, that suggests that an organisation such as Natural England or the Countryside Council for Wales will be able to overturn any decision made by commons associations.
</p>

<a name="51109-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>While the Minister may argue that this paragraph is a route of appeal&#151;that can be the only reason that it would be supported&#151;we on these Benches think that, if that is the case, it should be more precisely specified. Surely a more effective route of appeal could be set up through the commons commissioner. I understand that the chief commissioner is now merely a part-time post, in spite of the success of the post over the years.
</p>

<a name="51109-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>I hope that the Minister will agree to consider my amendment not only as a probing amendment properly to establish the relationship between the commons associations and national government but also as a prompt to consider the processes of appeal.
</p>

<a name="51109-46_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 188. The Bill has resulted in a fairly heavy postbag, all of it from people and organisations with considerable knowledge and experience of their local commons. It is obvious that commons legislation must cater for a variety of circumstances. The national authority should not be in a position to revoke a rule without the membership of the association in question having the opportunity to explain the need for it.

I agree with the noble Duke that these issues are unacceptable among commoners associations&#151;and, in my view, rightly so. Amendment No. 187 addresses subsection (3) of the clause, which states:


</p>

It will be bitterly resented if the Bill does not provide a clear way for a commons association to have its case heard in a manner which meets the normal requirements of natural justice. In its present form, Clause 33(3) appears to give the kind of centralised control that the Minister has been at pains to say he is seeking to avoid in the Bill. I think that Amendment No. 187, tabled by my noble friends, is the right way forward.
</p>

<a name="51109-46_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>We have discussed the role of the commons commissioner at a previous sitting of the Committee. Perhaps the Minister can suggest the use of some other mechanism, but if he is not able to find something which will ensure that a dispassionate view is taken of issues of this sort&#151;when a commons association feels that it is being unreasonably overruled&#151;we shall have to go back to the commons commissioner. There must be a way in which these issues can be addressed independently. For that reason, I hope that the Minister will think very carefully indeed about the suggestion before him.

<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="51109-46_spnew7"></a><b> The Earl of Caithness: </b>   I too should like to express my concerns about Clause 33(3). It is a point that I raised in my remarks at Second Reading. It does seem peculiar that, having instituted these associations, a minority which enjoys substantial support can go to the national authority to ask for an association to be formed&#151;the constitution of which is laid down in standard terms and the functions of which are quite clearly defined&#151;but finds that anything it seeks to do can be overruled by the national authority without so much as an argument or even any discussion. Attention needs to be paid to this matter, otherwise there will be no chance that commons associations will be set up.
</p>




<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="51109-46_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Noble Lords have been very persuasive on this point. I have changed my mind. I shall take it away because there may be some potential for the inappropriate use of such powers to dominate the actions of an association. Obviously we do not see this as a power to be used lightly and in any case there probably needs to be some form of last-resort power. However, we need to think about it a little more. Furthermore, if we did use such a last-resort power, its exercise would be subject to judicial review. However, that is not an answer to every issue that is raised. Given that, we think that the matter needs to be considered further.

<a name="51109-47_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, for his comments. Given the fair way in which the Minister dealt with the previous amendment, I hope that he will consider Amendment No. 191 seriously. I am sure that we will be told that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is unnecessary, but the noble Lord is quite right to raise this important issue.
</p>

<a name="51109-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>Amendment No. 191 would delete subsection (4). It is not a very long subsection but, my goodness, the power it contains is amazing. It is the power under subsection (1), which includes the power to amend or appeal an enactment. I have looked at that fairly carefully, and while this is a probing amendment, Clause 34 reads as though the Government&#039;s intention were to ensure that public access to common land could take priority over other uses to which that land has traditionally been put. If that is the intention, then the connotation to be placed on subsection (4) is surely that the Government may repeal any local Act under which a commons association was formed, thereby&#151;and this could well happen&#151;nearly eliminating the association, which I am sure is not the Government&#039;s wish.
</p>

<a name="51109-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>The Minister may be able to assure me that no such local Act exists but, if not, can he assure me that the Government would not use the repeal of a local Act in this way? I need an explanation for why it is in the Bill if it will not be used.
</p>

<a name="51109-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>The commons associations were formed to protect the interests of those with an interest in the ownership and the use of the land. It is as vital a role today as ever it was. If our countryside is to be protected for the benefit of all our citizens, there must be a balance between those who use it and those who enjoy it.
</p>

<a name="51109-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>I hope that in explaining the amendment, I have clarified it for the Minister. As the Bill stands, Clause 4 has an overriding power over any other enactment that might already exist. I do not think that I have misread it.

<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="51109-47_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   The speech I am about to make will involve what I was going to say in the stand-part debate because some principles about the clause require general answers, as well as the specific amendments Would the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, like to speak to the clause-stand-part Question as part of this debate? It was once linked and now it is separate, but it is a matter for him.
</p>




<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="51109-47_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   There are a number of issues contained within the consequential provisions in Clause 34.

<a name="column_GC234"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC234</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

its possible impact. The Minister must justify the inclusion of the clause, which is consequential on subsection (2) and supersedes a number of Acts of Parliament. It is difficult to determine precisely the impact of the changes of those Acts of Parliament if they are superseded and what effect that would have on commons associations.
</p>

<a name="51109-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>It is very simple: first, why is the clause necessary; secondly, why does the Minister require these powers and amendments to existing legislation; and, thirdly, is it because unreasonable powers are being taken in the Bill against the interests of commons associations? The Minister will have to satisfy us on those three questions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="51109-47_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   This has been a useful debate. Let me try and persuade noble Lords why Clause 34 is important. They will be aware of the various longstanding management mechanisms for commons that pre-date the Bill. Prior to the fundamental reforms to the law of property that took effect in 1926, a manorial court frequently presided over the exercise of grazing rights on a common. Some might feel that, had that particular reform never been enacted, commons might have been better served. Be that as it may, manorial courts have, for the most part, and with honourable exceptions, either ceased to exist or ceased to exercise effective oversight of the way in which commoners exercise their rights. The vacuum they have left behind is perhaps the key reason why we are trying to enact Part 2 of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51109-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>There are, however, some courts&#151;leet and the like&#151;still in existence. To the extent that they still work well or have some wider social or ceremonial function that is locally valued, we are of course not in the business of sweeping them away just for the sake of it. But let us suppose that the legal interests in a particular common that has a court leet conclude that the time is right to move on to avail themselves of the powers and functions that are potentially available to them under the Bill. Suppose that they also tell us that they would actually prefer it if the existing court were wound up to avoid any confusion or possible conflicts in functions. It seems right that we should be able to respond positively to such a request.
</p>

<a name="51109-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>I ask noble Lords to consider another, rather less romantic type of case, contemplated by Clause 34(2). The Commons Act 1908 referred to in subsection (2)(b) allowed regulations to be made controlling various aspects of the turning-out of stock on a common. Some of those regulations are still in force, yet they are exactly the sort of issues on which an association might seek improved powers under the Bill. The association would not want to have two different sets of controls in place on the same activities; it would want and deserve clarity. If the association wanted the 1908 Act regulations to go, we should be able to respond positively. The same would be true if the association wanted to switch from its current powers under an 1899 Commons Act scheme of management, as referred to in paragraph (c), or under an order made under the Commons Act 1876, referred to in paragraph (d), and given effect by a confirmation Act, and instead take improved powers under this Bill.

</p>

<a name="51109-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>We should be able to abolish, revoke, repeal or vary such arrangements in response to local demand, so long as we are satisfied that there is a good case for doing so and that nothing useful will be lost. Just to be sure, we have put in place a suitable safeguard. Both the 1876 Act orders and the 1899 Act schemes invariably carry with them statutory rights of public access. Sometimes the rights were expressed as being only for local people but they have recently been extended to cover the public as a whole by Section 15(2) of CROW. Plainly, we must not sweep them away, too, as part of any over-zealous tidying-up that we are being asked to carry out under a Clause 34 order.
</p>

<a name="51109-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>Clause 34(3) responds to that difficulty with a guarantee that we can do no such thing with one of those orders. If it made sense to change or revoke one of those orders or schemes, there would have to be a specific saving to preserve the public right of access. The same consideration would apply if we were to use an order to modify or repeal a local or personal Act&#151;as referred to in paragraph (e), which the noble Baroness talked about&#151;affecting management of a common or scheme of management made under a local or personal Act. Usually such arrangements work well and would act only if the local analysis were that the purposes set out in the existing provisions might conflict with the purposes of a commons association established under the Bill. Again, there would be absolute protection for any public access arrangements created by the local measure. We would also be alert to any other possible impact on the public interest.
</p>

<a name="51109-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>The clause is not about distant bureaucrats sweeping away valued local provisions; it is about ensuring that government have the capacity to respond positively if, and only if, an association asks us to remove an existing measure that might conflict with a new power that it wishes to have conferred on it. Any public access that comes with the measure will be preserved by any order we make. In addition, the order itself would be subject to the negative resolution procedure, which is a standard requirement of Clause 53(4). On that basis, I argue that this clause plays a valuable practical part in this Bill and that it should stand part.
</p>

<a name="51109-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>Amendment No. 189, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is unnecessary. The order referred to in the clause is an order under Section 25 that establishes a commons association. The establishment procedure requires the appropriate national authority to consult local interests and obtain substantial support before making an order. Any proposed changes to existing legislation or schemes of management would naturally be part of that establishment process. Local interests would be consulted and there would have to be demonstration of substantial support for the proposed changes. We argue that the noble Lord should be satisfied that there is no need for a separate requirement in this clause for advertisement and <br>&nbsp;<br>

consideration of representations regarding proposed changes to existing formal management arrangements on commons.
</p>

<a name="51109-47_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>On Amendment No. 191, we have previously discussed that principle in the context of the National Trust, when the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, moved Amendment No. 77A. She was most kind in agreeing to read <i>Hansard</i> carefully before considering whether she was satisfied with the intent of my reasoning on amending or repealing other enactments. I will not repeat what I said then.
</p>

<a name="51109-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>Amendment or repeal of any of the enactments referred to in this clause would not take place without consideration of the views of local interests. That would occur through the establishment order process that requires the appropriate national authority to have regard to representations and to ensure substantial support for the proposed order. Local interests may wish to take advantage of the powers which can be given to commons associations under the Bill; for example, to upgrade or modernise a management arrangement established under 19th century legislation. We want to ensure that this can be carried out without creating problems of conflict between existing legislation. We therefore believe that we need to retain the power for the Secretary of State for England or the National Assembly for Wales to amend or appeal the enactments listed in the clause. That is all I want to say in reply to the amendments.

He then went on to talk to the clause-stand-part Question, which is where I got into great difficulty, and he spoke of substantial support. I shall try to stick clearly to my amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>Whatever else is said in the whole of Clause 34, I do not think I am being frivolous in saying that subsections (1) to (3) become unnecessary because subsection (4) is a catch-all and end-all provision. The Government have written in:

<a name="51109-48_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   We have had a useful debate, and I thank the Minister for his detailed comments on the clause. However, he has not entirely convinced me. As the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, said in relation to subsection (4), it is not altogether clear that the Minister&#039;s assurance about an enactment is in fact contained in subsection (2). If that is the case&#151;I am sure that the Minister is sincere in this regard&#151;then it should state that, but it does not do so at the moment. If it did, that would at least clarify the situation somewhat.
</p>

<a name="51109-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>At present, Clause 34 seems to be a bit over the top. I understand what the Minister said about previous Acts of Parliament&#151;that they are 19th century, past their sell-by date and need modernising in terms of the priorities of a commons association. That was explained, but there are still certain anomalies in Clause 34.

<a name="51109-48_spnew11"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose </b>   moved Amendment No. 192:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>Page 19, line 22, at end insert &quot;to an adjacent commons association for a period not exceeding 12 calendar months&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51109-48_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>The noble Duke said: The paragraph in the Bill that allows for the transfer of rights, property and liabilities covers neither the destination nor the duration of such a transfer. The implication must be that English Nature may be involved.
</p>

<a name="51109-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>It is obviously prudent to allow for the possibility that an association established by government may fail. However, surely it does not follow that a second attempt will also fail. The land is still there; the commoners and the graziers are still there; and the need for an association is still there, so all possible steps should be taken to re-establish one as soon as possible. In the mean time, an adjoining association would certainly be better placed than a national organisation to carry out a caretaking role. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="51109-48_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I support this amendment in principle, but I am not sure about the period of 12 calendar months; it may need to be two years given the speed at which things move in relation to common land. It might be necessary to allow that length of time to sort things out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="51109-48_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Amendment No. 192 would constrain the ability of the national authority to transfer the rights, property and liabilities of a commons association that was being wound up. The amendment would allow transfer only to an adjacent commons association, and then only for a period of 12 months or less.
</p>

<a name="51109-48_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>Clause 35(1) sets out a number of reasons for an association to be wound up. It may have ceased to operate, it may be failing to discharge its functions effectively, or failing to pay due regard to the public interest. Perhaps the commoners have ceased commoning, or too few of them remain to make the association viable. In that event, there may well be good reasons why the association should be wound up. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC239"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC239</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The association may have a range of assets such as land, property, common rights or funds that need to be disposed of. Of course it may also have liabilities in the form of debts or obligations under, for example, agri-environment agreements.
</p>

<a name="51109-48_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>This clause would enable assets and liabilities to be transferred to a new association, an existing commons association or any other person or body. We do not think it right to constrain this power. It may be difficult to find an association willing to take on the assets, liabilities and responsibilities in question, or indeed there may be no neighbouring association established in the area and no prospect of one being established in future. We must remember that associations are bottom-up initiatives and it is not the role of the Secretary of State to require local interests to establish an association where none is wanted. We believe that there must be the flexibility to transfer assets as best makes sense in all the local circumstances. That could well favour another local commons association, but it may well not be an option. Moreover, limiting the transfer to a period of 12 months would not make sense in the circumstances I have described.
</p>

<a name="51109-48_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>I want to emphasise that the powers in Clause 35 are very much those of last resort. If an association still exists and is functioning well, there would be no need to use this power. I invite the noble Duke to consider withdrawing his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="51109-48_spnew14"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say on this subject. He has raised <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC240"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column GC240</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

some interesting questions. We are still not entirely clear on what liabilities commons associations might generate during their lifetime. Of course there could certainly be agri-environmental undertakings&#151;I do not consider them to be liabilities&#151;and I am not sure what would happen to such undertakings when the person undertaking them disappears. Obviously, if the liabilities and undertakings were to become too draconian, it is very unlikely that anyone would choose to set up a new commons association to take the place of the old one. This goes back to our earlier questions on whether some constraint should be placed on the way that debts are structured if they are engendered by a commons association.

<a name="51109-49_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My honourable friend the Minister of State (Rosie Winterton) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.

</p>

<a name="51109-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>We are committed to reforming National Health Service dentistry and improving access for patients. In the Written Statement of 16 July 2004 (<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, cols. <i>WS 89&#150;91</i>) the Government announced the twin targets of recruiting 1,000 additional whole-time dentists and funding 170 extra dental training places to address access issues. Both targets have now been achieved. Overall, over 1,400 dentists were recruited through a mixture of domestic and international recruitment. This contributed to a net increase of 1,100 dentists <sup>1</sup>  in the past year, more than twice the average increase over the previous seven years.
</p>

<a name="51109-49_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>The recruitment drive included (whole-time equivalent dentists): 216 from Poland via the central Department of Health recruitment initiative; 297 from local international recruitment; 230 via expansion of the International Qualifying Exam; 88 from domestic returners to practice, supported by the Keeping in Touch scheme; and 622 reported by primary care trusts from local NHS activity to expand capacity in existing dental practices.
</p>

<a name="51109-49_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>Some 189 additional dental students have now started their studies at dental school, 19 more than the original target. This brings the total number of dental undergraduates to 859, reflecting the popularity of dentistry as a career. This 29 per cent increase is being supported by capital investment of &#163;80 million over the four years from 2005&#150;06, and revenue costs reaching &#163;29 million by 2010&#150;11.

</p>

<a name="51109-49_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>Some 91 of the new dental training places have been allocated to the existing dental schools on a temporary basis while the Higher Education Funding Council for England conducts a bidding exercise to determine the permanent allocation of these places. This exercise will be completed by the end of January 2006.
</p>

<a name="51109-49_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>This Government are committed to NHS dentistry and improving access for patients. The immediate benefits of the recruitment of 1,400 dentists are already clear to patients. The undergraduate expansion will stabilise the supply of dentists in the longer term and by 2010 there will be 850 extra dentistry students in training. These achievements will support the move to local commissioning of dental services from next April and the accompanying changes to contractual arrangements for NHS dentists. These reforms, when <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS60"></a>

taken together with the healthy position on recruitment, will enable primary care trusts to replace capacity much more readily when other dentists leave the local area, the profession or increase their private work. The reforms will also improve the quality of dentists&#039; working lives in the NHS and support improvements in access for NHS patients.

<p><a name="wa_qn_0"></a>
<a name="51109w01_wqn0"></a><b> Earl Howe </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>Whether local authorities are expected to achieve targets in respect of children adopted from the care system; and, if so, what these targets are.  [HL2061]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="51109w01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  The Government have set targets for local authorities to increase the numbers of children who are adopted from care. The current target is to increase by 40 per cent. the number of looked-after children who are adopted by 2005 and to exceed this by achieving, if possible, a 50 per cent. increase by 2005&#150;06, from 1999&#150;2000.
</p>

<a name="51109w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>The Government have also set a target to increase to 95 per cent. by 2004&#150;05 the proportion of looked-after children placed for adoption within 12 months of the decision that adoption is in the child&#039;s best interests, up from 81 per cent. in 2000&#150;01, and to maintain this level up to 2006.
</p>

<a name="51109w01_para1"></a>

<a name="51109w01_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  All bail applicants are provided with a copy of the Home Office bail summary prior to the bail hearing.

Immigration judges will afford lesser evidential weight to summaries that do not reach an unrepresented applicant promptly or may even choose to exclude them.

<p><a name="wa_qn_2"></a>

<a name="column_WA76"></a>

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column WA76</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>pandemic they base their figure of &quot;at least 50,000 deaths&quot; in the United Kingdom, as stated by the Lord Warner on 17 October (<i>Official Report</i>, col. 566); and whether their purchase of 14.6 million courses of antivirals will prove adequate, given that they will not be fully available until September 2006.  [HL1863]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_3"></a>
<a name="51109w01_spmin2"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  The estimates and contingencies referred to in the Question relate to a possible flu pandemic among humans, not avian flu, which is a disease which primarily affects birds.
</p>

<a name="51109w01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>The estimate of &quot;at least 50,000&quot; deaths arising from a possible human flu pandemic is based on the case fatality for seasonal flu and experience from the 1957 pandemic. A pandemic strain could be more severe but the severity of the disease is expected to be reduced by treatment with antivirals. This is why we have purchased 14.6 million antivirals to treat the 25 per cent of the population that may become ill in a pandemic. The estimate is thus independent of the timing of the onset of a flu pandemic.
</p>

<a name="51109w01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a>In September 2005, we published a framework for the storage and distribution of the antiviral stockpile. This framework takes into account that we may need to prioritise antivirals if a pandemic emerges before our stockpile is complete in September 2006. The World Health Organisation has identified the United Kingdom as one of the best prepared countries in the world.

<a name="51109w01_wqn3"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_3"></a>What estimate they have made of possible fatalities in Wales arising from an avian flu pandemic.  [HL1906]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_4"></a>
<a name="51109w01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   Avian influenza rarely affects humans and hence it is unlikely to cause significant numbers of human fatalities even if there was an outbreak of avian influenza in poultry in the United Kingdom. If an   influenza strain emerges which readily infects humans and is easily transmitted, this could cause a pandemic. As outlined in the UK Influenza Pandemic Contingency Plan, we estimate that there could be a possible 2,800 excess deaths or more in Wales due to a human influenza pandemic. We are working closely with officials in the Welsh Assembly Government to co-ordinate planning for an influenza pandemic.

<p><a name="wa_st_7"></a>

<p><a name="wa_st_10"></a>
<a name="51109w01_spmin6"></a><b>The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </b>  It has been the policy of successive governments, at least since the 1920s, that the costs of court administration should be defrayed by litigants&#039; fees.
</p>

<a name="51109w01_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a>Over time, the range of costs taken into account when setting fees has varied. In 1992, the government of the day decided that&#151;in line with general government fee-charging policy&#151;court fees should be set to reflect the full cost of providing the service. This meant including for the first time the salaries of the full-time, senior judiciary (circuit judges and above) paid directly from the Consolidated Fund.

<a name="51109w02_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   All EU member states plus Norway and Iceland, with the exception of the UK and Ireland, operate a common visa policy which determines the short stay visa policy towards non-EU citizens.

<p><a name="wa_st_12"></a>
<a name="51109w02_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   The Croatian visa regime was introduced in 1999 to stem the rising number of asylum applications in the UK being received from Croatian nationals: there were 150 applications for asylum from nationals of Croatia in 1997, 335 in 1998 and 1,780 in 1999. It has clearly been effective in its objective as the number of asylum seekers from Croatia has fallen significantly: there were 115 applications for asylum from Croatian nationals in 2000, 35 in 2001, 35 in 2002, 15 in 2003, five in 2004 and one or two applications in the first half of 2005. All visa regimes are kept under review and introduced, or lifted, on the basis of immigration need. When considering removing an existing visa requirement we must ensure that any favourable change to the immigration threat from the nationality concerned is sustainable. I refer the noble Lord to the Answer I provided on 24 October (<i>Official Report</i>, <i>WA 153</i>) in which I made clear that the visa regime on Croatian nationals is the subject of ongoing review and we will lift the visa regime at the earliest possible time.

<a name="51109w02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The Government have applied sanctions against certain governments and individuals in situations where there have not been free and fair elections, such as the EU sanctions against Zimbabwe and Burma. The Government believe that the lack of a free and fair election constitutes an important element in the case for sanctions and that election monitors play a crucial role in providing information on how elections are conducted. Other elements which the Government take into account when considering sanctions include broader failures on the part of the target state and individuals to address good governance, human rights, democracy and the rule of law.

<a name="51109w02_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a>As catheterisation allows the entry of bacteria into the bladder, it frequently causes colonisation rather than infection. Consequently, assessments of CAUTIs based on bacterial numbers in urine rather than bacterial numbers and clinical symptoms will overestimate infection rates. However, it is estimated that 80 per cent. of urinary tract infections (UTIs) are associated with catheterisation and up to 5 per cent. of    UTIs develop into blood stream infections (bacteraemias) <sup>1</sup> .

The scheme has recently been formally evaluated and overall findings were positive on the model and quality of support provided. A copy   of the summary findings from the evaluation can   be obtained from www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/whatsnew1.html.

It is recognised that child victims of trafficking are likely to be in need of welfare services and protection under the Children Act.

<a name="51109w04_wqn6"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:

<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_39"></a>What advice they received that led them to oppose the initiative by the Belgian Environment Minister, Bruno Tobback, to halt imports of wild birds in March 2005; and whether the United Kingdom was the sole member state to oppose this initiative.  [HL1927]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_35"></a>
<a name="51109w04_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   A ban on imports of wild birds was raised by Belgium at the Environment Council meeting of 10 March 2005. The only other EU member to support Belgium was Hungary. The European Commission did not support a ban at that time as it could not be justified on animal health, welfare or conservation grounds. The UK, along with other member states, agreed with the European Commission assessment at that time.

<a name="51109w04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_21"></a>Since then both the UK and the European Commission have been monitoring changes to the global disease situation and we now agree with the European Commission that a temporary ban is appropriate.
