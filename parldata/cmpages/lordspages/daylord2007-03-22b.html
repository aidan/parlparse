We are open to undertaking new research where, in the opinion of the independent Medical Research Council, it is considered justified. The MRC has been asked to review research into rehabilitative therapies designed to improve the long-term health of veterans with persistent symptoms.</p>

We accept that, but we do not accept that there has been any attempt to reinterpret the tribunal decision. The Ministry of Defence does, however, need to communicate these issues better. My honourable friend the Minister for Veterans is committed to doing that.</p>

<a name="70322-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="07032272000016"></a>Approximately 9,000 UK service personnel may have been within the area of possible exposure at Khamisiyah.

It is recognised in the medical community, however, that all this research is peer-reviewed. It is shared within the community, so any research by the United States is available to us and is taken into account in our consideration of this very important and complex matter. However, I will write to the noble Lord with the data on expenditure by both the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>

If so, is it relevant that the Secretary of State recently acknowledged that medical services for troops were in some cases inadequate, and does this apply to the troops who came back from the first Gulf War as well as those who came back from the Iraq invasion? Finally, why is the Department of Health not represented on the Carden committee? It is obviously extremely important to have joined-up government in this matter.</p>

I will look into it and write to the noble Lord. Frankly, I do not accept the association he makes between concerns over veterans&#146; illnesses, issues relating to organophosphates and the Gulf War. We look into all these issues, not because we believe that there is necessarily a causal link, but because we have a duty to research these issues properly in order to understand whether there might be one and therefore whether it relates to the nerve agents used at Khamisiyah, raised by my noble friend, to organophosphates or indeed to anything that might cause the symptoms of Gulf War syndrome. However, that does not necessarily mean that we accept that there is a causal link.</p>

These have looked at a wide range of the possible causes of the syndrome. We accept the existence of Gulf War syndrome as an umbrella term; we do not have evidence to explain its cause. I am happy to write to my noble friend to detail the extent of the research undertaken in the United Kingdom and in the United States. All the research undertaken is under the direction of the Medical Research Council, which advises us on which research would most help us to understand whether there are causal links to anything the troops were exposed to.</p>

Does he realise that American research has shown that combinations of different organophosphates, of which sarin is one, can have different effects? The clothing and tents of troops were sprayed with Top Clip Gold Shield, which is an organophosphate. They were also given pyridostigmine bromide, which is a carbamate closely related to organophosphates and has the same effect on the cholinesterase. Does he not consider, given that the American research shows serious effects on human health, that exposure to these chemicals in combination, particularly when combined with DEET, which is a pyrethroid, has long-term health effects? This has been found by Hailey and Abou-Donia in America. Why do the British Government not accept it?</p>

That research, undertaken over many years here and in the United States, has been assessed by independent peer review. It has not concluded that there is a causal link; that has not been established.</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What effect European Union regulations on driving hours will have on volunteers in the Territorial Army, the fire service and special constables.</p>

Compliance with the prescribed rest requirements will determine how much time professional drivers can spend as volunteers. With the exception of emergency work, any time spent as a reservist, retained fire fighter or special constable will count as other work, not rest.</p>

<p><a name="st_14"></a>

Can he therefore confirm that these regulations will mean that people who wish to serve in the Territorial Army, the fire fighting services or as special constables will not be able to do so if they have already met the hours specified in the regulations; that is, they will not be able, for example, to drive for the Territorial Army because the time will count as working time and they will already have used all their driving hours?</p>

I am sure that matters will proceed pretty much as they have done since the current regulations were put in place in 1985. There are some variations to the way in which the regulation will take effect and it is true that there will be a slight problem in terms of organising operations that reservists have to drive on in order to take account of their fully paid work. The important point here is that we need to ensure that proper health and safety regulations are in place so that they and those who work with them are protected from tiredness. We do not want operations to be undermined by tiredness.</p>

There is now a high degree of confusion within the reserve community and among employers about the exact situation regarding the requirement for rest periods. Can the information be put on the Ministry of Defence website via the Department for Transport so that everyone knows what the rules are? If this has implications for the number of our reserves, can we have a statement on how it is to be handled by the Ministry of Defence?</p>

I know that the Ministry of Defence fully supports the spirit of this legislation and for many years has had measures in place to ensure that people are not unduly exposed to the risks I referred to earlier. I agree with the noble Lord that there is a dependence on reservists. They play a very important part in our operations.</p>

If we adhere to the drivers&#146; hours regulations and the working time directive, which also impacts on the TA, we run the risk of promoting soldiers in the TA who have some limitations in capability.</p>

Noble Lords will know that no foreign national prisoners have been released without full deportation consideration being given to their case. We are speeding up the process of consideration. Deportation is now being considered four months before release in the majority of deportation cases, and deportations of foreign national prisoners are occurring at a higher volume than ever before. As at 12 February, 2,240 foreign national prisoners had been deported, as I indicated. So I cannot accept the noble Lord&#146;s description.

Also, is it not possible to identify the national status of an individual at the beginning of the sentence rather than waiting until the sentence has been completed?</p>

He will know that we are now adopting a process of early identification. We are looking at a number of systemic changes in order to accurately identify at the beginning of the process the nationality of the individual who is brought through the system. The noble Lord will also know that the difficulty that we have had historically, in each Administration, is that we have had self-identification, so that the individual will not necessarily be able to be challenged about their nationality. The details of the numbers are clearly set out in Lin Homer&#146;s four reports and I invite the House to refresh their memory from those. There are copies in the Library.</p>

My point was that this context is clearly set out in Lin Homer&#146;s four full reports and that it would be far better for us to look at those. The figures were an issue of concern and as a result, as noble Lords will know, it was agreed that the director-general should set out these figures on a regular basis. It is very difficult to correlate figures pulled out from other reports away from the figures that she gives, because different dates give us different figures. That is why, although I am not specifically challenging, I am saying that one has to correlate those figures with the figures given by Lin Homer and the dates on which they were collected.</p>

On 15 March the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport announced a construction budget for the Olympic Delivery Authority of &#163;5.3 billion, comprising &#163;3.1 billion for the building of the Olympic Park and venues&#151;the core Olympic costs&#151;&#163;1.7 billion for Olympic infrastructure and regeneration, linking the park to the rest of the Lower Lea Valley, and &#163;500 million for programme contingency. Tax on this of around &#163;840 million is to be met by government. There is also an unallocated programme contingency of &#163;2.2 billion including tax, &#163;390 million for non-ODA provision including sport, and &#163;600 million for wider security costs.</p>

One particular concern is of the bill being passed on to the National Lottery, which has now increased by &#163;675 million to &#163;2.2 billion. Surely that is going to have an impact on future grants to arts bodies, heritage organisations, charities and sporting organisations all around the country.</p>

The noble Lord is right that it will impact upon certain aspects of the heritage and arts budgets, although not the sports budget, which we are guaranteed will play its part with regard to the Olympics. We have entered into an agreement with the Mayor of London that part of the land development profits on the Olympic Park site will be redirected to the lottery so that we make up lost ground in terms of the resources available in future years.</p>

Does my noble friend support the idea of making these the greenest of Games? We must ensure a green legacy, especially in the east side of London, so that once the Games have gone we still have something left.

It made a profit that was sufficient to pay for the building of the Albert Hall, and for the establishment of Imperial College and the forerunner of the V&amp;A. The surplus that was invested has provided a fund of &#163;50 million providing for scholarships for students in design and engineering. What was it about the 19th<sup></sup>century that enabled people to do projects on a grand scale without having to look to the taxpayer to bail out the inefficiencies and losses which have not been anticipated?</p>

It is important to view the Olympic Games in 2012 as a similar opportunity for the 21st century. That is why the Government, while having due regard to the costs, were very concerned that the project should be translated into a regeneration project in which the emphasis upon the legacy from the Games should be all pervasive. The noble Lord is absolutely right&#151;the Games need to be, and will be, an outstanding success. Of at least equal importance is the legacy for the British people that this opportunity provides.</p>

<a name="07032272000085"></a><b><a name="70322-0002.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="07032272000383"></a>Baroness Walmsley</b> rose to call attention to the monitoring by Parliament and Government of the quality, value for money and transparency of public services commissioned from the private sector; and to move for Papers.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="07032272000086"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, all of us in your Lordships&#146; House pay our taxes and, like our fellow citizens, we are very keen to ensure that the money is spent by national and local government wisely and carefully. We want to see value for money, services delivered by people who are expert in their field and fairness in any competition to gain contracts for the work.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="07032272000087"></a>There is one overarching principle underpinning what I want to say today: transparency in the way public money is spent forms the democratic link between those being taxed and those spending the taxes on their behalf. In a free and democratic society, monitoring and transparency in the funding of public services are essential.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="07032272000088"></a>None of us on these Benches wants to tax the British public overall any more than they are already taxed. We may want to tax things differently, such as the environmental taxes that we have long proposed, but we certainly do not want to tax more. That is why I feel it is vital to scrutinise very carefully how public money&#151;our money&#151;is spent. Historically, public services were mostly delivered by the ranks of employees of government departments and their agents. That was a long time ago. Nowadays, there are actually fewer real public services than there used to be, following the series of privatisations of the past three decades. The supply of water, telephone services, electricity and gas are now private services. The consumer can choose their provider of these domestic services. The provision of train and bus journeys is now a private service, and there are many more examples. There are even plans to privatise social services, about which I am extremely cautious, since people&#146;s lives are at stake.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="07032272000089"></a>Some public services are still controlled by local and national government, although nowadays they are hardly delivered by them at all. The ranks of civil servants and local authority employees have been drastically reduced. Instead, many workers delivering public services are employees of private companies and charitable organisations which compete with others to deliver public services. That is a very good thing. We have seen major improvements in the delivery of some services because of that competition. People earn a good living from it, and companies make fair profits. That is absolutely fine. We see some excellent examples where two organisations can pool their expertise to deliver a public service. I cite for example the partnership between an arm of Serco, a private company, and the voluntary organisation I CAN. They combine their expertise to promote speaking and listening skills in schools. The children&#146;s services provided by the NSPCC and other charities are excellent and delivered by experts on the basis of evidence of what works.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="07032272000090"></a>Yet I was most concerned to read recently in the Charity Commission report <I>Stand and Deliver</I> that only 12 per cent of voluntary organisations undertaking public service contracts are paid in full, which undermines the whole concept of contestability. How can the Minister, on behalf of the Government, justify such a thing?</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="07032272000091"></a>The role of government departments, non-departmental government bodies and local authorities has changed. They are now strategic service commissioners rather than having the provider role of the past. In these circumstances, the quality of the commissioning guarantees the taxpayer value for money. The quality of the monitoring ensures that the taxpayer continues to get value over the years of the contract.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="07032272000092"></a>There are now two giants in the delivery of public services: Serco and Capita. Serco was described by the <I>Guardian</I> as,</p>
<ul><a name="07032272000281"></a>&#147;the biggest company you have never heard of&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000239"></a>This is where I come to the transparency part of my question. These two companies run enormous quantities of our public services. Last year, Serco&#146;s net income was &#163;79.5 million and Capita&#146;s profit before tax is quoted on its website as &#163;193.2 million. Yet Capita is known only for the London congestion charge and Serco is hardly known at all to the man in the street.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="07032272000093"></a>Serco manages transport systems, facilities for the Atomic Energy Authority, air-traffic control systems, both civilian and for the RAF, provides electronic tagging for offenders and runs prisons, young offender institutions and an immigration removal centre. It provides health services and is approved to bid for the operation and turnaround of failing NHS trusts. It runs education support and information services for schools and it operates leisure centres. It is a British-based, international company, but most of its turnover comes from the UK.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="07032272000094"></a>Capita is another British company; it has been part of the FTSE 100 since 2004. It has grown from a &#163;100 million company in 1997, when Labour came to power, to a &#163;4 billion FTSE company by 2006. No wonder its former executive chairman felt able to loan the Labour Party &#163;1 million. The company&#146;s public service contracts range through education&#151;it runs all teachers&#146; pensions and is the leading provider of IT support and software to schools and local authorities&#151;to health services, the London congestion charge, the criminal records disclosure system, National Rail, BBC information and TV licensing, the operation of benefits such as the education maintenance allowance and an enormous number of business management and IT services to central and local government. There is much more, too.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="07032272000095"></a>So widespread are the services provided by these companies that we have no idea whether there are any conflicts of interests within the spectrum of what they do. How can any one person outside the company know that? So enormous are they that the whole of life as we know it in this country would collapse if they withdrew their services, fell by the wayside commercially in some way or were taken over by a foreign company.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07032272000096"></a>In any other sector the competition commissioner would have something to say about this. If they controlled such a large proportion of the media, some regulator would have something to say. If they controlled such a large percentage of any other industry, there would be concern. Yet nobody seems concerned. Do the Government have any plans to limit the proportion of public services that can be delivered by any one company?</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07032272000097"></a>It behoves us all to ensure that profitable public service contracts are awarded fairly, after fair competition. Much is at stake. Those who rely most on public services are the most vulnerable members of society. For their sake, we must achieve value for money and ensure that the relevant information is in the public domain. Sadly, there is evidence that that is not always the case.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07032272000098"></a>I quote one example given to me this week by my noble friend Lady Hamwee, the deputy chairman of the London Assembly, whose role is to scrutinise the office of the Mayor of London on behalf of the citizens of the capital. She is unable to be in her place today, but she told me that when the London congestion charge scheme was introduced, the contract between Transport for London, chaired by the mayor, and Capita, which runs the congestion charge scheme, was not put into the public domain. She and a Labour Member of the Assembly requested it on a number of occasions. They were told that it contained a confidentiality clause that precluded both parties from publishing it, so the mayor and Transport for London could not provide it for her. Capita came up with the converse reason. Eventually, the mayor agreed to ask Capita to agree to its release. It consisted of 600 pages, and it crashed the GLA computer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07032272000099"></a>On a general point, it is inevitable that private companies will want to keep the detail of their relationship with their customers to themselves. Theirs is a very different culture from that of the public services. It is therefore all the more necessary for the public sector to be alert to that and to so arrange things from the start that there is maximum openness about contracts for public services.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07032272000100"></a>That becomes all the more important because of the scale of the matter. Recent estimates by Kable, an organisation that provides technology research and analysis on UK government and public services, suggest that almost one fifth of public sector services&#151; &#163;60 billion&#151;could be delivered through outsourcing to private and voluntary bodies. The principal sectors targeted are health and education, much of it IT services and management tools, but a lot of it is local government services too. It estimates that the market for public sector outsourcing for 2005-06 reached &#163;49.4 billion and will grow by 30 per cent over the next three years, to reach an annual spend of &#163;64.3 billion, a growth rate of over 9 per cent.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07032272000101"></a>With public spending reaching &#163;550 billion in 2005-06, the pressure to contain costs and improve service delivery is stronger than ever. It is a great challenge to the private companies and voluntary organisations in the field. It is also a great challenge to the commissioners of services to ensure that they are wise commissioners, that the contracts are right, that they deliver value, that monitoring will expose failure that can be rooted out wherever it is found and that the public are not bound to contracts for 30 years from which they cannot be extricated. I fear that many PFI contracts will turn out to be of that nature. They are short-term solutions to long-term problems, and they put the country in hock for decades.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07032272000102"></a>In my field, education, schools now have control over the vast majority of their own budget. That is a good thing in the main, although there is enormous pressure on local authorities to find the money for the support services for which they are still responsible. They have to pick up the pieces when individual schools fail children, and that can be very hard. It makes schools vulnerable to the clever sales pitches of companies that sell them the latest whizz-bang techie idea or snake oil that will solve all their problems. I think that rather ironic description applies to the military equipment companies that have persuaded about 3,500 schools to buy equipment to fingerprint their pupils for purposes as trivial as borrowing library books or paying for their lunch.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07032272000103"></a>I will not go into the detail of the practice here, since the Minister replying today will not be in a position to answer me. Suffice it to say that the DfES has really no idea what is going on out there. It does not know how many schools are doing this or how many children are affected. The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, in answer to a question from me earlier this week, revealed that his department is unaware that most of those schools are flouting good practice by not getting the parents&#146; permission for this infringement of their children&#146;s rights. That is the sort of thing that can happen when services to the public sector are not properly monitored. The Government are walking blindfolded into a future identity fraud crisis, and the parents and children do not even know about it or realise the implications of the practice.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07032272000104"></a>Proper monitoring of outsourced public services is essential. Having opened up the market and allowed schools to spend their own money, the Government must introduce statutory guidance to regulate schools that use those systems. It is simply bad practice for schools to keep a record of children's precious and unique biometric information, sometimes on insecure computers that can be hacked into, without parents&#146; informed consent. The Government should do something about it before it is too late.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07032272000105"></a>The other most contentious involvement of private sector companies and voluntary organisations in education is in the takeover of city academies, in exchange for a fairly paltry sum of money, some of which is never even paid. We on these Benches have always welcomed the injection of money and ideas from successful business people into our schools but not at the cost of relinquishing public accountability and democratic control. When we talk about state provision of compulsory school-age education, we must have local democratic accountability, and that is missing from these schools.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07032272000106"></a>Some academies have awarded valuable contracts for services to companies owned by their sponsors without the proper competitive tendering process that they are supposed to operate. According to an article in the <I>Guardian</I> last week, that has happened in the Grace Academy in Solihull, the King&#146;s Academy in Middlesbrough and the West London Academy. In some cases, the DfES was persuaded to waive the usually strict rules about tendering to allow that to happen. The DfES has refused to answer questions about whether these are one-off situations or whether the practice is widespread.</p>

<a name="70322-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07032272000107"></a>In these matters, as in all the other situations I have mentioned, the confidence of the public will be gained only if transparency and fairness are the watchwords. Examples such as these undermine the confidence of the public in these public/private arrangements and make them suspicious that someone is lining his pocket at the expense of taxpayers. I accept that, in most cases, that is not so. Most companies and voluntary organisations give good value and a fair deal, but we need to be convinced that the monitoring of this brave new world of private delivery of services is rigorous and that the levers available to correct poor delivery are powerful. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

However, the issues that she raised in her speech and that are implicit in her Motion on the private provision of public services are, I suggest, equally important to all providers of public services, whether public, private or third sector.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70322-0003.htm"/>


<a name="70322-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07032272000109"></a>There is something slightly quaint about singling out private sector providers for special attention. As the noble Baroness said, in many parts of public services, such as health, adult social care, children&#146;s services and criminal justice, a mixed economy of providers has been the reality for some time. As someone who has, in a variety of roles, spent over two decades promoting such a mixed economy, I believe that if it is done properly, the public can only benefit. </p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07032272000110"></a>I want to concentrate on this wider context and the arrangements necessary to ensure quality, value for money and transparency among all types of public service providers. I shall deal briefly with a great myth that continues to be aired noisily by those who regard private provision of public services as, to coin a phrase, the Great Satan. Good and bad public and private providers of services exist; they have always existed and, no doubt, they will continue to exist. The trick is to weed them out or not to appoint them in the first place.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07032272000111"></a>My experience as a long-standing public servant is that there is not much to choose from between a public and a private monopoly for giving the public a raw deal. I have seen and contracted for private providers in health, adult social care and custodial services that match and exceed their public service counterparts. I have also seen the reverse. The evidence on private and hospital-cleaning contractors, for example, is that they are both as good and as bad as their public counterparts. Very often, it is more a matter of the quality of the contract and its management than anything else.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07032272000112"></a>Let us never forget that group of small business men with profit-and-loss accounts&#151;we call them GPs&#151;who have been providing our primary care in the NHS for nearly 60 years. More recently, in the field of elective surgery we have seen the introduction of independent sector treatment centres, which has finally convinced some sceptics in the NHS that you can separate emergency and planned surgery lists and that that leads to fewer cancelled operations and increased adoption of day surgery. In all these examples and many others, fair and well drawn contracts, issued on a competitive basis and properly enforced, are critical to success. No one is arguing with that, but even-handedness is the key.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07032272000113"></a>The ISTC example illustrates the benefits of competition in improving value for money in public services, but we have seen the same results in other areas. My experience as a Minister, as a director of social services and as the first chairman of the Youth Justice Board leaves me in no doubt that a degree of contestability is critical in most of our public services if we are to foster innovation and improve productivity.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07032272000114"></a>As public expectations of our public services rightly grow, the biggest challenge is to respond more effectively and productively than has sometimes been the case. That is why a twin-track approach of investment and reform in areas as diverse as health and probation is important in improving these services. Both services have had a lot of extra money, but they still have some way to go in delivering the productivity improvements that need to accompany that investment. Probation is a good example of where more properly commissioned and contracted private and voluntary sector services, as envisaged in the Offender Management Bill, might also help to reduce the use of custody.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07032272000115"></a>We have a long and honourable tradition of voluntary organisations providing public services, which the noble Baroness rightly alluded to. Among the best things that I did as a director of social services in Kent was to contract out to Age Concern many day centres for elderly people and to hand over family support work to voluntary organisations. The result was services that were more responsive to the users than the previous public service provider had been.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07032272000116"></a>Of course, not every voluntary organisation is an excellent service provider. I have terminated contracts with voluntary organisations, just as I have terminated contracts with public providers. It comes down to the processes by which you monitor, contract and collect information. To make things more complex, we are now in an era of joint ventures between the different sectors, and we have an emerging social enterprise sector. There is no point in concentrating on the private sector alone. We are moving into a period when a far more complex range of people, in joint ventures in some cases, will provide our public services under contract. This means that we need approaches and arrangements for guaranteeing quality and value for money that operate even-handedly across all providers of public services, irrespective of their governance systems. That is particularly crucial now that the public are largely indifferent about who provides those public services&#151;and they are still public services, commissioned by public bodies that are accountable for spending the money that they use to award those contracts.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="07032272000117"></a>In the NHS, for example, people across the social classes want more say on where and when they are treated. We are moving towards a situation where people want more choice. That is why the Government are right to promote choice across the public services. This is a means of improving user experience. There is nothing that so interests people as getting a good deal. Leaving them to make some of those choices and to report on their experience is a good way of driving up the quality of our public services. Choice for users is a mechanism by which we can often make improvements. This approach is also generating more and better information for service users. I cite, for example, a pioneering website called &#147;Patient Opinion&#148;, set up by a Sheffield GP, which allows patients to post their own hospital experiences and encourages hospital improvements. We need more of those improvements. We can trust the service users to drive the quality and VFM agendas.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07032272000118"></a>Choice and contestability are two key drivers for improved public services, but they cannot do the job on their own. We also need better commissioning and contracting, good and open performance measurement, and more effective and even-handed regulation. The Government have been working hard to improve those arrangements and I am glad to have had the opportunity to play my part in bringing about those improvements.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07032272000119"></a>Local government has done much good work in improving public sector commissioning and contracting, and we all have a lot to learn from its experience in that area under successive Governments&#151;I am not making a party-political point. Other public services could well learn from that experience, too. However, we have to recognise that outsourcing is not a dirty word; it is a way of getting a job done more effectively than often a particular public corporation can do. Done properly, outsourcing is a sensible way of using public money. Saving up our pennies to buy a massively expensive piece of capital equipment that can quickly become out of date is poor value for money; that approach is often better replaced by leasing arrangements, where the lease requires the provider of that expensive kit to train the staff, maintain it and keep it up to date.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07032272000120"></a>These approaches that involve the private sector can bring huge benefits to the public sector and achieve better value for money. However, none of these changes in any way diminishes the public accountability of the public body that accounts for the expenditure of that money. Nothing in any way removes Parliament&#146;s ability to scrutinise that way of providing public services.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="07032272000121"></a>I want to spend a few moments talking about targets, which has become a dirty word in public services. It is naive and disingenuous to suggest that targets have no place in this area. As an aside, I was mildly amused to hear that the Leader of the Opposition is very keen to abolish all targets in the health service but wants to introduce them for climate change. There is an interesting approach on these issues when you are in opposition, compared with when you are in government. The much dreaded targets in the NHS have actually reduced waiting times and cancer deaths and improved the quality of our A&amp;E services. We must be selective in the way that targets are used, but they are a way of driving up improvements in our services.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07032272000122"></a>We need good performance, assessment and measurement in our public services and we need to make sure that that work is often done on an independent basis by independent bodies, such as Ofsted and the Healthcare Commission. They have a responsibility to put their findings into the public arena and to make that information available to the public, which also feeds into helping the public themselves to improve the choices that they make in the use of public services.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07032272000123"></a>Let me finally say a few words about regulation. In this country, too much public inspection and regulation has been allowed to become over-bureaucratic and, in some bodies, has delivered a degree of mission creep. The Government are right to have tried to tackle this problem. They should be commended for the Better Regulation Task Force and its work and for trying to integrate and focus many of our public inspectorates. In health and social care, there will be a new combined regulator, which will have to behave even-handedly with service providers, whether they come from the public, private or voluntary sectors.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="07032272000124"></a>This is an issue for debate and I am sure that we will debate it further, because the Government will need to legislate in this area. My critical point is that, in regulation, we need to adopt an even-handed approach to providers. There need to be the same rules for entry to the market for providers, whoever they are and wherever they come from. There need to be the same rules for removal from the market for failing bodies. This needs to be even-handed and we should not perpetuate the myth that somehow one particular type of provider is supremely better than another type of provider because they come from either the public sector or the voluntary sector. That is simply not true; there is no historical evidenceto support it. This is all about good contractingand commissioning of services, good performance measurement and assessment, and good regulation on an even-handed basis.</p>

<a name="07032272000125"></a><b><a name="70322-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07032272000385"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> My Lords, my noble friend Lady Walmsley raised a number of important issues in an excellent opening speech to a very important debate. The fact that the noble Lord, Lord Warner, called the issues that she raised quaint smacks of enormous complacency in a number of areas, two of which I will explore in my speech. I want to concentrate on the lack of transparency in two areas.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07032272000126"></a>First, the line between the public and the private has become so blurred that it is very hard for the public to follow lines of accountability; that is not acceptable. It is clear to the public that they pay for such services, especially at this time of year when council tax bills land on their doormats and their tax  returns have just been filed. A blurring of that line undermines the very reason behind a democratic structure at national and local level. The problem for the public is that the line between the public and private sectors in the provision of what are traditionally known as public services used to be defined by who delivered the service. The noble Lord, Lord Warner, is right that the model where the public sector both commissioned and delivered the service is very old-fashioned. I am not commending a return to the days when DLOs delivered everything without question. However, the public are not aware of who is delivering the service beyond the fact that they are on the receiving end. They see the lorries of the waste collector or the vans of the sub-contractor and that is the nearest that they come to knowing who is delivering the service. The niceties of who has commissioned the service and of the contract are not something that they are privy to.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07032272000127"></a>Does that matter if the service is excellent? Do the public want to know who is delivering the service? The noble Lord, Lord Warner, said that the public are indifferent. In the short term it is true; they only want to know if something goes wrong. In the long term the blurring of the line, if it is not replaced with anything else, has enormous implications for the important connection between the public and their services, and for democracy itself. Of course, we have moved on from the days when DLOs delivered everything, and the days under the Conservative Government when compulsory competitive tendering ruled the day and the work went to the lowest-price bidder, no matter that the lowest price often represented the worst value. Authorities were unable to question that.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07032272000128"></a>There are advantages in the public and private sectors working together; for example, in the management skills and financial acumen of the business community and by bringing better value for taxpayers. In the long term, however, we have a long way to go to get the model right. I do not believe that times have moved on significantly. In 2002, the Institute for Public Policy Research looked into some of the 378 PFI projects completed by central and local government and found that only 23 had been completed on time and had had an independent value-for-money examination by independent audit bodies. In 2003, the Audit Commission looked at the operation of the early PFI school contracts. It reached some important conclusions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="07032272000262"></a>&#147;The synergies expected to come from the PFI process had failed to materialise. That type of auditing exercise must now be urgently repeated across other policy areas, particularly in the NHS and the prison sector&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70322-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07032272000129"></a>Both those examples are from some years ago and I expect that the Minister will be able to say that matters have improved substantially in those bodies. However, in 2006, in its strategic plan, the Audit Commission recognised that there was a real problem with transparency. It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="07032272000263"></a>&#147;If local public bodies are to improve services in ways that people recognise and value, they need to engage better with local people. The governance frameworks that underpin accountability for public money and improving services are evolving&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000240"></a>&#147;Evolving&#148; is a rather nice euphemism for saying that they are virtually non-existent and there is a very long way to go.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07032272000130"></a>At the moment, one reason why the public often choose litigation, encouraged by certain solicitors, is that it is the clear and obvious route. I do not think that any of us believes that litigation offers the most desirable way forward in public services. The accountability model would mean that the public were involved and understood how to break into the difficult cycle of drawing up contracts. When does anyone go to their local authority and say, &#147;We would be interested in the contract being delivered differently&#148;? It is hard enough for local authority members let alone normal people to know when to break into the cycle of a PCT and say, &#147;What we are receiving is unsatisfactory. We would like it to be delivered differently&#148;. Matters such as the contract cycle, who draws them up and how to make a difference are extremely opaque. That other line of accountability, the ballot box, also becomes undermined if the system is opaque as people will become apathetic, depressed and unable to address the issues. There is an enormous need for these matters to be much more clearly outlined.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07032272000131"></a>I turn to another issue that my noble friend highlighted in her Motion: parliamentary accountability. I was struck by comments of Sir Peter Gershon, in November 2006, when he was talking about the public sector of environmental services. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="07032272000264"></a>&#147;In some areas I believe there has to be greater collaboration. I look at environmental services, I could not find a single person in the public sector, who could tell me what the structure of the supply market looked like for environmental services. How many companies there were, were they increasing or reducing, or was business equally spread?</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="07032272000265"></a>So I went to one of the suppliers in the market and asked them, and they said would you like me to email it to you or send it through the post and you can have it tomorrow morning. It actually told me that over a five-year period the number of suppliers was reducing. How can the public sector procure efficiently without that information? It is just about smart procurement&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000241"></a>That is a worrying situation, but I am sure the Minister will have an answer for it. It is on the public procurement side of a fairly centralised system, but I deal with Defra, which has an extensive list of quangos&#151;over 60&#151;many of which are very large; for example, the Environment Agency, which is busy outsourcing. To have any idea of what is being purchased, by whom and to what effect becomes very complicated.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07032272000132"></a>In not giving quangos complete independence, the Government remain able to keep a handle on them. However, they often choose that as an excuse to slope shoulders and claim that the Government are not responsible for what that particular body does. I give the Minister a couple of examples. One is the Food Standards Agency, which does a valuable job. The Government claim that it is independent&#151;it is at arm&#146;s length&#151;yet it clearly is responsible to the Department of Health. How do the public concentrate on getting the Food Standards Agency, for example, to address the issues in which they are interested? The FSA has a better record than most in holding public meetings and making the records of them publicly available. Even within Defra there are several bodies which do not meet in public and do not have publicly available records. The picture is very complicated.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07032272000133"></a>I refer the Minister to a debate in which I was involved last year about accountability to Parliament of a public body. The Minister will recall there was a considerable debate around the cuts in funding to the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. Its parent body&#151;NERC&#151;was created by royal charter, and NERC's website says it is accountable to Parliament. Yet it seemed that it was not that accountable. I accept that it needs to be responsible for commissioning scientific research without political interference, but we were talking about decisions of cutting public funding that had united both the scientific and the political establishments, and still the Science Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, was able to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="07032272000266"></a>&#147;As for parliamentary accountability, it has always been clear that the council is accountable for its performance&#148;,&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/3/06; col. 10.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000242"></a>but not for anything else. That means that even though a body may have a charter making it responsible to Parliament, Ministers can decide that where it is inconvenient it is not accountable to Parliament. In reply to a similar question from me, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="07032272000267"></a>&#147;I understand the legal position ... NERC is an independent body and the decisions that it reaches are solely for its own council&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/3/06; col. 1278.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000243"></a>That draws up the fact that, if a body is stated to be accountable to Parliament, certainly it should be.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07032272000134"></a>I close by re-emphasising my support for the stand of my noble friend Lady Walmsley on very large private organisations such as Capita being subject to proper scrutiny. She was completely right when she said that that is the sort of issue that the Competition Commission should be considering and that if it was in any other sector, it would be called into question. The fact that the public are not aware of who is delivering the service, except when something goes wrong, means that there is not much demand from them for such scrutiny. It is not like the supermarkets, for example, where that is very plain, which is why the Competition Commission recognised that there was public concern. If the public heard and understood the points made by my noble friend today, they too would have deep concern and would fully back her call.</p>

Too rarely is there an opportunity to talk about a development that is profoundly affecting many areas of our lives. I will concentrate on one area only: criminal justice.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07032272000136"></a>The Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I am a member, is undertaking an inquiry into the treatment of old people in healthcare and social care settings. We have been hearing very interesting evidence and already we have heard enough to make it clear that our report will have to consider the accountability of private care homes. However, as we are at the evidence-collecting stage, I can do no more than whet your Lordships' appetites about that. We shall also shortly publish a report on the treatment of asylum seekers and there, too, we shall probably consider the accountability of the private companies that carry out forcible removals and are involved in other ways.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07032272000137"></a>I turn to the situation in criminal justice and particularly the contracting out of prisons to private companies. I do not want to talk about the principle of those prisons, although I know that it is very controversial. I want to talk about quality, value for money and transparency&#151;transparency in particular. How can we in Parliament know whether there is quality and value for money and whether we are being well served by those providers if it is difficult to find out about their performance?</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07032272000138"></a>Let me start in the obvious place. The annual report and accounts of Her Majesty's Prison Service, which is a report made to the House of Commons, is where one goes to find out about the performance of the Prison Service. It is packed with information on performance against key performance indicators on a range of measures: escape, serious assault, self-inflicted death, resettlement, staff sickness, health and safety, public health, drug treatment programmes and the cost of everything. However, there is something very odd about that report. As it says on the cover, it reports only on public sector prisons, which contain about 90 per cent of prison places. So 10 per cent of the operation of prisons in England and Wales is not reported on annually in a report presented to Parliament. That is not the case in Scotland, where the report covers all prisons and the information is aggregated. So I ask the Minister my first question. Am I mistaken in thinking that the annual report to Parliament of the Prison Service covers only 90 per cent of the prisons in England and Wales and there is no similar reporting mechanism to Parliament for private sector prisons?</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07032272000139"></a>In reply, the Minister may be hastily advised to say that there is a report, the Office for Contracted Prisons statement of performance and financial information, on the website of the National Offender Management Service. However, before he replies, I will tell him that that report will not answer my question, as it includes data on three public prisons as well which operate under service-level agreements. I should tell the House that the Government do have a performance rating system for prisons. Level 4 is the highest rating, and indicates an exceptionally high performance. Level 3 is applied to those prisons that meet most of their targets. Level 2 is for prisons with a limited regime or with significant or major problems. Level 1 is applied to prisons that are failing seriously.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07032272000140"></a>The figures can be found only on the Prison Service website. Figures for the end of September 2006 showed the following: 20 per cent of public sector prisons and 9 per cent of private sector prisons were performing at level 4&#151;the best level; 68 per cent of public sector prisons and 64 per cent of private sector prisons were performing at level 3&#151;in other words, were quite good; and 12 per cent of public sector prisons and 27 per cent of private sector prisons were performing at level 2&#151;in other words, were quite bad. I am afraid that I cannot give the House the latest figures for private sector prisons, as those figures have disappeared. Only figures for the public sector prisons now appear on the Prison Service website.</p>

<a name="70322-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07032272000141"></a>My second set of questions is therefore this: can the Minister say where the figures have gone, on whose authority they were removed, and what will replace them in the public domain? I accept entirely that he will not know the answers to those questions, and I do not expect him to. I do, however, assume that he will be able to write to someone who does and let me know the mystery of the disappearing figures.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07032272000142"></a>We must conclude that there is no annual report to Parliament on the performance of private prisons; so where can we look for information on them? We can, for example, find out about a prison called Rye Hill, which is run by a company called GSL, if we look at the prison&#146;s website, which is very nice. It sets out the prison&#146;s aspirations:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="07032272000268"></a>&#147;Here at HMP Rye Hill we pride ourselves on making the difference to all we come into contact with ... Our prison staff are highly trained in the necessary skills required to operate a modern prison. Management are clear on leadership and direction&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000244"></a>Its mission statement is,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="07032272000269"></a>&#147;To be the leading provider of privately managed custodial services in the world ... We have a total commitment to training our employees to know their job&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000143"></a>The latest report of 2005 by Anne Owers, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, on Rye Hill, is not on that website. She concludes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="07032272000270"></a>&#147;Our 2003 report described residential staff who were relatively inexperienced and lacking in confidence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000245"></a>&#147;In 2005&#148;, she said,</p>
<ul><a name="07032272000282"></a>&#147;this situation had worsened. We had very serious concerns about safety at Rye Hill. Staff lacked experience and confidence in managing an experienced prisoner population; this was exacerbated by the absence of visible management support, very low staffing levels and high staff turnover ... We found evidence of mobile phones, and we were told by prisoners of the ready availability of drugs and weapons ... and there had been a number of recent serious incidents&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000246"></a>There are other matters in the report which I cannot quote because of the sub judice rule.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="07032272000144"></a>Dovegate is another private prison, which is part of the Serco group, which the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has already mentioned. Serco&#146;s website says of its prison activities:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="07032272000271"></a>&#147;In all our prisons we strive to hold our inmates safely, securely and with dignity and respect&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000247"></a>The chief inspector published her report on Dovegate last week. She says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="07032272000272"></a>&#147;When we last inspected in 2003, we were concerned by the low numbers of staff and their inexperience in dealing with serious and experienced offenders ... Worryingly, this unannounced full follow up inspection found that, while a few areas had improved, Dovegate was no safer or more controlled than in 2003. Senior Serco managers assured us&#151;as they had in 2003&#151;that they appreciated the seriousness of the situation and had appointed a new director specifically to turn matters around, but it is of concern that so little progress had been made since our last visit&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70322-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="07032272000145"></a>Serco also runs Doncaster prison. At the end of 2005, the chief inspector found a prison that had slipped back since the last inspection. She said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07032272000283"></a>&#147;respect was seriously undermined by the physical conditions in which many prisoners lived, which in some cases were squalid. Many prisoners lacked pillows, adequate mattresses, toilet seats ... notice-boards and places to store belongings&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000248"></a>Only just over one in three prisoners were actually in work at any one time. She concluded her report by saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="07032272000273"></a>&#147;Our main concern was not only that managers had failed to tackle the problems we pointed out at the last inspection, but that the prison had deteriorated in some important respects&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70322-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07032272000146"></a>My question to the Minister is this: in the absence of an annual report on these prisons, and until the chief inspector visits&#151;not annually, but basically about every five years&#151;all we know about these prisons comes from their websites, so would it not aid transparency if they were at least required to put a link on their websites to the chief inspector&#146;s latest report about their prison?</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07032272000147"></a>I shall move on to say a word about the contracting process, and whether that could be more transparent too. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that this is very important. There is a secure training centre, a sort of children&#146;s prison, called Oakhill, which holds 75 very vulnerable children. The latest inspection report noted that there was only one qualified social worker on the staff. Information provided by the Minister to the Joint Committee on Human Rights has shown that over a six-month period there were occasions when the minimum staffing levels of the Youth Justice Board were not met. In a later written response to a debate in which this was raised, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, told those who had spoken:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="07032272000274"></a>&#147;The part of the country in which Oakhill is situated has very high employment levels and this may have hampered the contractors&#146; earlier efforts to maintain high and stable staffing levels&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000249"></a>I find that baffling. When the contract was first drawn up, did not those writing it know that Oakhill was located in a high employment area? So far as I know, the contracts are not in the public domain. Indeed, I would draw to the attention of the Minister the fact that the Scottish Prison Service has all its contracts on its website without the financial information.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07032272000148"></a>Finally, I want to indicate why the lack of transparency and dearth of readily available information is so damaging to our being able to monitor these prisons. During the Report stage of the Offender Management Bill in the other place, the Minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07032272000284"></a>&#147;we would contend that the successful track record of private companies in delivering custodial services in the 14 years since the first private prison was opened already offers assurance that they can be relied on to recruit competent staff&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000250"></a>He went on to say that private contractors,</p>
<ul><a name="07032272000285"></a>&#147;have certainly been a key driver of the improved treatment of prisoners&#151;and under what is sometimes termed the decency agenda&#151;of ensuring more decent prison regimes&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 28/2/07; col. 1000.]</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000251"></a>On the basis of the information available to us and in the public domain, that is an astounding statement, but since I know the Minister is a genuine and very honourable person, he must have access to information that is not in the public domain. Surely we need much more openness and objectivity in the information available so that we can do our job of holding the Government to account and ensuring that our money is well spent.</p>

<a name="07032272000149"></a><b><a name="70322-0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07032272000387"></a>Baroness Scott of Needham Market:</b> My Lords, I too am grateful to my noble friend Lady Walmsley for tabling this Motion because it gives the House an unusual opportunity to look at an issue that is cross-cutting and not driven along departmental boundaries, but is of increasing importance to Parliament, to the Government and to the public. My experience is in local government. I was a councillor for 14 years, a senior member of the Local Government Association, served on the board of the Audit Commission, and since 2000 have spoken on local government affairs in this House. In recent years I have also worked with two private companies, Anite and Atkins, to develop their thinking on the relationship between the public and the private sectors.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07032272000150"></a>It is of course a matter of interest to Parliament and to the Government how local authorities determine their relationship with the private sector, partly because of the lessons which central government can learn from local government and because, from compulsory competitive tendering through to the more recent Gershon requirements on local government to make efficiency savings, the Government have made local government&#146;s relationship with the private sector their business.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07032272000151"></a>It used to be very simple. The public sector employed people who provided services. The compulsory competitive tendering drive of the 1980s led to a quiet revolution. What we now have is a patchwork of arrangements between the public and the private sectors, and I can say at the outset that I have absolutely no problem with that. I can see many ways in which great synergies can be created when the public and private sectors work together properly. The voluntary sector has also changed enormously during this time. Large organisations such as Help the Aged and WRVS are providing services which are commissioned by local authorities and managed by contracts.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07032272000152"></a>However, I want to use my time today to reflect on a few lessons that have been learnt by local government over the years. First, I shall say a few words about markets. We talk blithely about market forces, but they are complex and change constantly. I am not confident that either local or central government fully understand how certain markets operate when it comes to the detail, or how markets will change as a response to certain interventions by the Government. I shall give an example. Compulsory competitive tendering certainly caused a massive shake-up of provision and often enabled huge cost savings to be made. It was heralded as a triumph for the private sector, but subsequent academic studies have never really established whether it was because the private sector was inherently cheaper or whether it was the tendering and contracting processes which actually made the difference. However, what was really never thought through was this: once an in-house bid had been lost by a local council, the in-house body had nowhere else to go. It could not bid for work anywhere else and therefore it would close down. That meant that the second time around, there was no in-house bid and competition was reduced. So the cost savings tended to be made only on the first round of bids. But local authorities are always under pressure to make more savings. What happened then was that councils would often work together. It sounds as though it makes sense to have bigger contracts and create economies of scale, but in many sectors the smaller companies simply could not provide on that sort of scale and so they did not tender. Twenty years on, the result of this process is that in certain sectors&#151;I cite particularly the waste and the bus industries&#151;there are on the whole relatively few very large operators. Once the market is concentrated in the hands of a few providers, the benefits of competition are much reduced. Councils are now struggling to continue to reduce the costs of contracts.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07032272000153"></a>The process is continuing today. Evidence from the residential care sector shows that contracts are now being constructed in such a way as to deter smaller providers. Earlier this year the CBI produced a report on the commissioning of local public services which emphasised the need for a diverse range of providers in order to increase value for money and improve service quality. Many councils stimulate local markets through the provision of information about future work flows and by advertising contracts more widely, but it would be useful if central government could commission more research in this area. Perhaps they need to understand a little more the implications when they insist on blunt efficiency saving targets from local authorities.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07032272000154"></a>It has become clear that intelligent commissioning requires a number of components. The nature and variety of the services to be commissioned, and the range of service users, have to be well understood in order to enable the council to determine the correct range of organisations which can deliver them at an affordable price. Huge skill is needed in constructing a tendering process which ensures that a variety of organisations are indeed able to bid. Recent academic research suggests that for markets to work in a more positive way, there needs to be a clear and non-doctrinaire attitude to commissioning, a genuine understanding of the market, good procurement practice and that the commissioning organisation must have the right capacities and skills. Here again there may be a role for central government, particularly in assisting smaller councils in this area where they may not have the relevant skills.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="07032272000155"></a>I want to turn next to monitoring. The original Nicholas Ridley view was that councils would meet just once a year and set the contracts. Indeed, in the 1980s and 1990s, some Conservative councils outsourced pretty much all of their services and reduced staff to a minimum, which resulted in much heralded savings to the taxpayer. Unfortunately it became clear over time that they simply had not left themselves enough capacity to monitor the contracts thoroughly, ensure that there was proper compliance and deal with problems when they arose. We then saw a recreation of a corporate centre in many councils. There are limits to the paring down of central staff that can be done. As the noble Lord, Lord Warner, said, it does not really matter what sector the providers come from; they need to be properly monitored, and that requires skilled staff.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="07032272000156"></a>There is also a point about responsiveness. It is quite difficult sometimes for councils to ensure that private sector partners really understand the wider requirements of organisations that are ultimately accountable to citizens. For example, if road maintenance is outsourced on a conventional contract, the company repairs the roads on a term agreed with the council, usually on a technical basis. But what happens when the public start to complain about potholes? Should the company respond to the citizen, or should it just stick to the agreed work plan? The challenge is how we create contracts which enable private companies to be responsive to the citizen.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07032272000157"></a>Another example of that is the vexed question of parking enforcement. If you compare two services that are routinely outsourced, waste collection and parking enforcement, you see two very different things. With waste collection you simply want the bins emptied&#151;the council wants them emptied, as do the public, and you establish contracts that penalise companies that do not do so efficiently. It is all rather more difficult with parking enforcement. How do you build judgment into contracts so that the contractors do not go out and create some of the more ludicrous examples of parking tickets while ensuring that real parking enforcement takes place? That is not really a question for public satisfaction surveys, but the public need to be sure, whatever and whoever is doing the parking enforcement, that they are treated fairly and that the system is transparent. It is not impossible to create relationships with private contractors that do that, but it is difficult.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07032272000158"></a>Another conundrum emerges here. In the social care sector, for example, the Commission for Social Care Inspectorate has shown that, although private and voluntary providers have demonstrated that they are better at reaching national minimum standards than the public sector, users are expressing more satisfaction with the public sector. The same holds true of satisfaction levels recorded by tenants of social housing. They seem to be happier with the local authority, even when other providers are performing better. I am not sure the noble Lord, Lord Warner, is correct when he says people do not care about who provides it&#151;I think they do.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="07032272000159"></a>The dilemma for local government&#151;indeed, this is in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill that will be coming to this House in the summer&#151;is that increasingly local authorities will be required to be more responsive to their local communities. Quite what they will do when the communities say, &#147;We want residential care or housing provided by the council but the Government are making that almost impossible&#148;, I do not know. It is an interesting dilemma for the local council.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07032272000160"></a>One of the conclusions from all this is that contracts and contractual frameworks have to be drawn up in a way that reflects the desired outcomes, not just performance management of outputs&#151;in other words, a move away from bean counting. In order to do that, it is necessary to work with providers in a transparent and mature way in developing final specifications and contracts. The relationships between the private, voluntary and public sectors are evolving and maturing. Councils are learning that the private sector has a valuable role in providing expertise, technology and finance, often on a scale which is difficult for councils to achieve themselves. The private sector has been slower to learn to recognise that local authorities are subject to processes such as statutory frameworks, transparency and even democracy, which have to be respected.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07032272000161"></a>There is a lot to learn, and it is essential that local authorities learn from each other. It is even more essential that Parliament and Government monitor, in a strategic way, what is happening. This is not a field where we can afford to allow prejudice and dogma to determine public policy. It must be evidence-based.</p>

This is a large area and we all need to discuss across the parties the experience that we have now gained about the contracting-out of public services and the relationship between private public-service providers and the local and central state. We have, as the noble Lord, Lord Warner, remarked, discovered that the private sector is not uniformly better than the public sector, as Nicholas Ridley and others always believed. We are also clear that it is not uniformly worse than the public sector, as many in the old Labour Party used to believe. So we now move on to a different set of issues about what is best under what circumstances, how we set the rules for contracting carefully enough and what we think the public really want. We are, after all, talking about a very large sector. I note from one of the briefing papers that the total value of PFI contracts to date is some &#163;46 billion.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07032272000163"></a>As an academic, I naturally start by trying to find the underlying principles on which this whole area has developed and the studies in which they are applied. I have to say that I was rather shaken to discover, working not only with the Lords Library but with academics at my own institution and elsewhere and with planners at some of the big private public-service providers, that the detailed studies are thin and that the underlying principles are not entirely agreed. There is a lot to learn from the experience of other countries&#151;the Nordic states, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and North America&#151;as well as from the experience that we have accumulated in the past 10 to 20 years. This is, however, a highly technical field with limited transparency, deluged with opaque language and management-speak. I looked at the declared objectives of the Office of Government Commerce, and at the end of it I was not at all sure what most of them meant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07032272000164"></a>The whole question of how we get Members of Parliament and the wider public to understand this field is therefore important. Do we now have broad agreed principles across this field and, if so, where are they? Where are the Government now setting them out? Do we now accept that the same principles work across differing sectors, or that the principles that operate in the health sector, for example, do not really apply in the prison and probation sector? We have learnt from bitter experience that management and contracting principles that operated in the offshore energy sector, when applied to the railway sector, led to very unfortunate relationships between principals and agents and to a breakdown in the necessary mechanisms of trust that were required to maintain rail systems on a proper basis.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07032272000165"></a>Are we clear about how far risk should be shared? There has been a whole range of problems about how far risk is offloaded from the public on to the private sector, and what happens when the private service provider fails to continue to provide those services. I note that the Government are accumulating experience about how to monitor the selling on of PFI contracts. I understand from what I have been reading that the Government&#146;s attitude to that is still developing. We do not yet have clear agreement.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07032272000166"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Warner, talked about the different categories of private public-service providers: the for-profit companies, the public-interest companies and what he described as the emerging social enterprise sector. That in turn raises a number of questions about which is more appropriate under what circumstances and how government should appropriately deal with the social enterprise sector. That sector is not primarily driven by economic gain but has a range of other motivations and objectives in mind that occasionally cut across the objectives of public policy, as indeed we argued about at considerable length yesterday with regard to the social enterprise sector&#146;s provision of services to the Government on adoption.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07032272000167"></a>Reading the new public management literature, I have had some concerns. As a social scientist, I followed the development of public choice economics, recognising that it was a right-wing, libertarian theory masquerading as mathematical economics; it is based on a deep mistrust of government and a desire to shrink the state and public services and to pursue a libertarian agenda. I was even more concerned when I came across the conclusion of one of the most useful volumes surveying experience of new public management in five different countries. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="07032272000275"></a>&#147;The supermarket state model is a central feature of NPM ... The supermarket model presumes that the government and the state in general have a service-providing role, with an emphasis on efficiency and good quality, and conceives the people as consumers, users or clients&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000252"></a>not citizens. It goes on to state that,</p>
<ul><a name="07032272000276"></a>&#147;instead of the state controlling society on the basis of a democratic mandate from the people, society more directly controls the state through market mechanisms. The public are viewed as sovereign consumers or clients&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000253"></a>That cuts exactly across the Government&#146;s citizenship agenda, and I suspect that it is one of the reasons why that agenda is in so much trouble.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07032272000168"></a>We need to question a number of the underlying principles in which we are engaged. Public choice theory is based essentially on mistrust; it is based on the idea that you can never trust a government servant or bureaucrat, that contractual relations are the only basis on which to operate, and that those with whom you deal are motivated primarily by economic gain. However, trust is essential in long-term partnerships of the kind that involve the provision of public services. Most people are motivated by a mixture of economic gain, job satisfaction, a sense of personal and social responsibility, and altruism. We need to recognise that.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07032272000169"></a>For example, prison management that is motivated purely by economic gain is the last thing that we want. In talking to a number of people within Serco, I was relieved and happy to discover that they are much concerned with other quality issues in the management of private prisons, as they should be. But how does one then write the contracts in such a way as to ensure that one does not simply go for the cheapest model and so as not to set a whole range of standards because one does not entirely trust one&#146;s private contractor? As we have seen with GP contracts and the rising salaries of top civil servants, if one assumes that only economic gain motivates people, one slips very easily into a model in which one gives higher salaries to those at the top and squeezes the wages of those at the bottom.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="07032272000170"></a>The evidence of opinion polls is not that citizens want maximum choice; it is that they want available pubic services in their local communities. That is very much the case in the public&#146;s attitude to schools. A range of other values is involved.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="07032272000171"></a>The quality of contracting, and of monitoring the contracts, has so far been highly variable. As a social scientist, I am familiar with the development of principal/agent theory, in which the Government are the principal and the private contractors are the agents, but I doubt whether principals always understand how to control the agent, and I suspect that the vast expansion of consultants&#146; advice to government during the past 10 years has partly been a matter of government trying to catch up with private public-service providers in terms of monitoring what has to be done.</p>

<a name="70322-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07032272000172"></a>Contestability, as the noble Lord, Lord Warner, remarked, was an important part of the model that, I think most of us will agree, was well worth introducing into a Prison Service that was stuck in a range of old-fashioned attitudes, but the problems that public and private prisons now recognise are not to do with the quality of the Prison Officers&#146; Association or of public or private provision; they are a matter of overcrowding, which comes from other aspects of public policy.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07032272000173"></a>How long term do contracts need to be? If we have short-term contracts, the building of the trust relationships that we require breaks down. I do not want to rehearse the arguments that we will have after the Easter Recess on the Offender Management Bill, to which the noble Lord, Lord Warner, referred, but an effective offender management system, in which relationships between those in the courts, within local government and inside and outside the prisons require to be maintained over a long period, is not easily compatible with short-term contracting and contestability of public services.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07032272000174"></a>The target mentality is worth introducing, but we have also been made aware by our economist friends and acquaintances that the imposition of targets and the measurement of particular statistics and indicators affect behaviour in ways that may not be entirely intended. I heard at a meeting of the Royal Society of Arts last night that one of the reasons why the number of students who are continuing the study of history through to GCSE and A-level is going down is that schools discourage children from going on with history when it becomes optional, because they are afraid that some of the students might not get the A to C grades that the schools need for their league tables. They therefore push them off into subjects that they regard as being easier for them.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07032272000175"></a>Some real issues are at stake, one of which is accountability. When we discuss the Offender Management Bill, we shall come to the question of how far private prisons are allowed to exert state authority over the prisoners for whom they are responsible and, similarly, over community punishment. The British Medical Association notes in its briefing, which we have received today:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="07032272000277"></a>&#147;Evidence is not currently available to compare clinical standards, such as complication rates, in NHS Treatment Centres and ISTCs&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000254"></a>It goes on to state that there is,</p>
<ul><a name="07032272000286"></a>&#147;a lack of robust audit data on outcomes and productivity&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70322-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="07032272000176"></a>Another issue is equity. A study on introducing the theory of new public management in public housing notes that one of the problems is that it does not necessarily include social inclusion and social justice, which are important in the provision of social housing. A further issue is whether provision will be local or central. When we discuss the Offender Management Bill, one of the issues with which we on these Benches will be concerned is the extent to which contracting will remove authority from local government and take it up to a regional and central level.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="07032272000177"></a>An underlying question is whose satisfaction we are talking about. Is it that of the consumer, the Treasury&#151;in terms of efficiency&#151;or the citizen? Are these interchangeable or distinctive? The economist&#146;s model is of the well informed customer seeking the widest possible choice of services, but, for the many who are not well informed, this may not be the ideal model. What is our shared responsibility for them?</p>

<a name="07032272000178"></a><b><a name="70322-0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07032272000389"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has selected an intriguing subject for today&#146;s debate. It is a multi-layered topic which has provoked some diverse perspectives in our debate. I do not normally have much sympathy for the Minister, but I do so today because in his winding-up speech he must produce some form of synthesis of the varying points that have been made.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="07032272000179"></a>In preparing for the debate, I asked the Library to find out how much the Government spend on the private sector each year to deliver public services, but, having carried out its research&#151;extremely diligently, I am sure&#151;it came back with no answer at all. We have therefore to debate the noble Baroness&#146;s interesting Motion in an information void, which, as an accountant, I find disturbing.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07032272000180"></a>According to the Budget Book released yesterday, the public sector will spend around &#163;340 billion on goods and services, including capital, next year. Can the Minister say how much of that will be spent via the private sector, and if not why not?</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07032272000181"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, asked whether the public sector gets quality and value for money in its dealings with the private sector. When we talk about transactions with the private sector, we are often drawn to think about the private finance initiative. The PFI was invented by my party and by 1997 we had overseen a relatively small number of contracts, testing out the parameters of risk transfer which was the heart of our approach. Since 1997 the Chancellor has enthusiastically driven the use of PFI as a source of public sector investment and overseen contracts for well over &#163;50 billion. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, referred to &#163;46 billion but every day more contracts are signed and the figure rises ever higher. The annual cost is currently around &#163;7 billion, due to go over &#163;9 billion in 10 years&#146; time. So we are talking large sums of money involved in PFI.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07032272000182"></a>One worrying feature of PFI is the way that some completed projects have been refinanced to produce significant gains for PFI consortia. The later generations of PFI contracts have ensured that the public sector captures some of those gains, but the uncomfortable truth is that the PFI industry is built not so much around service provision but around significant financial engineering and highly leveraged structures, with high rates of return often matching high risks that are often best managed in the public sector. Can the Minister explain how this delivers value to the public sector?</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07032272000183"></a>Another uncomfortable feature of the PFI is the fact that the public sector is tied into contracts for 25 or 30 years, burdening future generations of taxpayers with paying for, say, hospital configurations which have been designed for today&#146;s era. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, referred to this problem. Of course, the contracts allow for changes over time but only at a price which will in turn increase the burdens on future taxpayers. The problem here is that we will not know whether these contracts represent long-term value for money for some years to come but long-term value will become of increasing prominence as the contracts mature. Do the Government have any systematic way of monitoring long-term value from these contracts so that any problems that may start to emerge from PFI contracts can be anticipated and dealt with before they end up destroying value for taxpayers?</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07032272000184"></a>The Government have continued to make progress on the professionalism of contracting and commissioning, as has been referred to today, but some dreadful mistakes continue to be made, especially in the area of IT. The Child Support Agency has wasted many millions of pounds on two failed systems. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, which outsources its IT, has had its share of problems, recently with the tax credit system where IT problems were compounded by design faults which resulted in overpayments of more than &#163;2 billion each year and misery for hundreds of thousands of taxpayers.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07032272000185"></a>The Minister will be aware that transferring risk to the private sector does not automatically ensure value for money. The National Physical Laboratory PFI contract, on which the Public Accounts Committee in another place reported last week, is testimony to that. The department concerned used hope rather than rigorous analysis to guide it. The private sector contractors assumed significant risk and they duly took a financial hit but the public sector still incurred a cost over-run and lost five years in the process. Does the Minister think there are any lessons to be learnt here?</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="07032272000186"></a>I completely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, that transparency is extremely important. There is a disturbing trend in public sector procurement for the details of contracts with the private sector to be concealed under the guise of commercial confidentiality. The Government liberally use the commercial confidentiality let-out clause in Section 43 of the Freedom of Information Act to refuse to answer requests for information on government contracts. And the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, referred to the particular issue of non-availability of contracts for prisons run by private sector contractors.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="07032272000187"></a>We have seen in the NHS IT programme that stringent confidentiality requirements have been imposed on its contractors. We will have to await the obituary on the project to find out whether that has added any value to this vast programme but we do not believe that obsessive secrecy adds value or that secrecy operates in the public interest. During the passage of the Identity Cards Bill last year, the Government refused to disclose the full costs of the programme. Even today, the Department for Work and Pensions is defying the Information Commissioner on its ID card programme. It is not surprising that so many distrust the Government on ID cards and the national identity register. Openness may be difficult, but it serves the public interest.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07032272000188"></a>In general, we believe, to quote US Supreme Court Justice Brandeis, that &#147;sunlight is the best disinfectant&#148;. That is why I introduced the Government Spending (Website) Bill in your Lordships' House late last year which requires the Government to open up government spending by way of a publicly searchable website. I am grateful to the House for allowing my Bill to pass last week. I hope that the Minister today will commit the Government to granting it a speedy passage in another place.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07032272000189"></a>The Motion of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, focuses on public services commissioned from the private sector, but issues in public services are not confined to the ones delivered by the private sector, as the noble Lord, Lord Warner, reminded us. I agreed with much of what he said today, including what he said about the indifference of the public as to who provides the services. Many services are still provided by the public sector and quality, value for money and transparency are of equal or greater importance for those. Quality and value-for-money measurement in the public sector remains primitive. The Office for National Statistics, when pressed by the Government to measure quality in order to make up for the underlying loss of efficiency shown in many public services, has come up with some answers but I do not believe that these are regarded as wholly convincing by many people who have looked at them.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07032272000190"></a>On efficiency, we might think that the Government had good mechanisms for measuring it, given the way that they have trumpeted the prospective &#163;21 billion of efficiency savings identified by Sir Peter Gershon. The Chancellor has claimed that much of this has been delivered. For example, in the Pre-Budget Report last December, he said that &#163;13.3 billion of these savings had been achieved. The National Audit Office's report on the Government's efficiency programme released a few weeks ago revealed the truth that of the &#163;13 billion only about a quarter,</p>
<ul><a name="07032272000287"></a>&#147;fairly represent the efficiencies made&#148;;</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000255"></a>over half of the total,</p>
<ul><a name="07032272000288"></a>&#147;carry some measurement issues and uncertainties&#148;;</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000256"></a>and for the remaining &#163;3.1 billion, in the NAO's understatement,</p>
<ul><a name="07032272000289"></a>&#147;there may be efficiencies taking place but the measures used either do not yet demonstrate efficiencies or the reported gains may be substantially incorrect&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000191"></a>Yesterday, the word &#147;Gershon&#148; did not pass the Chancellor's lips. Will the Minister say whether the Government plan to restore credibility to the Gershon efficiency programme or will the programme be quietly buried in the upcoming Comprehensive Spending Review?</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="07032272000192"></a>We are concerned that the Government do not have good processes to get value for money from their expenditure, whether with the private sector or within the public sector, and we have seen too many signs that the Government prefer secrecy to transparency. Will the Minister today commit the Government to turning over a new leaf?</p>

The first is to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, for introducing what has been a most interesting and stimulating debate. There was a contrast between real statistics, immediate problems, theoretical interest in the nature of the mix between public and private, how we measure those boundaries and how we create the correct balance between their contributions to the public good.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07032272000194"></a>My second debt of gratitude is to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, who said that I had an impossible job and that she had some sympathy for me. Wherever I can get sympathy, I accept it with the greatest enthusiasm. I certainly need it now as I have only 20 minutes in which to cover this extremely extensive debate.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07032272000195"></a>In terms of describing the principles on which the Government act and giving illustrations from decisions and policies at national and local level, my noble friend Lord Warner did the House a great service. He gave clear illustrations of the way in which these arrangements can be established effectively and to good purpose nationally and locally, and outlined the main principles on which we ought to work. I was grateful for that speech, in which he illustrated the Government&#146;s achievements in crucial areas. That is also my task but I emphasise that I recognise the nature of the theoretical debate. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, is right that many Bills that come before us on aspects of public expenditure will raise issues about the nature of the mix of ensuring value for money and guaranteeing effective accountability.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07032272000196"></a>A theme which ran through all speeches was the extent to which relying upon certain areas of private delivery spread a danger of limited accountability. The fact that private organisations could establish that certain aspects of their operations were commercially confidential puts limitations on accountability to which local authorities and national government could present a challenge.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07032272000197"></a>As my noble friend Lord Warner pointed out, these issues are determined by the nature of the contract. Of course the contract can be drawn up in terms of counting the beans. As the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, suggested, it could be a question of the relationship between costs and returns in the contract. But the plea was strongly made by the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, when she was referring to local government, and by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, in her opening remarks, that the contract ought to have demands of accountability and that there should be a structure in which the organisation delivering the service was open to such accountability. That depends on the nature of the contract. As this process develops, we learn and improve.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07032272000198"></a>There are very many actors involved in the contracts. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, expressed sympathy for the job I had to do and then asked me the nuclear question which she knew I could not answer&#151;namely, what is the global cost of all these contracts? She knows very well that I am not in a position to quantify that. It is an impossible question to answer. However, because there are so many actors upon the scene, we need to develop a clear philosophy of how we balance costs and returns effectively and make sure that contracts insist upon accountability.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07032272000199"></a>Above all, what is the purpose&#151;the philosophy&#151;behind public service? Surely it is not to balance the interests between producers but to guarantee that the consumer gets the best possible public service. That is what is at stake. Of course due regard must be given to costs, but over the past decade or so there has been a clear realisation of what the public are demanding. The noble Baronesses on the Liberal Democrat Benches emphasised that there may be greater interest than might be contended in who delivers the service, but I do not think that anyone can contradict the view that the most important thing is the quality of the service that is delivered. That is inevitably the view of the public.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07032272000200"></a>We should recognise how much progress has been made against this background, in which the Government have been able to use a great deal of the public/private mix. There was a huge backlog in public investment when we came to power 10 years ago. The usual areas of obvious neglect, which I shall not bore the House with, included huge school repair backlogs and enormous problems in the National Health Service, while investment in transport was clearly very necessary. Expenditure on schools had been more limited than was good for the education programme.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07032272000201"></a>The Government pride themselves on having made immense progress in delivering public service. In getting the necessary resources for investment, there have been huge advantages in levering in private investment. As my noble friend Lord Warner indicated, that can be done at local level and in much bigger national programmes.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07032272000202"></a>We are concerned not to engage in the debate between public ownership or the market in theoretical terms; we are concerned with what delivers best for the public interest. That is why inevitably there are different solutions to different services. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, identified things that were wrong with aspects of the academies. The DfES vets sponsors of academies with regard to their responsibilities. There is a safeguard against conflict of interest. She said that those who provided the service to the school might sometimes have close relationships with the sponsors. That is a conflict of interest which we would regard as reprehensible; it needs to be identified. Given the position of the relationship between the department and Ofsted to the operation of the academies, they have to be as open about their activities as other schools and educational institutions. Should a conflict of interest such as the one the noble Baroness identified come to light, the department has the opportunity and responsibility of ensuring that something is done about it. The first responsibility belongs to the governing body, which has a public duty to act in the interests of the school, not of the sponsor. Sponsors who back and help establish academies are well aware of that basic constraint on their expectations of what happens in the academy&#146;s transactions.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07032272000203"></a>The noble Baroness asked a rather more general question about whether certain parts of the private sector could dominate public services and whether we would come to depend on them too much. I disagree. I recognise that in certain areas, as she listed in her speech, private companies have a very significant role to play. But the total managed expenditure will be well over &#163;600 billion by the end of the next spending review period. Capita is responsible for &#163;4 billion of that. Capita is a most successful company, whose name crops up in a public connection more often than many other companies, as she indicated. It has enjoyed conspicuous success in some areas but has shown weaknesses in one or two others. However, &#163;4 billion out of &#163;600 billion scarcely suggests market dominance.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07032272000204"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, emphasised IT failure in government. The vast majority of government IT projects perform excellently. They deliver key public services day in, day out, and on budget. As a Government we are managing some of the largest and most complex IT-enabled projects in the world. I am well aware of the areas that she identified where there have been weaknesses, but the vast majority work to budget and work successfully. No sharper criticism could be advanced of the Government than if they had attempted to deliver huge public service programmes without coming to terms with the opportunities vouchsafed by the development of IT while recognising the risks involved.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07032272000205"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, said that she did not expect me to be able to answer one or two of her questions. Indeed, I am not able to answer them at this stage. However, I reassure her that although we are not sure that we can go much beyond January in this regard, the information on the website of the Chief Inspector of Prisons relates to both public and private services. Although there may be an issue of immediate updating, the matters which she raised on private prisons are available on that website for public analysis and scrutiny. She identified problems with certain prisons. I do not think that she would expect me to respond to those points now. However, many aspects of the prison private finance initiatives have performed well and have delivered cost savings. Prisons have been built on time and on budget. The first PFI prison comprised a 17 per cent saving as against a traditionally procured prison. That is not a negligible saving. Further, valuable external resources are levered into such projects.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07032272000206"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether the relevant reports were available. I am not sure about the date of the latest report but, as she will know only too well, one could not expect fuller reports than those provided by the Chief Inspector of Prisons. We hold her and that office in high regard in providing that information.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07032272000207"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, made the main theme of his speech that, whenever public provision is in issue, there is bound to be an ongoing debate about the relationship between public and private resources. We all recognise that such a debate must be based on clear principles. The Government believe that the principles are very clear. We know that we need to identify the public interest in the choice of delivery system. That is open to debate. When we bring legislation that initiates change before Parliament, we reflect the nature of that debate. A reforming Administration will bring forward a whole series of proposals about how our public services need to change to meet a reforming agenda. In this rapidly changing world a Government would not meet their obligations if they did not respond to the rapidly changing circumstances in which public provision has to be established. However, there is bound to be a debate within that framework. It is clear that there is a legitimate role for the private and third sectors in delivering and reforming public services based on a clear assessment of value for money, not dogma. It is certainly based on the fact that there must be proper accountability. That was a constant theme in speeches from all sides of the House, certainly from the Liberal Democrat Benches.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07032272000208"></a>We are open to hearing all suggestions that public services are not as open as they ought to be. There is no agenda here for imposing on the previous open accountability of local government a new secretive provision because private resources and private agents are used. The concept of openness must pervade local democracy. It is up to local authorities to recognise that the contracts which they strike with these providers will, and ought to, guarantee that openness.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07032272000209"></a>Where we do not think that value for money can be guaranteed through the market and private providers, we shall continue to be entirely pragmatic about public service delivery. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, my noble friend Lord Warner and other speakers were emphatic about that. We should value the ethos of public service. Not everyone is motivated purely by economic grounds. Nor is the public good delivered by the sole consideration of cost-benefit analysis. It is clear that we do and will depend on the ethos of public service which pervades the Civil Service and the legions who work in local authorities. As we all recognise, one of the great strengths of British life is the extensive work that is done through the voluntary sector, which has very high ethical standards. It plays an increasingly important part in the delivery of certain aspects of public services.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07032272000210"></a>The Government will remain pragmatic about these issues. We recognise that in whole areas the public interest can be served only through the delivery of public services that are democratically and straightforwardly answerable to public authorities or Parliament. However, during the decade in which we have been in power, we have proved that, increasingly, enormous advantages can be derived from carefully drawn-up contracts which ensure that private investment is levered in to increase the resources available to develop the public goods which we need, and that considerable efficiencies and gains can be achieved in those areas through the operation of the market.</p>

<a name="70322-0005.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07032272000211"></a>I thank everybody who participated in this informative and, from the Government&#146;s perspective, enormously challenging debate.</p>

<a name="07032272000212"></a><b><a name="70322-0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07032272000391"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords and especially the Minister for a thoughtful and cross-cutting debate. I hope I made it clear to the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that I do not regard private companies, either individually or as a whole, as the great Satan. I contest one point in his speech; he said we can always trust the service users to drive forward quality. We cannot, because often in the case of public services they are vulnerable people not in a position to do so, such as children, frail elderly people or prisoners.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07032272000213"></a>I thank my noble friend Lady Miller, who talked about the lines of accountability being blurred, and my noble friend Lady Scott of Needham Market, who talked from her great experience in both the public and the private sectors, and of her experience of the lessons we can learn from local government. The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, has certainly whetted my appetite to read the JCHR&#146;s upcoming reports on private care homes and asylum seekers. Her powerful speech exposed the 10 per cent information gap about prisoners. It also emphasised the importance of the achievement of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, although he is unable to be in his place today, in keeping the inspector of prisons free-standing and not part of a larger inspectorate.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07032272000214"></a>My noble friend Lord Wallace, in true academic style, gave us a thoughtful analysis and exposed the lack of principles and research about these matters. One thing struck home to me; people want good local schools and hospitals. If they get them, they are not terribly bothered about choice.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07032272000215"></a>I share the sympathy of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, for the Minister having to respond to a debate such as this. She certainly put him on the spot about the figures and highlighted a number of failures, particularly in big IT contracts. Yet I do not agree with her that members of the public are indifferent as to who delivers their public services. The Minister kept talking about consumers. Consumers are not the same thing as citizens, and when we consume public services we are citizens first and foremost.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07032272000216"></a>I am most grateful to all noble Lords. It has been an enormously thoughtful and thought-provoking debate. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion for Papers.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07032272000219"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, last week we celebrated International Women&#146;s Day and the promotion of equality for women. Yesterday we approved a law to combat discrimination based on sexual orientation. We are about to mark the bicentenary of the abolition of the infamous trade in slaves, but there are many other forms of modern slavery. As was pointed out in Monday&#146;s <I>International Herald Tribune</I>, in an article by the executive director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, Antonio Maria Costa,</p>
<ul><a name="07032272000290"></a>&#147;we have the moral duty and legal obligation to prevent and suppress its modern equivalents&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000220"></a>The Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Bill seeks to tackle a serious abuse of human rights, often amounting to sexual slavery. Happily the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, has been given lead responsibility for the Bill in this House, and I am delighted that she will reply to this debate, the subject matter of which is wide-ranging and topical.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07032272000221"></a>A democratic society governed by the rule of law needs constantly to nurture a culture of respect for human rights. It must secure in law the effective protection of human rights against arbitrary and unnecessary restriction or abuses of power by public authorities, or by private bodies exercising public powers. It needs to recognise that civil and political rights and economic and social rights are interdependent, and that all three branches of government must be actively engaged in their advancement. These are statements of the obvious, but there are few countries where they are a practical reality. Nor is there room for complacency in this country. It is all too easy when the public are threatened by the scourge of terrorism or serious crime and disorder to treat respect for human rights as a disposable luxury, to pander to populist pressure from reactionary media in the pursuit of political power, and to surrender the rights of vulnerable and unpopular minorities.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07032272000222"></a>The Human Rights Act has strong Liberal Democrat support. Its purpose is to nurture a culture of respect for human rights, and to enable our own courts to give effective remedies for breaches of the convention rights by British public authorities. Alone in Europe, we have no written constitutional Bill of Rights. The Human Rights Act is the next best method of constitutional protection. It reconciles effective British judicial remedies for human rights violations with the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy. The courts are empowered to declare legislation to be incompatible with the convention rights, but not to strike it down, leaving it to government and Parliament to pass remedial legislation, or, if they will not, to defend proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights. The Act is based on the assumption that the executive and legislative branches as well as the judiciary share a common commitment to representative democracy, respect for human rights and government under the rule of law. It could not work without that shared commitment. It requires government, public authorities and public officials to justify policies, practices and decisions which have an adverse impact on human rights on the basis of evidence and not mere assertion. In other words, it promotes a culture of justification.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07032272000223"></a>The Act was not welcome to Euro-sceptic Conservatives whose political memory does not extend to the aftermath of the last world war, when Winston Churchill, Harold Macmillan, Maxwell Fyfe and other leading Conservatives led the European movement and championed the need for the European convention. We hope that in this debate Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition&#151;represented on this occasion by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, who cannot be regarded in any way as a Euro-sceptic&#151;will recognise the great benefits that the Human Rights Act has brought.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07032272000224"></a>One benefit is the relief given to the hugely overburdened European Court of Human Rights. The Strasbourg court is choking on 80,000 or more pending cases, with some 250,000 cases by 2010. The case load is increasing exponentially. Without the Human Rights Act, British citizens would have had to rely upon recourse to the European Court, with ever increasing delays in obtaining a final judgment. Another benefit is increased British legal influence on the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. Judgments of our courts closely examine the convention case law, and British judgments are now given great weight by the European judges because they engage in a dialogue based on common principles and a common human rights discourse.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07032272000225"></a>The Human Rights Act is no ordinary law. It is a constitutional measure of greater practical significance than the measures we rightly cherish as part of our constitutional heritage&#151;the Bill of Rights and Claim of Right, the habeas corpus Acts, and Magna Carta itself. Its values are expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its progeny, including the UN international covenants and the European convention. The values are universal and are deep-rooted in British political and legal tradition. They are our birthright and part of our common humanity and human dignity.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07032272000226"></a>That leads me to correct a mistake in <I>Hansard</I>, in order to reassure the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford, who is to take part in this debate. In the report of last night&#146;s debate, there is a Freudian mistake, not I think by me, but by the unfortunate <I>Hansard</I> reporter who no doubt listened to my poor enunciation. It is quite an important mistake. I have been reported as saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="07032272000291"></a>&#147;the principles of human rights are universal, that they derive not only from the secular Enlightenment but from all the great religious divisions&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000257"></a>that last word should be &#147;traditions&#148;&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07032272000292"></a>&#147;including the Judaeo-Christian tradition, and that they all recognise the need for a fair balance between competing rights and freedoms&#148;. &#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/3/07; col. 1323.]</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000258"></a>Maybe the <I>Hansard</I> writer has a sense of humour.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07032272000227"></a>The Act exerts a magnetic force over the whole of our legal system. Our courts respect its force and do not permit human rights protection to be weakened by arguments based on political expediency or administrative convenience. The courts strike a fair balance between the rights of one individual and another, as well as the interests of the community. They avoid the trap of legalism or of a narrowly literal interpretation. They are to be commended for that and for protecting legislative and executive powers against judicial usurpation. There is no risk in this country of a Government of unelected judges. They have approached the Strasbourg jurisprudence through, rather than round, British law, weaving the convention rights into the fabric of the British system. That is vital if the process is to command public confidence. We must not alienate British public opinion by the way in which we deal with these matters.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07032272000228"></a>The Act has also increased the parliamentary accountability of the Executive with the aid of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, on which I have been privileged to serve since it was first established. Ministers and civil servants are much more aware of their human rights responsibilities, and Parliament is much better informed when debating proposed measures, as we saw in two debates only yesterday. If noble Lords read the debate on the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Bill, they will see the dialogue that took place with the noble Lord, Lord Rooker. There was also the debate on the sexual orientation regulations. There is no doubt that the JCHR and its input are now an established part of our procedures and have altered the terms of the relationship between the Government and Parliament.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07032272000229"></a>The approach of the Human Rights Act is holistic, by which I mean that all three branches of government are involved, rather than only the judiciary. The JCHR takes account of all the international human rights instruments by which the UK is bound. The courts treat its reports as relevant&#151;but no more than that&#151;when deciding issues of convention compatibility. It gives them an important context.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07032272000230"></a>The Government&#146;s review of the implementation of the Human Rights Act has dispelled myths and misconceptions about the Act. The Act has had a beneficial impact on UK law and government policy. It has not damaged the Government&#146;s ability to fight crime. It has been misapplied on occasions, because of deficiencies in training and guidance, particularly to public authorities and services, for which the Act itself is not to blame. The Government are to be commended for having made sure that almost &#163;6 million was spent in training all our judiciary before the Act came into force. The Government have published welcome new guidance to enhance understanding of the Act. From October, the Commission for Equality and Human Rights will be in a position to carry on that work. We hope that the commission will give sufficient priority to human rights, in addition to its demanding equality brief.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07032272000231"></a>The legitimacy of the Human Rights Act is under frequent and unfair attack by the tabloid press. The <I>Sun</I> ran a campaign last summer to,</p>
<ul><a name="07032272000293"></a>&#147;rip up the Human Rights Act&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000259"></a>The right honourable David Cameron has suggested that the Act is,</p>
<ul><a name="07032272000294"></a>&#147;practically an invitation for terrorists and would-be terrorists to come to Britain&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07032272000260"></a>and that it should be repealed and replaced with a Bill of Rights based on British traditions and balancing rights and security. While the stronger constitutional protection of human rights through a Bill of Rights would be welcome, repealing the Act and replacing it with a Bill of Rights is, in the words of the right honourable Kenneth Clarke, chair of the Conservatives&#146; Democracy Task Force, &#147;xenophobic and legal nonsense&#148;. The Conservative Party has now set up a Bill of Rights commission. It consists of seven distinguished lawyers, two of them Members of this House, all barristers, six of them men, with the only woman as secretary to the committee. I wish them well, but I suggest that they might broaden their membership to include a substantial lay and minority element. Much as I respect my fellow barristers, the subject is too important to be left even to barristers, however distinguished.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07032272000232"></a>There is a powerful case for developing a British Bill of Rights to strengthen the protection given by the Human Rights Act. It would need to reflect British political and legal values, drawing on not only the convention but the other international human rights instruments and the constitutional rights recently developed by the courts from the common law. It would contribute to our public philosophy and public education on the meaning of British citizenship, providing a code of values for each new generation. The process of obtaining genuine popular consent through public consultation across the country would be as important as the outcome of the process.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07032272000233"></a>Next week, the British section of the International Commission of Jurists will launch a discussion paper, to which I and others from this House have contributed, which seeks answers to key questions about whether and how to achieve a Bill of Rights for Britain.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07032272000234"></a>Finally, two years ago, when the Government accepted the right of individual petition to the UN Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, they undertook to review whether to accept the right of individual petition for British cases under the other UN human rights treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Human Rights Committee. The review was due to begin last week, and I believe it did so. At present, we are out of step with every other member state of the EU, the great majority of members of the Council of Europe, and Commonwealth countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07032272000235"></a>I very much hope that the Minister will respond positively to what promises to be a fascinating debate, even though I realise that the most she can do today is to tell us, with her characteristic charm, that the Government are looking into the matter and do not necessarily have closed minds. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_time2"></a><h5><a name="07032280000499"></a>1.47 pm</h5>

<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="07032280000007"></a><b><a name="70322-0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07032280000519"></a>Baroness Whitaker:</b> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Lester, on this debate and on all he has done in the field of human rights in this country and in Europe.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07032280000008"></a>Equality is perhaps the most important of human rights, apart from the right to life itself, because without it the other rights cannot universally apply. The Labour Government&#146;s great building blocks of the sex and race laws in the 1970s, of which the noble Lord, Lord Lester, was one of the chief architects, eventually became so accepted that when I used to negotiate the UK position in Brussels and the United Nations, successive British Governments upheld them with as much pride as did the originators. They are becoming part of our way of life and part of our idea of fair play, and the same will happen with Labour&#146;s reforms on sexual orientation and ageism, if we hold fast.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07032280000009"></a>The latest achievement in this progress is the Human Rights Act, and I support everything that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said about it. But the Act has not become part of the national culture fully enough yet. It is very surprising to me that it has not been everywhere understood as the transfer into legislative principle of respect for human dignity, which we all value, as the means of protecting the vulnerable, like saving old people from being sacrificed in hospitals and abused in residential care, or obtaining entitlements for our army of unpaid carers, as the tool for balancing conflicts of rights, which are inevitable in a complex society, and as the basis for uniting diverse cultures into communities. The splendid Act could perhaps have one or two add-ons, but emphatically it would not be right to review it.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07032280000010"></a>So the tabloid press has it completely wrong when it caricatures the Human Rights Act as privileging prisoners or merely occupying lawyers; and that minority of politicians who attack the Human Rights Act is ignorant of the range of practical work it has inspired. I speak here as an advisory board member of what the British Institute of Human Rights does in supporting and educating staff in the public services like NHS trusts in how respect for the citizens they serve is really achieved, and in providing an ethical framework to help our hard-pressed social services with difficult problems. This training has been widely welcomed by service providers. Indeed, it is complementary to some of the concerns voiced in the debate initiated by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, earlier today.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07032280000011"></a>The creation of the Commission for Equality and Human Rights is the second great human rights achievement of this Government. I was one of those on the Joint Committee on Human Rights who was convinced by the evidence that this was what would make the Human Rights Act a reality. Every time an official pushes someone around for administrative convenience, every time British implementation of the many human rights treaties we have so creditably helped to draft and have signed up to is found wanting, there will be work for the commission to do in helping to create a better culture. And of course, at the bicentenary of the abolition of slavery, we do not forget the race prejudice which still disfigures our democracy. With so many commissioners of proven worth, Trevor Phillips as its chair, my noble friend Lady Prosser as his deputy, I think we shall see welcome changes.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07032280000012"></a>I mention four of the areas where I hope for a change in culture. First, although the reforms following from <I>Every Child Matters</I> are significant, we still do not respect children enough. I declare an interest as a trustee of UNICEF UK. Although the rights of the child are paramount in law, we except child asylum seekers and children in custody from that protection. That affects a minority of children, although among the most vulnerable. But all children are disadvantaged by their lack of equal protection with adults against assault, which is where I part company with the noble Lord, Lord Lester.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07032280000013"></a>Secondly, I became aware, as a member of the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, of the stigma and discrimination that mental health patients still suffer. We need to work on that.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07032280000014"></a>Thirdly, I think we have got it wrong about boys. When I was responsible for gender discrimination in the then Employment Department, statistics showed an alarming picture. In health, from birth, in educational achievements, in crime and violence and in alcohol abuse, boys seemed to have drawn the short straw. It has not really changed since, and for some groups it is worse than for others. It is paradoxical that once they grow up they manage on average to earn quite a lot more than women, but then if we want to erode prejudice against women, for that reason also we need to care differently for boys. I sometimes think that if these statistical tables had shown the same story about girls, there would have been a national outcry. But, as it was, with discrimination against girls having such a long historical past, I could never get a budget to work up programmes for boys.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07032280000015"></a>Finally&#151;I hope the commission has members who will appreciate this point&#151;non-religious belief does not have the same status as faith in our society. I do not think I have ever heard an agnostic or an atheist contribute their ethical perspective on &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;, and I do not often see the British Humanist Association, for instance&#151;I declare an interest as a vice-president&#151;called in to advise the Government when the faith groups do so. I have nothing against faith and I especially warm to some of its practitioners. But I would like ethical views like mine&#151;about 14 per cent of the population&#151;to be taken into account rather than marginalised and discriminated against. I hope the Government will resist any move in any new European constitution to do otherwise.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07032280000016"></a>All this, and more, is unfinished business in the exhilarating and essentially constructive field of human rights and fundamental freedoms. This Government have opened up the prospect of a truly rights-based society and I trust, with our new institutions, we can complete the job.</p>

I do not have her longstanding experience in these matters any more than I have the legal expertise of the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, whom I warmly congratulate on initiating the debate. I am very glad to take part in it and I hope he is not too alarmed to know that I agree with quite a lot of what he said.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07032280000018"></a>I enter the debate with some temerity, being neither a lawyer nor an expert. I suppose I am just a representative of the average Back-Bench Peer in the street. I take heart from what I have heard a noble friend of the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, who is not in his place&#151;say in a debate earlier this month. On quite a technical issue, up popped the figure of my noble friend Lady Knight of Collingtree&#151;she too is not in the Chamber&#151;and, although the debate was technical, she got right to the heart of the matter. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, said it was a very good thing&#151;I quote from memory but more or less exactly&#151;that these issues were not left to barristers or to experts and that it was sometimes right to have an outside view. One of the most memorable things, among many, that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said is that some issues are too important to be left to barristers. With respect, the issue of human rights is one of them. This afternoon, I model myself on my noble friend Lady Knight, which may surprise some noble Lords.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07032280000019"></a>In doing so, I warn those Members of the House who are of a delicate disposition that there may be some criticism of the nature of current liberal thought in what I say. I mean not Liberal Democrat political thought but liberal thought in its general, metropolitan sense. There is even a risk of criticism of that conveniently self-canonising set of latter-day secular saints; the self-styled human rights lawyers. Of course, I do not refer, under any circumstance, to anyone in your Lordships' Chamber this afternoon.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07032280000020"></a>It may well occur to some, who are legally trained or who have greater experience than I have, that something I say&#151;I shall concentrate entirely on religious freedoms&#151;may be covered by this article of the European Convention on Human Rights, or that clause of an Act of Parliament. If any Member pops up to ask, &#147;Don&#146;t you know that?&#148;, I am quite likely to say, &#147;No, I do not know that&#148;. You will not get a very smart answer, if tempted.</p>

<a name="70322-0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07032280000021"></a>Following something that the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, said about atheists, agnostics and people who are not of faith but who have deeply held ethical views, I am the first to admit that for hundreds, if not thousands of years, until very recently, the Christians in the UK were more or less top dogs, disapproving of atheists, agnostics and those who were not of faith&#151;the secular. That is totally wrong. It is absolutely right that in this place we should consider the ethical stance and views of those who belong to the British Humanist Association or whatever. I would be very interested to hear people speak on &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;, even if the lurking Conservative in me says, &#147;Bring back &#145;Lift up Your Hearts&#146;&#148;. None the less, I would wish to hear that voice and I would respect it.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07032280000022"></a>Things are the other way around now. These days, the seculars rule the roost and it seems to me, by some sort of reverse act of God, that sometimes the religiously inclined find or perceive themselves to be the new oppressed, rightly or wrongly&#151;a minority needing the help of true liberals. Alas, in the sometimes suffocating atmosphere of contemporary liberalism, we see the beginnings of what I perceive as a form of soft secular totalitarianism. It is an approach that is absolutely tone deaf to nuance. It wishes, rather, to categorise, is often against any diversity that offends the contemporary fashionable secular creed of the day, and participates in rhetoric rather than reality.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07032280000023"></a>The problem is that an increasing number of those of religious orientation, whether Christian or from any other faith group, feel that they are simply being denied the right to be themselves. That perception may be wrong, but it is there and should not be dismissed. This was neatly summed up in a letter that arrived on my desk out of the blue on 10 March from a correspondent in Glasgow whom I do not know. I have not sought her permission to use her name, but I will quote from her letter. For the avoidance of doubt and to help, as always, our hardworking <I>Hansard</I> writers, who have never made a mistake in my speeches&#151;so the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, must have been joking in his speech&#151;I begin:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="07032280000431"></a>&#147;I believe that the right to religious freedom is a fundamental human right, which recognises the right of the human person to act in accordance with his/ her conscience. Moreover, I believe that religious bodies have a right to manifest their religious beliefs by establishing and maintaining institutions and services in accordance with those religious beliefs and values&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032280000413"></a>I&#151;a non-expert, non-human-rights lawyer&#151;could not have written better.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07032280000024"></a>Sometimes, the new and also sometimes militant secularism that seeks, little by little, to force a new morality on our churches, does not act in the most balanced way and needs the help of the liberal human rights lawyer. The role of the state is truly over-reached when it tramples on legitimate moral freedoms. There is an urgent need to revisit the protection of religious minorities in the United Kingdom. It may be that some noble Lords may say that the list of five areas I am about to give is covered by this or that bit of whatever Act or European Convention. However, we need to revisit them to ensure that those assertions are true.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07032280000025"></a>First, we need to revisit the fact that religious freedom is a fundamental human right, grounded in the dignity of the individual, which recognises the right of woman or man to act in accordance with their conscience. Secondly, individuals should not be restrained in any way from acting in accordance with their religious beliefs. Thirdly, all religious bodies should have the right to demonstrate and teach their religious beliefs. I am talking here about all religious bodies. Further to my earlier remarks in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, that should include those who have strong ethical feelings, but come from non-religious bodies. Fourthly, religious bodies should have the unfettered right to establish and maintain institutions and services that reflect their beliefs and values. That is, I know, a contentious point that has been much in noble Lords&#146; minds in recent days, but it is important to revisit it to make sure that the balance between secular and religious society is right. Fifthly, the Government do not have the right to inhibit acts of religion or to force people to act contrary to their conscience in a proper exercise of religious freedoms.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07032280000026"></a>The time has come for those interested in human rights&#151;even those of the most secular bent of mind&#151;to revisit these issues in the interests of what are now an increasingly small minority in this country. Overweening and overbearing secularism should not be allowed to trump religious freedom on any occasion. I borrow from Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O&#146;Connor, who said that we may be reaching a position in our present law-making where there is no space for the Christian conscience. True liberals, of all political beliefs and none, would surely wish to see that space provided and protected.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07032280000027"></a>Mention of the Roman Catholic cardinal leads me to my last point and to declare my adherence to that faith. On the statute book of this country, we still have an absolutely disgraceful discrimination specifically aimed at Roman Catholics, and over which there is generally a deafening silence from the secularists and human rightists. There is not much campaigning from them on this issue here or in the other place. There are four such statutes, which I shall enumerate: the Coronation Oath Act 1668; the Act of Settlement 1701; the Act of Union 1707; the Accession Declaration Act 1910. These all have provisions preventing Roman Catholics or those married to Roman Catholics acceding to the Throne&#151;some protection for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Roman Catholics in those statues, which Parliament forces on the monarchy.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07032280000028"></a>The Government should have acted on this long ago. I asked the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor a Question a few weeks ago and in his Written Answer he told me:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="07032280000432"></a>&#147;The Government currently have no plans to bring forward legislation on this issue&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report,</I> 5/3/07; col. <I>WA 6</I>.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032280000029"></a>Will the Minister please tell the House this afternoon why not? Will she also reflect on the insulting discriminatory nature of this approach to the Roman Catholic community in the United Kingdom, perhaps pausing on the difficulties that this can cause Roman Catholics in public life?</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07032280000030"></a>I give one entirely theoretical, but entirely plausible, example of this. Suppose that the heir to the monarch of the day&#151;I talk of any day&#151;wishes to marry the Roman Catholic son or daughter of an equally Roman Catholic privy counsellor. The monarch of the day, under the force of the four statutes that I have enumerated, will be forced to say that, while continuing to welcome the advice and loyalty of the Roman Catholic privy counsellor parent, because of what we gratuitously left on the statute book, the new son-in-law or daughter-in-law is unwelcome as consort to the heir to the throne. So in our statute book, we enshrine Roman Catholics as second-class citizens. This is swept under the carpet, particularly by some in the liberal and legal human rights area. Parliament urgently needs to free the monarchy from this disgraceful discriminatory nonsense. Those most involved should recognise the burden that this places on Roman Catholic privy counsellors from time to time.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07032280000031"></a>My second and last request to the Minister is that she undertakes to draw my remarks to the attention of the Lord President of the Council, who can expedite a meeting of privy counsellors to discuss these issues. I say only to all in this place who really care for human rights, that I hope that they will be as vigorous on this issue as they quite properly are on the issues of sex, age and racial discrimination.</p>

There is no one better qualified in this House to speak on these issues. With regard to the mistake in yesterday&#146;s record, I assure him that we are quite good at division among ourselves, without his assistance in the record.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07032280000033"></a>A bishop of the established church enters a debate on human rights and fundamental freedoms with due humility and caution. The modern liberal state arose from weariness with the European wars of religion. The attempt to protect fundamental freedoms and entrench human rights in law was not always met with sympathy from churches and religious leaders. It is not an edifying spectacle. As we have seen in this House this week, difficult issues arise in this field when liberty of conscience is set in tension with human rights.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07032280000034"></a>It is worth at the outset reminding ourselves that, in Parliament, the law, the elected representatives of the people, the church and those who sit in this place representing a wide diversity of interest have one common duty under God&#151;to defend the liberties of the people and to uphold the role of a just and equitable law.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07032280000035"></a>One of the interesting things about our intellectual history is that here, in some contrast to the revolutionary experience on the Continent and even in the United States of America, the principles of the Enlightenment and the values and visions of Christian faith were not set in opposition to each other&#151;a point made by the noble Lord. In her book <I>The Roads to Modernity</I>, Gertrude Himmelfarb even claims that John Wesley and the early Methodists were part of the Enlightenment in this country. The Wesleys evidenced that in a generosity of spirit that moved in the direction of universal values and moral sentiments. In the United States of America, at an earlier moment, Jonathan Edwards, that great person in the middle of 18th-century America who was both a preacher of the religious awakening and a contributor to the philosophy of the Enlightenment, seemed to hold the two faces of American culture together in his own person&#151;strong religious experience and wide reasoning sympathies.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07032280000036"></a>I was sorry to see in the 50th anniversary celebrations of the European Community that we were not able to celebrate the roots in our Christian tradition of our contemporary inheritance. I hope that we might be able to do so as that debate develops. Deep in the heart of serious Christian thought, over many centuries, has been a concern for the rights of the oppressed and the excluded, and deep in our liturgies and spiritual inheritance is the theme of liberty of conscience. Yes, as with every institution and powerful social agency, there have been nightmare scenarios of the church&#146;s collusion with oppression and attacks on freedom. But a golden thread runs through our history that we need to contribute to establishing an unshakable foundation for human rights and liberty of conscience in our own time.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07032280000037"></a>There is some astonishing Christian thinking in our history. Last year, I had the privilege of reviewing Roger Ruston&#146;s latest book, <I>Human Rights and the Image of God</I>, on Francisco de Vitoria, Bartolom&#233; de Las Casas and John Locke. Las Casas spent his whole intellectual life arguing against the conquest of Mexico and Peru. An interesting programme on television last night mentioned him. He opposed the enforced conversion of the people and the illegal appropriation of their lands by the conquerors. He made it clear that, from a moral and religious perspective, all the gold, jewellery and land that had been appropriated by the Spaniards should be restored to the people. In his view, it was a breach of the Gospel to seek conversion by force.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07032280000038"></a>Las Casas even resisted the argument that the Spanish conquest could be justified on the ground of ending the Indian culture of human sacrifice and cannibalism, which is interesting, given some of the debates going on today. He declared that the Indians had not only a right of dominion over their lands and goods, but a natural right, even a duty, to worship according to their own light until such time as they were freely persuaded otherwise. He said that people are free to change by persuasion and the excellence of what is presented&#151;not by force or the abuse of power, but through a fundamental respect for their own integrity and liberty of conscience.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07032280000039"></a>The example is extreme and takes little account of the liberties of those being sacrificed and consumed, one might say, but its point is important on the protection of people from the abuse of power&#151;political, religious and cultural. As a more contemporary thinker, Emmanuel Levinas, whose structure of thought was born in the fire of the Holocaust, said in our own time, we have a binding obligation to give ourselves to the other, always responding to their otherness and difference from us.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07032280000040"></a>Religious belief gives to us an under-girding of our culture and the law on human rights and procedure, with an understanding of the moral and spiritual worth of the person and of human society. Picking up the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Patten, I suggest that our society, given its history, needs a fresh engagement between the traditions of the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason, freedom, equity, community and moral virtue, and the experience and reasoning of religious faith. If, in these days of so much abuse of human beings and their rights, we do not consciously seek to enliven that conversation and relationship, we may well be in danger of allowing our culture to lapse into one with a growing abuse of power, growing acceptance of violence against the person and an ever widening gap between peoples of different cultures in our society.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07032280000041"></a>It is vital to maintain civil liberties in the face of various challenges in our time, not least the challenge of security. The most dramatic and urgent of these challenges is terrorism, but fear of crime and disorder also generates demands for actions that would erode or abrogate fundamental freedoms. We have already seen this in the provision for control orders against terrorist suspects and we are constantly being told that the criminal justice system must be rebalanced in favour of victims by restricting the rights of the accused. There is a major non sequitur in that argument, for doing justice to victims depends on convicting the guilty, and any moves that substantially increase the possibility of convicting the innocent would not only be unjust but would fail in their intended purpose.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07032280000042"></a>Central to the life of a liberal, democratic society is the administration of justice. We should, therefore, cherish the provisions of the European convention relating to due process: Article 5, which stipulates the conditions for deprivation of liberty; Article 6, which guarantees the right to a fair trial; and Article 7, which prohibits punishment without law. Frequently, good reasons may well be advanced for eroding those provisions, but it is at such moments that proposals to curtail rights and to restrict liberties must be scrutinised in order to ensure that the social order that we are endeavouring to defend by those means will remain worth defending.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07032280000043"></a>We must not set liberty of conscience and the rights of the individual in opposition to each other&#151;a hierarchy of rights, which has been mentioned, in which we argue as to which is more important than the other. Guarding the liberty of the person&#146;s conscience and a right for them to live their life according to it is, in the light of some important themes in Christian theology, a fulfilment of our duty; it is not in conflict with it. I am not required to agree with my neighbour; I am required to defend their liberty of conscience and they are required to defend mine.</p>

Like many noble Lords, I believe that the Human Rights Act is and remains the right vehicle for acting for the rights of British citizens. Before I came to this debate I spoke to a number of people, many from black and ethnic-minority communities, who increasingly felt that their liberties were being curtailed and that they were isolated and watched. We are the most watched population in Europe; the Government have found many ways of gathering more and more information on us. Many of us have little idea what other bodies have access to that information and how it is secured.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07032280000045"></a>The Government have not inspired confidence in the British public with their IT projects, and their insistence on pushing for ID cards seems to many a very dangerous course, especially given the shambles that has followed the projects so far. To date, we have not received satisfactory answers on the holding of DNA or fingerprint details, whether or not a person has committed a crime, just on the basisof arrest.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07032280000046"></a>The Minister needs to allay the fears of the public, particularly groups who already felt that they were targets for having their liberty removed on the basis of intelligence that cannot be readily challenged. Organisations such as Liberty have warned the Government of the negative impacts ID cards will have, in particular on race relations in this country, especially among ethnic-minority communities. Can the Minister provide evidence from other countries where ID cards are in use? Do citizens in those countries feel safer, and have ID cards lessened the threats felt among people? Youths in some communities feel that they are already looked at with greater suspicion by the police and other government organisations and that they are made scapegoats when intelligence turns out to be misguided. What were the outcomes of the many meetings held around the country by Ministers to talk to communities, particularly the Muslim community, and to address alienation and ways to re-engage Muslim youth?</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07032280000047"></a>Another area that concerns me greatly is the human rights of children and young people. Sadly the headlines only highlight the small minority who cause distress and mayhem to our neighbourhoods. However, many more suffer silently each day, until they are badly injured or, in some cases, killed. I was taken aback a few days ago when a news item showed that some people felt that the NSPCC&#146;s television campaigns, encouraging people to offer financial support, were too graphic and too extreme. If those adverts distress us, can you imagine the pain and misery of children who have to endure that environment day in, day out? How do we keep failing these children when so much information is already held on us? Why is it that the police and other agencies cannot stop such atrocities, such as the example I will now give your Lordships? It was reported in the <I>Observer</I> on Sunday 4 February that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="07032280000433"></a>&#147;Britain's child protection services will face severe criticism ... when a couple are sentenced for torturing their four-year-old daughter in a case that has alarming echoes of that of Victoria Climbie&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032280000414"></a>The couple had,</p>
<ul><a name="07032280000492"></a>&#147;poured boiling liquid over the child&#146;s hands, ripped out her hair, kicked her repeatedly ... locked her in the toilet over seven terrifying weeks&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="07032280000415"></a>fed her her own faeces and given her cold baths. The parents had previously had the child taken away because there was already domestic violence between the spouses.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07032280000048"></a>I have in the past supported women who have suffered terrible physical and mental abuse at the hands of their husbands and partners to get their lives back together, to help them find support and sometimes to support them in court. Where are the rights of those women and their children protected?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07032280000049"></a>The Government&#146;s mission has been to ensure that, increasingly, people can access our personal details, give greater rights for people to enter our homes on behalf of the Government and confine us to control orders without producing any evidence or giving us a right to appeal, yet when it comes to protecting rights it seems that the powers that be and the systems let down often the most vulnerable people. Can the Minister assure the House that there will be no plans to introduce ID cards and instead that the Government will fully support greater policing and better community cohesion? Can she also assure us that much better ways of handling information can be developed so that those who are most vulnerable from bullying in schools and abuse in the home can be dealt with much earlier in the process rather than being badly damaged before intervention takes place?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07032280000050"></a>I come back to my beginning. The Government cannot say that they are the guardian of the human rights of the people in the UK when they are so determined to ignore those rights when it suits them. They cannot expect to move the goalposts when they so choose. It is the inconsistencies of their interpretation of the Human Rights Act that need to be sorted out so that people can have confidence in what the Government are doing.</p>

It is particularly appropriate 200 years after Parliament voted to end the slave trade, one of the most dreadful crimes against humanity ever committed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07032280000052"></a>I must declare an interest as chairman of the council of JUSTICE, the United Kingdom branch of the International Commission of Jurists. I also have to confess to being not only a barrister but a secular liberal. The noble Lord, Lord Patten, raised some important issues worthy of a separate debate. I note that a debate on secularism has been scheduled for the Thursday following the Recess in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Harrison. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Patten, and I could cross swords on that occasion. All I would like to say today is that I entirely agree with him about the repeal of provisions discriminating against Roman Catholics in the Act of Settlement and the other legislation that he mentioned. You will find that my party agrees, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07032280000053"></a>I pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, for her remarkable speech. It is the first time I have heard her speak and I look forward to hearing her on many future occasions.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07032280000054"></a>JUSTICE is working on a project to create a British Bill of Rights. That Bill of Rights must, we believe, undoubtedly incorporate the rights conferred by the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights. We hope to go beyond that by adding rights that are not adequately recognised by the European convention; for example, discrimination issues. Article 14 forbids discrimination on matters such as race, nationality or gender, but that prohibition is not freestanding. It is only a breach of the convention where there is discrimination in relation to the exercise of other rights under the convention. There is no express mention in the convention of discrimination on grounds such as sexual orientation or age. The European convention and the Human Rights Act do not include a right to trial by jury for serious crime. The USA and other countries whose legal systems are derived from ours recognise that in many cases as a constitutional right, although it is not recognised as such in many other countries.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07032280000055"></a>The American Constitution is one of the great masterpieces in the history of political drafting. It has survived for more than 220 years, with remarkably few changes. The American Bill of Rights was not originally part of the constitution. Almost the first action of the federal Congress was to adopt the first 10 amendments, known in the USA as the Bill of Rights, to which were later added the 13th amendment, on prohibition of slavery, and the 14th, on due process and equal protection of laws. Some provisions of the Bill of Rights are outdated and inconvenient; for example, the second amendment, on the right to bear arms, and the seventh amendment, on the right to trial by jury in civil cases. By and large, however, the American Bill of Rights does and has done an immense service for the USA, and Americans are rightly very proud of it.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07032280000056"></a>Our Human Rights Act is the closest thing that we have to the American Bill of Rights. I believe that it will be seen as the greatest achievement of the Blair Government, something which that Government have tried to undermine ever since; it is the modern Magna Carta. Why are we not as proud of the Human Rights Act as the Americans are of their Bill of Rights? There are a number of reasons. It is partly because of its sheer novelty; we have had it as legislation for less than 10 years and perhaps it has not fully bedded in yet. It is partly because the aim of the Human Rights Act was to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights, which contains the dreadful word &#147;European&#148;. That leads some otherwise rational people to foam at the mouth, even though the European Convention on Human Rights is not a creation of the European Union and was largely drafted by British lawyers led by David Maxwell Fyfe, later, as Lord Kilmuir, a Conservative Lord Chancellor. It is partly also because of a vicious campaign by some parts of the British media, which have based their attacks on the Human Rights Act on stories that involve misinterpretation of the Act by officials or that are simply untrue.</p>

<a name="70322-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07032280000057"></a>It is partly also&#151;this is particularly important&#151;because many people have not yet understood the real purpose and nature of the Bill. All of us welcome the right for ourselves to freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of private life and so on, but any Bill of Rights must confer rights not just on ourselves but on, for example, terrorists, paedophiles and illegal immigrants. It is true that they have no right to incite terrorism or to circulate child pornography&#151;nothing in the Human Rights Act requires that; far from it&#151;but there are rights, such as the right to a fair trial and the right not to suffer inhumane punishment or torture, to which they are entitled.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07032280000058"></a>Bills of Rights are directed at abuses from two very different sources, the first being against oppression by a Government. All of us understand that. We understand the damage that an oppressive Government, such as the Government of Zimbabwe today, can impose on their citizens. However, the other problem with which a Bill of Rights is meant to deal is oppression by us of other people; that is known as the tyranny of the majority. It is much more difficult for people to understand that; but we cannot claim the right to a fair trial for ourselves and refuse a fair trial for those accused of terrorism or paedophilia. We cannot detain people without trial unless they present a threat to the life of the nation. We have to be prepared to give rights to others, such as freedom to express their religious belief and freedom to change those religious beliefs, which they themselves in some cases would not be prepared to give us. Those are things that we must accept if we want to live in a humane and tolerant society. That is why, for example, I believe that the Prime Minister was wrong in saying after the London bombings of July 2005 that,</p>
<ul><a name="07032280000493"></a>&#147;the rules of the game have changed&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032280000416"></a>This is not a game, and the rules have not changed.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07032280000059"></a>The European Convention on Human Rights is a pragmatic document and gives government all the necessary powers for the defence of national security and prevention of crime. Without a Bill of Rights there is a real and increasing danger that we would become a brutal and vindictive society. Surely that is not a society in which we would wish to live.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07032280000060"></a>I wish to add a coda to what I have said. I understand from newspaper reports that the budget for the DCA is to be cut by over 3 per cent in real terms. I understand that law and the lawyers are not necessarily popular and that, politically, there is more to gain in the short term by putting more money into hospitals and less into the legal system, but if we carry that problem too far we will end up with very slightly improved hospitals and a legal system in meltdown. The budget for the DCA is about &#163;3 billion a year or about a third of what we are paying for the 2012 Olympics. Most of the budget goes on legal aid, but legal aid has been squeezed for years. Because criminal legal aid gets priority, civil legal aid&#151;which is essential in, for example, cases concerning the right to housing and to benefits and cases of family breakdown&#151;is on its way to being squeezed out entirely. I attach no blame to the Minister in this, and no doubt she is as anxious as I am to see that we have a strong legal aid system, but I believe that the destruction, which has been going on for some time and looks as if it might be accelerating, of what was once one of the world's best systems of legal aid will do immense damage to the rule of law and to human rights in this country.</p>

Human rights have come from international treaties and were not invented by this Government, as is sometimes implied, but the Government do deserve credit for incorporating them into legislation, and about time. My own generation&#151;students of the 1960s&#151;long expected this pursuit of human rights to come from a progressive Government, not a conservative one. Perhaps that was because my father was a Tory MP with rather different interests and I did not immediately identify the search for justice for victims of poverty, persecution, crime and avarice with conservatism. However, now that I have heard the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, and had a chance to read David Cameron&#146;s article in the current issue of <I>Christian Aid News</I>, and despite what the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said pertinently about the attitude to terrorism in the Conservative Party, or parts of it, I realise that I was wrong. It is, and it always has been, a Conservative objective. It is just that they never boasted about it. Perhaps they felt it was unobtainable.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07032280000079"></a>I welcome the fact that all political parties are laying claim to this great inheritance, and I do not except the Cross Benches either; but we are still far from honouring the commitments that we have made. Today I should like to get over one simple point&#151;that human rights are not contained within frontiers; they are indivisible, and international development has to go hand-in-hand with human rights protection in this country.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07032280000080"></a>Perhaps I may quote the case of an asylum seeker who has been in touch with me recently, whom I shall call Maria. She comes from northern Mozambique. She is the child of a Christian Portuguese father and an Indian Muslim mother, so she can be called a world citizen with no claim to anywhere. During Mozambique's violent civil war, of which I had some experience myself, she lost contact with both her parents and any relevant documents were lost. She became a street child, homeless, sheltering with others along railway lines and even wandering across frontiers until a Portuguese family helped her to obtain a forged Portuguese passport.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07032280000081"></a>Maria entered the UK in 1992 and for five years she managed to start a new life. She found work cleaning and cooking. She took English classes and was soon able to pay tax and national insurance. It seemed like a success story until her passport&#151;her fake passport&#151;was stolen. Although she reported it, she had thereby lost her only form of identification. At this point her work came to an end. There were no taxes paid. Her claim for asylum was turned down in 2005 and her allowance from NASS was stopped. She became destitute and reliant on the charity of churches. It seems that she still does not belong anywhere.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07032280000082"></a>Two years later, Maria remains stateless, rejected by the Home Office and the Mozambique embassy. She says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="07032280000435"></a>&#147;I&#146;m left begging for everything every day ... I am extremely exhausted, depressed and fearful ... I have no money for daily living ... I wander aimlessly in the streets ... (Yet) I sustained myself by working hard ... educating myself and paying my taxes in this country and lived peacefully. That&#146;s not what criminals normally do&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032280000420"></a>She is being punished, she says, although she is a war victim. She is no &#147;sponger&#148; or danger to society.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07032280000083"></a>How many men and women like Maria are there out there roaming the streets because the IND cannot look at individual cases and make initial decisions outside the tick boxes? How much more evidence is needed that in the search for neat solutions under the new asylum model and the host of regulations, we are letting down people of real quality? Here is someone who is the antithesis of the asylum seeker of popular imagination who is taking bread from our own mouths&#151;I warm to what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said about legal aid, of which I am sure the Minister will take note&#151;someone who has not only suffered human rights abuses of many kinds but whom our society also needs and should cherish. Instead, we are condemning this person to the life of the street children that she thought she had left behind.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07032280000084"></a>It is difficult to solve human rights problems far from home. This morning, by invitation of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, I listened to appalling stories about the treatment of Chechen women at the hands of the Russian state. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford referred to such tyranny. When will we in Europe stand up to Russia, to hold up a mirror of what it is doing to persecute women who try only to stand up for themselves and explain the brutality they have suffered?</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07032280000085"></a>On Monday, with the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and others, I heard some distressing tales of women who have suffered human rights abuse in Herat in western Afghanistan. These were mainly cases of domestic violence against women who had been forced into marriage or servitude of various forms, and they had often been attacked, tortured and even set on fire. Some had opted for self-immolation. The remarkable woman who was trying to help them through a very small charity fully accepted that her efforts, although commendable in the context of her educated background, were feeble beside the trend of custom and tradition in Afghanistan. These stories can be told in our own communities, as we have heard, but when human rights workers come from afar to share their predicament we have obligations towards them. Their biggest task at home is to change the attitudes of politicians and people in authority who condone these practices in their own country. We have an obligation to help them, and, as countries contributing to their reconstruction, we may be able to help.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07032280000086"></a>While human rights are indivisible and should be upheld anywhere, it is plainly impossible for all these problems to be solved by international development. It takes time for education and understanding to work themselves through in those countries to resolve the problems which the law by itself cannot solve.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07032280000087"></a>On the other hand, if women such as Maria, along with thousands of families from Africa and Asia who now live in this country, have been able to escape from lives of poverty, civil war and human rights abuse, and are on our doorstep, can we not see them as equally deserving of international development in this country? Is not the filter of immigration control also a means of sustaining life and of celebrating survival? </p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07032280000088"></a>This week we are celebrating 50 years of the European Union. As part of that we can rejoice at the standards we have set for ourselves in Europe, as expressed through the various conventions. I am not sure that I want to see much more written down or any more Bills of Rights. I would prefer to see a Europe which stops navel-gazing and constitution-seeking and looks outwards to the rest of the world. We have a great deal more to offer today than we had in 1957; and we could be more generous still.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07032280000089"></a>In many ways we have become a magnet. That too brings obligations. Many of our citizens are alarmed by the prospects of migration. Yet we in Europe, with our ageing population and job shortages in certain sectors, need to attract more people to work here. Europe's population is falling rapidly. As a proportion of the world&#146;s total, it was 12 per cent in 1945; it is down to 8 per cent today; and it is projected to fall to 4.5 per cent in 2050. Meanwhile, the pressure of refugees and migrants is greater than ever. This is surely not a threat but an opportunity, as I know the Government sometimes tell us, yet instead through some of our inward-looking policies we are in danger of condemning the persecuted to more misery, the poor to more penury and the homeless to a life on the streets.</p>

We heard about them in the Joint Committee on Human Rights. We even heard of one poor woman who had AIDS and was refused treatment on the National Health Service. She had no money and could not afford to have it done privately. That is something of which this country should be deeply ashamed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07032280000091"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, had a lovely sort of love fest for the Human Rights Act. She said that the Prime Minister&#146;s record was frightfully good on it. I suggest that his record on it is absolutely appalling. He has introduced 3,000 new crimes and has said that ancient liberties are an old-fashioned virtue. Let us remember that the Human Rights Act, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, was written by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, and Lord Kilmuir. I cannot mention Lord Kilmuir without remembering that little ditty:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="07032280000436"></a>&#147;There&#146;s nothing worse than death in life</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07032280000092"></a>The Lord Chancellor lectures us on the glories of Magna Carta, ancient liberties and the rule of law. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, sometimes reminds me of the French Army. France was the aggressor in Europe for about 300 years, but it managed to get away with it because it had an enormous amount of charm and panache&#151;and it produced very good food. When the poor old Germans start behaving like that, they have neither of those so they get very strongly disapproved of.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07032280000093"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has presided, almost with the panache of a French general, over an assault on our human rights and ancient liberties. I will list them because it is a list of which we should be deeply ashamed. I quickly note to my noble friend Lord Patten, who is not in his place, that the reason for keeping the Crown in the hands of the Church of England is that the Crown is supreme governor of the Church of England, and there is no hurry to repeal this legislation, if it needs to be repealed. In the Great Papal Bull of Regnans in Excelsis, Pope Pius V said that Queen Elizabeth could reasonably be assassinated by her Roman Catholic subjects because they could not show twin loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church and their lawful sovereign. The noble Lord, Lord St John of Fawsley, told me&#151;and we all know that he is an essentially genius-like authority on these matters&#151;that that Papal Bull was eventually repealed, but in the reign of our present Sovereign in 1958.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07032280000094"></a>I should like to list some of the things that the Government have done which I regard as assaults on British liberties. Earlier this week we debated the Fraud (Trials without a Jury) Bill. The Government had earlier been persuaded by pressure from this House that such a provision could be brought in only by affirmative order. Knowing full well that they could not get it through by the affirmative procedure, they decided to produce a Bill on which they thought they might be able to invoke the Parliament Act. That is cheating, frankly. It is going back on what they said and, as was pointed out in the debate, those liberties are essential and should be guarded.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07032280000095"></a>In no particular order, we have had the retaining of fingerprints from innocent people and the taking of DNA samples from children. It has been reported that up to a quarter of Afro-Caribbean males have had their DNA samples kept. The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, adduced that; and rightly so. It is a disgrace.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07032280000096"></a>You can now be sent to prison&#151;admittedly, indirectly&#151;on the basis of hearsay evidence. ASBOs can be given on hearsay evidence. We know how unreliable that can be. If you breach an ASBO, that is contempt of court and inside you go. Consequently, you can go inside on the basis of hearsay evidence. That is against all natural justice.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07032280000097"></a>Under control orders, of which we have been hearing in the JCHR, you do not hear the evidence against you. If your advocate hears what is called closed evidence, he is not allowed to pass it on to you, so you have no idea what are the charges against you. We still refuse to use intercept evidence.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07032280000098"></a>Terrorism is criminal. Do not give it the flattery of calling it a war. We are dealing with criminals&#151;of, I quite accept, a very nasty character. We must deal with them in the criminal way according to law and according to criminal evidence. The Government want to lock up people for 90 days without trial. Thanks to parliamentary action, the limit has been held at 28 days. Some of us would say that that is too long. During the whole of the IRA troubles, people could be held for only 96 hours without charge. We managed, more or less, to contain that. Through hints, we know that the Government are trying to increase that to 90 days.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07032280000099"></a>We have the Regulatory Reform Act, which includes powers for Ministers, admittedly under restrained circumstances, to change Acts of Parliament. We have the Civil Contingencies Act, which again can repeal Acts of Parliament. Parts of the Animal Health Act allow Ministers much greater power than they should have.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07032280000100"></a>There are the provisions for the prevention of serious crime and disorder. If someone thinks that someone is a crook, and a big enough crook at that, he can be put under house arrest, have his bank accounts frozen and be banned from using the internet or the telephone. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, these people have their rights. I am not saying that they should be allowed to be drug dealers, major fraudsters or bank robbers. Of course I am not. I am saying that it is a very old established thing that you are innocent until proven guilty and you cannot just be locked up on suspicion.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07032280000101"></a>I believe that there were 439,000 applications to monitor telephone calls last year. About 500,000 people have been stopped and searched under terrorism laws, including yours truly, who was driving down the Embankment and was stopped by two policemen and three special constables. When I said that I had had my car searched in the House of Lords car park and showed them my identity card, they redoubled their endeavours to search my car. I did not object to that, but, on principle, it is wrong. I accept that in my personal circumstance it may be perfectly justified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07032280000102"></a>Under terrorism laws, people have been arrested for having something rude about the Prime Minister on a T-shirt at an agricultural show. People have been arrested and charged under the Crime and Disorder Act for reading out the names of war dead in front of the Cenotaph.

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07032280000108"></a>The passing of the Act will be commemorated throughout this country and internationally this year. A wide range of organisations is working on the political and social legacy of the slave trade while highlighting the work of prominent abolitionists such as Olaudah Equiano, Ignatius Sancho, Hannah More and William Wilberforce, and the wealth generated through the slave trade in places such as Bristol, Liverpool, Birmingham, Lancaster and London. There will be a significant exhibition here in Westminster Hall indicating the role of Parliament in both sustaining and abolishing that abominable traffic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07032280000109"></a>This afternoon, I want to raise the issue of public consciousness regarding human rights culture but, first, I want to say just a little about the role of the arts in human rights debates. I should here declare an interest as chair of the advisory group on the parliamentary exhibition and as co-curator, along with Dr Nima Poovaya Smith, of an Arts Council-funded programme of artistic commissions and events to commemorate the bicentenary, &#147;Freedom and Culture&#148;. The project aims to demonstrate the continuing role that the arts play in the emancipation of the human spirit&#151;a theme that occurs throughout history, but particularly in relation to African diaspora encounters with Europeans.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07032280000110"></a>Historically, artists, writers and scholars have played a key role in shaping, influencing and informing events relating to physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual freedoms. It is therefore crucial that the arts sector makes a considered and high-profile contribution to the commemorations across the UK this year and that public funding continues to support art that helps to heal the human spirit, especially of the most vulnerable groups in society, to deepen understanding, to articulate complex ideas in creative ways and to expose tensions between competing rights and sensitivities. Full participation by artists and arts organisations will be important as a means of demonstrating the continuity of the engagement of artistic practice with struggles for liberation and human rights across time and place.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07032280000111"></a>It is worth reflecting on the wider meanings of the bicentenary in the context of today&#146;s debate on human rights and fundamental freedoms in the UK today. We in this House and in the other place are all too aware of the modern versions of slavery that still exist, despite the fact that it is banned in most of the countries where it is practised and despite the fact that there are several declarations, conventions and directives against such practices. The bare facts of the extent of the misery caused by trafficking in human exploitation&#151;women, children and men being forced to work, in debt for life, subject to threats and torture&#151;have been laid before your Lordships&#146; House on various occasions by many noble Lords with a deep commitment to ending those forms of exploitation.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07032280000112"></a>Within the parliamentary exhibition on the slave trade, Anti-Slavery International has curated a section revealing insight into the relevance of the history of enslavement to our current situation. More than 180 years after its establishment, the organisation&#146;s campaign against enforced labour and the denial of human freedom and rights is still necessary and vital in a contemporary globalised world.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07032280000113"></a>Internationally, Anti-Slavery International continues to press relevant agencies of the United Nations, such as the Commission on Human Rights and the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, to make the issue of trafficking a priority and to ensure that the rights of the person trafficked are central to any anti-trafficking measure. Anti-Slavery International&#146;s anti-trafficking programme comprises three elements: campaigning to end human trafficking; lobbying for victim protection; and research on measures that Governments take to protect the victims of trafficking, especially those who act as witnesses. This last point is vital. Assurances of protection against revenge are absolutely essential if the anti-trafficking measures are to be effective. The establishment and protection of the human rights of those who are victims of contemporary forms of the abominable traffic should surely be a priority in any anti-trafficking strategy.</p>

<a name="70322-0008.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07032280000114"></a>Those in Britain who denigrate the notion of human rights often do so from the vantage point of having benefited from centuries of struggle to achieve them. The mischievous misrepresentation of a few high-profile cases misleads the public and contributes to antipathy towards these issues. Frivolous uses of the term to refer, for example, to people who wish to smoke in restaurants or drive fuel-hungry vehicles distort the intentions and do a disservice to those powerless victims of human rights abuses who have no public voice. The freedoms and rights to which we refer are fundamental and should be unarguable.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07032280000115"></a>Although we should recognise that Britain has travelled some distance in respect of human rights since 1807, we need to be aware of the extent to which these gains have often had to be wrung from reluctant Governments, have frequently been contested and resisted by politicians from all parties, and have sometimes entailed defamation of people&#146;s characters. Sadly, they have also sometimes resulted in the loss of life. We should also recognise that many members of the general public are still unaware&#151;or, worse, uncaring&#151;about the fact that, for example, switching on the lights has an impact on the freedoms and rights of the people of the Niger delta, or that the cheap shoes or rugs that we buy come at the expense of the physical and intellectual development of young children. And what about those men who think nothing of using a brutalised woman trafficked here for their gratification from Europe and Africa? Our own human rights achievements count for nothing if we perpetuate pain and misery for other, more vulnerable human beings elsewhere. One of the reasons why the trans atlantic slave trade could thrive for centuries was that the people of this country refused to regard enslaved Africans as fellow human beings. Surely we do not want to continue with that view today.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07032280000116"></a>Government action should be informed by the values that we claim to hold dear, in the tradition of those who have struggled and have sacrificed their lives for the principles of universal enfranchisement, children&#146;s rights, women&#146;s suffrage, anti-racism and anti-discrimination. It should not be shaped by the political agendas of the tabloid press.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07032280000117"></a>We are on the threshold of launching a new body that recognises the importance of the need for embedding in Britain a human rights culture that takes these issues seriously. In October this year, the newly formed Commission for Equality and Human Rights will come into being. In a briefing sent out on this debate, the Disability Rights Commission, one of the organisations that will be subsumed into the new body, states that the,</p>
<ul><a name="07032280000496"></a>&#147;CEHR will have a strong set of tools to strengthen individual rights, shift institutional behaviour and transform public attitudes&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032280000421"></a>I sincerely hope that that statement is correct. I also hope that the Minister will be able to say something about the contribution that the new commission will make to public education and understanding of these issues, particularly the real meaning of a human rights culture. With the right powers and resources, the establishment of the CEHR could mark a new era in the development of a progressive rights and equalities agenda for all citizens of this country. It could also develop a deeper sense of connection to struggles for freedom and rights across the globe.</p>

<a name="07032280000118"></a><b><a name="70322-0009.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07032280000531"></a>Lord Sheikh:</b> My Lords, historically, the people of Britain were protected not by a written human rights Bill but by ancient statutes such as the Magna Carta, the 1689 Bill of Rights and the principle of habeas corpus. However, as we approached the 21st century, it became necessary to offer a more structured definition of the rights of the individual and how these should be protected in our modern society. This resulted in the Human Rights Act 1998, which came into force in October 2000, tying Britain to rights detailed in the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07032280000119"></a>The Human Rights Act solidified the relationship that Britain already had with the European Convention on Human Rights, of which it had been a signatory since 1966. The intention was to make it easier for individuals to protect their rights in the British judicial system. Since 2000, however, the interpretation of the Act and the failure to find the right balance between individual and community rights have led to the emergence of a culture of rights, which is being exploited to the extreme. Several high-profile cases have attracted media attention by highlighting the difficulties that the British courts have had in translating the Act into practice&#151;for example, the Court of Appeal&#146;s refusal in 2004 to deport nine Afghan hijackers, despite the fact that the Taliban regime that had threatened them had been toppled. This was seen as evidence of the Act&#146;s ability to put the needs of an individual above the safety of the community or even the nation.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07032280000120"></a>Not only has the Human Rights Act not been fully effective, but this Government have taken an increasingly anti-libertarian stance in the wake of September 11. Legislation such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 has attempted to restrict some of the very rights that the Labour Government intended to protect with the introduction of the Human Rights Act. Furthermore, the introduction of ID cards is totally wrong. It interferes with the privacy of citizens but does not offer them protection against harm. It is an unwanted imposition.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07032280000121"></a>There are alternatives. A debate is emerging on the feasibility of the repeal of the Human Rights Act, to be replaced by a British Bill of Rights that would reflect more accurately the relationship between the citizen, the state and security. A Bill of Rights would have to balance rights with responsibilities. It would have to outline clearly the core values that give us our identity as a nation, and would likely mirror many of the rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights. However, it would also provide the opportunity for national discourse on what fundamental civil liberties should be protected, and greater clarification of the exact details in a British context would enable the courts better to apply the Bill of Rights. This change would not remove all controversy. We could not deport some people because of the fate that awaited them in their own country. To deport them would constitute a violation of Article 3, on protection from inhuman and degrading treatment. The Bill would help to prevent decisions, such as the one concerning the Afghan hijackers in 2004, which appear to be irrational and wrong.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07032280000122"></a>A Bill of Rights would also silence critics who believe that the UK has lost too much parliamentary supremacy due to compliance with European laws. By entrenching a new Bill of Rights in Parliament, the UK would be asserting her own decision-making power and restating our legislative independence from Europe. That would clarify fundamental duties, safeguard liberties and provide equality in law and civil rights.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07032280000123"></a>Undoubtedly the system as it stands is creating far more questions than it is answering. The introduction of a new Bill of Rights would strengthen our hand in the fight against crime and terrorism. Ultimately, a British Bill of Rights would have the power to promote awareness and be a reminder to British citizens that each person has as much of a responsibility to uphold another&#146;s human rights as they have a right to have their own rights protected. If the Bill is suitably drafted, it will incorporate common values so that British citizens of all backgrounds will feel that it applies to them and there will be common ownership of the Act. I am sure, therefore, that there will be acceptance from everyone in the country.</p>

He described the human rights legislation as having a magnetic force over the whole legal system, and I am sure that he more than anyone else understands the impact of that. But I am challenged by the push indicated in his own speech and that of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, for a UK Bill of Rights. I want to reflect on that a little and question whether we need yet further legislation. The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, has rightly pointed us to the excess of law we have been engulfed in. We must ask whether we need more legislation or whether we need a different approach of mind. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said that without a Bill of Rights we would become a brutal and vindictive society. He may well be right. However, I wonder whether with a Bill of Rights we might not instead become a more punitive, aggressive and frightened society. We should take some time to consider that as an optional outcome of further legislation.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07032280000125"></a>Later this year there will be the formal launch of the new Commission for Equality and Human Rights. I welcome that, not only because it is led by my good friend Trevor Phillips and many others known to noble Lords, but also because it will attempt to take forward the work of the existing commissions and become more dynamic and progressive. I do not suggest that some of the former bodies were not, but it will seek to be. For nine years until 2001 I served on the Commission for Racial Equality, mostly under the chairmanship of my colleague and noble friend Lord Ouseley, who is not in his place today. Under his chairmanship we fought hard for the progress of race relations legislation and I was proud to be one of those who contended for the reform Act of 2001 which brought in provisions on institutional racism, the promotion of good race relations and public duty provisions. Those were significant achievements, ones I feel were worthy of the time and effort given to them.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07032280000126"></a>However, recalling those achievements caused me to reflect deeply on the amount of time consumed by the monthly meetings of the commissioners, and the paperwork and documentation that ate up our living hours as we struggled with just one of the five areas which the new Commission for Equality and Human Rights will attempt to address and get right. It has a huge remit in front of it: it must promote a human rights culture and good relations between individuals and communities; according to briefings sent to noble Lords it will try to shift institutional behaviour and transform public attitudes. It will seek to make human rights acknowledged as intrinsic to Britain&#146;s prosperity, security and well-being. These are huge, noble tasks and if I recall anything of the pressures of the Commission for Racial Equality, it will take a wise group of men and women, perhaps meeting daily, to achieve them.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07032280000127"></a>I note that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, has left the Chamber for a moment, but I want to reflect briefly on last night&#146;s discussion in this Chamber on the sexual orientation regulations. In his speech he commented on the pressure behind the regulations, saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="07032280000497"></a>&#147;it is unfortunate that the law has to be reformed by secondary legislation, since, as has been said, this reduces the scope for scrutiny of the detail of the regulations, and that the reason for this is that the Home Office unwisely included religious discrimination in the Equality Act without providing also for sexual orientation discrimination&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/3/07; cols. 1321-22.]</ul>
<p><a name="07032280000422"></a>My vote last night was cast in reflection of the fact that no matter how just, necessary and essential those regulations may well be, contentious and horrid regulations or legislation are never good law. I wonder whether there may not have been some reflection by the soon-to-emerge Commission for Equality and Human Rights on a better way to achieve all this, rather than to rush through processes which will cause many to continue to wonder whether we have given sufficient time or understanding to these critical issues, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, might make us a more brutal and vindictive society.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07032280000128"></a>My noble friend Lady Young also referred to the celebrations being held this week and throughout the year to mark the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade within the shores of the United Kingdom. It is something we should all rightly feel proud of. Last night with William Hague and Alan Johnson, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills in another place, I was privileged to host in Portcullis House the screening of &#147;Amazing Grace&#148;, the film of the life of William Wilberforce. There will be considerable discussion and debate in this House of the impact of all these issues over the rest of this year. That is something we should all welcome and want to participate in.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07032280000129"></a>But we are being encouraged to remember that the achievements of slavery reduction and removal 200 years ago are almost as nothing to what is the contemporary slavery of today, and the pain it inflicts on multitudes of our fellow human beings, involving as it does the loss of their human rights. The Deputy Prime Minister said, in a speech delivered in another place during a debate to mark the bicentenary of the abolition of slavery:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="07032280000437"></a>&#147;The ILO estimates that a minimum of 12.3 million people are enslaved in the world today. Of those trafficked into forced labour, 43 per cent. are subjected to sexual exploitation, 32 per cent. to labour exploitation, and 25 per cent. to a mixture of both. The estimated value of that criminal activity is $32 billion&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 20/3/07; col. 692.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032280000423"></a>It is easy for us to shake our heads and feel irritated and complacent, and in some sense anguished about what others do abroad in human trafficking. Let me quote from the shadow Foreign Secretary, Mr William Hague, who said later in the debate that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="07032280000438"></a>&#147;It is important that we in Britain wake up to the gravity of the situation on our own doorstep. A fortnight ago, an official at the Lithuanian Ministry of Information declared that Britain is the No. 1 destination for gangs smuggling sex slaves from countries such as his own. Last year, when our police conducted a four-month operation to tackle sex trafficking, they rescued 84 women&#151;a small number in the scheme of things, but the list of their countries of origin tells its own sorry tale of the trail of misery. Those 84 women came from Albania, Brazil, China, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, India, Iran, Jamaica, Kenya, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Namibia, Poland, Rwanda, Russia, Slovakia and Thailand&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 20/3/07; col. 701.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="70322-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07032280000130"></a>We have a lot to get right in this regard, and I question whether further legislation is really the way to achieve it. It may well be. With regard to the current slave trade and its ugly, damaging appearance in the life of this country among those people who choose to pay for services&#151;for which they should not wish&#151;from others trafficked from around the world, I only ask whether it is legislation or culture change that will achieve this. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, said that one of the key ambitions of a new UK Bill of human rights would be improved citizenship. We would all want to affirm that as appropriate; we desire it, and we would seek it.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07032280000131"></a>I shall refer to another legal expert. A Lenten talk was given on Radio 4 on 14 March by no less a figure than Cherie Booth, in her role as president of Barnardo&#146;s. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="07032280000439"></a>&#147;Fifteen year-old Andy from Newry in Northern Ireland was brought before the court for attempting to attack the police. As part of a community responsibility order, he met with police, fire service and ambulance crews who told him what it&#146;s like to be under attack from hooligans when they are trying to save lives. Andy began, for the first time, to appreciate the risks they took and the impact of his behaviour. He wrote a letter of apology to the police and joined the Fire Brigade cadets for a six week programme on public safety. The programme also helped Andy look at the things in his life which made him angry and develop ways of coping with these&#151;within his family, where both his parents had problems with substance misuse, and at school, where he was frequently in trouble. Andy is accepting responsibility for his actions&#151;but there&#146;s another way to look at this. The community is accepting its responsibility for Andy as well. All too often society wants to draw a &#147;them and us&#148; line between offenders and victims without recognising that offenders are often victims themselves. We can&#146;t ignore the fact that over a half of all 15 to 17 year-olds in custody and a third of all prisoners have been in care at some point in their lives, nor that the majority of women in prison say they&#146;ve been victims of domestic or sexual abuse. The Archbishop of Canterbury recently called on society to recognise the part it has to play in the journey of reform and rehabilitation that the offender needs to embrace, because that has to be the fundamental goal of the criminal justice system. Those who have been through our courts and prisons need to be helped to return to society as full and contributing members&#148;.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07032280000132"></a>I quote that story because I want more than ever to see us achieve, with the continued downward and upward pressure on human rights&#151;we should all be keen in that endeavour&#151;less of the weight of law and more of an opportunity for responsibility to balance rights. My concern is that a UK Bill of Rights and the continuing regulatory rights culture that we have seen around us, and all the pressure it brings to stand up for, defend and even litigate for rights, has not necessarily moved us to understand the place of duty, responsibility and fair citizenship.</p>

I shall focus on the requirements of Section 19(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act, which provides that the Minister of the Crown in charge of a Bill in either House of Parliament must make a statement to the effect that, in his or her view, the provisions of the Bill are compatible with the convention rights. That is the statement of compatibility, with which we are all too familiar. The provision was brought into force in November 1998, and we constantly see on the cover of any government Bill the short statement:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07032280000134"></a>In all parliamentary systems which have adopted a Bill of Rights or its constitutional equivalent, there has been a debate about whether the judiciary should have the sole authority when claims of rights clash with political decisions; in other words, whether judicial interpretation must prevail over political judgment. In some systems in the United States, to which my noble friend Lord Goodhart referred, and in Canada in particular, the judiciary is authorised to invalidate legislation that is inconsistent with guaranteed rights. My own first contact in this field was with the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, to which the noble Lord, Lord Wilson of Tillyorn, as Governor of Hong Kong, gave his assent in June 1991. It incorporated the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and provided, in terms, that all pre-existing legislation which does not admit of a construction consistent with this ordinance is, to the extent of this inconsistency, repealed. So if it was inconsistent, it went.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07032280000135"></a>In its early days, the Hong Kong judiciary, with this new power to strike out legislation, exercised it with a will. I appeared for the appellant in the first test of its judicial activism in the Privy Council in the case of the Attorney-General v Lee Kwong-kut in 1993. It dealt with the reverse of burden of proof in a criminal charge, an issue, incidentally, that we were debating yesterday in the Serious Crime Bill; it is important. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, expressed his disquiet at too much judicial activism and cautioned that questions of policy remained primarily the responsibility of the legislature. He held that a strict attitude towards statutory defences would merely encourage the legislature to adopt a different drafting style which would not assist individuals who were charged with offences. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="07032280000441"></a>&#147;While the Hong Kong judiciary should be zealous in upholding an individual&#146;s rights under the Hong Kong Bill, it is also necessary to ensure that disputes as to the effect of the Bill are not allowed to get out of hand. The issues involving the Hong Kong Bill should be approached with realism and good sense, and kept in proportion. If this is not done the Bill will become a source of injustice rather than justice and it will be debased in the eyes of the public&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032280000425"></a>That was colonial legislation introduced in 1991 by the British Governor, the noble Lord, Lord Wilson.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07032280000136"></a>The Human Rights Act, which we introduced here in 1998, followed a different model that was closer to that adopted by New Zealand in 1990. In that, the judiciary is not authorised to invalidate legislation that is inconsistent with guaranteed rights. As noble Lords will know, the Human Rights Act obliges courts to interpret legislation so as to be as compatible as possible with convention rights, but the court may make a declaration of incompatibility which can engage a fast-track mechanism to enable Parliament to amend that legislation.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07032280000137"></a>However, there is no obligation on the Government to use that mechanism. There is no requirement even for them to comment or to give reasons for disagreeing with the court&#146;s ruling. The problem in the United Kingdom, deriving, I have to say, from a first-past-the-post electoral system, is that strong party discipline results in very few checks on decisions of the Executive. The concentration of power in the hands of the Prime Minister of the day, barely modified even by collective Cabinet decision-making, means that guaranteed rights can be ignored or written over. The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, provided a list: the removal of jury trials in serious fraud cases and the introduction of ASBOs, control orders and, now, serious crime prevention orders by using a civil standard of proof and civil methods of proving the issues involved.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07032280000138"></a>I recognise, however, that there are some limitations. No Minister wants to be criticised for having the legislation for which he or she is responsible declared by the courts to be incompatible, hence the provisions of Section 19, by requiring a statement of compatibility, demand of every Minister some form of pre-legislative scrutiny of every government Bill. There is a natural scepticism, not least on these Benches, about the statements that appear on the front of Bills. Frequently, particularly as regards Home Office Bills, there is a sharp debate as to whether the provisions of the convention have been violated. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford pointed out, there is a clash between the maintenance of civil liberties and the attack on crime. Many of the Bills that are introduced by the Home Office contain that clash, thereby inviting a dispute about whether they comply with the convention.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07032280000139"></a>The debates that we have are informed by the reports of the Joint Committee on Human Rights to which the noble Lord, Lord Lester, referred. That committee has the important function of advising both Houses whether rights have been fully respected in the Bill in question. In addition to its consideration of representations from a wide body of opinion, the committee has the power to question Ministers to seek explanations and clarifications of legislative proposals. If a statement of incompatibility is made by a Minister under Section 19(1)(b) of the Act, there is inevitably controversy.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07032280000140"></a>As a result of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, the Home Secretary entered a derogation from Article 5.1(f) of the ECHR and the Joint Committee on Human Rights was not convinced that the three requirements set out in Article 15 were fulfilled. In particular, the committee drew to the attention of both Houses the question whether a public emergency existed which threatened the life of the nation. It drew to our attention the overly broad definition of a terrorist and the lack of due process in relation to detention orders. There was a robust debate which led to some amendments, in particular a requirement of reasonableness relating to the decision to certify a person as a suspected international terrorist, and your Lordships will recall the introduction of a sunset clause.</p>

<a name="70322-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="07032280000141"></a>However, in the case of A v Home Secretary in December 2004, the Judicial Committee of this House, sitting as a Bench of nine Lords of Appeal, held that indefinite detention under the Act was contrary to the convention and it made a declaration of incompatibility. Three years have gone by with this legislation in place and it is unsatisfactory that so many years may go by before the courts have the opportunity of pronouncing on guaranteed rights issues because during that time individuals caught in the system may suffer severely. Greater parliamentary scrutiny, therefore, is absolutely essential to ensure that rights are respected in the making of new statute law and here is where the noble Lord, Lord Patten, and the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, come in. It is not the exclusive territory of liberal totalitarian secular lawyers to determine years later whether an Act of Parliament is incompatible with the convention. It is a matter that should be at the forefront of our discussions when we actually make that legislation.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="07032280000142"></a>While the Joint Committee on Human Rights performs a vital and important role, Parliament should be better informed at the beginning of the legislative process about the Government&#146;s evaluation of rights issues and the reasoning that lies behind these formal statements of compatibility. There should be transparency. These statements in the Bill are purely formal and they contain no guide or explanation of the assumptions or the values which lie behind the Government&#146;s purposes. It simply says that the Minister certifies that this Bill is compatible with the convention. These formal statements should be accompanied or supported by relevant information which would allow Parliament to debate fully their merits and justifications. We should know what the aim of the Bill is; what harm or concern the Government are addressing; whether there is a possibility of a rights restriction; what the justification for it is; and why less restrictive measures are not being considered by the Government. We need information which we can debate at the beginning of the legislation. It should not be left to the courts years later and to the totalitarian secular lawyers to be arguing about it in succeeding years.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07032280000143"></a>I draw to the attention of the Minister an important article interpreting a Bill of Rights by Janet Hiebert of Queen&#146;s University, Kingston, Ontario in the <I>British Journal of Political Science </I>published in 2005 by the Cambridge University Press. That compares the systems of New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom and I am sure she and her department would gain a great deal from it.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="07032280000144"></a>As we have in this country consciously adopted a system which denies to the judiciary the final say when determining constitutional validity, political scrutiny of impending legislation is vital. If a Government give their reasons, they can be properly examined by the Human Rights Committee, considered by the public at large and, most importantly, tested in debate. Along with my noble friend Lord Goodhart, I have often said that the Human Rights Act is the Government&#146;s most important legacy&#151;indeed, it is probably the only positive one. It has helped to nurture the culture of respect for rights to which my noble friend Lord Lester referred.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07032280000145"></a>Criticisms of legislation by parliamentarians based on human rights considerations are not to be considered as the usual cut and thrust between opposition and government. There are few electoral votes in arguing for the rights of minorities. The noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, referred to the Afghan hijackers. I appeared in that case; they were lawyers and teachers who were escaping from the Taliban. It would have been a little unusual for us to send them back to Afghanistan when we were invading it to get rid of the Taliban. They were protected by human rights legislation. The Act should not be seen as a veto on legislative or executive action.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07032280000146"></a>The considerations of human rights are essentially assertions of the norms&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, referred to the fair play concept&#151;and values of our humane society. Parliament agreed the Human Rights Act in 1998, in the year 2007, it should be fully respected.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="07032280000512"></a>3.36 pm</h5>

<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="07032280000147"></a><b><a name="70322-0010.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07032280000534"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> My Lords, I add my congratulations to those already delivered by many other of your Lordships to the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, on initiating this debate, which I think everyone will agree has been first class.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="07032280000148"></a>Many things of real constitutional value have flowed from the arrival of the Human Rights Act on our statute book. I can think of two particular principles that have been greatly advanced and enriched by the jurisprudence of the past 10 years. First, the principle of equality, rather undervalued by the common law, has shown a remarkable development by virtue of our courts applying the European Convention on Human Rights. Another principle that has prospered has been that of non-discrimination. In his own appearances in the courts, the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, has made a vital contribution to that.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="07032280000149"></a>However, the Human Rights Act has not, in my judgment, commanded the public respect that it ought to have done and that it deserves. There are a number of reasons for this. First, there have undoubtedly been some foolish or misplaced decisions&#151;I do not know how one would properly describe them&#151;by public servants in the name of human rights that have benefited people who either did not deserve those benefits or at least were not perceived as deserving them. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has spent a great deal of time in the past two or three months agreeing that some of these decisions were foolish&#151;I am thinking particularly of the one where a certain police force seemed reluctant to issue the photograph of an escaped criminal. The noble and learned Lord has promised that new directions will be delivered to civil servants and others serving in public authorities to ensure that incorrect interpretations of the human rights legislation will be, if not entirely eliminated, at least minimised.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="07032280000150"></a>The second reason is that, despite the fact that the Human Rights Act is a product of the present Government, it continues to receive at best only lukewarm endorsement from Ministers. This is a particularly unattractive factor, especially when direct attacks are made on judges who base their decisions on human rights legislation, which is what the Act requires them to do. When political leaders make such attacks, it is no wonder that from time to time the public call its value into question.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07032280000151"></a>Thirdly, my noble friend Lord Onslow was at pains to point out that, far from protecting the traditional rights provided to us over the centuries by the common law, the Act has often proved useful camouflage for promoting legislation that undermines them. In developing his argument under Section 19, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, made glancing references to these. One thinks of jury trial, habeas corpus and the conversion of what ought to be criminal offences into civil offences in order to lighten the standard of proof on the prosecution. One thinks of what I find a particularly offensive development in our criminal law&#151;the changes made to the propensity rules in the Criminal Justice Act 2003.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="07032280000152"></a>Before the Human Rights Act was on the statute book, nobody would have dreamt of questioning these very hard earned, long established common-law rules. Yet we are now told that these changes are human rights convention compatible. The reason for this is that jury trial and a great deal of the evidential protections that flow from it are an unfamiliar feature on the continental jurisprudential terrain. Therefore, the European Court of Human Rights has been reluctant to grapple with these issues when they have been taken to Strasbourg. That is one of the reasons why talk of a British home-grown Bill of Rights is in the air.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07032280000153"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is chairman of Justice. I have the honour to serve as a vice-chairman of Justice under his benign leadership. We are both engaged in a project in Justice that seeks to assess whether the next stage in the development of human rights in the United Kingdom ought to be through our own home-grown legislation. My right honourable friend Mr David Cameron has established a committee in the Conservative Party chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell of Markyate, to address precisely the same issue. When Justice and the Conservative Party simultaneously think that there is a problem, it must be a problem well worth looking at.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07032280000154"></a>If a Bill of Rights proves to be a desirable future initiative, one of the most important contributions that it will make will be the protection of the defendant in criminal trials. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford rightly drew our attention to the frequent statements from government Ministers about rebalancing criminal law and criminal evidence in favour of victims, with the effect of reducing the rights of the accused. In other words, the defendant is more likely to be convicted. Nothing offends human rights more than a system that is prone to punishing the innocent. One of the objectives of a British Bill of Rights would be to make sure that we do not have a system that is prone to that.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07032280000155"></a>There are other objectives of such a Bill. The noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Lester of Herne Hill, might not agree with what I am about to say; they will have their own views about what ought to appear. One area that I am particularly concerned about&#151;I know that the noble Baroness is intimately involved in it at the moment&#151;is the question of due process in administrative tribunals. We are establishing a common tribunal system with a common administration, but each one of the 70-odd tribunals has its own system of due process. In some cases, the system is absolutely right for the tribunal&#146;s objective; in other cases, the process is wholly inappropriate. I would like to see some basic standards of due process set out for tribunals.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07032280000156"></a>My noble friend Lady Verma talked about us being the most photographed nation in Europe. How right she is&#151;and it is not only a question of being the most photographed. We must be one of the nations that suffer most from invasions in our privacy. Information that government departments can obtain from us can now be shared with most if not all other government departments, for purposes that we do not know. This is another area that a Bill of Rights would address.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07032280000157"></a>My noble friend Lord Patten reminded us that important aspects of religious freedom ought to be enshrined in such a Bill. I do not want to enter today into whether the list that he provided is the right one, but he has an important principle, which ought to be considered by any drafting committee.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07032280000158"></a>The draftsmen will also have to confront some awkward questions, particularly in the area of terrorism. We are obliged, not only by Article 3 of the convention but also under the international Convention against Torture, not to deport a suspected terrorist where there is a real risk that he will suffer torture in his country of destination. Anyone who is complicit in a series of events that leads to somebody being tortured is effectively now committing an international crime. This is a real problem for us when we cannot prosecute people for the offence that we allege they have committed. I am not pretending for a moment that a Bill of Rights will make all the issues that we face easier. However, there are certainly gaps in the convention that we need to fill.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07032280000159"></a>A number of your Lordships, particularly the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Hornsey, and the noble Lord, Lord Hastings of Scarisbrick, reminded us that the issue of human rights is an international problem and that, compared with many other countries, we are extremely fortunate. The noble Earl, in particular, rightly said that we perhaps ought to spend rather less time engaged in navel-gazing and more time exporting the remarkable experiences that we have had in developing our human rights legislation and doing our very best to ensure that human rights breaches are minimised in international society. I know that that is a concern. The peroration of the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, addressed precisely that issue and the extent to which we ought now to be more directly engaged as a people in the United Nations conventions on various matters that have been raised by your Lordships today. That goes beyond the defined scope of today&#146;s debate; but we should remind ourselves that those matters are nevertheless of great importance.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07032280000160"></a>I see that I have strayed a minute beyond my permitted time. In those circumstances, I shall hasten to sit down.</p>

I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Lester, on this debate. There are few in your Lordships&#146; House who can claim to have as long and expert an association with the human rights traditions of this country and issues of equality and discrimination. It is a pleasure to be able to work with him on occasions, of which today is one. I am privileged to have that opportunity.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="07032280000162"></a>Contributions have ranged across a variety of different issues such as religious freedom, the Act of Settlement, the Spanish conquest, legal aid, trial by jury, ID cards, the alienation of some of our communities, a Bill of Rights, cannibalism, the horrors of domestic violence and child abuse, Maria&#146;s story, the plight of Chechen women, the misery of slavery, statements of incompatibility, trafficking and the DCA budget, to name not all, by any means. Anyone listening to this debate who has any doubt of the relevance of the discussions on human rights to our daily lives has only to look at that range of subjects. As I only have 20 minutes in which to try to wind up this debate, noble Lords will forgive me if I do not cover all the issues that have been raised today.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="07032280000163"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patten, unfortunately left us just when the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, was kind enough to address the points that were raised; I refer him to that contribution, which, in part at least, answered some of the questions. He has chosen well in his choice of the noble Baroness, Lady Knight of Collingtree, as a good model. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and I were reminiscing, and I am reminded about her role in taking up issues&#151;in the case of the Mental Capacity Act, the issue of basic care&#151;and never allowing us to forget the importance of addressing fundamental questions of how we support, particularly, the elderly. I pay tribute to her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="07032280000164"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patten, raised some interesting questions, picked up in a number of contributions, about religious freedom and about the importance of how we tackle those issues of conscience and their relevance to this debate. The right reverend Prelate raised that too in his extremely helpful contribution.</p>

I was not in the Chamber, and I will pay attention to what my noble friend Lord Onslow said in his reference to my speech. The Minister does not need to shelter behind his albeit formidable presence in answering my two specific questions, of which I gave her due notice. It would be right for her to be kind enough to answer them.</p>

The Government still have no plans to deal with the issues that the noble Lord has raised. I will say to my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor that the noble Lord has once again raised the issue. I will see whether he has a longer answer that the noble Lord would be happy with. The second question was whether I would refer the issues to my noble friend the Lord President; I will certainly do so.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07032280000167"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Young of Hornsey, and the noble Lord, Lord Hastings of Scarisbrick, both mentioned the importance and relevance of the new Commission for Equality and Human Rights. I was privileged to take through the Equality Act in your Lordships&#146; House, and I too pay tribute to the work of Trevor Phillips, who has already begun his leadership of the commission. I completely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hastings of Scarisbrick, that this is a formidable challenge, to which I have no doubt that Mr Phillips will rise. With the help and support of the commissioners, who, in the main, have already been appointed, he will be able to do that.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07032280000168"></a>Yesterday, the ministerial group on which I serve met to address this matter to ensure that we are ready on 1 October to bring the new commission into being. It has a wide remit. It is fortunate in being born of some amazing work done under previous commissions. I agree with the noble Baroness about the contribution that the Disability Rights Commission has played. We will have to help and support the commission so that it can bring into being the new strands of work that we have given it, set against the backdrop of human rights.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07032280000169"></a>I say to my noble friend Lady Whitaker that the issues she raised about children, the plight of patients with mental health problems, problems concerning boys, and matters of religious and non-religious beliefs will be taken forward by the commission. Perhaps I can give her some comfort by saying that the Chancellor has announced an additional &#163;10 million for 2007-08, to help with improving the educational attainment of boys. Although the UK has a problem in that respect, it is not as great a problem as that of many in the OECD, but it needs to be tackled.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07032280000170"></a>The right reverend Prelate talked of the liberty of conscience. I agree with him about conversion by force, which I think we all agree is not conversion. Dealing with the abuse of power is also important. The tradition of enlightenment, expertise and the backdrop of religious faith form the essence of why debates on human rights are so important.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07032280000171"></a>The rebalancing point concerning victims was raised by several noble Lords. Quite often victims feel that their voices are not heard. The advocacy of families that have had horrendous crimes perpetrated on them is also important. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, says about ensuring fairness in trials.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07032280000172"></a>The protection of people is fundamental to the Human Rights Act. The history and traditions that form the Human Rights Act in this country and the work of the European Convention on Human Rights concern the relationship between the individual and the state and how the state, public authorities and public bodies treat those individuals. In our deliberations on human rights we must keep that as our context. It challenges us and brings us up sharp against issues that noble Lords have raised; for example, Article 3&#151;the right not to be tortured&#151;and the deporting of people whom we believe are a real threat and danger to our country but whom, for a variety of reasons, we are unable to prosecute.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07032280000173"></a>I have missed the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, although it has been very nice to debate with the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. I am very proud of the Act. I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said about the Government needing to do more. We have rightly been criticised for not promoting the Act when it came into being as well as we might have done and, in a sense&#151;I do not mean that negatively&#151;leaving it to the lawyers to own it.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07032280000174"></a>As I speak, I have 15 ministerial colleagues meeting with my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor to discuss how they are supporting and promoting the Human Rights Act. Each represents a different department. They are putting together plans to cover the training, guidance and legal advice needed for front-line staff, improving the guidance on the Act on their websites, ensuring that the guidance that we have produced is distributed fully around departments, and ensuring that particular groups of staff have the necessary advice.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07032280000175"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and others referred to the press reporting the way in which the Act has been used. There was the case of a police force and there have been others. They are good examples of why people find it hard to understand the Act and that it has a positive benefit to them, which is why people should be given the correct information about the Act. That is why my noble and learned friend launched a campaign with the title &#147;Human Rights: Common Values, Common Sense&#148;, with a message to many involved in the public sector that if you think about a common-sense response to the issues, one will almost invariably be where the Human Rights Act will take you. That is true in the case of the elderly couple who, after many years of marriage, were told that they would have to go into care in separate homes. Anyone with any common sense looking at that would say that it was inappropriate. So, too, is not publishing the photographs of criminals you are trying to catch. Common sense should play its part, but we need to give people support and guidance. These are not people deliberately trying to use the Act wrongly, but simply lacking the necessary expertise.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07032280000176"></a>I say to my noble friend Lady Whitaker how much I respect and admire the work of the British Institute of Human Rights, which has been a very expert source of help and guidance to me. Our campaign, if I can call it that, is also about opportunities for Ministers and others to talk about the Human Rights Act. My noble and learned friend will be speaking at a teachers&#146; conference at Easter, and to the Association of Chief Police Officers. I hope to speak at conferences on health and education and to meet different groups and organisations to support their work.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07032280000177"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, spoke very movingly about some of the critical issues, particularly domestic violence. One in four women is a victim of domestic violence; there is an incident every minute. It costs &#163;23 billion each year in legal costs, social services, medical care, child care, and so on. There is a new plan: 64 special courts will be operational by April. The Home Office is working with 100 multi-agency risk assessment conferences. There are more successful outcomes in the form of guilty pleas; the trend is upward. Nationally, successful outcomes are up from 46 per cent to 65 per cent, and 71 per cent of cases in specialist courts are successful. The incidence of recorded domestic violence is going down. A huge amount of work is going on.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07032280000178"></a>The noble Baroness also talked about data sharing and data protection. This was raised and echoed in other speeches. I am also the Data Protection Minister, so I can talk for a moment about that and would like to make three points. First, a lot of data sharing must be about citizens feeling in control of their own data and taking the opportunity to use data sharing to save time. In many of our systems we assume that citizens&#146; time is free. We often decide, when shopping on the internet, for example, that we want our data to be retained. That is our choice. Secondly, where the Government retain data, transparency is critical. Noble Lords have raised concerns over the question of transparency, which is incredibly important. That is a bigger and longer debate for another day. Thirdly, data sharing should protect the vulnerable. When, after the Victoria Climbi&#233; inquiry, I took through a Bill that had a data-sharing clause&#151;Section 9 of the Children&#146;s Act&#151;one statistic stayed with me. When two professionals dealing with children at risk want to talk to each other, it takes them, on average, two days to find each other. If an address book with shared data showed which professionals were involved with a given family, we could save lives for sure. It is about getting the balance between data sharing and data protection right.</p>

<a name="70322-0010.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07032280000179"></a>I do not have details of how Ministers have been talking to different communities that feel at risk of alienation, but I will get that information.</p>

I believe that there are cases of children being given warning orders by the police. I am not exactly sure what they are, but they go down on record. They expire in time but can be shared with other Governments, especially that of the United States. This can involve visa problems. I may not have got that completely right, but I think I have. Could the Minister look into that as well, please?</p>

I have not heard of that, but will of course look into it and see what the reality is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07032280000182"></a>On ID cards and whether countries have found them useful, there was a very good Channel 4 programme, featuring my right honourable friend Charles Clarke when he went to Estonia. It is very interesting in showing how Estonians have used ID cards as the means of finding out who is looking at their data, and to get information. It is well worth looking at. If noble Lords want a copy of it, I can probably find one somewhere.</p>

<a name="70322-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07032280000183"></a>Noble Lords spent, quite reasonably, some time on the Bill of Rights. It is interesting that no one talked about repealing the Human Rights Act. I suspect that where the Conservative Party and Justice end up in terms of a Bill of Rights may be different. I know that Justice, in launching its consultation and discussion on the matter, said that it sees the purpose of a Bill of Rights as giving greater constitutional protection to fundamental rights, increasing the scope of rights under the Human Rights Act, emphasising the constitutional principle of the rule of law, building public awareness of constitutional rights protection and drawing attention to the rights and duties of citizenship. The noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, mentioned rights and responsibilities in relation to a Bill of Rights. I very much look forward to seeing what happens as Justice continues its work. From my perspective, I am looking at what I call &#147;human rights plus&#148;, not &#147;human rights minus&#148;, and it is important that all the issues that have been raised are dealt with in that context.</p>

<a name="70322-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07032280000184"></a>I agreed with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, on tribunals and standards of service. I am responsible also for tribunals, so I feel strongly about that issue. On the DCA budget, the legal aid budget will not be cut&#151;it will be flat cash, bearing in mind the efficiency savings that we expect to see from the reforms of the noble Lord, Lord Carter. That should keep legal aid on a sustainable and affordable path. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, will know that my noble and learned friend is keen to ensure that civil justice is dealt with properly and appropriately within the legal aid budget. The reform and modernisation that we are seeing across the DCA will generate efficiencies that will make 3.5 per cent savings within the department.</p>

That is the official line; I can obtain more information for him if he wants, but I wanted to put that firmly on the record. It has been agreed by the DCA finance department, so I shall say nothing more at this point. However, we are satisfied that we have good resources to take things forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07032280000187"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, spoke about being a minnow; he is not. He gave a passionate and moving account of Maria. We in your Lordships&#146; House are all proud of our long history and tradition in wanting to provide refuge to those in need. I also think that we want and need a robust and proper system, including trying to tackle properly and appropriately issues regarding those who do not have a right to be here. It does mean rules. One of the great difficulties&#151;which I experienced during the passage of the asylum and immigration legislation last year&#151;is that although we want that, we can all point to exceptional cases. I make no comment on Maria, because I do not know her case; but I can think of many instances where it is very difficult to make such decisions, and I know that one of the ways is to try and sort out such cases as quickly as possible to give people certainty about the outcome&#151;particularly when children are involved, even if that means that people are going back to another country or the country of origin. That should be done properly and appropriately.</p>

We want to stop an inconsistency of approach&#151;bailiff law has grown up all over the place and people find aspects of it incomprehensible. Some bailiffs can go in at certain times of day, some at other times of day. All those rules are now being made consistent and all bailiffs will be regulated, which is even more important, and allowed into people&#146;s homes only with judicial authority and under strict guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07032280000189"></a>Intercept evidence was raised by the noble Earl, who covered a lot of terrain. We are still looking closely at that issue. There is a clear government commitment to that work, but we must recognise and protect our intercept capabilities. We are reviewing the issues and trying to see whether there is a legal model that provides the necessary safeguards that might allow intercept material to be used as evidence. He will be aware of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07032280000190"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Young of Hornsey, talked about the terrible tragedy of slavery and trafficking, and I pay tribute to her work on what will be an important series of events taking place, right across government, to recognise the 200th anniversary of the abolition of slavery.

It has done a tremendous amount of work. It is always a privilege to appear before it. I recognise that the issue of statements of compatibility that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, raised is important and indeed an issue that the joint committee has raised with us. As well as a statement, within the Explanatory Notes we provide the explanation of the main human rights issues that arise within the Bill. I will acknowledge, and the Joint Committee observed, that not all Bills have been accompanied by as good an explanation as there should have been, but I am pleased to say that we have made a particular effort this Session to make sure that we do that.</p>

I am extremely grateful, because I have been racking my brains for the past hour trying to remember what was happening around this issue. The noble Lord has just reminded me what it was, so I thank him. I know that it has been raised elsewhere and I am grateful to him for raising it now. I am going over my time because I have been interrupted, so I think that I am allowed to; anyway, both Front-Benchers went over their time. I have nearly finished.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07032280000199"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester, talked about the backlog at the European Court of Human Rights. There is a meeting today in San Marino at which my officials are discussing that issue. I particularly wanted to pay tribute to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, who has been very involved in trying to help the court to deal with the backlog. On 1 January the backlog stood at 89,000 cases. I understand that a number of cases have been removed from the list, if I can put it like that.</p>

<a name="70322-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07032280000200"></a>The noble Lord has come up with some pragmatic approaches which we are pushing hard to make happen&#151;for example, an application form. Some 12,000 letters were destroyed last year because they did not fit the criteria, and it will be 15,000 this year. An application form might help, as might making sure that when a decision is made it is communicated, so that countries will know what the effects will be; there is clearly a precedent for that. These are pragmatic and practical ways in which the group of wise persons who produced the report last November, of which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, is a member, has been able to try and deal with some of the questions.</p>

<a name="70322-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="07032280000201"></a>We are also hoping that the Russians will ratify Protocol 14, which they signed in May last year. That will enable the filtering to be done by one judge as opposed to several, which enables the court&#146;s work to speed up dramatically.</p>

<a name="70322-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07032280000202"></a>Finally, I will address the matter of the individual petitions to the UN; the noble Lord, Lord Lester, raised it. We are looking at that. As he has said, the optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women enables individual claims to go to the UN. One has been rejected and there is a second one. I am not going to get information about what has happened to that until the autumn, so reviewing whether that works or not is going to take me longer. I can say to the noble Lord that it is my responsibility and I will make sure that we deal with it.</p>

I am very sorry that I taxed their patience. We have now had a three-hour debate and no one has had lunch; indeed, I have not had anything since a bowl of porridge at breakfast.

Secondly, I should like to thank everyone for taking part in a very well informed, very wide-ranging, sometimes provocative and fascinating debate, which will not be reported in the newspapers at all.

I wonder whether the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford meant exactly what he said when he seemed to imply that there was no moral justification for interfering with cannibalism or human sacrifice.

<ul>

In strengthening and clarifying the rights of disabled people to independent living, the Bill will have a direct and hugely positive impact on the one in four families in the United Kingdom that include disabled members, and more particularly on the 175,000 children and young people who are relied on by disabled family members for care that would normally be expected of trained adults.</p>

The main reason why children and young people find themselves taking on these support responsibilities is that their disabled parents do not get the assessments and help from local authorities to which they are entitled.</p>

<a name="70322-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07032280000218"></a>Amendment No. 1 establishes the principle that, in exercising their duties under the Bill, the responsible bodies&#151;local authorities, health services and their partners&#151;should ensure that independent living support is delivered in such a way that no disabled person has to rely on care or support provided by a child or young person, such as may impair the child or young person&#146;s educational opportunities, health or well-being.</p>

<a name="70322-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07032280000219"></a>Amendment No. 2 amends the definition of &#147;accessible information&#148; given in the Bill so that it is clear that it includes information that is suitable for children&#151;whether disabled children or children with disabled siblings or parents. Young carers will, of course, have rights to information and advice under Clause 12 of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70322-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07032280000220"></a>Amendment No. 11 tackles the need for improved joint working and more effective co-ordination between children and adults services to support families affected by disability. It is inspired by the work of the Princess Royal Trust for Carers, the Disabled Parents Network and the Children&#146;s Society in developing an exemplar protocol for children and adults services. A few local authorities already have a protocol that sets out the roles of children and adults services in ensuring that families affected by disability receive appropriate support rather than having to rely on the inappropriate caring role of a child. The amendment specifies that measures towards this must be included in the local independent living strategies. This complements other measures in the Bill that support families.</p>

<a name="70322-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07032280000221"></a>Amendment No. 12 specifies that registers of disabled persons should include the details of any carers whom a person may have to enable better forward planning and to facilitate identification of carers who may have support needs.</p>

<a name="70322-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07032280000222"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, will be able to accept the amendments in the group and thus enhance the delivery of support to families and friends affected by disability. I beg to move.</p>

I have, as noble Lords know, been privileged to speak for the Government on two previous occasions in responding to the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Ashley&#151;a wonderful and extraordinary campaigner, who has done so much to improve the lives of people with disabilities. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to two noble Lords who are not in their places today; I am sure that they would wish to be here but they cannot be because of ill health&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and my noble friend Lady Wilkins.

The Princess Royal Trust for Carers does a fantastic job. We thank it, especially for its work with children and young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07032280000225"></a>As noble Lords may be aware, my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the New Deal for Carers on 21 February. A key component of that new deal will be a review of the Government's strategy on carers. This is a pan-government strategy and I will ensure that the point at issue about the well-being of children who care for sick or disabled people is drawn to the attention of those charged with the review of the strategy.</p>

I am glad to say that I accept the amendments in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth. One of the greatest scandals of our social care system is that children can be robbed of their childhood by the failure of statutory services to provide the necessary services.

I think that the Office for Disability Issues has another independent living review. Perhaps she could update us on that. I thank her very much for the letter that I received today on the issue that I raised on Second Reading: how the age equality regulations will impact on specialist agencies employing carers for severely disabled people, which is a very demanding job for people above a certain age. I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the fact that the Minister has today placed a copy of the letter in the Library and I thank her for the very sympathetic way in which she has handled the issue. I am delighted that the amendments will be accepted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="07032280000236"></a>Amendments Nos. 3, 32 and 33 and 38 take account of the Government of Wales Act 2006, following which regulations and orders should be made by Welsh Ministers rather than the National Assembly. We wrote in the National Assembly for Wales early on, not realising the changes that had taken place. The amendments will fix that.</p>

<a name="70322-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="07032280000237"></a>Amendments Nos. 13, 20, 21 and 25 address a concern of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee that there are clauses in the Bill which do not specify who is to make the regulations. The committee recommended that it should not be left to implication that these powers, too, should be exercisable by the Secretary of State or the Welsh Ministers. Hence, the amendments make it clear that the appropriate authority is responsible.</p>

<a name="70322-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="07032280000238"></a>Amendments Nos. 8 to 10, 17, 22, 24, 26 and 27 and 31 and 34&#151;I did say that this would be technical and boring&#151;leave out those subsections which enable the appropriate authorities to &#147;make further provision&#148; in connection with the relevant section. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee recommended that the regulations should not be included in the Bill, as it is not clear what such broad delegations might be used for, and I would be happy for them to be removed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="07032280000239"></a>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5, and 35 to 37 relate to parliamentary procedure on the use of delegated powers. All the powers conferred on the Secretary of State by the Bill, except the power in Clause 24(2), would be made subject to the affirmative procedure by Clause 36(2), including commencement orders and the orders applying the Bill, with modifications, to the Isles of Scilly. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee commented that the only power in the Bill that seems to warrant the affirmative procedure is that in Clause 3 to extend the definition of &#147;disabled person&#148;. The amendments therefore act on that recommendation. If the amendments were accepted, regulations and orders made under the Act would be subject to the negative procedure rather than the affirmative procedure of both Houses of Parliament, or of the National Assembly for Wales, as appropriate. The exception would be the definition of &#147;disabled person&#148;. The amendments specify that only the Secretary of State, not Welsh Ministers, could extend the definition of a disabled person.</p>

I shall say simply that, in the context of the Bill, my noble friend&#146;s amendments appear to be very sensible and reflect exactly what the noble Baroness and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee said. As noble Lords are aware, the Government have set out a 20-year strategy to improve provision and services for disabled people. I explained at Second Reading the many initiatives that we already have in place and in the pipeline. I believe that the Government can be proud of what has been achieved to date. We recognise that much more is still to be achieved, but we believe that huge strides have already been made and that the right foundations are in place to ensure continued progress.</p>

<a name="70322-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="07032280000244"></a>The Government do not believe that we have a monopoly of wisdom on what is needed for continued improvement. We will continue to listen to, and to learn from, all those with an interest and knowledge in this field. However, the Government remain unconvinced of the need for legislation of this nature and at this time. I assure the Committee that the Government share wholeheartedly the commitment of the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, to the principles underlying the Bill. However, there are undoubtedly some aspects of the Bill with which we would disagree or which we believe are already achieved through existing provisions. There would also be major cost implications in implementing all that is proposed here, especially at the pace implied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="07032280000245"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, asked earlier about the independent living review, which I announced last year. It will report this summer. This 12-month project, led by Jenny Morris with the help of an expert panel chaired by Dame Jane Campbell, is considering whether any changes to legislation are needed to support independent living. Here I should like to congratulate Dame Jane Campbell on being nominated as a People&#146;s Peer. We look forward very much to welcoming her and benefiting from her great expertise in this House. The panel is developing a five-year strategy to deliver independent living for disabled people. However, it is not possible at this stage to make any statements about the final recommendations of the project.</p>

<a name="70322-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="07032280000246"></a>All of this demonstrates our shared commitment with my noble friend Lord Ashley, but we do not believe it is necessary to deliver our common goals by means of imposing legislation, at least until we have the results of the important review of independent living. I am grateful to my noble friend for again giving us the opportunity to discuss these extremely important issues.</p>

I believe that we should get on with things now rather than wait. We have had many investigations, inquiries and reports and we could go on like that without ever reaching a determined end. I am confident that my noble friend has the welfare of disabled people very much at heart and that she will do all she can. None the less, my fear is that, with the Government adopting this position, things will just drag on while the need for strong legislation is urgent. However, I accept what she has said.</p>

Making sure that you actually get the right advice and that it is delivered in a way that can be understood is crucial to anyone who wants to conduct their life in their own way. Knowing what is out there and engaging in an interchange of ideas is vital. I suggest that Amendment No. 6 would strengthen the core aim of the Bill.</p>

We were told that, however much the Government approved of what was proposed, that Bill was not the place to legislate. The then Minister went on to say that she did not feel the amendments proposed were necessary anyway because the subject was covered by a local authority circular, by which means the Government encourage local authorities to maintain lists of suitable accessible properties for disabled people.</p>

<a name="70322-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="07032280000269"></a>I shall quote from the only paragraph in that circular, which is called<I> Revision of the Code of Guidance on the allocation of accommodation</I>, and was published in 2002:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="07032280000452"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State recommends housing authorities to maintain lists of properties which are suitable for disabled people and other special needs groups. These lists could be made available to relevant applicants as part of the general information supplied to applicants under section 166&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032280000428"></a>of the Housing Act&#151;I think of 1992, but I would not swear to it. Anyway, the circular explains what ought to happen under that Act. It goes on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="07032280000453"></a>&#147;Such lists might include all accessible or significantly adapted local authority stock&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032280000429"></a>registered social landlord properties&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07032280000498"></a>&#147;and private sector properties to which authorities nominate tenants&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032280000430"></a>So far as I know, that circular has never been updated. It is pretty darned weak.</p>

<a name="70322-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="07032280000270"></a>We on this side of the Committee agree with the Government that, to quote <I>1066 and All That</I>, accessible housing registers are &#147;A Good Thing&#148;. The question that this Bill allows me to ask is: how successful has that paragraph in that circular been in persuading local authorities of the benefit of such registers? How many local authorities have set one up? Do the Government agree that these registers save money? The housing department in Bradford believes that its register saves &#163;1 million a year. This does not mean that less money is invested; it spends far more on adaptations than previously. The two things do not necessarily go together, but the department&#146;s savings come from void/rent losses, and officer and customer time savings.</p>

<a name="70322-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07032280000271"></a>The Bill is all about making life easier for disabled people, enabling them to live as normal a life as their disabilities will allow them. Yet again, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, on persevering with it. I am sure that all noble Lords would agree with me that life for disabled people would be made a lot easier if they did not have to trudge around looking at properties which were unsuitable for their needs, before alighting on one that would fit in with the easier life that we all want them to lead. I beg to move.</p>

It is still a good idea; it still offers tremendous savings. If this is not the right way of bringing it into this Bill, I would be interested in seeing one that is.</p>

<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="07032280000273"></a><b><a name="70322-0012.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07032280000567"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, both for giving me advance notice of his amendment and for explaining why he has suggested this addition to the Bill. I well understand his interest, and that of the noble Lord, Lord Addington, in the availability of accessible accommodation to meet the needs of disabled people, which is very important. I made inquiries of the DCLG, which confirmed that it does not hold a central record of the number of local authorities that maintain an accessible housing register. Therefore, I regret that I cannot answer his question in terms how many local authorities have such a register.</p>

<a name="70322-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="07032280000274"></a>It was commented that such registers can save money, as the example in Bradford which the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, cited shows. They would therefore seem to be an excellent idea for that reason as well as for all the reasons that he suggested. The Government are still very much in favour of the voluntary approach, as outlined by my noble friend Lady Hollis in the debate to which the noble Lord referred. However, as the circular clearly has not been updated&#151;perhaps it was not even properly circulated&#151;the DCLG should perhaps give attention to it. I will certainly discuss with my noble friend Lady Andrews whether the circulars could at least be updated and some measure taken to ensure that all local authorities were aware of their duty to make them widely available.</p>

I was therefore well aware of it. I cannot understand why the previous Administration resisted such a sensible suggestion. I strongly support the amendment.</p>

I am also grateful to the Minister for doing her best at very short notice to answer my question. However, it is not satisfactory to have a paragraph in a circular such as this from the DCLG. There is no record of what, if anything, it has produced. The Government do not want to legislate in this area and are in favour of continuing the voluntary approach. If the voluntary approach is not working, it is the Government&#146;s duty to fix it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="07032280000302"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 14 and Amendment No. 23, which is grouped alongside it, are about the periodical review of assessments. If an assessment is taken under this Bill and found to give the right support, it should in most cases be reviewed periodically. This will depend on the nature of the person; the condition or disability they have; whether they are improving or deteriorating in terms of physical or mental health, et cetera. Unless we get the review in here, what was appropriate X amount of time ago may still be applied now when it is no longer appropriate and we may end up quite simply wasting money and effort. On Amendment No. 23, the period after a stay in hospital, for instance, might be thought to be the appropriate time to call for a review of any package. I would suggest that the amendments are a sensible way of making sure that if help is given, it is updated and made to be consistently appropriate. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_420"></a><a name="07032280000377"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 1 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="07032280000378"></a><b><a name="70322-0013.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="07032280000595"></a>Lord Redesdale:</b> In speaking to this Motion, I wish to speak also to the Motions that Clauses 2, 3, and 5 stand part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70322-0013.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="07032280000379"></a>My purpose is very simple&#151;to remove four of the clauses from the Bill. I always find this stage of a Private Member&#146;s Bill slightly maudlin. I feel rather like a condemned man having his last cigarette before going to the Commons to be shot. However, the process of a Private Member&#146;s Bill has been particularly successful in this case.</p>

<a name="70322-0013.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="07032280000380"></a>I seek to remove Clauses 1 and 2 because the Government have already dealt with those provisions in other legislation, for which I thank them. The work done on EPCs as part of HIPs was incredibly important. HIPs are unpopular but recent discussions with the installation industry, the boiler manufacturing industry and those dealing with all forms of energy efficiency revealed that they considered EPCs a massive boon in bringing to the attention of home owners the importance of improving the energy efficiency of their homes. Millions of tonnes of carbon could be saved by the Government&#146;s action. I have one question for the Minister. I know that it is usually the role of those proposing a Bill to answer all questions but she may be able to satisfy me on this point.</p>

<a name="70322-0013.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="07032280000381"></a>The EPCs also set out to deal with residential and commercial property. When will those regulations come forward? There is a proposed meeting of the All-Party Group on Climate Change headed &#147;Can EPCs save the planet?&#148;. It would be great to find out if those regulations have come forward. Particularly heartening is that I was contacted by the Landlords&#146; Association, which is very keen on the issuing of EPCs for rental property.</p>

<a name="70322-0013.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a><a name="07032280000382"></a>Clauses 3 and 5 are also to be removed, though Clause 5 on mortgages was dealt with in the Budget yesterday. I am interested in how the Chancellor is going to change mortgages, because the Council of Mortgage Lenders was particularly opposed to this. When we talked about changing mortgages, it went back to the 1925 Act. If it were to change, we would have to change most of the mortgages issued in the last few years quite substantially. I believe there is some difficulty in that.</p>

I reiterate my thanks to the noble Lord for bringing this important topic to us in this way.</p>

<a name="70322-0013.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a><a name="07032280000384"></a>I suspect that on all sides of the House we recognise that energy efficiency and microgeneration represent important elements in any strategy to deal with providing a balanced environment, in the battle against climate change and in creating a greener world. By focusing on the planning issues contained in Clause 4, the noble Lord challenges the Government to respond to the Bill&#146;s provision for review by the Secretary of State of the planning issues presented by microgeneration.</p>

<a name="70322-0013.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a><a name="07032280000385"></a>Noble Lords will recognise that other elements of the broader debate embodied in the deleted clauses will not have gone away. We hope that the Minister can assure us that the Government acknowledge them and will give serious consideration to the Bill in its amended form.</p>

<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="07032280000386"></a><b><a name="70322-0013.htm_spnew20"></a><a name="07032280000597"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, feels like a condemned man in the Committee stage of his important Bill. In thinking about what to say today, I looked at the Second Reading speech of my noble friend the Minister. I was delighted to sit next to her during that debate and was surprised to see so many mentions of kitchens and by the number of noble Lords who signed up to living in windy parts of the country. I notice that those elements of the debate are not necessarily to be continued in what will be a quick and efficient Committee.</p>

<a name="70322-0013.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="07032280000387"></a>I re-emphasise the comments of my noble friend at Second Reading about the importance of what she called, &#147;a heroic debate&#148;. She also commented that the Government were extremely sympathetic towards the intentions of the noble Lord in bringing this Bill forward. I thank him for providing us with the opportunity to discuss these important issues again.</p>

<a name="70322-0013.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a><a name="07032280000388"></a>As my noble friend Lady Andrews said at Second Reading, the Government welcome the intention of the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, to withdraw the four clauses. Clauses 1 and 2, on the promotion of energy efficiency ratings through the home information packs and estate agents&#146; property details, are, as we have already discussed, unnecessary because regulations are being laid before Parliament later this month which will implement these policies. The third provision required substantive changes to the current council tax and business rates regime, which we shall not consider before we have had time to properly examine the final findings of Sir Michael Lyons&#146;s independent inquiry.</p>

<a name="70322-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="07032280000389"></a>The Government also support the withdrawal of requirements on lenders to offer products supporting the take-up of energy efficiency and microgeneration measures. The noble Lord raised the timetable for the implementation of the EPCs for rented and commercial properties. I understand that he has an APPG meeting coming up; I do not know the date of that meeting. I reassure him that the timetable for the regulations will be announced very shortly.</p>

<a name="07032280000395"></a><b><a name="70322-0014.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07032280000599"></a>Lord Redesdale</b> moved Amendment No. 1:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a><a name="07032280000489"></a> Clause 6, page 4, line 2, leave out &#147;Energy Efficiency and Microgeneration&#148; and insert &#147;Development Orders (Microgeneration)&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70322-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a><a name="07032280000396"></a>The noble Lord said: I will take a very short time over this. The purpose is to allow small microgeneration through wind turbines, dealt with in Clause 4, to become permitted development on agricultural land. I realise that there is a White Paper on planning, which is an opportunity that should not be missed by the Commons to take this up and debate this problem area in the planning process. The Climate Change Bill followed a previous Private Member&#146;s Bill, the Renewable Energy Bill, that was introduced in this House two or three years ago. It put forward ideas about small microgeneration on buildings.</p>

<a name="70322-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a><a name="07032280000397"></a>The problem with that is that it extends only to the curtilage of the building. Small microgeneration up to 50 kilowatts, which would be able to generate enough to run a house, can be put on the building but not in a field next to the building. This issue is causing some concern. As the planning process drags on interminably, it is almost impossible to get planning permission for what we believe should be a permitted development. I hope that the Government will bring forward some constructive proposals in their White Paper to cut down on planning time. The only purpose of the amendments is to take the Bill forward. I hope that those in another place might see the absolute merits and pass them into law. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="07032280000398"></a><b><a name="70322-0014.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07032280000600"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I hope I can encourage the noble Lord to feel optimistic about the concepts surrounding the debate going forward. As my noble friend Lady Andrews said last month, the Government are very much at one with the noble Lord over the importance of the climate change agenda and the promotion of microgeneration technologies. However, my noble friend also made clear that there is no need for primary legislation, as current government policy already deals with the actions that the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, seeks to support.</p>

<a name="70322-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a><a name="07032280000399"></a>The amendments would leave us with one substantive clause, the current Clause 4. As indicated by the proposed new Title, the resulting Bill will require the Government to conduct a review and report on the effect of planning requirements on the installation of energy efficiency measures and microgeneration equipment on, importantly, agricultural land. However, we feel that the clause is unnecessary. We have already strengthened planning policies over the past year. We have issued a ministerial Statement that built on the existing policy in the planning policy statement on renewable energy&#151;PPS 22&#151;issued in 2004, and we launched a public consultation on a new draft planning policy statement on climate change.</p>

<a name="70322-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a><a name="07032280000400"></a>The latter expects planning authorities to make the most of existing and planned opportunities for decentralised, renewable and low-carbon energy supplies to supply both proposed and existing development. Local planning authorities should expect substantial new development to gain a significant proportion of its energy supply on-site and renewably, and/or from a decentralised, renewable or low-carbon energy source.</p>

<a name="70322-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a><a name="07032280000401"></a>We have also carried out a review of permitted development rights for the installation of microgeneration equipment by householders, as I am sure the noble Lord is well aware. In addition, we want to consider including agriculture in our response to the Baker proposal that permitted development rights for microgeneration should be further extended to uses besides domestic uses. The Government do not support the amendments to Clause 6 and to the Title.</p>

<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="07032280000402"></a><b><a name="70322-0014.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07032280000601"></a>Lord Redesdale:</b> I did not think the noble Baroness would have a change of heart on that point. I am heartened by her statements. It is important that the Government note that although PPS 22, in my view, strengthens the case for microgeneration, at a recent planning appeal on the erection of a wind turbine, PPS 22 was used by those objecting to the planning appeal as well as those trying to support it. So the wording for making a case for moving forward with microgeneration, rather than preserving the landscape, needs to be strengthened substantially. On that basis, I very much hope that there will be an opportunity for many in the other place to see the merits of this argument and crusade forward with it. Even if the Bill does not get much further, the debates will feed into a growing change within government and outside on the need to increase the stock of microgeneration, which can only be for the good.</p>

</ul>
<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000010"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 2 and 3. I suppose that you could call this group of amendments the Whitehaven amendments. Their purpose is to ensure that those living in Whitehaven&#151;the area that will begin the digital switchover process&#151;are entitled to the help scheme in the same way as the rest of the country. This is a probing amendment that ensures that information about social security entitlements, war pensions and visual impairment is disclosed at the very least before 17 October 2007, which is the date on which switchover will begin in Whitehaven. That date was announced on Thursday, 15 March 2007. Should the Bill receive a speedy passage through Parliament, it should be possible to disclose all the information necessary for people to be entitled to the digital help scheme in Whitehaven before that date.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000011"></a>My colleagues in the other place&#151;in particular, my honourable friend Paul Holmes&#151;raised this issue. They were concerned that there was a danger that people in Whitehaven would lose as the criteria for help had not been made clear, because the Bill is yet to be passed. There is also the danger that people who move to Whitehaven after switchover may not receive any help.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000012"></a>I seek the Minister&#146;s assurance that in that area help will reach all the elderly, disabled or low income households that need it, when they need it. We still do not have many details about how much the Whitehaven switchover will cost; there are still some imponderables there. Perhaps the Minister could give the necessary assurances about the beginning of the switchover process. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000013"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07032291000374"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I assure the noble Lord and the Committee that Whitehaven is the crucial location and that the date in the legislation, which we hope will receive Royal Assent, is determined by the fact that we want to meet exactly the points that he identified. It is important that we have everything in place for the switchover date for Whitehaven and Copeland, and we intend to do that.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000321"></a> Clause 1 , page 1, line 13, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000322"></a>&#147;( ) The Secretary of State shall publish and lay before Parliament a list of relevant persons.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000323"></a>( ) The Secretary of State shall re-issue the list biennially.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000018"></a>The noble Viscount said: This amendment, which relates to Clause 1(4) , is about the phrase &#147;relevant person&#148;&#151;or perhaps we should say &#147;relevant people&#148;, since the provisions are in the plural. The reason for the amendment&#151;it is largely a probing amendment&#151;is that subsection (4) is very widely drawn. A &#147;relevant person&#148; can be &#147;the BBC&#148;&#151;or anyone in it&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07032291000356"></a>&#147;the Secretary of State, or ... a nominee&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07032291000313"></a>which means a company that the Secretary of State or the BBC controls. Clause 1 (4)(c) refers to &#147;any person&#148; engaged by them, which covers a wide range of people&#151;it could cover almost anybody. Our concern is that the &#147;relevant person&#148; will have access to all sorts of confidential information, such as someone&#146;s social security status, whether they are employed or unemployed, are in receipt of benefits or receive a war pension. The &#147;relevant person&#148; will know far more about people and their circumstances than would usually be the case because the information will cross over to a number of government departments.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000019"></a>The Government should keep a record of the relevant person who has access to this information. The more people who have access, the more chance of the whole system leaking. Unless we know who they are and how they are operating, the wrong kind of people will have access to the information. There is real scope for information to leak out, which could be extremely detrimental to those involved. I realise that later in the Bill there are various safeguards about information, but those safeguards are somewhat irrelevant if virtually anybody nominated by the BBC or, in effect, anybody nominated by a company where the BBC might control 51 per cent, but does not control day-to-day operations, can come into the scope of that information.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000020"></a>I am concerned because it will open the door to information about people&#146;s circumstances that is normally kept in the hands of one department. It will be pooled by a number of departments and will be open to possible misuse. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000021"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07032291000377"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> I support the amendment tabled by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor. Many of the amendments tabled are about trying to be more specific about aspects of the help scheme. That is why we have tabled an attempt at a sunrise clause. There is a paucity of information, which is one of the problems with a Bill that is essentially a framework, with the rest being filled in by regulation. That will no doubt give the Government greater flexibility, but there are dangers, as the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, said. The Government should carefully consider whether to fill in more details before reaching the appointed day.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000022"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07032291000378"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> We would certainly be only too happy to fill in additional details if we thought them necessary. We think that the amendment is defective in a number of ways, but I do not want to discuss the details because the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, would only put that right on Report. I want to give him the assurances that he seeks, which I hope will render the amendment unnecessary.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000023"></a>We envisage that the BBC will not need access to data disclosed in this Bill. We envisage that a single main scheme contractor will be appointed, with responsibility to safeguard these details. That might change, of course, if one of the operator&#146;s partners were to lead in managing the contact centre operations and fulfilment process, or if the operator was acquired in a takeover, merger or de-merger.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000024"></a>The details would need to be safeguarded but within the framework of a single main scheme contractor, to which no one in the BBC would be privy. It would be neither its responsibility nor its need as it would have contracted-out this operation. The BBC will come into the picture if the arrangements of the scheme or operator need to be terminated.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000025"></a>The OJEU notice issued at the end of January sets out the preference for a single end-to-end operator who will have sole responsibility for the data. Therefore, in asking for a list, the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, is asking for a very short list indeed&#151;the single operator.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000026"></a>The Bill permits only someone engaged by the BBC or a company where the BBC or a nominee or the Secretary of State or a nominee has at least a 51 per cent shareholding to be regarded as the relevant person. As we think there will be one scheme, by definition the number of relevant persons will be very limited. The scheme operator is not yet known, but there must be a direct relationship between the BBC, the Secretary of State or both with the scheme operator. The relevant person cannot be a sub-contractor, but must be the direct operator. If we had made the appointment, I would be able to tell the noble Viscount who that person will be, but individuals are not specified in legislation, only their function. The noble Viscount is anxious about what we all recognise as important confidential information, and we are seeking to ensure that it is the responsibility of a very limited number of persons.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000027"></a> I am grateful to the Minister for his response, but it raises as many questions as it answers. If I heard him correctly, he said that the BBC will not hold the information directly. Following the logic of that argument, one could delete Clause 1(4)(a) because there will be a company in which the BBC or the Secretary of State or their nominee holds at least 51 per cent.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000028"></a>Clause 1(4)(c) states,</p>
<ul><a name="07032291000357"></a>&#147;any person who is engaged by the BBC&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032291000314"></a>Does that mean any relevant person or does it mean any other person? It is not clear who is being referred to because one company will undertake this process.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000029"></a> The BBC is mentioned in case the scheme needs to be terminated. We have to have provision for action on its part but, providing that the scheme operates successfully, we do not envisage the information being made available to the BBC because it is not germane to the purposes of the scheme. The reason why we have to have a provision for the BBC potentially to have access to the information is in case things go wrong and the single operator has its contract terminated or is subject to a takeover or there are changes in the arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000030"></a> If the BBC or the Secretary of State holds at least 51 per cent of the ordinary share capital and has voting rights in the company, it is rather difficult for it to be taken over.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000031"></a> We are talking about the position of the scheme contractor. When the phrase &#147;any person&#148; is used in legislation, it does not mean any inhabitant of the United Kingdom; it means a person who is, by definition, the relevant person in terms of the legislation. The noble Viscount is being literal when I am asking him to be parliamentary when he looks at the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000032"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07032291000383"></a>Viscount Astor:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s response. It seems to me that this clause is not drafted quite as precisely as it should be, and I should definitely like to come back at the next stage and improve it. As the Minister is far more expert than I am when it comes to drafting, perhaps he will consider inserting the word &#147;relevant&#148; in paragraph (c), so that it reads &#147;any relevant person&#148; as opposed to &#147;any person&#148;, as that might satisfy some of our concerns. I suggest that the drafting could be better.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000033"></a>I will read with care what the Minister said about the contractor. I was not terribly convinced by it but I am sure that, when I come to study it, it will be more illuminating. No doubt before we get to the next stage, the Minister will, with his usual courtesy, make himself available to explain anything that I have not understood. However, I am grateful for his response and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000036"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment, which seeks to establish what plans Her Majesty&#146;s Government have for ensuring that eligible people living in multiple dwellings are not left behind in the digital switchover due to inadequate rooftop aerials and other associated problems. I declare an interest as chairman of the trustees of the Hospital of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Castle Rising, which is a multiple dwelling.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000037"></a>Provision for multiple dwellings has been entirely ignored in the Bill, yet about 20 per cent of the population, or around 6 million households, are in multiple-occupancy dwellings. The majority of these households are managed by a private landlord, managing agent or social housing provider and will not be covered by local councils.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000038"></a>At an all-party meeting a few weeks ago, the Minister in another place acknowledged that multiple dwellings will prove a difficult hurdle to overcome. I should be grateful if the Minister could inform noble Lords what action will be taken to encourage housing providers in the private sector to undertake the necessary work to communal aerials and related issues to ensure that their tenants are able to switch to digital television. Can the Minister possibly take that further and commit to ensuring that those living in multiple dwellings who are entitled to help under the scheme will be provided with adequate help? The amendment is purely probing. I have tabled it to give the Minister the opportunity to place on the record the Government&#146;s plans, if any such plans exist, to lessen that difficulty as far as possible. I beg to move. </p>

Indeed, Digital UK is using data gleaned from the British Market Research Bureau study to build up a nationwide picture of progress by social sector landlords and larger private sector landlords.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000040"></a>The Bill deals with the disclosure of personal information about individuals. Following amendments made in another place, it now covers powers for local authorities to disclose personal information about blind and partially sighted people.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000041"></a>The amendment would cover information that local authorities keep about all dwellings&#151;and could probably, in most cases, disclose without restriction&#151;subject to issues of cost. Indeed, the research carried out by the DCMS collected this information from local authorities and registered social landlords.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000042"></a>For that reason, I hope that the noble Lord will agree that the amendment is not necessary. However, the points about access to information on the status of communal TV system upgrading are well made and will be not only carefully considered but acted on.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000043"></a>We can certainly give the noble Lord assurances that the scheme operator working with Digital UK will seek out this information, where available, to help to ensure that the risk of beneficiaries living in flats and other multi-dwelling units being inconvenienced is minimised as far as possible.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000044"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07032291000386"></a>The Lord Bishop of Manchester:</b> If I may interrupt at this point, I and several other noble Lords touched on this at Second Reading. I simply seek clarification about the difference between public housing, with its communal aerial systems, and social housing, where the costs may fall on people in a way that they would not in public housing. I may not have picked up properly what was said.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000045"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07032291000387"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> We are encouraging landlords to work in partnership with residents and be sensitive to their needs and concerns and go ahead and make the necessary changes in good time for switchover in the regions where they operate. There are a range of legal protections against excessive increases in service charges&#151;for example, Section 19 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, which provides that landlords can take into account only relevant costs in determining the amount of service charge to the extent that they reasonably occur. The important assurance that the right reverend Prelate wants is that people who are socially deprived will not in any way be penalised by this Bill, and we can give that assurance.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000046"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07032291000388"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> I thank the Minister. We should remember that in certain multiple occupations, some will be entitled to help and others will not. There should be some method for landlords to make application, or tenants who are not entitled to help may bear a disproportionate amount of the cost, which may cause resentment and problems within those multiple dwellings. It could be most severe in the case of small places, where there are a lot of old people. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000047"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000048"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07032291000389"></a>Lord Clement-Jones</b> moved Amendment No. 6:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000326"></a> Clause 1 , page 1, line 15, leave out paragraph (a)</p>
</ul>
<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000049"></a>The noble Lord said: The reasons I am keen to move this amendment is that we on these Benches feel rather strongly about this issue. These amendments, which refer to the deletion of the BBC in Clause 1, started life as Liberal Democrat amendments in the other place. I want some rationale from the Government that goes further than we got on Second Reading&#151;at which I was unfortunately not able to be present&#151;about why the Government believe that licence-fee payers should have to pay for digital switchover.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000050"></a>The Minister was clearly on the record at Second Reading as saying that the costs to the BBC&#151;to licence-fee payers&#151;were clearly capped at &#163;600 million, so I suppose we should be grateful for small mercies. But the rationale as to why the licence-fee payer should even pay that &#163;600 million and not the taxpayer eludes me and many of my colleagues. Indeed, I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, was particularly eloquent on the subject. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000327"></a>&#147;This proposition was examined first by the BBC Select Committee of this House. It was then examined by the culture department Select Committee of the other House ...we were totally united: we walked arm-in-arm on this issue&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/2/07; col. 1520.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032291000051"></a>The absolute consensus is completely against having the licence fee payer do this.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000052"></a>It may well be that the poor old DCMS has been heavied by the Treasury, as ever&#151;I suspect that that is the case. As the Minister has made clear&#151;and that is why his answers to the amendment tabled by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, were so revealing&#151;the BBC is frankly quite unnecessary in this Bill except for the purpose of paying the bill. That is all it is. Everything else can be done by the contractor, which will do the necessary. All that the BBC is there for is to pay the money over to the contractor&#151;the &#163;600 million or more.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000053"></a>We have not seen any form of justification for having the BBC being involved as it is, and I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s rationale as to why the BBC was ever brought into this in the first place. There is no satisfactory precedent for this, although I suspect that the Minister will start talking about colour television, but that is not on all fours at all with this major switchover, which should be borne out of general taxation. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000054"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0001.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07032291000390"></a>Viscount Astor:</b> My Amendment No. 10 is grouped with the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, although it is on a slightly different issue; but I agree with much of what the noble Lord has said.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000055"></a>My amendment is a probing amendment about the company to be set up either by the BBC or the Secretary of State and the idea that it would hold 51 per cent of the shares. Could the Minister be a bit more revealing? Under an earlier amendment, he mentioned the fact that they hoped to have one company rather than a multitude of them, and he intimated that some progress had been made. Can he tell us a little more about that? Will the company be funded by either the BBC or the Secretary of State? Will it be funded by the 49 per cent shareholder or do the Government still think that it will be 51 per cent? The clause says &#147;at least 51 per cent&#148;. What progress have the Government made? According to the Minister&#146;s earlier answers, this company will be entirely responsible for the whole thing, so we need to know the Government&#146;s thinking on how it will operate and whether they have made any progress in identifying who it will be. I refer the Minister back to a question that I posed earlier when he said that the BBC was necessary in case the company got taken over. The one issue that he did not address is that it is difficult for a company to be taken over if the Government or the BBC own 51 per cent of the shares.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000056"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0001.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07032291000391"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords who have contributed to this interesting group of amendments, although they raise a cardinal point that we seem to have discussed on the Floor of the House on a number of occasions, not least at Second Reading. I recall that when we discussed the whole issue of licence arrangements, we went fully into the question of who should be responsible for switchover. It is a division of principle between us, and I am not sure that at this stage I am in a position to identify fresh arguments on this.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000057"></a>It is clear that digital switchover, as all noble Lords recognise, is a much more significant task than any previous transitions, such as going from black and white to colour. All equipment that is not adapted for digital services will become obsolete at the point of switchover, which has never been the case before, when signals have continued to be received by households even if they have not converted to any new technology.</p>
<h5><a name="07032291000361"></a>2.30 pm</h5>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000058"></a>Our strategy since 2001 has been based on a managed migration led by the broadcasters&#151;I emphasise, led by the broadcasters&#151;and co-ordinated by Digital UK. It has been significantly effective and successful. Through increased information, awareness and advice, and people&#146;s rapid recognition of the huge advantages of new technology, 75 per cent of viewers have already switched to digital, which is impressive progress. However, we want to make sure that the most vulnerable are not left behind, which is a perfectly proper objective which I am sure is shared by all Members of the Committee. The help scheme will give support to some of the most vulnerable citizens in our community and will help in an area which is technical and confusing for many of us, but more likely to be for those who are targeted by the scheme.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000059"></a>The need for the help scheme stems from the change in broadcasting technology. I have heard Members of the Committee advocate why the BBC should not be involved in that, but they cannot deny that the reason for the shift is not to do with any policy of government, least of all to do with benefits or support. It is because broadcasting technology has changed. Without digital switchover, there would be no need for a help scheme, which, therefore, is entirely different from other social policy objectives. It is related to this technological development.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000060"></a>The operation of the help scheme is linked to the complex regional roll-out of switchover and timings when different transmitters will make the switch, which also will be conditioned by broadcasters. The help scheme will, therefore, be most effective if it is fully integrated with the wider programme of work, which is best done by linking it with the wider responsibilities of the BBC for building digital Britain set out in the new BBC charter and agreement.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000061"></a>It was first proposed that the BBC should be responsible for helping to establish and fund the scheme in the March 2005 Green Paper. As I have indicated to Members of the Committee, we have been around this course a few times. The White Paper in 2006 confirmed this. The requirements are set out in the new BBC charter and agreement which came into force on 1 January 1007</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000062"></a>I hear the criticism that has been voiced on every occasion the issue has cropped up, and I understand the argument, which again has been well articulated and established today by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones; namely, that this is a social assistance programme and its costs should be met by others, presumably through general taxation rather than the BBC licence payer. We take a different view; namely, that the costs are part of a broadcasting transition and it is appropriate therefore for the BBC to help to establish and fund the scheme.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000063"></a>We need to turn to practicalities and the efficient and effective delivery of the help scheme rather than go back to all those debates, interesting as they were, on the BBC charter. This Bill directs itself to the practicalities. The operation of the help scheme will be more efficient and effective if the scheme operator has access to social security information and other relevant information under the Bill. The Committee will be aware that since 2000 the BBC has had access to social security information to support the TV licence concession scheme for the over-75s, so the Bill breaks no new ground in this respect.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000064"></a>The collective effect of the amendments is to remove the BBC from the definition of relevant persons to whom the DWP, the Department for Social Development in Northern Ireland, the Ministry of Defence&#151;in respect of war pensions administered by the Veterans Agency&#151;local authorities and health and social services boards in Northern Ireland can disclose such information. This would make it much more difficult for the BBC to help establish and manage the help scheme, increase the inconvenience for those eligible and, as a result, make the help scheme more costly to administer.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000065"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07032291000392"></a>Viscount Astor:</b> I apologise, but I think the Minister has said something entirely contradictory to what he said on a previous amendment. He said that a company would, as it were, organise that, and the BBC would have no part in dealing with the actual information brought up. He has just said, however, that it is part of his argument that the BBC must have access to this information. Am I confused?</p>

<p><a name="07032291000066"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07032291000393"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> The noble Viscount is never confused; I have just not succeeded in clarifying the situation as accurately as I ought. As I have indicated to the noble Viscount, we trust that the practical operation of the scheme will go to one contracted operator. If that takes the BBC out of one of the &#147;relevant persons&#148;, it will have no status on the position, nor can it deal with any difficulty which might occur with the one contracted operator. The BBC has a crucial role in this; it is the broadcaster of national repute, in which resides considerable trust.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000067"></a>We are dealing with a difficult transition. There is perhaps a tendency to be a little blas&#233; over the movement to digital television. I should not think that there is Member of this Committee who has had difficulties in making that transition; if so, they are in a small percentage of the population. There may be a noble Lord who has not transferred to digital, but neither the actual concept of effecting the transfer not the costs involved would be the most salient issues. We have identified a group of people for whom the signal will be progressively switched off as we go through the regions, starting with the pilot study at Whitehaven. We have identified a group of vulnerable citizens who need help. The over-75s&#146; take-up of digital is vastly different from the rest of the population. I give way to the right reverent Prelate, who I am sure will help me.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000068"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07032291000394"></a>The Lord Bishop of Manchester:</b> I thank the Minister for so kindly giving way. I gave notice at Second Reading that I would be pressing a particular point, which the Minister has now raised: the definition of the vulnerable in the 75-plus age group. In the Minister&#146;s reply at Second Reading, he clearly indicated that the Government&#146;s view was that there was sufficient argument from research that the people in the 65-plus, as opposed to the 75-plus, bracket did not need that level of help.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000069"></a>Since Second Reading, I have had a further opportunity to look at the DCMS Consumer Expert Group report, <I>Supporting Vulnerable Consumers with targeted assistance at and after Digital TV Switchover</I>. It claims that nearly as many households with people aged over 65 required assistance with installation as those with over-75s:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000328"></a>&#147;We are concerned that help with installation will be necessary for people outside the targeted assistance scheme for vulnerable groups. In the Ferryside and Llansteffan digital switchover technical trials conducted by DCMS it was found that nearly as many households with people aged 65+ required assistance with installation as those with people aged 75+. Further work needs to be done to work out how households with people aged 65+ can be provided&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032291000315"></a>with installation assistance. It goes on to talk about the role that volunteers may have in that. I have no doubt that the answer is immediately available to the Minister&#151;as I was speaking I saw the papers coming across. I now look forward to hearing it.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000070"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07032291000395"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> Long before the notes came across, the answer was plain to the Minister&#151;I want to reassure the right reverend Prelate on that point. I have not the slightest doubt that there are vulnerable people and people of limited means for whom the switchover will cause difficulty. The switching off of the system and the requirement to invest in different equipment will create a challenge. That is why it is so important that the broadcasters are involved in a technologically driven action of significance to the nation.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000071"></a>The right reverend Prelate will recognise that we have to draw a line somewhere. If we set out to identify all sections of society that might contain vulnerable individuals, we would be involved in an extremely complex exercise. It would be a means test with a vengeance and one that would not just be about income and resources but would also be about technological understanding and capacity to cope with the modern situation. We have to draw the line somewhere. It is abundantly clear that 65 year-olds fit the pattern of the rest of the population because very close to 75 per cent of them have already moved to digital. However, only 45 per cent of over 75s have made that transition, so there is clear evidence of a group that needs help because it is markedly different from the rest of the population. That is why we are addressing ourselves to that group.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000072"></a>I respect the motives of the right reverend Prelate who is trying to give help wherever it is needed, and I do not deny that help is needed among different sections of society. However, he will recognise that the cost of the scheme&#151;more than &#163;600 million&#151;has already been visited upon licence fee-payers. It would be substantially higher if we extended the scheme to include over-65s. If we did that, we would be extending the scheme to a group that is like every other group and it could then be said that if that group needs help, all categories in society need help. That would raise a challenge that we cannot respond to. However, we have an identifiable group that needs help, and we are addressing it.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000073"></a>In the general debate, one side&#146;s argument is that this a social security issue of assistance and the Government&#146;s argument&#151;which is established in the settlement regarding the licence fee&#151;is that this is a broadcasting change properly visited upon the BBC as part of the licensing cost. On that basis, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000074"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07032291000396"></a>Lord Maxton:</b> I am far too rapidly approaching 75, and I find some of what the Minister said rather insulting. The implication that all the over-75s cannot cope with any of this is unfair. Many people say, &#147;All I want to watch is BBC1, BBC2 and ITV. I don&#146;t want to watch anything else, so why should I bother paying a company or buying a box?&#148;. However, let us leave that aside.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000075"></a>In relation to the point raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, the BBC or the Secretary of State will own a minimum of 51 per cent of the contracting company, but who will own the other 49 per cent? Will other broadcasters&#151;Sky, cable television, BT or other providers&#151;be barred from holding shares in that company? Those companies will benefit from the switchover when it comes. Who will own the other part of the company? How is it going to be set up? When will it be set up?</p>
<h5><a name="07032291000362"></a>2.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07032291000076"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07032291000397"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> Let me just deal with my noble friend&#146;s point about me insulting the over-75s. I would not dare to adopt such a strategy, nor would it cross my mind; I am merely reflecting the fact that a much higher percentage of people in that group need help, just in the same way as we recognise that in the 65 to 74 year-old group who will not qualify as of right, we have identified the disabled as having a special need and they will qualify for assistance. So it is a question of where the line is drawn, and we have drawn it in relation to the broadcasting knowledge that we have about who is receiving digital at present, because we are constructing our whole position on this in the context of the broadcasting change that is due to occur. I hope that my noble friend will recognise that.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000077"></a>What my noble friend has done is to reinforce the anxiety of the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, about the company that will operate the scheme. As we have made clear, we expect that it is likely to be one company, but the reason why we say 51 per cent is that it allows for a joint venture with the main scheme operator. It is not for us completely to pre-empt that position entirely. We are clear about the structure. The noble Lord pressed me on why the BBC was involved in this legislation in relation to the scheme. It is because there is a hierarchy of power.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000078"></a>The BBC will take responsibility for the operation of the scheme. It will be responsible for ensuring that the contract is drawn up accurately and that the contractor meets the contract. We are not out to be overly prescriptive about how the BBC chooses such a contractor and what that contractor will look like. That is not the basis for legislation; as long as we have broad parameters for who takes responsibility in this, that detail can eventually be worked out. In legislation, what Parliament and the nation need to be assured of is that there is a proper line of responsibility that guarantees that the scheme will be carried out effectively and properly. That is why the BBC has a crucial role in that.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000079"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07032291000398"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> I thank the Minister for his extensive reply. We have teased out some rather interesting aspects. I assure him that I was not necessarily expecting any fresh arguments; I was simply expecting some convincing arguments&#151;but we are clearly bereft of such arguments today. I also assure him that, given my technological skills, I am not at all blas&#233; about switchover.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000080"></a>The arguments are not convincing, but I thought that it was interesting how the Minister veered off and talked about the help scheme and how it would be applied, which was not really a justification of the BBC&#146;s involvement. He referred to the need for broadcasters to be involved. In a way Digital UK is just that&#151;it has been formed by the broadcasters. That does not prove at all that it is best done by the BBC. He illustrated the fact that we have a rather different approach, in that it is more of a social assistance programme than what he calls a broadcasting transition. The more that he talks about the BBC having a crucial role, and attempts to demonstrate it by referring to the national repute of the BBC, the more he shows that the BBC may have some responsibility but without the power to influence. I do not believe that the BBC is geared up to do this kind of thing. It does not own a lot of transmission equipment any more. Digital UK would seem the best body to be the overseeing body for the contractors.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000081"></a>I do not think that the case is made and I do not think that we will find ourselves in agreement with the Government. It comes back to the fact that the BBC is a convenient point from which to collect the &#163;600 million. The Minister mentioned that the cost to the licence fee payer would be more than &#163;600 million. I suspect that that is a mis-statement, because he has assured us on previous occasions that the cost for the licence fee payer would be capped at &#163;600 million and any cost over that would be borne out of general taxation. He said that explicitly at Second Reading, so I hope that we are not going backwards today.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000082"></a>Finally, I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the philosophy of support for the over-75s. I accept that, although it would be desirable to go further, the cost will start to unravel to a very great extent if we try to extend the scheme further. Many aspects of the scheme are still rather opaque and, as we go on this afternoon, I hope that we shall learn more. We may well come back to this matter at another stage of the Bill but, in the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000083"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000084"></a>[<I>Amendments Nos. 7 to 11 not moved.</I>]</p>

<p><a name="07032291000085"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07032291000399"></a>Lord Clement-Jones</b> moved Amendment No. 12:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000329"></a> Clause 1, page 2, line 2, after &#147;persons&#148; insert &#147;, including persons who have moved to a specified region that has completed the digital switchover scheme from a specified region that has not completed the digital switchover scheme,&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000086"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that people who are entitled to the help scheme and who move to a new area that has completed digital switchover will still receive the benefits of the help scheme if they move from an area that has not yet begun digital switchover. We on these Benches are concerned that people who are eligible for the scheme could miss out on help just because they have moved or are moving to a new area. Although I do not believe that this would be a major consideration for people in deciding whether to move to a new area, it may well be something that they do not think about when they are arranging the move.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000087"></a>Such a situation can be illustrated with the example of a partially sighted student who is eligible for help in his university town where switchover has not yet taken place but who, after graduating, gets a job in a town that has completed digital switchover. That student might well fall between the cracks and that would be an unfortunate state of affairs. I am sure that the Minister can think of many other cases of people moving where that could happen, and the amendment is an attempt to seek assurance about those kinds of circumstances. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000088"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07032291000400"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> The philosophy behind the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, is well accepted. I need to describe the position and then we can discuss subsequent matters, should they arise.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000089"></a>In developing the help scheme, we wanted to simplify the basic eligibility rules as far as possible, bearing in mind the complexity that can quickly surround social security benefits. The help scheme will be implemented on a region-by-region basis. It is not possible to organise this in any other way, given the volumes involved and the need to give support close to the point of switchover. That means that an eligibility window needs to be tied to the event in each switchover region.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000090"></a>We are opting for a qualification period starting from eight months before the final switchover date&#151;the date that BBC1 services are removed in an area&#151;until one month after switchover in order to be as generous as possible. We have not gone for a fixed date in a particular region as that would exclude people who became eligible for the qualifying disability benefits some months before switchover.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000091"></a>Following discussions with the consumer expert group, we have opted for a date one month after BBC1 in analogue disappears. That will be the final date on which applications from eligible households will be accepted. Of course the scheme may need to continue helping people for, say, a couple of weeks to deal with post-switchover claims. This means that people meeting the eligibility criteria but moving into an area after that date will not qualify. They will need to make their own arrangements. Before the right reverend Prelate speaks, perhaps I may say in respect of disadvantaged people, and disabled partially-sighted people, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, Digital UK will set up voluntary networks to help disadvantaged people who have problems. Saying that people need to make their own arrangements and excluding those who I have just mentioned may seem unfair, but to extend this period would either widen the eligibility rules or require complex rules to deal with verification of previous addresses. Both approaches would add further complications and costs. More importantly, this would require the scheme operator to have infrastructure in place long after switchover in the region. Again, this would have cost implications.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000092"></a>We believe that the priority should be on helping those affected at the point of switchover rather than people who move into an area subsequently. Those affected will still be able to make use of the communications available from Digital UK. Many of those affected may well already have converted to digital. It is also worth bearing in mind the very important point that these rules do not affect people who move within the same region, so we are probably talking about a small minority of those who are eligible, particularly if we are taking care of the disadvantaged and the disabled.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000093"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07032291000401"></a>Lord Maxton:</b> This raises one of the problems with the BBC being involved. The TV licence is for a property and a household. It is not paid by the individual, as such: it is paid on behalf of the whole house. But the help is to be given to individuals. Suppose that, for instance, a house becomes digital as a result of the help scheme and the person moves on, for whatever reason. Is the equipment purchased by the help scheme for a particular person to remain in the house when someone else moves in or is the person entitled to take it with them?</p>

<p><a name="07032291000094"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07032291000402"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> What a very interesting question. Help is by household, defined as husband, wife and dependent child. If someone leaves, having bought the equipment, presumably they can take it and the new tenant or owner has to purchase new equipment.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000095"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07032291000403"></a>Lord Maxton:</b> Let us take the earlier example of a dependent who is a partially sighted child, to whom help has been given. If the child leaves home to go to university or whatever, and the parents remain, does he take that equipment with him or does it remain with the parents?</p>

<p><a name="07032291000096"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07032291000404"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> Presumably, it remains with the parents, but the disadvantaged, partially sighted student will be helped when he moves to his new flat, hall of residence or palace.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000097"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07032291000405"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> The problem is that that is not the case. It depends on when switchover takes place. By the Minister&#146;s own admission, everything finishes one month after BBC1 in analogue disappears. If switchover has taken place, it means that the partially sighted student in this example, perhaps living with 75 year-old parents&#151;just to make it even more complicated&#151;would be unable to get help because switchover had already occurred. Perhaps they may move to Whitehaven, to coin a name. The Minister is demonstrating the harshness of this absolute cut-off point. I will read very carefully what has been said.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000098"></a>The Minister has made some play of the voluntary networks for disadvantaged people, which I can see has some benefit. However, one needs to look at that further to see the reality, the geographical coverage and so on. I do not know what kind of resource Digital UK plans to put in for this. I think that we have uncovered something that may affect a small number of people, but could act harshly on people in those circumstances. We are a mobile nation. I do not think that the examples that I have given are outlandish. They are perfectly reasonable, but we shall look at what the Minister has said.</p>
<h5><a name="07032291000363"></a>3 pm</h5>

I shall not ask difficult questions about individual circumstances; it is more a question of principle. Will he say how the rules will be defined? Will there be secondary legislation? Who will decide on eligibility? How will it be done by statute?</p>

<p><a name="07032291000100"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="07032291000407"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, raises some interesting points that we want to reflect on.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000101"></a>There is a real problem in that we are talking about a technical switchover. There has to be a time limit, whether it is two weeks, three weeks, or whatever. You cannot construct an example of two 75 year-old parents with a partially sighted child who is moving off to university in, say, 2015, and ask why the Bill does not look after them. Obviously there are networks at social services that will take over the voluntary organisations that I mentioned. Although we will reflect on the issue, there has to be a date on which the process, support mechanism and infrastructure that we have set up for digital switchover disappears. While we reflect on what the noble Lord has said, perhaps he could reflect on the practical implications of his proposal, which is a rather more open-ended arrangement that we are considering.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000102"></a>In answer to the question posed by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, it is under the BBC charter and agreement.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000103"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="07032291000408"></a>Viscount Astor:</b> I am not entirely clear about that. I am not aware that the BBC charter and agreement go into details of eligibility into this scheme. I think that the Minister may have misunderstood my question. My question was: when it comes to deciding who is eligible for the help, will that be set out in regulation? </p>

<p><a name="07032291000104"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="07032291000409"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> I do not think that the noble Viscount will be more satisfied by my next answer when I tell him that the Secretary of State is responsible for eligibility rules.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000106"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="07032291000411"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> I gather that there will be a scheme, which will be published under clause 39 of the BBC charter and agreement.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000107"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07032291000412"></a>The Lord Bishop of Manchester:</b> On several occasions the Minister has talked about the role of voluntary organisations. I wonder whether he can give some indication of how those voluntary organisations will be co-ordinated. It is a very good idea to get voluntary organisations in on this, and he may be interested to know that some very early conversations within the churches and the faith communities have been taking place to see whether help can be offered in that way.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000108"></a>It is one thing for an organisation such as Digital UK to say that it will use voluntary organisations, but it is a pretty massive task, and I wonder how the Minister thinks they will go about it.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000109"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="07032291000413"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> It will be part of the brief for Digital UK to develop those lines of communication with voluntary networks. I am sure that the right reverend Prelate would agree that not all voluntary networks will be relevant to this technical operation. My guess is that Digital UK can mobilise a number of voluntary organisations to help with this switchover and satisfy the requirements of all those needing the help that it and the voluntary networks can provide.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000110"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0002.htm_spnew20"></a><a name="07032291000414"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> The more we go into this, the more baffled I am. I first thank the Minister for his undertaking to take this issue away and look at it. I accept that a halfway house may need to be reached in this process, but one month seems rather draconian in the circumstances. This clearly cannot be a right for ever and a day; it must be related to the timing of the switchover in the various areas. If we can pull people into the net, and not rather unfairly have a situation where they are too late to be eligible, that would be satisfactory. One could talk about a range of different dates.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000111"></a>The essence of many of the amendments, as I said earlier, is that it is particularly baffling that, to be specific about the scheme, the Secretary of State must, by order or regulation&#151;I have no idea whether some sort of ministerial fiat is involved&#151;lay down an understood mechanism by which the scheme is brought into effect. I probably misheard the Minister, but I thought he mentioned Clause 39; that sounds rather outlandish, since there are only five clauses in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000112"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07032291000415"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> That was clause 39 of the BBC agreement.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000114"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07032291000417"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> The noble Lord says that he is baffled. I thought that we had agreed that something must happen at a certain period. We argue that the period is of a certain length; the noble Lord says that that is too restrictive. We must both go away and think about that.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000115"></a>I am sorry if I was not clear that the scheme agreement will be made under clause 39 of the BBC agreement. The scheme agreement between the DCMS and the BBC will set out the detailed requirements. The BBC must reflect them in the terms of its agreement with the contractor. The agreement will cover eligibility, customer management requirements and operational requirements for the help scheme and will be published as soon as it is agreed.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000116"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07032291000418"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> I thank the Minister. I was not the slightest bit baffled by his statements about how the scheme&#146;s cut-off points and so on will operate, but about how the scheme will come into effect. He has now said that it is under clause 39 of the agreement; that is a different ball game. In that context, as it is an agreement between the BBC and the Secretary of State, we cannot have a debate about the essence of the eligibility and how the scheme will operate. The only opportunities we have to debate details are in this Committee and, no doubt, on Report. That is not fully satisfactory and will be the basis of a number of amendments that we shall deal with this afternoon.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000117"></a>I look forward to further discussions with the Minister about the cut-off point for those who move. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000118"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000330"></a> Clause 1 , page 2, line 3, at end insert &#147;or otherwise face excessive costs as a direct result of digital switchover&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000120"></a>The noble Lord said: I make it clear that this is a probing amendment, designed in part to smoke out the kind of information that was intended to be smoked out by Amendment No. 5 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising. The fact that both our amendments are so obscurely worded to get at that point indicates the narrowness of the Bill compared to the extent of the problem.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000121"></a>The motive behind this amendment is to say that a far greater proportion of people will be disadvantaged, or potentially disadvantaged, as a result of switchover than are covered by what is referred to here as the switchover help scheme, which is restricted to those with certain disabilities and the over-75s&#151;the right reverend Prelate earlier made that point in specific terms. As the noble Lord, Lord Howard, said, many of those people will be in areas of multiple occupation, both social housing and private landowners, which will inevitably eventually lead to a call on the public purse to cover their costs at least in part.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000122"></a>If the figures from the London Borough of Camden as quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, at Second Reading are correct&#151;about &#163;200 was charged to the lessees and a similar charge put through the rent to the tenants&#151;the charge on a large council estate, which may be run by a managing authority or directly by the council, would be much higher than the charge faced by the individual householder for digital switchover in his own house, which might be across the road from the council estate. That in itself constitutes some degree of disadvantage. As chair of the National Consumer Council, I say that that is serious consumer detriment because those tenants are getting the same good but having to pay more for it as a result of the decision of a landlord&#151;in this case, a social landlord&#151;to go for a system that is beyond what most individual flat dwellers, whether lessees or tenants, would choose for themselves.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000123"></a>That is the case in a lot of social housing across our cities. It is also the case in dwellings owned by private landowners, particularly those who have long-standing tenants or lessees who are elderly and who would prefer, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, to stick to the three channels that they knew 30 years ago. However, the landlord decides to go for the top end of the system. There is also the opposite problem, which probably does not apply in the public sector or in those parts of the housing stock managed on behalf of the public sector, when the landlord decides not to do the switchover at all, at least not until the last minute, in which case the price goes up once more.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000124"></a>A large proportion of the 20 per cent of people who live in the dwellings referred to by the noble Lord are disadvantaged in one form or another, but only some of them will come under the scheme. The over-75s are in that sense no different from the over-65s, who may be more technologically advanced and may have already made their choices. However, they are equally disadvantaged if their landlord decides on an over-the-top system that they would not have chosen.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000125"></a>As I understand the matter&#151;and I think that this was confirmed at Second Reading because it certainly seems to be the case with councils that have already done the switchover&#151;if the cost to the tenant is put on the rent, that additional rent will be met by housing benefit. I am not entirely clear where that ruling came from but, in any case, the implications for the public purse are pretty stupendous. More than half of council house dwellers are eligible for housing benefit, which is about 9 per cent of the population, compared with the 2 per cent or 3 per cent covered by the switchover help scheme, which it is estimated will cost the BBC &#163;600 million in its new welfare function financed by poll tax payers through the licence fee. If the cost of switchover is put into the housing benefit system, it will cost more than the BBC-administered &#163;600 million. This is an important point of public policy.</p>
<h5><a name="07032291000364"></a>3.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000126"></a>If the landlord is the council, a reputable social landlord or an ALMO, because rents are more or less standard, housing benefit will probably automatically follow. For the elderly tenant or lessee of a private landowner, that is by no means clear. We know that a higher proportion of such disadvantaged and elderly tenants are less likely to claim housing benefit in the first instance. We have a large chunk of people who are disadvantaged vis- -vis those who live in individual houses and vis- -vis those who are being helped under the help scheme for whom, at best, housing benefit will pay. It is important that the Government and policymakers understand the full cost of digital switchover and that tenants or lessees involved in this area of deprivation know what their rights are under this system.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000127"></a>There is the additional position of the lessee of such a landlord. I believe the noble Lord, Lord Evans, said that he could apply to the land, valuation and housing tribunal if costs were added to his service charge. However, such a large number of people is involved in this that the workload of such tribunals would significantly increase if that happened rather than costs being offset in other ways.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000128"></a>I am therefore making two points. First, let us be franker about the full cost of this. If a larger cost falls on housing benefit, the case made eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, about why the BBC should be in the position of administering the smaller cost is even more valid. Secondly, those who are entitled to this help&#151;who are over 75 or disabled&#151;should at least potentially be known to the people operating the switchover scheme. Otherwise, in some parts of the country, in certain estates and in areas of sheltered housing, there will be a last-minute problem. It will cause not only severe distress to the individuals involved but also severe difficulty for the administrators of the scheme, and frankly, political difficulty to the Government or the local authority implementing it. While I do not expect the Government to accept this amendment, I would like to see greater recognition of the public policy problem and the potential distress that it may cause.</p>

Also, clearly, from what he has said today, this is a major issue. He should be congratulated on unearthing a real problem. I very much hope that the Government have had time to give this consideration since Second Reading.</p>

I am not in a position to accept his amendment, nor any amendment constructed along these lines. As he will recognise, such an amendment would greatly extend the range of people on whom data would be necessary within the framework of the help scheme. That raises some big questions. But I recognise that he is raising the interests of a significant group of people and I want to give him the most constructive response that I can to the points he made.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000131"></a>It is the responsibility of the landlord to upgrade communal TV systems and reception or other reception equipment for which they are responsible.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000132"></a>The help scheme will have a responsibility to take all reasonable steps to ensure a continuity of reception at switchover. That is the premise on which we are working. Clearly, my noble friend rightly identified, in somewhat dire terms, the danger of not taking that on board significantly. This will include set-top reception where appropriate or connecting the equipment to an upgraded or working communal TV system. But I accept that in some cases this may not be possible. We need to consider those issues in finalising the scheme agreement to which we alluded earlier.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000133"></a>If the system does not convey signals&#151;there might be many reasons why this might be the case&#151;only the landlord can take responsibility, either by taking forward work to do this, or allowing residents to take their own steps. There will be costs associated with any upgrade work needed with implications for service charges, and we encourage landlords to work with residents in determining the best solution. Of course, many responsible landlords have already done so. The recent research by BMRB showed that significant progress was being made in the public sector.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000134"></a>As my noble friend indicated, tenants on low income may qualify for housing benefit which will cover any increase in rents or service charges. Housing benefit regulations are being updated so there is no doubt that integrated reception systems that convey terrestrial and satellite signals are covered. In that area, I can give my noble friend all the assurance that he requires. Steps are being taken to protect those least able to meet increased costs from upgraded aerial systems.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000135"></a>We and Digital UK will continue to communicate with the housing sector to ensure that people are aware of what they need to do and the consequences if they do not&#151;our particular focus will be on private sector residents and landlords who are likely to be less advanced and who were largely the subject of my noble friend&#146;s concerns. We will also continue to work with the housing sector with more practical support&#151;for example, by making landlords aware of the likely costs, and encouraging them to seek effective procurement solutions or integrate this work with other planned developments on their properties. We will also encourage them to think about their charging policies as far as possible.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000136"></a>My noble friend has raised an important area of consideration. I want to give him the reassurance that, as far as housing benefit is concerned, where we are able to act directly, we are taking steps to ensure that appropriate action is taken. He is right. It is in the landlord&#146;s own interests to act in good time. Tenants will also receive information about dates and when things will occur and it is in the interests of the landlord to ensure that he meets tenants&#146; reasonable expectations in these terms. Landlords may seek to recover the costs of upgrades to communal TV aerial systems from their leaseholders and tenants in the same way as they would for any improvement to the building infrastructure. They will get their capital investment back. Costs arising from these upgrades will certainly be covered by housing benefit and tenants and leaseholders will continue to be protected from overcharging the improvement in the service which the digital switchover represents by the existing range of housing law.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000137"></a>The digital switchover programme will provide advice and guidance for landlords, leaseholders and tenants to facilitate cost-effective upgrades to systems. Landlords will want to consider the whole-life costs and benefits of the upgrade options. After all, if a landlord owns property which has not been upgraded several years after the rest of the region has been upgraded, he will have real problems with the rent that he will be able to charge in comparison with a property that has taken account of the upgrade.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000138"></a>I reassure my noble friend directly on the issue of housing benefit and we take on board the points that he made about the importance of communal systems, but both landlords and tenants, as far as possible, will be made fully aware of the implications of the switch-off date.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000139"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07032291000422"></a>Lord Whitty:</b> I am grateful for my noble friend&#146;s assurance as far as it goes and, as I said, I will not press this amendment. But before the passage of this Bill is complete, we need greater clarity. I am glad that the rules of housing benefit are being formally altered, because that will help. But that is only half the detriment&#151;it is what the landlord charges to a tenant for the communal area and associated wiring, whereas the tenant of that flat will need to pay more. If the landlord goes for an all-singing, all-dancing system because some of his tenants want that, a particular flat dweller will have to pay more for their system on an ongoing basis for the internal own equipment than someone across the road who seeks exactly the same service and can do their own deal. The detriment continues even though the communal part of the cost is covered by housing benefit.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000140"></a>There is a real problem here. It is true that the possibility of the landlord completely abrogating his responsibilities is more likely at the murkier end of the private sector, but the actual problem is bigger in the social housing sector and particularly on large estates where clearly there is a huge range of possible choices. The landlord&#151;the council, ALMO or transferee company&#151;can quite legitimately say, &#147;I have found people who want 95 different channels&#148;, but an individual tenant wants only 10. The landlord would claim that he had support for an all-singing, all-dancing system but there is still a detriment to the person in the particular flat who has particular requirements.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000141"></a>I do not see the way round this problem, but the Government and the help scheme must be aware of it and, if necessary, stand by to provide some assistance to those suffering from that detriment, as well as for those over 75 or subject to the other disablement criteria in the Bill. Subject to that point still floating for the rest of the progress of this Bill, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000144"></a>The noble Lord said: I very much welcome the acceptance by the Government of an amendment similar to one moved by my honourable friend Paul Holmes in another place that ensured that the targeted help scheme contractor can have access to registers of blind and partially sighted people in order to provide information to them about their entitlement to help and support with switchover. That will be of huge benefit to the 380,000 people on the registers throughout the UK.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000145"></a>However, I am raising other issues in this amendment on behalf of organisations such as Sense and RNIB. Although they welcome the amendments tabled, there are further concerns. The chairman of the RNIB, the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, would have liked to have been here. In a sense, I am moving the amendment on his behalf with his knowledge.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000146"></a>In seven months&#146; time, we will be beginning the process of digital switchover in Whitehaven in Cumbria, as we have established. Are the Government yet in a position to describe the access features of the equipment being commissioned for distribution to Whitehaven residents who will qualify for assistance under the targeted help scheme? For example, if that equipment does not have the capability to deliver audio description, then visually impaired people will be completely excluded from television services, there being no digital terrestrial set-top box currently on the market that can receive audio description.</p>
<h5><a name="07032291000365"></a>3.30 pm</h5>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000147"></a>The specification of the equipment to be commissioned has been the subject of a long debate between the consumer expert group&#151;certain aspects of whose report we have heard about today&#151;and the Government. Manufactured goods are excluded from disability discrimination law. However, switchover offers a huge public procurement opportunity to build in access features needed by disabled and older people. The Government must seize the opportunity to make the equipment for the targeted help scheme as accessible as possible and set out a number of minimum features under the specification, however technology changes in the future.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000148"></a>There are additional concerns, such as whether a fully accessible solution will be ready for Borders in 2008. By &#147;fully accessible&#148;, I mean a set-top box that can receive audio description as well as having an electronic programme guide, with audio output functions enabling visually impaired people to access simple but essential information such as what channel and programme they are watching.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000149"></a>The Government are to be congratulated on their movement on the Bill so far. I hope that the Minister can assure us that the accessibility issues, and the minimum specification issues I have raised, will be addressed not only for Whitehaven in the short term, but in the longer term for Borders and beyond. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000150"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07032291000424"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> A key requirement of the help scheme is that it provides suitable equipment to those eligible for assistance. Like the consumer experts group, we were concerned that equipment available in today&#146;s market was designed to reduce costs and therefore might not be suitable for the help scheme. So, with the help of the consumer experts group, we have developed the core receiver requirements for equipment procured by the help scheme.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000151"></a>We consulted on the core receiver requirements between July and September last year, and the results were published on 13 December. The requirement also formed part of the <I>Official Journal of the European Union</I> notice issued in January as part of the procurement exercise. The noble Lord mentioned the pilot in Whitehaven, which has been chosen as a flagship project and will switch in October 2007. Given the timing of Whitehaven, it is possible that there will be no set-top boxes matching the core receiver requirements, so it may be that the scheme operator has to provide boxes currently on the market which most closely match the requirements. Both the BBC and the DCMS expect that boxes for the main scheme will fully comply with the core receiver requirements. The important point is that boxes with audio descriptions and the other important characteristics the noble Lord mentioned may not be the core box that is eventually used, but they will be provided in the Whitehaven experiment to ensure that these people are not disadvantaged. Audio description is already available in Whitehaven via Sky. We would also welcome a DDT audio description solution, to provide residents with that extra choice.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000152"></a>I hope that the noble Lord is reassured on his important point that partially sighted people in the Whitehaven pilot, will not be disadvantaged. It may not be the box that is eventually used, but we will ensure that the equipment provided by the help scheme evolves over time to make best use of advances in technology. The help scheme will make a significant investment in equipment on behalf of those eligible. We and the BBC want to use this investment to ensure, first, that better equipment would make switchover an easier process&#151;the significant work that the DTI led in 2003 and 2004, which was carried out by the Generics Group, identified this as a very important issue&#151;and, secondly, better equipment should reduce the level of support visits needed.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000153"></a>The amendment will not have any positive effect for people eligible to the scheme. In fact, it might have the opposite effect because it would prevent the scheme improving the core receiver specification over time as technology improves.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000154"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0003.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07032291000425"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> I thank the Minister for that careful reply. It will be necessary to read carefully what he said. Clearly, there is a two-stage process. On the Whitehaven introduction, the essence of what the Minister said is that the maximum possible will be done and that audio description will be available on Sky, but probably not on other channels, although I do not know whether that is an entirely correct interpretation. But one will have to access through Sky in order to access audio description. It means that there will not be platform neutrality for Whitehaven in that respect, which is to be regretted.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000155"></a>Nevertheless, one has to accept that perhaps that will happen early on, but what will happen thereafter? Is there a plan to replace unsatisfactory set-top boxes with set-top boxes that meet the core receiver requirement in future? It would be rather unfair for people in Whitehaven to be prejudiced by the fact that they are experiencing switchover rather earlier.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000156"></a>I have not had the benefit of reading the core receiver requirement. Clearly, it would be useful if I was able to do so. I entirely accept that technology may change over time, but organisations are concerned about having the minimum. Of course, let us have more bells and whistles&#151;as time goes on that will inevitably be the case. But there must be accessible remote control, voice output of channel announcement, identification displayed on screen, voice output of programme identification and so forth. There are very clear requirements for set-top boxes. I very much hope that the Minister can assure me that the core receiver requirement is essentially a set of minimum specifications that will be the entitlement of those eligible from Whitehaven onwards and that, for Whitehaven, those eligible will have the right to change to satisfactory platform-neutral set-top boxes.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000157"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07032291000426"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> The most constructive thing we can do is let the noble Lord, and any other Member of the Committee who might like to see it, have a copy of the core receiver requirements. We could then address, if necessary, the problem that the noble Lord has raised. There is no difference of view: we want to provide not all the bells et cetera, but the core requirements that disadvantaged people need. If the noble Lord is happy to accept that undertaking, we would be grateful. He makes an interesting point on the boxes used in the Whitehaven pilot and asked whether, if they are different from the boxes rolled out over the country, we would consider replacing them. That point is very well made, and we shall consider it and come back to Members of the Committee on it.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000158"></a>To further reinforce the point about minimum requirements, they will be written into the scheme as the absolute minimum. That also gives an opportunity for the noble Lord and other noble Lords to comment if they so wish.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000332"></a> Clause 1, page 2, line 6, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000333"></a>&#147;( ) The National Audit Office is to publish an annual report on the expenditure incurred in the course of disclosing information under this Act.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000162"></a>The noble Viscount said: There are concerns bringing the National Audit Office into play regarding the cost of digital switchover, which, as your Lordships have heard, is estimated to be &#163;600 million. When I tabled this amendment, I believed that it was quite important but, having heard the explanation from the Minister today about how the system is going to operate, I now believe that it is vitally important.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000163"></a>The Minister, his department and the BBC are wonderfully schizophrenic about the National Audit Office. When I asked him in a Written Question why the BBC is not subject to the National Audit Office, the Answer&#151;which was perfectly reasonable&#151;was that it would affect editorial independence. When one then asks whether the remit of the National Audit Office on the amount of money spent by the BBC on its World Service&#151;which is funded by the Foreign Office, for which the National Audit Office does have a remit&#151;affects the editorial independence of the World Service, the answer is of course no. So the Government have it both ways: when it suits them, they say yes; when it does not suit them, they say no.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000164"></a>I believe that it is important to bring the National Audit Office into play. I am sure that the Minister will say that my amendment is in the wrong place and refers to the wrong thing, but I am sure that he will understand that I am not as good at drafting as his department. I hope that he will accept the principle.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000165"></a>We have heard that the estimated cost is &#163;600 million, which will not be subject to any parliamentary procedure. The Secretary of State will decide who will be eligible and how they will be eligible. The rules will then be drawn up and delivered to the BBC, which, under the agreement in clause 39, will make an agreement with the operating company under the Clause 1(4)(b), whereby it will hold 51 per cent. The company will be given a whole load of rules that will decide who will get help and who will not.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000166"></a>At some point, presumably, someone sat down and worked out the exact costing. We have heard that there are enormous variations in who may get help and what happens if they move House. We have had that debate, but there is no form of scrutiny. As I understand it&#151;and I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;if there is an overspend, it will be picked up by the Treasury. If the department gets it right, the Treasury is not involved, but if it gets it wrong it is involved. On the basis of the department&#146;s ability to forecast spending, we have to be dubious about that; after all, this is the department that brought us the dome and that has seen the budget for the Olympics quadruple. So where is the accountability?</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000167"></a>The Secretary of State will set the rules, but he will not spend the money. Will the Secretary of State responsible for social security set the rules or will it be the DCMS, given that they relate to the eligibility of vulnerable people? Who will oversee that the help is going to the right person in the right place, at the right time and with the right amount of money? How is that money going to be accounted for? That is important because we know that the BBC licence fee is now classified as a tax; we are all paying for it. This process should be subject to scrutiny by Parliament and the National Audit Office.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000168"></a>I hope that the Government understand the importance of this and will be able to explain that the process is subject to proper scrutiny. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response and I beg to move.</p>
<h5><a name="07032291000366"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07032291000169"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07032291000429"></a>Lord Fowler:</b> I support the amendment proposed by my noble friend. Earlier today, I asked the Minister about the cost of the London Olympics&#151;he may remember. He tried as best as he could to disguise the true position with a long list of figures, but the fact is that the costs are now &#163;9 billion and the original estimate has trebled, rather than quadrupled, in two years. Therefore, the Government have form in estimating future costs and, to put it as mildly and as genially as I can, it is not exactly encouraging.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000170"></a>That adds force to my noble friend&#146;s amendment. We need to keep a very close eye on this spending, as we do on the administration of the spending. The estimate is &#163;600 million, all of which will come from the licence fee. The Minister knows my views on that: I think it is wrong for it to come from the licence fee, but there we are. However, the noble Lord has given an assurance&#151;it would be helpful if he repeated it&#151;that, if the costs go above &#163;600 million, the overrun will be borne by the general taxpayer. We are all general taxpayers as well as licence fee payers, so, to the extent that the costs go above &#163;600 million, we will all be required to pick up the bill.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000171"></a>My noble friend&#146;s last point on the National Audit Office was also extremely strong. Looking at the matter objectively&#151;if I can put this politely&#151;I think that most people probably trust the National Audit Office more than they do the department when it comes to making forward financial estimates. The National Audit Office carries more clout in that regard and it certainly has a better reputation on accuracy. Like my noble friend, I do not understand the Government&#146;s position on the National Audit Office. They say that in some peculiar way it affects the independence of the BBC, but it is clear that, when it comes to the BBC&#146;s World Service, the National Audit Office not only operates there but operates very successfully and with absolutely no complaint. Although BBC services are sometimes criticised, when we were looking at the BBC for the charter review, we certainly heard very few criticisms of the World Service.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000172"></a>For all those reasons, there is a great deal to be said for my noble friend&#146;s amendment and it deserves support.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000173"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07032291000430"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> I support the suggestion of my noble friend Lord Astor that the National Audit Office should look at this matter. I talked about this earlier in another debate. I believe that spending &#163;600 million helping the disadvantaged has absolutely nothing to do with editorial independence.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000174"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07032291000431"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, made an impeccable case for his amendment, which we support. Indeed, when the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, suggested that the BBC should be audited by the NAO, we also supported that. His arguments today are entirely analogous to that and entirely correct. I think that, if the NAO had greater involvement in this area, we would all be more reassured.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000175"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07032291000432"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> We are revisiting some very well trodden territory here, but why not? The Bill deals with the disclosure of personal information from the DWP and others for the purpose of operating the help scheme, so the amendment, which seeks to place obligations not on the BBC but on the National Audit Office, cannot be accepted. However, in his helpful way, the noble Viscount, in what was described as an &#147;impeccable&#148; contribution by another noble Lord, has sought to tease out an important issue regarding the operation of the help scheme and securing value for money.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000176"></a>Our expectation is that the BBC will operate the help scheme. The details of how it will do that have not yet been settled, but it must be open and transparent. The BBC Trust and executive are both absolutely clear on the need for that. The BBC agreement makes provision for it to publish an annual report about its switchover-related activities, which will, of course, include the help scheme. Accounts of expenditure on the help scheme will need to be produced and audited, as required under the scheme agreement made under clause 39 of the BBC agreement.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000177"></a>The NAO does not have unrestricted access to the BBC, for reasons we debated at length during the passage of the Communications Act 2003 and, more recently, as part of the charter review process. However, clause 79 of the agreement puts the BBC Trust under an obligation to examine the value for money achieved by the BBC in the use of public funds, and gives the NAO a key role in contributing to the fulfilment of that obligation. The detailed arrangements set out in the clause are based on those originally introduced following the Communications Act debates in your Lordships&#146; House. They require the trust to discuss regularly with the Comptroller and Auditor-General the scope of its audit programme and which individual reviews within that programme would be particularly suited to the NAO. The trust must then make arrangements with the NAO and other suitable organisations to carry out individual value-for-money reviews in accordance with the audit programme. The obligations on the trust to secure value for money will apply to its involvement in the operation of the help scheme. I hope that my description of the involvement of the NAO in the process reassures your Lordships that the existing requirements on the trust to act transparently and to secure value for money will also apply to its role in helping to establish and fund the help scheme.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000178"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, asked what would happen if there were any overruns on cost. &#163;600 million will be ring-fenced within the settlement and will therefore not form part of the BBC&#146;s baseline at the end of the settlement. If costs exceed the estimates that we have set out, they will not be met by the BBC but by the public purse in different ways; we have yet to determine how that will actually be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000179"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07032291000433"></a>Viscount Astor:</b> From the Minister&#146;s last remark, one can guess that there will be another raid on the National Lottery if there is an overspend. I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s reply and will study it with care. I take particular note of his points on a possible role for the National Audit Office under clause 79 of the BBC agreement.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000180"></a>The Minister also talked about transparency of accounts. The BBC&#146;s accounts are occasionally interesting, but I have never found transparency in them. It is such a large organisation that it is difficult to discover anything about it. If the BBC is going to keep accounts of this, they will have to be separate and published separately.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000181"></a>There is more important point here, however. If any government department is given &#163;600 million of taxpayers&#146; money by the Treasury to spend as part of a help scheme, a social security handout or whatever, it is subject to a form of parliamentary scrutiny. First, it is probably subject to an order coming before another place and your Lordships&#146; House, setting out the terms on which those who are vulnerable or need help will get the money. It consequently appears in that department&#146;s annual accounts and is subject to NAO and various form of parliamentary scrutiny&#151;by a Select Committee in another place or whatever. Here, however, we have something totally different. The Secretary of State, presumably for the DCMS, will decide who gets the help, what the justifications for it are going to be, and what the terms are. As we have heard, none of that will be debated by Parliament. It will in effect be a private agreement&#151;although it may be published&#151;between the BBC and the company that the BBC and/or the Secretary of State employs to manage the scheme.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000182"></a>There needs to be some form of scrutiny. It is entirely unsatisfactory that there should be none because this is taxpayers&#146; money, and we need to know not only that it is well spent, but more importantly, that it is going to the right place and to the people who matter. There are two elements to this: not just safeguarding the taxpayer but ensuring that those who deserve it get it. I do not think that the Minister fully addressed that issue. I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s response, and I shall study it with care. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000334"></a> Clause 2 , page 2, line 33, leave out from &#147;section&#148; to end of line 34 and insert &#147;&#147;information of a prescribed description&#148; means information prescribed in Schedule 1&#148;</p>

<p><a name="07032291000187"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 30.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000188"></a>This group of amendments would ensure that any information that is essential for the purpose of switchover is released. Amendment No. 16 provides a reference to the proposed new schedule, which sets out on the face of the Bill the information that will be shared under the new powers in the Bill. The new schedule lists the information as shown in paragraph 27 of the Explanatory Notes. It would be preferable for these parameters to be included in the Bill rather than restricted to the Explanatory Notes.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000189"></a>Amendment No. 17 would strengthen and safeguard the release of information provided for in the Bill by ensuring that when the Secretary of State makes an order prescribing information, it will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure in both Houses.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000190"></a>Amendment No. 18 is a probing amendment. It would delete Clause 2(7), which allows the Secretary of State to make what seem to be extremely wide ranging orders. The wording currently reads that orders,</p>
<ul><a name="07032291000358"></a>&#147;may make different provision in relation to different cases&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000191"></a>That is an unnecessarily broad definition of the types of orders that could be issued for the purposes of data sharing, especially given that, as the Bill stands, they are subject to the negative procedure. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response and beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000192"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07032291000435"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> I rise briefly to support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Howard. Clearly there seems to be a large measure of agreement about what information will be required. It appears both in the Explanatory Notes and in the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee&#146;s report dated 28 February. Clearly evidence was given to that effect to the committee. The amendment follows that entirely. It is not clear why that cannot be specified in the Bill. There is no reason why not if there is agreement that that information is required.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000193"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07032291000436"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> Clause 2 gives a power to define the kinds of information that can be supplied under Clause 1. Setting out the details in secondary legislation means the type of information that can be supplied can be adjusted, depending on operational requirements, without the need for further primary legislation, although it cannot be changed at will because the negative resolution of parliamentary control applies.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000194"></a>We have updated a draft order showing how we plan to use the powers in an order we intend to make immediately after Royal Assent. The order was shared at the Commons Committee stage. If the noble Lord has not seen it, I suggest that we share it with him and other Members of the Committee. Amendment No. 16 would remove this power, changing the definition of &#147;prescribed&#148; to mean information set out in a schedule. Amendment No. 30 sets out the information that can be disclosed.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000195"></a>Amendment No. 17 would require the order to be made using the affirmative resolution procedure. As I have said, orders made under this clause as drafted are subject to the negative resolution form of parliamentary control. Amendment No. 18 removes the provision which allows regulations to be made for different cases. This appears to be consequential on Amendment No. 16.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000196"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, mentioned the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee report of the 2006-07 Session. The committee said that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000335"></a>&#147;This bill is to give legal authority for the disclosure of social security and war pensions information, with a view to maximising take-up under the proposed Digital Switchover Help Scheme. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport have provided a delegated powers memorandum (printed at Appendix 1) to explain the delegations in clause 2. The delegations are not inappropriate and there is nothing in the bill which we wish to draw to the attention of the House&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032291000316"></a>It is worth saying that opposition parties are always quick to point out where the Delegated Powers Committee has concerns. In general, the Government respond very positively to the committee&#146;s recommendations. In this case, it has given our approach a clean bill of health.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000197"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07032291000437"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> This is entirely on the basis of information provided by the department; namely, that those items of information specified in the report of the Delegated Powers Committee were the ones to be prescribed in regulation. So it is an entirely circular argument. There is no argument about the nature of the information. The argument is about the fact that, since the department is very clear about the information required, it could be in primary legislation and not in secondary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000198"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07032291000438"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> It is fair to say that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee would have made that point had it felt it appropriate so to do. When I say it has given a clean bill of health, it has presumably approved all aspects because it is very thorough in the way in which it looks at matters.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000199"></a>It will not surprise the noble Lord, Lord Howard, that we do not agree with his arguments. Our approach, as set out in Clause 2, strikes the right balance between certainty and flexibility&#151;in an operation like this flexibility is of enormous importance&#151;enabling the scope of information that can be shared with the scheme operator to be narrowed so that only certain descriptions of information essential for the scheme are disclosed while allowing these rules to be adapted if there is an operational case to do so.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000200"></a>Placing the detail in the Bill would not confer any additional protection, but would mean that further legislation would be required if the list of items was not correct. The lack of flexibility may have important implications for the successful delivery of the scheme. I hope that the noble Lord is convinced by those arguments.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000201"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07032291000439"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> In a word, no. I cannot see why this should not be in the Bill or why one needs flexibility over a list of information. It should be possible to produce a list of what is wanted now because there cannot be a great deal more that is wanted. It would be much more satisfactory to have it there, than to give effectively a blank cheque to be able to ask for anything that is wanted. That having been said, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000336"></a> Clause 2 , page 2, line 33, leave out from &#147;section&#148; to end of line 34 and insert &#147;&#147;information of a prescribed description&#148; means information prescribed in Schedule 1&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000207"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment addresses a serious flaw in the Bill. Clause 3 establishes a new offence for abusing information shared under the powers in the Bill and in doing so places the burden of proof on the individual who would be, in the event of a prosecution, the defendant. What is most disturbing about the reversal of the burden of proof in this context is that it not only shows flagrant disregard for the presumption of innocence, but it strikes me that an offence that not only places the onus on the defendant but also reduces the standard of proof for the prosecution to the balance of probabilities must be wrong.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000208"></a>All these are arguments that have been to some extent rehearsed in another place, and it was the Minister's response to those arguments there that have spurred me to bring this issue back for scrutiny in Committee. The Minister's justification for the level of proof was inadequate. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07032291000359"></a>&#147;no offence would be committed unless it could be proved that the offender either knew they were disclosing information supplied under clause 1 without lawful authority or was reckless in doing so&#151;in other words, they took an unjustified risk&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Public Bill Committee, 16/1/07; col. 31.]</ul>
<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000209"></a>The offence carries a possible prison term of two years, or the maximum statutory fine. Those are serious punishments. The Minister knows that I have reservations about the distribution of information but the release of information should not be compensated for by abandoning important legal principles. Noble Lords will be familiar with the description by the sometime Lord Chancellor, Lord Sankey, of the presumption of innocence as the &#147;golden thread&#148; running through the British legal system. I hope that the Minister will be able to take away our amendment and come back with government suggestions at report. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000210"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07032291000441"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> I have a certain sense of d&#233;j -vu about debating the burden of proof with the Minister. I must say from the outset that although we have tabled an amendment later on in the Bill, the noble Lord, Lord Howard, has restated the classical reversal of the burden of proof and put it down in a well drafted amendment.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000211"></a>I do not really understand why there is any justification for reversing the burden of proof. It seems to be a popular thing for the department to do nowadays. In the London Olympics Bill, the department was forced, quite rightly, to retreat from that issue, because it soon became apparent when we subjected the clause to scrutiny that there was no particularly good reason why the burden should be reversed. In the case of that Bill it was the London association right. In this case, as the noble Lord, Lord Howard, has frankly stated, disclosing information is something that we do not wish to see happen and there should be a penalty, but the issue is how draconian you can be in expecting someone to prove themselves innocent under Clause 5 before they escape the net, so to speak. As the burden of proof operates in the clause as it stands, they are guilty until they can prove themselves innocent. That, by any standard, is a very tall order, and it is particularly difficult taking into account the way that the defence in subsection (5) is drafted.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000212"></a>I fully support the amendment. I think that the Minister has a long way to go, and I certainly saw nothing in the arguments put forward in the other place to justify a reversal. I look forward to seeing whether the Minister can come up with some fresh arguments in this area.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000213"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0004.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="07032291000442"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> That is an unlikely occurrence, given past efforts in this respect. If there is a problem with offences under Clause 3(1), there is a problem with offences under Clause 3(2) as well, so I am somewhat surprised that attention has been drawn to the offences under subsection (1) but not to those under subsection (2). If we are to debate this issue any further, I hope that at least an amendment will be tabled to cover both.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0004.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000214"></a>There does not seem to be any logic in the Opposition&#146;s contention that we will have an extremely principled argument about the law in respect of this matter but that we will gloss over the offences in Clause 3(2). I think that the Opposition always put forward highly principled arguments&#151;it would be beneath them not to do so&#151;but I think they just happen to be wrong in this respect.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70322-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000215"></a>It is not the case that we are reversing the law of the land and that the presumption of innocence will be thrown away by the proposals in these subsections of Clause 3. The presumption of innocence is absolutely central to our criminal law and it is also enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, so the department will not disregard it lightly. In fact, that presumption underpins the offences in Clause 3, and I include all the offences there.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000216"></a>In a case of alleged unauthorised disclosure, it will be for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt: that a disclosure of information took place; that it was made without lawful authority; that it was not a disclosure falling within subsection (4)&#151;a disclosure of information already in the public domain, for example; that the information had been supplied originally to a relevant person under Clause 1 of the Bill; that the defendant falls into one of the classes of person who can be prosecuted for the offence&#151;a &#147;relevant person&#148;, for example, or an employee of a relevant person; and that the defendant made the disclosure. So there is no change in British law there, and the prosecution has to prove that before it can secure a conviction.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000217"></a>What is different is that subsection (5) then comes into play. It is open to the defendant to prove&#151;to the lesser standard of the balance of probabilities&#151;that, in short, he or she made an honest and reasonable mistake. Noble Lords who proposed these amendments say that it should be for the prosecution to prove that the defendant did not make such a mistake&#151;in short, that the defendant was culpable to a degree that makes it right to convict him with a criminal offence. That would put subsection (5) on the same footing as the matters mentioned in subsections (1), (2) and (4).</p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000218"></a>We do not agree with that contention. The Bill requires only that the defendant should prove that it is more likely than not that certain extenuating circumstances applied; then he will be entitled to be acquitted. Those are circumstances which the defendant will be in the best position to know about&#151;perhaps only the defendant will know about them. Those matters relate to his state of mind, or, more precisely, to what the defendant knew or believed at the time of the offence, and the factual circumstances surrounding the offence that made it reasonable for him to have that state of mind. Perhaps, for example, the defendant had been told mistakenly by a manager that it would be within the scope of his job to disclose the information, or perhaps he thought he had seen the information in question published in a local newspaper, or that the person concerned had consented to the disclosure of the information.</p>
<h5><a name="07032291000368"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000219"></a>If those mistaken views were honestly and reasonably held, then the defendant should be acquitted. But to ask the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that they were not so held would place an unreasonable burden on the prosecution. It would make prosecutions too difficult to bring, and acquittals too easy. The deterrent effect of Clause 3 about important information&#151;and to which we attach great importance&#151;would be lost, and the security of citizens&#146; personal data correspondingly weakened and jeopardised. This is not a unique provision. We need look no further than Section 123 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992&#151;with which at least one noble Lord opposite is probably much more familiar than myself&#151;which makes similar provision in relation to social security information in the hands of the DWP.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000220"></a>I emphasise that we are not changing the burden of proof. We are not making a presumption of guilt, with the defendant having to prove their innocence. We are saying that, in an area where difficult judgments must be made on how the balance should be struck in the operation of the law, it is unreasonable for the prosecution&#146;s case to have to stand on their being able to prove the state of mind of the individual committing the offence, rather than establishing that the offence has been committed.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000221"></a>We are not offending against the presumption of innocence. We are merely saying that this is the nature of the offence. If an individual is guilty of the offence, a breach of the law has occurred. The Opposition&#146;s amendments propose an extra burden of proof which we reject. That is why we hope the amendment will be withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000222"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07032291000443"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Howard, will forgive me for intervening. The Minister made as good a fist of it as he could, but his arguments are pretty thin, talking about good old British law and so on.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000223"></a>The fact is that once the disclosure has been established as having been made by the individual, the onus is on them to use the defences set out in subsection (5) and so on. That is the point at which the onus changes. The Minister is not at all correct in saying that this is the classical situation; indeed, entirely the reverse. It is all very well to say that Clause 3(2) also creates an offence, but if the Minister accepted the wording of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Howard, for Clause 3(1), it would also be appropriate to insert it into Clause 3(2). So that is not an argument.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000224"></a>What distinguishes this from theft, burglary, assault and heaven knows what else&#151;ordinary criminal charges with the ordinary onus of proof&#151;is inference from behaviour and conduct, which is how it is done in criminal law. It is not particularly difficult to infer from somebody&#146;s conduct or behaviour whether they had knowledge or belief. Evidence is called and convictions are upheld every single day. It seems a particularly lazy way of drafting a Bill in these circumstances, where a particular defence having to overturn the inference of guilt is inserted into a clause like this.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000231"></a>This is intended to be a halfway house, so that the defence is more easily available when the burden of proof effectively remains the same, but belief is more easily established. I am sure that the Minister has looked at this long and hard, and perhaps he thinks that this is preferable to completely reversing the burden of proof. It does not go right back to the classical situation of mens rea in terms of knowledge, intent or recklessness, but it would change the way in which subsection (5) operates.</p>

After serious consideration in the department and in the other place, and very serious consideration when I responded in terms of principle a few moments ago, I have been invited to change my mind. I have not done so. I recognise that the noble Lord holds no responsibility for any previous legislation. I have been unable to go back to 1916 or earlier for my illustration, but I have given the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, a reference to legislation passed in 1992, before this Administration came into power. Exactly the same concept was employed with regard to an Act of Parliament on social security. Others, besides me and my colleagues, fought through these issues and reached the same judgment on where the balance should be struck with regard to the offence. I have not changed my mind, despite the blandishments of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, who tried his hardest to win me over five minutes after I had rejected the concept. He has not succeeded, and I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000238"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment intended to clarify the function of paragraph (b). I would be grateful if the Minister could indicate under what circumstances he would expect information to be released under a court order or other enactment. While paragraph (b) looks like a standard component of legislation, in the context of information-sharing, it is important to clarify on the record in what instances information could be shared other than as set out in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

The purpose is quite straightforward. There are no hidden meanings attached to Clause 3(6)(b). Its purpose is to make clear to the relevant person&#151;the scheme operator, in other words&#151;that information provided in accordance with a court order or enactment constitutes lawful disclosure. It just makes that clear; that is all the paragraph does. Without it, whether the disclosure was lawful might depend upon individual circumstances. Having an express provision in the legislation makes it absolutely clear and helps the scheme operator understand its obligations.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000240"></a>The noble Lord asked for examples of when a court might require the scheme to disclose information. That largely misses the point. The provision is not to indicate how a court might place a requirement on the scheme, but to give a lawful defence for compliance with any such court order. It is as straightforward as that, and I hope the noble Lord will think that his probe has struck home.</p>

The amendment responded to representations made by the digital switchover consumer expert group and to amendments tabled by Opposition Members. The definition of &#147;local authority&#148; did not reflect the variety of local authorities in England that might hold information on blind and partially sighted individuals. In particular, it could be read as excluding 33 metropolitan borough councils in England. A similar amendment was needed to similar provisions contained in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill. The amendment corrects that drafting defect and ensures that the powers will enable information about registered blind and partially sighted people to be shared with a help scheme. I commend the amendment to your Lordships and I beg to move.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000340"></a> Clause 5, page 4, line 40, at end insert &#147;, whether by digital terrestrial, digital satellite, digital cable or any other platform and regardless of provider&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000249"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment makes clear that no preference is to be given to any particular type of platform and that full information on all providers and facilities will be made available. This relates to the earlier comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. It is a permissive amendment in that it does not restrict or prescribe the use of any particular platform in any particular concentration. I note that, when colleagues in another place sought to amend the Bill in the same vein, the Minister rejected their amendment on the basis that altering the definition of the help scheme would not contribute to digital switchover in the wider context.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000250"></a>The Minister in another place made it clear that his resistance to the amendment was because:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000341"></a>&#147;It is neither workable nor practicable to amend the definition by placing substantive conditions on the way in which the scheme operates&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Standing Committee, 16/01/07; col. 40.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032291000317"></a>In the light of that, Amendment No. 25 seeks to amend the Bill in terms of the wider definition of digital switchover. The amendment would serve to underpin the Government&#146;s commitment to platform neutrality, as set out in the help scheme document published by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and deposited in the Library before Christmas. </p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000251"></a>This is an important amendment. The wide choice of digital television platforms is a great asset to broadcasting and represents a welcome departure from just one analogue spectrum. It is important that information on all providers is widely distributed so that those whom the Bill is trying to assist are able to choose what they want in the full knowledge of what is available. I doubt that outside this Committee many people would be able to list all the providers available&#151;from the well known Freeview, as provided on the digital terrestrial television platform, to lesser-known providers such as Homechoice on the digital subscriber line and the various operators on Sky and cable.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000252"></a>The amendment will send out a message to whoever runs the digital help scheme that platform neutrality is properly endorsed by the Government. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000253"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07032291000453"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> I support in principle what the noble Lord, Lord Howard, has put forward. In a way, it is rather surprising that this definition does not appear in the Bill, or at least in the description in the help scheme, because, in a sense, it has been implicit in everything that Ministers have said, especially with regard to issues relating to partially sighted people and so on. It seems to me that such a definition would be a useful signpost, and it would be beneficial to make it explicit, rather than having to look at the no doubt wise words of Ministers in Committee in the House of Lords. It would be useful to have it in the Bill, and therefore I consider the amendment very sensible.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000254"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07032291000454"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> The simple fact is that in principle there is absolutely no disagreement between us in what we seek to see occur and in what I confidently forecast will occur. The difference seems to be that noble Lords opposite will be reassured only if something is included in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000255"></a>The Bill is about the digital switchover help scheme, and the definition of the scheme in the Bill is just that&#151;it is a definition. It is used to define switchover help functions, for which purpose the DWP and others can disclose the necessary information.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000256"></a>The current wording is neutral on the form in which digital broadcast takes place, and that is why there is no need for amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, in his extremely generous way, freely admitted that the Government seem to be thinking in that way, but, in fact, that is how we are acting. One obvious illustration is that, when it looked as though some planning rules were not platform-neutral because they might have raised difficulties for certain forms of broadcasting with regard to satellite dishes, we set about relaxing the rules to ensure that any such disadvantage did not obtain. So I give to the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, every reassurance that, as our White Paper says, the Government will continue to be platform-neutral in their public policy. That underpins what we are about, even in this modest little Bill.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000257"></a>I am resisting an inappropriate and entirely unnecessary amendment. We are already acting, and have acted, completely consonant with the objective, as the noble Lord enjoins us to do. Therefore, there is no difference on principle; merely, it is our view that the amendments are redundant and unnecessary, which I hope the noble Lord will think too.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000258"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0005.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07032291000455"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> I thank the Minister. Help can mean providing full information to assist people. All the amendment does is underline that. If the Minister is in such agreement, it is difficult to understand why he cannot include this modest wording in the Bill. In practice, the provision of help is being given to the BBC, which would not be human if it did not occasionally think, &#147;Well, why should we be giving out too much to help our competition?&#148;. That is why the maximum amount of clarity is desirable in the Bill. I hope that the Minister will come around to my way of thinking.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000259"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0005.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07032291000456"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> The significant actor on this scene is Digital UK, which has worked closely with all platforms and comes to a consensual approach in describing the different platforms which it obviously is obliged to do. This is of course difficult. Digital UK should be congratulated on the skilful way in which it has managed this. It will be responsible for the generic scheme communications and will have to abide by platform-neutrality issues. It has made enormous strides in reassuring all parties that it is working successfully towards this objective and is further proof that absolutely everyone recognises the principle on which the Government are working and on which all others seeking to achieve this objective on successful switchover should work. That is why the noble Lord should be generous and withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000347"></a>(4) In this section &#147;the prescribed period&#148; means the period beginning with the day on which section 1 comes into force and ending one month after the completion of the digital switchover help scheme in the United Kingdom.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000264"></a>The noble Lord said: There has been much discussion here and in another place about including a sunset clause. The argument was rejected on the grounds that powers granted in the Bill exist only until switchover has been completed and, therefore, will automatically cease. Yet again, we wonder why Her Majesty's Government are reluctant to put things in the Bill. The amendment incorporates the principles that have come out of debate in another place. The heart of the amendment lies in subsections (2) and (4), which would ensure that when the switchover help scheme has ended&#151;up to a month after the digital switchover, according to the Government&#146;s guidance&#151;the power to have access to and share information would cease. The amendment includes a commencement provision in subsection (1). The Secretary of State could fulfil the Government&#146;s wish to link the powers directly to the event of digital switchover by laying an order that would commence the Bill at an appropriate time. In practice, that would need to be quite soon after the passage of the Bill if adequate provision is to be made for Whitehaven.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000265"></a>Subsection (3) of the amendment is important. It includes a provision that the information shall be disposed of after the switchover has been completed. It will help to avoid abuse and, as the information is no longer required, should not be any impediment to a smooth switchover. We have the opportunity to set two important precedents; that is, a parliamentary precedent that clears the statute book of legislation that has served its purpose. Following on from that, we have a security precedent that shows that, while government may need access to personal data for beneficial reasons, they take seriously the importance of that data and will cease access once the data have served their purpose.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0005.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000266"></a>The amendment matches the flexibility of the scheme with the flexibility of the supporting legislation. For as long as it takes to implement digital switchover, which may, as the Minister in another place acknowledged, take longer than advertised, the legislation to enable the help scheme will remain on the statute book, yet the information, having served its purpose, will be afforded the greatest possible protection. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000267"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0005.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="07032291000459"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> Just to be helpful to the Minister, there is a choice of sunset clauses on offer. I am sure that he is tempted by both of them. The noble Lord, Lord Howard, made all the arguments in favour of sunset clauses. Our amendment has the benefit of simplicity. But in many of his utterances on the Bill, the Minister is resisting amendments and seems to be saying, &#147;We are doing it anyway so why do we need it on the face of the Bill?&#148; That seems to have been the line taken in the other place. Perhaps the real reason is that these amendments were not invented here. I suspect that the Government think the Bill is so finely crafted already that it is not capable of further improvement. That is probably the line being taken.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70322-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000268"></a>However, the Bill certainly is capable of further improvement and sensitive data are involved. A hulk will be left behind on the statute book after the switchover. The Secretary of State said that there is effectively a sunset clause because it will be operated once switchover is completed in 2012, which must be the Tyne Tees and Ulster switchover. But I seriously suggest to the Minister that there is a cut-off point and that the Bill is taken off the statute book at a particular time. These are important powers of disclosure and it should be explicit that they come to an end. I hope that the Minister will consider either the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Howard, or our own humble amendment favourably.</p>

It would be reassuring for all concerned if there were something rather more specific in the Bill, as other Members of the Committee have said. Delicate and sensitive areas of information are involved and people would be reassured if they knew that there was a definite date for removing data.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000270"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07032291000461"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> Let me begin by reassuring the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that we would never be so arrogant as to suggest that a Bill we introduced was absolutely perfect. As proof, with regard to this particular Bill, he will know that we accepted some opposition amendments in another place. Improvements have been effected. We approach all our work with undue modesty. That does not mean that I will accept every amendment that is tabled and I am not going to accept either of these, largely because it obviates me from the obnoxious choice of which amendment I would accept.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000271"></a>We are a little early, so the Committee will not mind if I digress momentarily. The other day, when the Government sustained a defeat on yet another amendment that asked for an annual report to be inserted in legislation, the Chief Whip told me that he would be very happy if I gave him a pound for every time such an amendment was proposed. I replied that I would happily do that provided he gave me a pound for every amendment that recommended a sunset clause&#151;knowing full well that with the digital switchover Bill I had two, so I was already in profit for the week. That does not make the concept any more attractive, however.</p>
<h5><a name="07032291000370"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000272"></a>Let us be clear: the objective of the Bill is to ensure that the help scheme gets the information it needs when it needs it; no more, no less. We should reflect, after all, on what Clause 1(1) says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000348"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State and the Northern Ireland department may... supply a relevant person with social security information for use... in connection with switchover help functions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032291000318"></a>That is the legal basis the Bill creates by which they can deliver such information. Once the help scheme has completed its task, the legislative basis for using the information, and therefore for the DWP or anyone else disclosing it, vanishes. Drafting the powers to link them directly to the event of digital switchover&#151;a time-limited event&#151;therefore has the same practical effect as a formal sunset clause. We already have it; the right to obtain or disclose the information dies with the completion of the function. Once switchover is complete and the help scheme has done its job, the DWP, the MoD and the other agencies will no longer be able to lawfully disclose such information.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000273"></a>Once again, we are not disagreeing about principle. Both noble Lords opposite and the Government want to be absolutely secure in understanding that, once the process has ended, disclosure of information must also come to an end. I am glad to give the assurance that there are no plans for the help scheme to continue, or for the powers to be exercised, after switchover has been completed and no more help needs to be delivered.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000274"></a>I emphasise that the problem with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, the first amendment tabled this afternoon, is that it contains a requirement for information to be destroyed one month after the switchover help scheme has been completed. That is an obligation anyway. The fifth data protection principle in Schedule 1 to the Data Protection Act 1998 is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000349"></a>&#147;Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032291000319"></a>The Data Protection Act is essentially the bedrock by which data protection in this country obtains. All data controllers must abide by those principles. If we made a specific provision for data destruction in the Bill, would we not be calling the effectiveness of the Data Protection Act&#151;the guarantee for citizens across the board that data cannot be kept or used when it no longer has a purpose&#151;into question?</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000275"></a>The Bill did not start out perfectly but, thanks to its consideration, we have made improvements. These amendments are not improvements, and I invite the noble Lord to consider withdrawing them.</p>

This is especially relevant if the amendments to introduce overseeing the operation by the National Audit Office are rejected.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000281"></a>Despite the fact that the Bill introduces a new office to deter malpractice among those who have access to the information, there is no system of accountability for the help scheme as a whole, despite the cost of the scheme being estimated at &#163;600 million.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000282"></a>Owing to the narrow scope of the Bill, it proved impossible to table an amendment requesting a yearly report on the whole digital switchover scheme. The amendment is therefore a probing one; it cannot go as far as I would like, but I hope that it will provide the Minister with some food for thought, so that he will come back with a proposal at Report on some method of ensuring greater accountability of how the help scheme works, either by this method or by use of the NAO. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000283"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07032291000464"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> I understand and support the reasoning behind the amendment. However, for the reasons I shall give, I believe that the amendment is not necessary.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000284"></a>It is our intention that the digital switchover should be established under the BBC charter and agreement. Clause 39 of the agreement says that the BBC must comply with a help scheme agreed with the Secretary of State. Once a scheme has been established under the agreement, I readily accept that it is very important that the BBC, in the form of the trust, should report on the operation of the help scheme.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000285"></a>That is why clause 41 of the agreement deals with annual progress reports and provides that the trust must provide the Secretary of State with an annual report on what the BBC has done in respect of the help scheme, and indeed all its activities in respect of digital switchover.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000286"></a>It is our intention that this report should be laid before Parliament as a matter of course. While I sympathise with the intention behind the amendment, I suggest that the provisions of the BBC charter and agreement make it unnecessary.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000287"></a>We also believe that as a matter of policy and good law making, it is not desirable to include in statute provisions that are unnecessary or otiose. Apart from anything else, it would imply that the provisions of the charter and agreement are not binding on the BBC, and consequently call into question the nature of all the other requirements in the charter and agreement. That would not be helpful.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000288"></a>I hope that the noble Lord has been reassured by what I say, and I should be grateful if he would withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000289"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07032291000465"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> I thank the Minister for his remarks. I am not entirely reassured&#151;but partly. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000290"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000291"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07032291000466"></a>Lord Clement-Jones</b> moved Amendment No. 28:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000353"></a> After Clause 5 , insert the following new Clause&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000354"></a>&#147;Commencement</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032291000355"></a>This Act shall not come into force before the digital switchover scheme is published and laid before both Houses of Parliament.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000292"></a>The noble Lord said: I realise that the Minister has not been very sympathetic to sunset clauses, but I hope that he will be entirely sympathetic to a sunrise clause.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000293"></a>The amendment reflects the uncertainty surrounding the scheme, which has been debated and discussed throughout today. It has been interesting to see how much the interventions of Members of the Committee such as the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and those on the Opposition Benches, have uncovered how little we know about much of this scheme&#151;not only its essence but its costs. This extends to looking not only at the costs of the scheme and specification of equipment. The Minister talked about the possible narrowing of the required information, so even the exact extent of the information is not known. The agreement between the Secretary of State and the BBC under clause 39 has clearly not yet been agreed or promulgated. We do not know which organisation will be running the scheme&#151;the scheme contractor. Will it be a hybrid, a joint venture or outsourced from the BBC?</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000294"></a>There are a number of imponderables. One of the Bill&#146;s problems is that it just provides a framework. We know a little about the help scheme from the website, but we do not know enough to make a judgment on the Bill as a whole. Either the Government come forward with more detail at this stage so that the Bill can move forward&#151;that would be my preference&#151;or we must put something in the Bill to give us the opportunity to discuss the full scheme at a future date. That is a less preferable way of going forward, but if details of the scheme are not available now, it seems the only course. Otherwise we do not have an understanding of the detail when we debate this Bill.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000295"></a>We are in a difficult position. The sunrise clause is designed to stop the Act coming into force until we have had a proper debate about the scheme. If the Minister can reassure us that we will get full details by Report stage, for instance, we would be satisfied. Ministers have certainly not held out any prospect of that today, however. In a sense, this amendment therefore sums up a lot of the sentiment around the Committee today. We need to know more before we can make a proper judgment. This is a skeleton on which to hang a scheme, not the scheme itself. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000296"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07032291000467"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> I support my noble friend&#146;s amendment. There is a painful lack of detail on how the scheme will operate. If Her Majesty&#146;s Government intend to have a switchover in Whitehaven on 17 October, they must surely be able to provide those details by now. If they cannot, it is difficult to see how they will get Whitehaven up and running by the required date. If they have the details then, as my noble friend has suggested, they should provide them to us.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000297"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0006.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07032291000468"></a>The Lord Bishop of Manchester:</b> I add my support to the amendment. The same thread has become evident at various points throughout this afternoon. It is precisely as has been said: we are left not knowing quite where to go because the amount of information required for us to be able to understand the scheme&#151;and therefore some of the problems that the Government say they wish to avoid, to protect vulnerable people&#151;will not be made available for some reason. That is unsatisfactory, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, is right to say that every part of the Committee represented here this afternoon has expressed that concern.</p>
<h5><a name="07032291000371"></a>5 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07032291000298"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07032291000469"></a>Baroness Howe of Idlicote:</b> I, too, support the amendment. One problem is that so little is known in either House about what is going on. The awareness that this is outwith the parliamentary process and that decisions are made behind closed doors has a disquieting effect on Members of both Houses, who feel that they should be safeguarding what will be required as a result of this digital switchover. If nothing else, can we have rather more reassurance from the Minister that more information will soon be available about what is going to happen and when? I do mean soon.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000299"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07032291000470"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> The noble Baroness is always sweet reasonableness. If I could take &#147;soon&#148; as the definition of when it would be available, I would be reasonably happy. I recognise the understandable concern expressed by all parts of the Committee about this issue. It is clear that we would like to be further advanced than we are. There have been some difficulties. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State made clear in another place on 18 January that we expect the BBC to lead the delivery of the help scheme. However, the Government will have a continuing responsibility for setting the policy, including helping with procurement and determining eligibility for the scheme. That will be reflected in the scheme agreement that is currently being finalised with the BBC.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000300"></a>I would have preferred to have been able to say that the scheme has been finalised. There has been delay, which reflects the fact that there have been substantial changes at the BBC. When the new board of governors was succeeded on 1 January by the trustees, eight of the 11 trustees were new and were not party to previous deliberations with the Government. It is not surprising that they wanted to consider the issue and reach a view on the detailed terms of the agreement. Now that the overall licence fee settlement has been determined, we are able to discuss detailed governance arrangements with the BBC Trust and the Executive Board. We will conclude those discussions very shortly and see the emergence of the scheme.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000301"></a>It is right that we are pressed on this matter. I cannot give a specific date, but if the noble Baroness's request for &#147;soon&#148; is my interpretation of &#147;weeks not months&#148;, then we are at one. If by &#147;soon&#148; she means &#147;next week&#148;, we have cause for some disagreement. I want to assure the Committee that we recognise the proper anxiety about this. We are eager to see the scheme published. We have made considerable progress and we are working closely with the BBC team to develop the procurement strategy. On behalf of the DCMS and the BBC, we issued a notice in the official journal of the European Union seeking a potential scheme operator. A briefing session has been held and a long-list of potential bidders drawn up. The aim is for the main contractor to be let by the end of the year.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000302"></a>The grass is not growing under the Government's feet. After all, Whitehaven is not too far away from us in terms of date, although a little further away in location, and we intend to meet that date. This scheme has to be in place before then.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000303"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0006.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07032291000471"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> Perhaps the Minister could interpret &#147;soon&#148; as &#147;before the next stage of the Bill&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000304"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0006.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07032291000472"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> As noble Lords will know, I am always eager to treat all aspects of, and consideration on, Bills in which I am involved as the top priority, and I am working with expedition to ensure that we deal with this Bill as expeditiously as possible. That means that I cannot meet the noble Lord&#146;s request. However, it will be recognised that the Government have a clear objective with regard to the passage of this Bill because we are aware of the significance of Royal Assent in relation to setting up the scheme. By the same token, we cannot reach that end date and not meet the obvious expectation in all parts of this House and another place that the nature of the scheme will be published and clear.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000305"></a>There are dual objectives to be arrived at as rapidly as possible. Far from the Government showing lethargy in this respect, quite the opposite is true. We have our foot down as hard on the accelerator pedal as is legitimate in terms of speed, but we have some constraints. As I have said, there are other significant actors in this situation and there are reasons for some slight delay, so we are a little further from the end than we would have wished. In general, I hope that the Committee will recognise that, in pressing this issue today, the noble Lord is pressing at an open door with regard to what we want to achieve. I hope that he will think the amendment is unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="07032291000306"></a><b><a name="70322-gc0006.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07032291000473"></a>Lord Clement-Jones:</b> I thank the Minister for that reply. I thought that at one stage he was going to say not &#147;open door&#148; but &#147;open wound&#148;. Clearly he is impatient, and I can tell that he is in a bit of a Catch-22 situation because, for business reasons, it is important to get Bills through, but we really have to see the scheme before the parliamentary process is complete. It would be completely wrong for us not to consider that before the next stage of the Bill. I thought that the suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord Howard, was a good one, because we want to see the emergence of the scheme before the parliamentary process is through.</p>

<a name="70322-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07032291000307"></a>That said, I can see that the Minister is in difficulty and that he will be cracking a very firm whip&#151;and no doubt the Secretary of State will do likewise. The best thing that I can do is to help the Committee to terminate its proceedings so that officials can get on with putting the scheme together. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="07032273000010"></a><b><a name="70322-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07032273000066"></a>The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor (Lord Falconer of Thoroton):</b> I am pleased to inform the House that I have today laid before Parliament and placed in the Libraries of both Houses the responses to the Government&#146;s <I>Confidence and Confidentiality: Improving Transparency and Privacy in Family Courts</I> consultation paper, which was published on 11 July 2006. The document is available on the department's website at www.dca.gov.uk/consult/confr.htm. We will also be publishing a young people&#146;s guide.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="07032273000013"></a><b><a name="70322-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07032273000067"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07032273000014"></a>The House will recall the extensive discussion in the Crossrail instruction debate on 31 October about a station at Woolwich, adding &#163;186 million to the cost of the scheme. This could simply not be afforded given the scale of the overall funding challenge. I said then, however, that I was willing to give Cross London Rail Links Ltd, the Crossrail company, the time needed to explore with others, including the London borough of Greenwich, whether there was a way of significantly reducing that cost.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07032273000015"></a>I am pleased today to inform the House of important developments that point a way forward.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="07032273000016"></a>The key to this has been Greenwich Council's recent proposal for a major revision of its spatial plan, to allow a significantly higher density of development at Woolwich. This, in turn, has prompted Berkeley Homes to offer a means of enabling a station to be built at Woolwich but, crucially, without adding to the current cost of Crossrail.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="07032273000017"></a>In the light of this, agreement has been reached in principle with Berkeley Homes under which it will build the basic box structure of a station at Woolwich and then construct its own development overhead. This will all be done at its own risk, using its own money, to the specification laid down by CLRL, with a payment back to Berkeley Homes of the saving CLRL will make through avoiding other works at Woolwich, when it constructs the line there.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="07032273000018"></a>In due course, Berkeley Homes would then arrange for the completion of the station box to full operational status. Both Berkeley Homes and Greenwich Council recognise that the completion of the station would be conditional on receiving sufficient funding contributions from the developers and businesses that stand to benefit from a Crossrail station at Woolwich. The contributions would be in addition to any London-wide Crossrail funding arrangements that may be agreed, and no additional public sector debt capacity would be made available. Fit-out of the station could take place only once sufficient private sector contributions had been received.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="07032273000019"></a>More work needs to be done to flesh out this deal, but the House can now have sufficient confidence that Berkeley Homes and Greenwich Council have the commitment and the right incentives to do that. This is a very significant change from the position last October, as there is now a clear way forward to deliver a station at Woolwich without adding to the costs of Crossrail already identified.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="07032273000020"></a>On this basis I am now able to table an amendment to the Bill to provide powers for the station. In due course, the House will be invited to agree a further instruction to the Committee in respect of Woolwich. </p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_head2"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="07032273000004"></a>Education: Post-16</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="07032273000021"></a><b><a name="70322-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07032273000068"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills (Lord Adonis):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Alan Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="07032273000022"></a>I have today laid before the House a Green Paper, <I>Raising Expectations: Staying in Education and Training Post-16</I>, which sets out the Government's proposals that young people should continue to participate in some form of education or training until the age of 18.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="07032273000023"></a>The Green Paper sets out proposals to raise the aspirations of young people and to galvanise the entire education system to offer them more, so that they are able to stay on and achieve success. The benefits to young people, the economy and society will be significant. For young people, participating in education and training for longer and achieving more will lead to better outcomes: improved job prospects, higher earnings and better health. Employers know that, as the skills of employees improve, their workforce becomes more productive.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="07032273000024"></a>These proposals have a long history. Both the 1918 and 1944 Education Acts sought to keep young people learning up to age 18, though these provisions were never successfully implemented. It has now been 35 years since the last change in the leaving age, 35 years in which the UK has been transformed technologically, economically and socially. There are many fewer unskilled jobs; a 16 year-old leaving school with no qualifications today is not prepared for the economy and society they are entering. As the Leitch review of skills highlights, the challenges of globalisation mean that British businesses will need ever more skilled employees to remain competitive.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="07032273000025"></a>We already recognise this need for improved skills. We are already committed to making sure that 90 per cent of 17 year-olds will participate in education or training by 2015. This is a challenging target that we are confident we will meet, and it will represent a real improvement on the current participation rate in England of 76 per cent; yet it will still not be enough to pull us into the top tier internationally. The current UK participation rate places us 20th out of 30 OECD countries. Even an improvement to 90 per cent would only place us around 10th, and that assumes that other countries make no progress. So we need to move beyond 90 per cent participation to compete globally, but also for reasons of social justice. If 10 per cent of young people do not participate, there is a risk that those young people with lower aspirations, who perhaps come from families and communities who have themselves had a poor experience of schooling, will miss out as participation increases. Within this group are often the young people who would have most to gain from longer participation and higher attainment. We cannot allow the most disadvantaged to miss out.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="07032273000026"></a>To ensure that all young people benefit, <I>Raising Expectations </I>sets out a central proposal that we will consult on:</p>
that from 2015 young people should remain in education or training at least until their 18th birthday;that this education or training could be in a school, college, with a work-based learning provider, or as part of a job; and that it should be full time, or part time if a young person is in full-time employment.
<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="07032273000028"></a>To fully realise the benefits, participation must lead to attainment. To ensure that this happens, we will need:</p>
engaging routes for everyone;the right support to enable every young person to participate, whatever their circumstances;engagement from employers to offer high-quality work-based training opportunities; and the means of making sure everyone benefits.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="07032273000029"></a>The central proposal recognises that different routes will work better for different young people. That is why <I>Raising Expectations</I> does not simply propose to raise the school leaving age; rather, it proposes that young people should be able to choose the route that best suits them: this could be in school, college or at work, working towards general qualifications, one of the new diplomas or an apprenticeship. This range of provision and flexibility of approach will be critical to ensure that there is a suitable and attractive route for every young person. It will also mean that young people can choose to work alongside learning if they want to. We are already committed, as part of the programme of reforms detailed in the 2005 <I>14-19 Education and Skills</I> White Paper, to expand the curriculum options available to young people and do not seek to raise the participation age until that is done. This means waiting until 2013, when the national entitlement to diplomas will see all 14 diploma lines available across England and the apprenticeship entitlement will be in place, so that every young person who is ready to and who wants to take an apprenticeship will be able to do so. The Green Paper proposes to raise the participation age to 17 from September 2013 and to 18 from September 2015.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="07032273000030"></a><I>Raising Expectations</I> sets out the Government's commitment to ensure that every young person is given the appropriate information, advice and guidance, and the right financial and other support to ensure that they can access the right programme of study to suit their needs and aspirations. It also sets out ways in which the Government will continue to encourage employers to provide valuable training opportunities for young people who want to work as they learn. These include increasing the number of apprenticeships available, utilising train-to-gain brokers to help employers find a training opportunity that meets a business need and improving the accreditation system so that all substantial and good-quality employer training is recognised.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="07032273000031"></a><I>Raising Expectations</I> is predicated on a solid foundation of good economic sense and strong social justice. It recognises the challenges of implementation and sets out how we propose to meet these challenges. In doing so, it sets out a clear vision of how all young people can benefit from longer participation and higher attainment and how society and the economy will benefit in turn.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="07032273000034"></a><b><a name="70322-wms0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07032273000070"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Wales (Peter Hain) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="07032273000035"></a>I am delighted to inform the House that I have today, in my capacity as Secretary of State for Wales, undertaken my formal responsibility under the Government of Wales Act 2006 to make the new Standing Orders of the National Assembly for Wales. This gives full effect to the proposals unanimously agreed by the Assembly on 7 February.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="07032273000036"></a>The Government of Wales Act 2006 is the most important step forward for devolution since the establishment of the National Assembly for Wales in 1999. The Act puts Wales on a new constitutional footing and represents a landmark step in the growing strength, stature and self-confidence of the Assembly. </p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="07032273000037"></a>By granting enhanced legislative powers for Wales, the Act will enable the Assembly to deliver tailor-made policies for the people of Wales. By putting the possibility of primary powers on the statute book for the first time ever, subject to the approval of the people of Wales in a referendum, it will settle the constitutional status of the Assembly for a generation.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="07032273000038"></a>Since 17 May 2006 the Standing Orders Committee of the Assembly has been working to put in place a set of procedures that will enable the Assembly to take full advantage of the tremendous opportunities that the new powers in the Government of Wales Act provide. Unlike the Assembly&#146;s Standing Orders under the 1998 Act, these new procedures were developed in Wales, for Wales, by the elected representatives of the people of Wales.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="07032273000039"></a>I congratulate all sides of the Assembly on their work to establish the new procedures under which it will operate from May. It will be for the Members of the new National Assembly to make these Standing Orders work and to deliver a brighter future for the people of Wales.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="07032273000040"></a>Copies of the Standing Orders have been placed in the Library and the Vote Office. They are also available on the Wales Office website, www.walesoffice.gov.uk.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_head5"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="07032273000007"></a>Slavery: Bicentenary of Abolition</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="07032273000041"></a><b><a name="70322-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="07032273000071"></a>The Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos):</b> My right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister is today announcing the publication of the official government magazine to commemorate the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="07032273000042"></a>This year is the bicentenary of a remarkable piece of legislation: the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act 1807, which outlawed slave-carrying by British ships in the former British Empire.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="07032273000043"></a>Although slavery itself was not abolished until 1833, the Emancipation Act 1807 marked the beginning of the end for the transatlantic slave trade, which had seen more than 12 million men, women and children bought and sold into slavery and more than 2 million die.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="07032273000044"></a>The anniversary of the Act is a chance to look into the past, to remember a period of dreadful inhumanity and to pay tribute to the campaigners who fought this injustice and to those who enforced the new law, including the Royal Navy. It is also an opportunity to look forward and to recognise the tremendous contribution of black African and Caribbean communities not only to the success of this country but also to the vibrancy of our culture and heritage.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="07032273000045"></a>It is also an important opportunity to recognise the fact that slavery did not die out with the end of the transatlantic trade. There are an estimated 12.3 million enslaved people in the world today. In the 21st century, slavery persists in the form of human trafficking, bonded labour and the forced recruitment of child soldiers.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="07032273000046"></a>The Government want to ensure that we gain the best possible legacy from the bicentenary, so as part of our work to commemorate this anniversary and to focus attention on tackling contemporary or legacy issues that arise out of the slave trade I am pleased  to announce that we are today publishing a commemorative magazine to mark the bicentenary.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="07032273000047"></a>The magazine aims to inform the public about the slave trade, those who fought for its abolition and the subsequent emancipation process, and of work taking place to tackle discrimination in Britain and forms of slavery still present in the world today. Copies will be distributed to museums, libraries and local community organisations across the country over the next few days. Copies will also be sent to all MPs and Peers.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="07032273000048"></a>In the mean time further information about the bicentenary, including details of events all around the country to mark the anniversary, can be found at www.direct.gov.uk/slavery. Copies of the magazine will also be placed in the Library for the reference of noble Lords and made available in the Printed Paper Office.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="07032273000049"></a><b><a name="70322-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="07032273000072"></a>The Minister of State, Home Office (Baroness Scotland of Asthal):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (John Reid) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="07032273000050"></a>Section 14(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) requires me to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of every relevant three-month period on the exercise of the control order powers during that period.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="07032273000051"></a>The level of information provided will always be subject to slight variations based on operational advice and legal requirements.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="07032273000052"></a>Control orders continue to be an essential tool to protect the public from terrorism, particularly where it is not possible to prosecute individuals for terrorist-related activity and, in the case of foreign nationals, where they cannot be removed from the UK.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="07032273000053"></a>From 11 December 2006 to 10 March 2007 four new control orders were made. Three were made with the permission of the court under Section 3(1)(a) of the 2005 Act; two were served on British citizens&#151;one on 28 December 2006 and one on 3 January 2007&#151;and one was served on a foreign national on  9 March 2007. A control order was already in force at the beginning of this reporting period in relation to the foreign national; it was revoked and the new order made and served in its place.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="07032273000054"></a>The fourth control order was made using the urgency procedures under Section 3(1)(b) of the 2005 Act and was served on 16 February 2007. This replaced a control order on the same individual that was already in force at the beginning of this reporting period. The previous control order was revoked at the same time the new control order was served. The court confirmed the new control order on 21 February 2007. The revocation of the old order and service of the new control order was as a result of the High Court judgment of 16 February in the case of Secretary of State for the Home Department v E [2007] EWHC 233 (Admin). This was the third control order review hearing under Section 3(10) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 but the first hearing with full evidence about the factual issues of a case. The court accepted that the Secretary of State had reasonable grounds for suspecting that E was involved in terrorism-related activity. However, the court found that the control order obligations cumulatively amounted to a deprivation of E's liberty under Article 5(1) of the ECHR and that the Secretary of State's decision to maintain E's control order was flawed because he failed to review the prospects of prosecuting E in the light of certain Belgian judgments after they were received and translated. The control order was quashed on that basis. The full judgment is available via www.judiciary.gov.uk. The Secretary of State is appealing this judgment. Before making the new order against E, the Crown Prosecution Service reviewed the Belgian judgments referred to above and other recent material. The position remains that there is insufficient admissible evidence available to the police that could realistically be used for prosecuting him for an offence relating to terrorism. However, the position will be kept under review.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="07032273000055"></a>Two other control order review hearings have taken place pursuant to Section 3(10) of the 2005 Act. We await the outcome of both.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="07032273000056"></a>Two control orders on British citizens were renewed in accordance with Section 2(4)(b) of the 2005 Act and served on 22 February 2007.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="07032273000057"></a>No control orders have expired since the last report.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="07032273000058"></a>In total, therefore, 18 control orders are currently in force, nine of which are in respect of British citizens. Eight of the individuals live in the Metropolitan Police area; the rest fall within other police force areas.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="07032273000059"></a>During the period, one modification of control order obligations was made, three modification requests remain outstanding and 10 requests to modify a control order obligation were refused. A right of appeal exists in Section 10(3) of the 2005 Act against a decision by the Secretary of State not to modify an obligation contained in a control order. This has not yet been exercised in respect of these refusals. An appeal has been made in respect of a modification made during the previous quarter. In addition, an appeal has been considered as part of one of the control order review hearings; in the other control order review hearing that took place during the period there was no formal appeal against modifications refused, but the issues raised by the refusals were considered by the court.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="07032273000060"></a>Control order obligations are tailored to the individual concerned and based on the risk that that individual poses. Each control order is kept under review to ensure that their continuance and obligations remain necessary and proportionate. Specifically, as the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, recommended in his February 2006 report on the operation of the control order system, the Home Office has established a review group, with representation from law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to keep the obligations in every control order under regular (quarterly), formal and audited review.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="07032273000061"></a>Breaches of control orders could arise from any obligation and could include arriving home after commencement of a curfew period or breaking geographical boundary restrictions on movement. As reported in the additional Statement of 16 January 2007, an individual charged with breach of control order obligations during the period covered by the  11 December 2006 quarterly report was convicted in January of failure to comply with daily reporting requirements and failure to notify the Home Office of a change of residence. He was sentenced to five months&#146; imprisonment. This is the first conviction for an offence under the 2005 Act.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="07032273000062"></a>Also as reported on 16 January, another individual has been charged with failure to comply with control order obligations and is on remand in prison. The charges relate to failure to comply with curfew requirements and failure to comply with restrictions on communications. The individual mentioned in the 11 December report as having been charged with failure to comply with a daily reporting requirement but not failure to notify the Home Office of a change of residence has, since 16 January, been charged with additional offences of failure to comply with a daily reporting requirement and failure to notify the Home Office of a change of residence.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="07032273000063"></a>As Parliament will be aware, two of the 18 individuals subject to a control order absconded, one in September 2006 and one in January 2007. Details in relation to the January abscondment were given in the Statement of 16 January. Another individual absconded in August 2006 after a control order was made (i.e. signed) against that individual but before the order had been served. This order is therefore not in operation. I have been informed that the individual who absconded in August 2006 is believed to be abroad; the High Court has been notified of this. The individual in question has been excluded from the UK.</p>

<a name="70322-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="07032273000064"></a>On 29 January, the Appeal Committee of the House of Lords confirmed that the House of Lords will hear two appeals against judgments handed down by the Court of Appeal on 1 August 2006 in respect of control orders. The Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the Secretary of State in one case (Secretary of State for the Home Department v MB [2006] EWCA Civ 1140, an appeal in relation to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, on the right to a fair trial) and against the Secretary of State in the other case (Secretary of State for the  Home Department v JJ, KK GG, HH, NN &amp; LL [2006] EWCA Civ 1141, an appeal in relation to Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, on the right to liberty).</p>

<a name="70322-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="07032273000065"></a>Sections 1 to 9 of the 2005 Act are subject to annual renewal by Parliament. The draft renewal order for those sections of the Act was debated and approved by the House of Commons on 22 February and the House of Lords on 5 March. The Secretary of State subsequently signed the renewal order, so Sections 1 to 9 of the Act now continue in force until the end of 10 March 2008.</p>

The additional road safety benefits resulting from their inclusion would be likely to be outweighed by the costs&#151;both the test itself and the inconvenience to all by requiring such vehicles to travel to testing stations.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a><a name="07032278000036"></a>It is not possible to confirm what questions and response categories are to be included in the 2011 census until the consultation and testing programme is complete and formal approval is given by Parliament in 2010. It is apparent that demands for information from the census are greater than are likely to be able to be accommodated, and difficult trade-offs will need to be made. A White Paper setting out the Government's proposals, including the wording of any questions about ethnicity and language proficiency, is scheduled to be published in 2008.</p>

<a name="70322w0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a><a name="07032278000037"></a>You might like to know that, as part of the preparations for the 2011 census, ONS will be conducting a census test in May this year in areas within five local authorities in England and Wales. The questionnaire which will be used in the test was launched on 31 October and can be found on the National Statistics website at www.statistics.gov.uk/censustestquestionnaire.</p>

<a name="70322w0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a><a name="07032278000038"></a>The test questionnaire includes a question on ethnicity and a new question asking about proficiency in a number of languages. Some prior small-scale testing of the language question has, however, identified some problems and the quality of the information collected may be unacceptable. Analysis of the results of the main 2007 test and of further small-scale testing and consideration of other priorities for questions will inform the decision as to whether or not any information on languages will be collected in the 2011 census.</p>

<a name="70322w0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a><a name="07032278000039"></a>We are conducting a further consultation exercise on user needs for information on ethnicity, national identity, language and religion from the 2011 census in England and Wales. This focuses in particular on assessing public acceptability of the descriptions of the ethnic categories. The relevant documents are available on the National Statistics website. This consultation closes on 31 March 2007 (see www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/cn_155.asp).</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a><a name="07032278000057"></a>The DoVE project involves the scanning of 259 million civil registration records held by the General Register Office (GRO) and the data-capture of those records in order to create an electronic index of the scanned images. The records date from 1837 and cover all births, deaths, marriages and still births registered in England and Wales since that time.</p>

From April 2007 it is therefore intended to withdraw the sale of new CD-ROM and microfiche copies of the GRO index, and the RON index data for new registrations will be made available free of charge at the Family Records Centre in London from July 2007. The DoVE index date will start to be made available online, from early 2008, greatly increasing the number of people who have access to this information. It is expected that the DoVE project will be completed by 2009.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_553"></a><a name="07032278000618"></a>The projections are estimated by a different method from that used to obtain pension credit entitlement figures. The latter are taken from the DWP's dynamic microsimulation model Pensim2, which is particularly well suited to long-term projections of entitlement to income-related benefits. However, Pensim2 cannot currently be used to forecast entitlement to housing benefit. Entitlement to housing benefit has been derived using the policy simulation model, a robust but less complex model. Care should therefore be taken when interpreting these projections alongside those for pension credit.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_555"></a><a name="07032278000620"></a>1. These projections assume that housing benefit policies as they stand at 2007-08, the end of the current planning period, continue indefinitely.</p>

<a name="70322w0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_556"></a><a name="07032278000621"></a>2. The projections also take into account the reforms to the state pension system proposed in the Pensions Bill, which will affect pensioner housing benefit entitlement: continued earnings uprating of the standard guarantee credit; the savings credit maximum uprated by earnings from 2008 and then by prices from 2015; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; and measures to improve coverage of state pensions described in the Pensions Bill introduced from 2010.</p>

<a name="70322w0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_557"></a><a name="07032278000622"></a>3. Estimates do not take into account the potential increases in private saving due to auto-enrolment or personal accounts.</p>

<a name="70322w0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_558"></a><a name="07032278000623"></a>4. Entitlement to housing benefit is as a result of being in rented accommodation and either having qualifying income below the relevant threshold or being &#147;passported&#148; as a result of entitlement to another benefit. In the case of pensioners, the guarantee element of pension credit offers automatic entitlement to housing benefit. Currently, around 84 per cent to 87 per cent of the elderly housing benefit-entitled population are also entitled to some element of pension credit.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_561"></a><a name="07032278000626"></a>7. Entitlement figures are calibrated against caseloads in 2004-05 using the National Statistics publication <I>Income Related Benefits&#151;Estimates of Take-Up in 2004-2005</I>.</p>

Estimates of the numbers entitled are given as ranges in order to account for possible biases in estimates from data that are less than perfect. They also take account of the effects of sampling variation. It is assumed that the size of this range remains constant in future years relative to the changing proportion of eligible elderly households.</p>

It was at the forefront of international calls for the UN to play a more active role in peacekeeping in Darfur, which led to UN Security Council Resolution 1591. The UN is working with the AU to deploy a heavy support package, which will include logistics and other support functions and a full hybrid UN/AU force, which we want to be fully funded through the UN. Rwandan troops are a key troop contributor to AMIS and they are doing an excellent job. We want them to remain and become a key contributor to the AU/UN hybrid force.</p>

The Organisation of Islamic Conference, and some Asian states, said that the council should not discuss the report on procedural grounds because the mission had not gone to Sudan. In statements to the council, my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs, Ian McCartney, and the UK Permanent Representative to the HRC have called on it to take effective action on Darfur and not become mired in procedural debates. We do not accept that the mission report is not valid, as the mission failed to go to Sudan. The Government of Sudan reneged on their commitment to co-operate with the mission and refused to grant visas to all members of the mission, so, rightly, none of the members  went. The report is based on the assessments of  UN humanitarian agencies, the African Union in Addis Ababa and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in eastern Chad. All of these organisations, which have large numbers of staff operating in Darfur and eastern Chad, continue to report an appalling human rights and humanitarian situation there. We will continue to press the HRC-to take forward the recommendations in the report.</p>
