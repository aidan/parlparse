On the Joint Committee on Human Rights, on which I serve, we listened to witnesses working in the front line with these unfortunate people, and the story was harrowing and moving. Too often, they are seen as just a troublesome extension of the immigration problem, as distinct from women in danger and in dire need of support and help. When will we send a clear message to all concerned in this country, and to all those in Europe and the world, that we stand absolutely firm and resolute in condemning this beastly trade and in supporting all those who are endeavouring to help these women in their predicament?</p>

I am sure he listened carefully to what I said, which was that it is our very firm intention to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings for the very reasons my noble friend set out in his supplementary. We have always said that we are wholly sympathetic to the objectives behind the Council of Europe convention, which, as I am sure we all appreciate, will provide greater support for all victims of trafficking and continue our fight against organised immigration crime, something that is at the very top of our political agenda.</p>

Is the Minister aware that delay costs lives? Practical measures can be taken now to protect trafficked children. Is the Minister aware of the report by ECPAT, published last week, which points out that of the 80 children rescued by government agencies from trafficking, two-thirds have gone missing and are back in the hands of traffickers? What will the Government do to protect them now?</p>

The ECPAT report does not absolutely identify the 48 missing children&#151;we are not fully apprised of all the circumstances set out in the report&#151;but we continue to ensure that proper enforcement measures are taken. Certainly, with the measures that we have put in place in the past few years, this Government take the issue very seriously, which is why we support projects such as the Poppy project, through the Eaves housing project, and so on, providing all the opportunities that we can to ensure that proper standards of child protection are in place.</p>

The country of origin may well be the place where they were abducted by a criminal gang in the first place. Returning them to their country of origin may mean returning them to a family that does not want to accept them because they are regardedas dishonoured.

However, offences are dealt with by the offer of a fixed penalty. In 2004, some 74,000 tickets were paid.</p>

Ihope I shall have such favoured treatment when I ask a Question in the weeks and months to come.The Answer revealed the figures for successful prosecutions, and another survey showed that some 500,000 calls are made on hand-held phones in a 24-hour period, so is he satisfied that the police are pursuing this matter with sufficient vigour, or perhaps the offence is difficult to prove? Does he agree that what is really required is a sea-change among the driving community, such as occurred with drink-driving, which nevertheless took many years to become socially unacceptable?</p>

The offence has been in place for only two or three years and, as I revealed in the Answer, some 74,000 drivers have been ticketed, which indicates a high level of enforcement. I agree with him that this area will develop over time. The Government take the issue of driving while using a hand-held mobile phone extremely seriously.</p>

Why does he not collect one set of statistics, or why does he not give them when he is able to give them for the other offence?</p>

It is clearly important that we collect data and statistics on that issue. The cycling question is rather more difficult.</p>

I am sure the noble Lord will have noticed that an increase in the penalty is to be introduced on 27 February, and there is a substantial advertising campaign around that.

Does my noble friend have an analysis of the statistics which shows what proportion of those people convicted of driving while using hand-held mobile telephones were involved in a road traffic accident as a result?

She will know that I am new to this brief, but I shall check on the matter because that information might be extremely valuable. We are well on the way to achieving our casualty reduction targets for 2010. There has been a 40 per cent reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured in road accidents compared with the average number for 1994 to 1998, and a 50 per cent reduction&#151;this is an important statistic&#151;in the number of children killed or seriously injured during that period.

The National Audit Office recognised that in its report and the Prime Minister said in Plymouth that it would mean the need for long-term extra expenditure. Will the Minister confirm that the Treasury is working with the Ministry of Defence on redefining and costing the defence planning assumptions?</p>

Defence expenditure and the defence budget for the next three years will be included in that. However, the Government of course take into account changes in priorities in the longer term. This is all part of the work that is done together by the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence.</p>

Has not GDP been rising rapidly? Is not the fact that defence expenditure has stayed at the same percentage of GDP therefore really quite remarkable?</p>

Since 1997, we have been spending on defence 2.5 per cent of GDP, which is almost exactly the same as the percentage rise in GDP.</p>

I do not think that many of those serving in the forces will be impressed by the bandying around of statistics or the clever answers coming from the Treasury Bench, given that those forces are faced with shortages, increasing levels of commitment and an increasing abandonment of the harmony guidelines, which provide a decent interval between unaccompanied tours of duty. The Prime Minister&#146;s comments in Plymouth, belated though they were, were at last a recognition of the serious shortfall in defence expenditure.</p>

This derived from a Question about defence last week. I am, therefore, obliged to put the record straight. However, I recognise what the noble Lord says: of course it is important that we sustain defence expenditure to meet the commitments of our troops. It is quite clear that the extra cost of military operations reflects the deployment of our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the noble Lord will recognise that that involves substantial increased expenditure.</p>

Surely he will agree that a Government who saw the end of the Cold War were able to reduce defence expenditure, and a Government who involved our Armed Forces in only one relatively minor overseas war were able to contain defence expenditure. Does he not realise that the Government of which he is a member will probably go down as the most warmongering since the end of the Second World War? That is why defence expenditure ought to be far higher than it is today.</p>

While the report&#146;s contents are shocking, the fact that the police ombudsman&#146;s investigation has succeeded in bringing this to light demonstrates how effective are the new police accountability mechanisms that are now in place. The Chief Constable has accepted the report&#146;s recommendations, and work on reinvestigating the cases referred to in the report has already begun.</p>

She is an exemplary public servant and does not deserve the unwarranted observations made in Grand Committee yesterday by certain noble Lords. I now ask the question put to the Prime Minister by the honourable Member for Foyle yesterday in another place, which was not replied to. Can the former Chief Constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, now remain credible as Chief Inspector of Constabulary after the ombudsman&#146;s report? He denies any knowledge of the gross irregularities that took place in Special Branch while he was Chief Constable of the RUC. Is that not dereliction on his part?</p>

Will the noble Lord confirm that yesterday at the Police Board the police ombudsman made it very clear that whatever faults she implied were not systemic throughout the RUC? Will he deplore the naming of three senior officers by Mark Durkan in another place yesterday? I know the three officers&#151;I have worked with them; they are among the most honourable men I know. I want that to be noted by the noble Lord. What is he going to do to protect officers whose reputations have been impugned by this very shoddy document, which has been produced at a huge cost? Finally, will the Minister confirm that the officers named did not refuse to give evidence to the police ombudsman? They wrote to her and offered to give evidence in any substantive inquiry that she should conduct.</p>

Senior police officers in Northern Ireland, however, regarded those procedures as being quite unrealistic in dealing with terrorism. That is the issue of general application, because we are in danger here of setting precedents that will come back to haunt us in dealing with terrorism elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</p>

There is a set of rules and protocols for that. Some of the informants may, indeed, be committing criminal offences and therefore the handling of this requires the utmost professionalism. Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, it is now in the interests of national security to make sure that those informants&#146; actions are proportionate to what the use of that conduct seeks to achieve. A source that acts beyond the limits recognised by the law will be liable to prosecution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="07012576000096"></a>We in Britain are more fortunate than we know. We have the oldest and most stable constitution in Europe. The sea is our timeless frontier. In 1603, Scotland inherited the English throne, and in 1707, by sovereign treaty, the union of Parliaments made us free and equal partners in the United Kingdom. We take a lot of things for granted&#151;our prosperity, our freedom and our stability under the Crown&#151;but what we take for granted most of all is the privilege from which all those advantages derive: the privilege of being British. There is no one prouder to be Scottish than I am, but I take equal pride in being British. There is no contradiction, no clash of interests or allegiance that disrupts that dual identity. It is our birthright to be Scots, English or Welsh; our good fortune to be British; and, I believe, our duty to be unionists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="07012576000097"></a>Gordon Brown has called for a big debate to celebrate our common values. The Government marked the 300th anniversary of the greatest partnership the world has ever seen by hosting a reception. It was hosted by the Chancellor and the Scottish Secretary in my old office, Dover House in Whitehall. I felt that I ought to go along. The Chancellor did not turn up and the Scottish Secretary left early to debate with Alex Salmond on &#147;Newsnight&#148;. Is that really the best that the Government can do to celebrate the tercentenary?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="07012576000098"></a>The Education Secretary, Alan Johnson, announced today that he wanted Britishness taught in our schools. Asked on the &#147;Today&#148; programme this morning what Britishness was, he spluttered incoherently searching for an answer. I suggest to him that if he wants our children to understand what Britishness is, he should ensure that we return to teaching history in our schools from beginning to end, not as a disjoint set of topics or periods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="07012576000099"></a>Amazingly, Mr Brown is now attacking Conservatives for playing what he described as fast and loose with the union by demanding English votes for English laws. He warns:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="07012576000279"></a>&#147;It is now time for the supporters of the Union to speak up to resist any drift towards a Balkanisation of Britain and to acknowledge Great Britain for the success it has been and is&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012576000269"></a>I recognise that phrase, &#147;Balkanisation of Britain&#148;. It was first used by one of his ministerial colleagues,Mr Kim Howells. Arguing against devolution for Scotland and Wales, he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="07012576000280"></a>&#147;I did not enter politics to help with the Balkanisation of Britain&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012576000100"></a>It appears, according to the Chancellor, that he did just that. English votes for English laws was always the inevitable consequence of engineering Scottish votes for Scottish laws. It is a proposal that carries support in opinion polls on both sides of the Border, because people in Scotland and people in England recognise that it is only fair.</p>

<p><a name="07012576000270"></a>He calls my noble friend Lady Thatcher in aid, and I welcome his reassessment. Yet it is this Government who changed everything and created the Scottish Parliament. They refused to listen to the warnings from my noble friend and from Sir John Major and unionists on their own side. You only needed to read the title of Tam Dalyell&#146;s book, <I>Devolution: the End of Britain?,</I> to get the message. Frank Field is today calling for English votes on English issues because he is a unionist, not a nationalist. The noble Lord, Lord Robertson, assured us that devolution would kill nationalism stone dead. The truth is that the Government&#146;s gerrymandering of the constitution has ignited nationalism on both sides of the Border and urgent remedial action is now required.</p>

<a name="70125-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07012576000102"></a>English votes for English laws is attacked by Ministers because they say it would create two classes of MP. But the Government did that when they prevented 59 Scottish MPs&#151;including the Chancellor, the Home Secretary, the Trade Secretary, the Defence Secretary and the Transport and Scottish Secretary&#151;from voting on devolved issues in their own constituencies as a consequence of establishing a Scottish Parliament. The Higher Education Act introducing top-up fees in universities was passed only on the strength of Scottish Labour MPs voting on a measure that was rejected for their own constituencies by Labour in the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07012576000105"></a>As I was saying, the Higher Education Act passed only because of the votes of Scottish MPs, but the provisions did not apply to their own constituencies. That is not sustainable. It is not defensible. We need to change it. The late Robin Cook, another distinguished parliamentarian, claimed that if a Scottish Parliament were created, he could not be Secretary of State for Health because he would not be accountable to his constituents for a department which presided over health in England. Quite what he would have made of Dr John Reid as Home Secretary trashing his own department, I do not know. It is a failure to address these problems that will feed the worm of separatism which is growing at the very heart of our union.</p>

I thought that it would be expensive. I thought that it would struggle to attract the most talented people. I thought that it would marginalise Scotland, diminish the authority of Scottish MPs at Westminster and undermine the union. It has exceeded all my expectations. At the very least, a root and branch reform is needed. There are too many politicians in Scotland and the Executive is far too large. We had five ministerial cars; they have 22 ministerial cars and preach about the importance of global warming. They are marginalised in their relations with Whitehall. Their role was never properly thought through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07012576000107"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Barnett&#151;who wanted to be at this debate, but cannot because of family illness&#151;has called for a review of the formula that bears his name. If Scotland was to have its own legislative and tax-raising powers, it was crucial to demonstrate that the Parliament was funded on a fair basis. The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, thinks that it is not. A needs-based assessment for each of the regions and countries of the United Kingdom was essential to establish a baseline that was fair and seen to be so. Providing funding of 20 per cent more per head for Scotland than for England without such an exercise, while introducing more generous policies on tuition fees or free care for the elderly north of the Border, was bound to create resentment. The Chancellor should commission that objective needs assessment now. The Treaty of Union guaranteed fair and equal treatment for all parts of the union. It is his duty to demonstrate that this is being done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07012576000108"></a>George Orwell introduced us to the concept of doublethink&#151;the ability to hold two contradictory thoughts simultaneously and to believe both of them: &#147;War is peace&#148;, &#147;Freedom is slavery&#148;, &#147;Ignorance is strength&#148;. To these, the Scottish nationalists have added, &#147;Independence in Europe&#148;. Scotland&#146;s voice counts in Europe, in the Security Council, in the UN, in NATO, in the Commonwealth, and in the G8 as part of the United Kingdom. An independent Scotland would struggle to catch the waiter&#146;s eye in Brussels. It would be a country of 5 million in a community of half a billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07012576000109"></a>The nationalists of old, such as Compton Mackenzie and Wendy Wood, offered hardship and sacrifice as the price of freedom. Their latter-day successors pretend that the economic and political advantages of being in the union could be retained and that secession would be painless. This is dishonest politics. If independence is the overriding priority, people have every right to vote for it, but they also have the right to be informed in advance about the heavy sacrifice it entails.</p>

The Lord Chancellor, whom I am delighted to see participating in the debate, has taken to the airwaves and warned us on GMTV that the future of the United Kingdom is at stake. He would do well to reflect on the role that he and his colleagues would have played as correspondents in any divorce proceedings. This marriage of 300 years is worth saving.</p>

Unity is our instinct and our strength&#151;unity that has been forged and tested in peace and war. We are a nation united under the Crown by common interest, by history, and by destiny.

I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, for introducing the debate, even though, in my view, as the author ofthe poll tax he was probably the politician in the20th century who came closest to destroying that union. However, I agree with the first part of the noble Lord&#146;s speech. I support the union; I believe that it is right. But here is one long-term supporter of devolution, who is still a long-term supporter of devolution, who believes that the establishment of the Scottish Parliament was right. I had an enormous sense of d&#233;j  vu when I listened to the noble Lord&#146;s speech, which he could have made in the 1980s, the early 1990s and even when he was Secretary of State for Scotland. The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, was wrong then and he is wrong now.</p>

<a name="70125-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07012576000113"></a>I did not support devolution in order to createan independent Scotland. I supported devolution because a democratic deficit had to be addressed. Before devolution, the Secretary of State introduced legislation to this House and the other place that related entirely to the Scottish people but was not supported by the Scottish people democratically. They had never elected anyone to introduce those laws. If that was not a major anomaly and a major deficit, I do not know what was.</p>

<a name="70125-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07012576000114"></a>In some ways I am almost representative of the union. I was born in England of Scottish parents. My brothers and my sisters still live in England, where they brought up their children. My brothers divide their loyalties between England and Scotland. Their children see themselves as English, while my sons see themselves very much as Scottish. I have lived for45 years in Scotland: I know many people would not believe that on listening to me&#151;although I may look it. I have brought up my family in Scotland; I holiday in Scotland; and I support any Scottish team or Scot taking part in any sporting activity. I suppose, in the words of Jim Sillars, that makes me a 90-minute patriot.</p>

<a name="70125-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07012576000115"></a>However, along with the majority of Scots, I cannot understand why anyone should propose the break-up of the United Kingdom. Of course, there are times when people should declare their independence from a dominant power. On these Benches, we have supported throughout our political lives the struggle of oppressed peoples for freedom throughout the world. But, despite the sometimes strange rhetoric of the SNP, no comparisons can be made between Scotland and those oppressed peoples. I have heard Alex Salmond compare the struggle of Scotland&#146;s independence with the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. What an insult to the people of South Africa that is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07012576000116"></a>Except for history and sport, what divides us from England? We are not divided by religion; we speak the same language; and we are of the same race and colour. There is not even a natural geographic divide between the two countries. When I was driven north by my parents, we believed that we were in Scotland when we crossed the Solway. I now notice that the border is about a mile further up the road nearer to Gretna.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07012576000117"></a>Scotland is not an oppressed colony seeking freedom. As the noble Lord said, Scots played a dominant role in the discovery, settlement and administration of the British Empire. They played a major role in the growth of the British economy. Even today, Scots play a leading role in the government of the country. Our present Prime Minister was born and went to school in Scotland. The next Prime Minister, who will be there for as long as he wants, is Scottish. The leader of the Liberal Party is a Scot and I am sure that, given his name, David Cameron has Scottish ancestors somewhere.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07012576000118"></a>If the Scots had wanted independence, they could have voted for it at any general election in the past50 years by voting for the SNP. If a majority of SNP MPs had been elected, no British Government would have refused to negotiate or call a referendum. But the Scottish people have steadfastly refused to do this&#151;nor will they in May or any future election. The Scots like to moan about the English and what awful people they are. They like to support any football or rugby team playing against England, wherever that team comes from. But they also want to enjoy the enormous social and economic benefits that union with the rest of the UK brings.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07012576000119"></a>The SNP tries to pretend that it is a modern, social democratic party, but it clings to a concept of nationhood that has no basis other than some romantic historic memory. It is significant that the party holds a rally every year at Bannockburn, believes that Scotland was defeated at Culloden and wraps itself in the Scottish flag. In a modern, democratic, high-tech world where trade and the economy are global, where the internet has brought to all nearly all the knowledge that we require and where we travel freely across the world, seeing and sharing a multitude of cultures, nationalism appears old-fashioned and narrow-minded&#151;a philosophy of the 19th and early 20th centuries with little or no relevance in the modern world. While the leaders of the SNP represent the face of reason and argue a case, seemingly based on reason, too many of their most ardent supporters base their nationalism on hatred of the English, not on any love for their own country.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07012576000120"></a>It would be a major blow to both England and Scotland if the bond between them was broken. Devolution has created some anomalies but, as I have said, they are no greater than the anomalies that were there when the noble Lords, Lord Forsyth and Lord Lang, were Secretary of State. The British constitution is riddled with anomalies; this House is, after all, probably the biggest anomaly of all. We amend these anomalies when necessary. I do not believe that the present relationship between England and Scotland needs any amendment at this stage. Let us celebrate

He is one of the kind of bare-knuckle politicians whom I admire. He has not yet fulfilled the prediction that I made when he entered the House&#151;that he would make an immediate putsch for the leadership of the Conservative Party&#151;but I would recommend that the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, keep an eye open. It is also a pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, who of course in his way is a part of one branch of Scottish aristocracy&#151;the red Clydesiders.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07012576000122"></a>The truth is that, whatever the political settlement agreed between the different peoples of these islands, we are bound together by an entanglement of history and the realities of geography. I am of Irish origin, some 150 years ago&#151;both sides of my family come from County Mayo. I have never checked back, because I fear that we may have left without paying the rent. I recall a visit by Jack Lynch&#151;then the Irish Prime Minister&#151;to Downing Street when I worked with Jim Callaghan. The receiving line consisted of Denis Healey, the Chancellor, Bernard Donoghue, head of the policy unit, and Tom McCaffrey, head of the press office. When Jack Lynch reached me he said, &#147;Is this my delegation or yours?&#148;.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07012576000123"></a>I emphasise those Irish roots because the tragedy of Ireland serves both as a lesson and a warning. Gladstone said 120 years ago:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="07012576000281"></a>&#147;We are bound to lose Ireland in consequence of years of cruelty, stupidity and misgovernment and I would rather lose her as a friend than as a foe&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012576000271"></a>Ireland has cast such a long and bloody shadow over our politics throughout the 20th century, in part because politicians sought to use the problems of Ireland for short-term political gain. One of the reasons why I wanted to participate today was in order to listen carefully to what was said by noble Lords on the Conservative Benches. I sincerely hope that they are not contemplating a 21st-century version of playing the Orange card by stoking up a spurious kind of English nationalism because, if they do, they may release a genie from the bottle with dire consequences for the union.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07012576000124"></a>I listened to what the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, had to say about the English question. Perhaps I can recommend especially to noble Lords on the Conservative Benches a book in the Library, <I>The English Question</I>, edited by Robert Hazell. It is a collection of studies of this issue by British academics which does not set out the stark choices outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth. He referred to Balkanisation. It is interesting to note that, when I was a schoolboy, Balkanisation was a pejorative term; it was a description of failure. But in recent years, not least in the Balkans themselves, we have seen Balkanisation, with many countries smaller than Scotland opting for independence, so an independent Scotland would not look out of place in a community

If our union is to continue, it has to do so because of shared values and interests, as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, said, and because of mutual benefit.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="07012576000125"></a>I watched the debate on &#147;Newsnight&#148; between Douglas Alexander and Alex Salmond, and I have to say that I found it sterile and unsatisfactory in many ways, not least because neither of them seemed to argue for what I would coin the third way. I hope that, over the next few hours, Members on these Benches will expand on that third way. I have never had any trouble identifying myself at a number of levels. To take the Tebbit test, I support Blackpool at football, Lancashire at cricket, England at football and cricket, Great Britain at rugby league and Europe at the golf Ryder Cup. Likewise in my politics I can see tasks best suited to the European Union, some to the UK Government, some to national and regional government and some to local government. It has been a constant theme of this party to move power from Whitehall to the level of most effectiveness&#151;that horrid word, &#147;subsidiarity&#148;. In fact, we have the most overcentralised government in the western world, and I hope that a number of my colleagues will develop themes in terms of the English regions, Wales and Cornwall.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07012576000126"></a>We will hear from my noble friend Lord Steel, who will address the specific question raised by the Barnett formula and his own work on that. Here I pay tribute to my noble friend for his contribution to the establishment of the Scottish Parliament and carrying through devolution. We will hear from my noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie. It will be a distinctive view. Harold Wilson once said that every dog hasone bite, and today my noble friend will have his bite. I hate to challenge him, because he has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the skulduggery and chicanery of Scottish politics going back 600 years, not least because his family seems to have played a major part in that skulduggery. We will also hear from my noble friend Lord Maclennan of Rogart, who with the Cook-Maclennan report set in motion moves towards the Scottish Parliament, of which Members on these Benches are extremely proud. Lastly, yesterday I had the pleasure of hearing the leader of the Liberal Democrats in Scotland, Nicol Stephen, speak to us. He set out an inspirational vision, onein stark contrast to what we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, and we can go into the forthcoming elections in Scotland with a track record of good governance and a positive vision of Scotland&#146;s future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07012576000127"></a>Members on these Benches will continue to argue that the union will be stronger if we embrace genuine devolution with significantly more powers for the existing devolved bodies and a renewed attempt to devolve power to the English regions. The late Donald Dewar described devolution as,</p>
<ul><a name="07012576000287"></a>&#147;a process, not an event&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012576000272"></a>If we see it that way and work with imagination and generosity of spirit to devolve power and decision-making, we will achieve that win-win situation of a United Kingdom strong enough to be a major influence on world events and with a constitutional settlement that respects and enhances the identity of

I make no apology for intervening as a Welshman because this debate relates to the future of the union as a whole.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07012576000129"></a>I make but four brief observations. First, it is unlikely that the union question would have been raised at earlier anniversaries. Clearly, there is now a Scottish question, to a lesser extent a Welsh question and, as I shall come to shortly, certainly an English question.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="07012576000130"></a>Secondly, what are the roots of the present challenges to the union? Even in Scotland in the 1979 referendum the statutory hurdle was not reached and in Wales there was a 4:1 majority against the devolution proposals. Less than 20 years later, in the new referendums there was a massive majority in Scotland and a bare majority in Wales in favour of the proposals. Why? What had happened during those 20 years? Obviously, one cannot separate the question from the UK political context. In 1979, the proposals were put forward by an unpopular Labour Government. In 1997, the proposals were made by a Labour Government after an overwhelming Labour election victory. Yet there were wider reasons. To provoke the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, who will speak after me, I say that some of the responsibility must lie with the Conservative Government after 1979, who failed to recognise that there is a Scottish question and failed to follow the example of Disraeli over the franchise and partially to steal their opponents&#146; clothes. The party fell into a narrow English nationalism, with the result that it lost all its seats in Wales and Scotland in the general election of 1997.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07012576000131"></a>It is interesting to speculate what would have happened if, after 1979, instead of ignoring and neglecting the problem, the Conservative Government had instituted a form of indirect election to an all-Wales body drawn from Welsh local authorities. Those super-councillors would then have had a vested interest in maintaining the new body. Perhaps that speculation is like asking whether Ireland would still be in the union if the wise home rule proposals of Gladstone had not been defeated by the unionists in the 1880s.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07012576000132"></a>Thirdly, the problem is now exacerbated by the West Lothian or West Glamorgan question. Opinion polls suggest that half the English want independence, perhaps for economic reasons. In my judgment unwise initiatives and slogans such as, &#147;English votes for English laws&#148;, by those from the unionist tradition could have negative consequences. Those who blow on the flames of English nationalism may one day find the union consumed by them. Perhaps because of the dangers we should recognise that some problems have no solutions, or at least no solutions without unacceptable consequences.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="07012576000133"></a>Finally, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said so well, surely the real problem is how in the post-imperial world we can best accommodate differences of national identity within the union. The problem is not confined to the United Kingdom. There is the Quebec problem in Canada and that of Catalonia and the Basque country in Spain. Even in Napoleonic France there are pressures for recognition of regional identities.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07012576000134"></a>Part of the solution may be to recognise multiple identities. In time the European Union identity, the United Kingdom identity and the internal national identities may all be considered valid. Perhaps we have been too complacent and inflexible. First, we should be ready to sing the praises of the union, which has given us all a greater weight and led to a greater sharing of resources within it. I note with regret that when on 17 January, for example, the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence announcedthe establishment in the Vale of Glamorgan of the training centre for the entire UK Armed Forces, no voice in Wales that I heard stated that this was one of the benefits for us in Wales of the union.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07012576000135"></a>Secondly, we should give a warm welcome and recognition to the Scottish and Welsh dimensions of our national politics, including incrementally transferring more power to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, but also avoiding centralising power in Edinburgh and in Cardiff by strengthening local authorities. In short, we should seek creative ways of reshaping our constitutional arrangements to respond to this search for identity, perhaps like Spain evolving an autonomy   la carte, which may be necessary because of the disproportionate population and the economic weight of England, and because of the lack of a sufficient regional identity in the English regions shown in the referendum in the north-east.</p>

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07012576000136"></a>The fact that England does not wish to be divided into smaller units means that a classic federal solution is unlikely, but we are probably sleepwalking according to the normal British tradition in the direction of a quasi-federal structure. At some point along that road, we shall have to consider a constitutional court to adjudicate on disputes and other features of classical federalism, but there are many termini on the road from the current unitary Government with their devolved Administrations to fragmentation and independence.</p>

He fears that his perfectly honourable ambition to be Prime Minister and effective in that role may be under threat. We also know why Mr Peter Hain, equally ambitious, is presenting himself as the passionate defender of the union. It appears likely that the Labour Party will be dismissed from office by a thoroughly disillusioned Welsh electorate in the May elections for the Welsh Assembly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07012576000138"></a>Mr Peter Hain&#146;s campaign is particularly curious. If you really want to defend something, it is a mistake to put all the blame for the fact that it is threatened on those who share your views. Conservatives share his opinion that the advantages and benefits of the union are compelling. He is also right that the case does not rest on economic arguments alone, but even more on the family ties that bind us. Yet in the <I>Western Mail</I> he alleges that,</p>
<ul><a name="07012576000288"></a>&#147;our shared values are now under threat as never before from an opportunist coalition of myopic Tories and the narrow separatists of Plaid Cymru and the Scottish Nationalists&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012576000139"></a>At Welsh Questions in another place last week he attacked the leader of the Opposition and the shadow Secretary of State for Wales for what he termed,</p>
<ul><a name="07012576000289"></a>&#147;their disgraceful policy of wishing to break up the United Kingdom by joining an alliance with Plaid Cymru to create second-class status for Welsh MPs&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 17/1/07; col. 768.]</ul>
<p><a name="07012576000273"></a>It is an odd constitutional doctrine that if the governing party loses the confidence of the electorate, other parties should not try to find common ground to provide an alternative Administration. I believe that it is their duty to do so. Even more absurd is the charge that it is myopic Tories who are to blame when it has been a succession of Labour Governments who have been blind to the foreseeable consequences of their own devolution measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07012576000140"></a>In 1976 Tam Dalyell, a Scotsman sitting for a Scottish seat, placed the problem in the centre of the debate when he posed the West Lothian question. Speaking in another place on Labour&#146;s White Paper proposals in that year and after referring to the fact that Scottish and Welsh MPs would be powerless in their own constituencies, I said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="07012576000282"></a>&#147;In another respect they will be privileged because they will be able by their voices and their votes to decide in England the policy on a whole range of matters; the structure of the education service and the organisation of the National Health Service, for example, which in their own parts of the United Kingdom will have been transferred elsewhere. I do not believe that this situation would for long be acceptable to this House&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07012576000141"></a>Almost exactly 30 years ago, in January 1977, we debated the Government&#146;s Bill. The explosive nature of the West Lothian question had become even more apparent, and the indignation of the English electorate was being roused. Twenty-one years later, debating the then Government of Wales Bill in this House, we came back to the issue. I spoke of,</p>
<ul><a name="07012576000290"></a>&#147;the dog that did not bark in the night ... in the debates in another place. I refer to the English dog. I fear that in due time he will bark and may bite ... It is an issue that we would be foolish to put completely on one side ... if we care for the stability and good government of Britain as a whole&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/4/98; col. 1061.]</ul>
<a name="70125-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07012576000142"></a>The next time the dog appeared it was in the very well trained and placid form of the Bill introduced by my noble friend Lord Baker of Dorking in the previous Session. Unless we find a solution, we may not be so fortunate on a future occasion. It is likely that next time it will be a dog with a vicious bite.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07012576000143"></a>Mr Hain in his <I>Western Mail </I>article referred to the historic and fundamental principle of equality between all Members of Parliament and suggested that English votes for English laws would result in second-class status for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. He

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07012576000144"></a>The union of our country is too valuable to be left in this dangerous state of instability. We have no option but to return to the proposition so admirably presented by my noble friend Lord Baker. I press the point of the social reason that I referred to earlier: the family ties that bind us. A few years ago I wrote a family history. I concluded the introduction with the observation that,</p>
<ul><a name="07012576000291"></a>&#147;the intermingling of English, Welsh, Scottish and Irish blood (and the history of those nations) that has produced my children and grandchildren is a characteristic of families that is ... unlikely to be exceptional. That fact appears to me to be significant when confronted by the current wave of nationalist sentiment and at a time when the unity of the United Kingdom is under threat ... My grandchildren have every reason to take pride in their common heritage from all four nations in the British isles&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07012576000146"></a>Let us join battle to defend the union, not on the grounds of personal ambition, however honourable that ambition may be, but because we are all members of a family with a shared history, shared interests, shared values and shared hopes.</p>

When I put my name down to speak in this debate, it was scheduled to last two and a half hours. Although I am delighted that it has been extended to four hours, it creates a problem for me because in the mid-afternoon I have to catch a plane to fulfil a long-standing engagement in Edinburgh this evening. I hope that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and others winding up this debate will acquit me of any discourtesy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07012576000148"></a>I welcome the debate and the action of the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, in initiating it, but I must chide him gently for his slightly shaky grasp of history, as his Motion is incorrect: the 300th anniversary that we are celebrating this month is not of the Treaty of Union but the passing of the Act of Union by the Scottish Parliament. The treaty was negotiated in the summer of 1706. However, we will let that pass, because a much more serious deviation from true history is conducted by the nationalists in their current campaign. They would wish us all to believe that the people of Scotland were against the union at the time. That is simply not so, and I am very grateful for a recent article by Professor Dickinson for pointing out that most people in Scotland, as in England, were at the time in favour of the union. Why was that so? It was partly because of the experience of the Union of the Crowns for a century, and partly because of the economic catastrophe of the Darien scheme, and the wasteful competition between Scotland and England in colonial adventures. The merchant companies of Edinburgh and Selkirk were ruined by the experience. There was overwhelming

<a name="70125-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07012576000149"></a>Where it went wrong was in between the agreement of the treaty and the drafting of the legislation. During the period from October 1706 to January 1707, the support that had existed for the union turned to opposition because of the nature of the proposal. People had wanted to retain the Scottish Parliament, but no one had yet devised any satisfactory federal system. It is part of the argument made by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, that no one has yet devised a satisfactory federal system. The argument was against an incorporating union, and even such as well known Scottish patriot as Fletcher of Saltoun, in his speeches from 1703 to 1706, was arguing for the union, not against it. Public opinion and the riots in Edinburgh were driven by the nature of the incorporating union abolishing the Scottish Parliament. I argued in debates during the passage of the Scotland Bill that the abolition of the Scottish Parliament was never accepted by the people in Scotland. That long-standing grievance and injustice was put right by the Scotland Act and by the re-creation of the Scottish Parliament. That is to be warmly welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07012576000150"></a>A recent survey of 25 top businesses in Scotland by the BBC&#146;s &#147;Newsnight&#148; found not one in favour of breaking the union. That is, in my view, wholly understandable. However, in the past few weeks, one or two prominent individual businessmen have declared that Scotland could be independent. I am happy to agree with them. Some of the arguments against independence have verged on the ludicrous, such as the claim that it would make life easier for al-Qaeda. The real question is not whether Scotland could be independent, but whether it should be. On that, together with most Scots, my answer is definitely no. We can enjoy the benefits of the union while developing the powers of our Parliament, especially in the area of raising the money that it spends. The alternative, including the dismantling of our social security system, would be wholly unnecessary and costly.</p>

<a name="70125-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07012576000151"></a>Unfortunately, at present the media tend to portray the upcoming choice in this year&#146;s Scottish elections as being between independence and the status quo. That is simply wrong. Opinion polls show that more people are in favour of ending the system whereby our Parliament is wholly dependent on a grant from this Parliament, by giving it the power to raise what it spends, rather than going for separation. A YouGov poll this month, commissioned by Channel 4, broke down the various options, and it made very interesting reading. Nine per cent wanted Scotland to become a completely separate state outside the UK and the EU; 22 per cent wanted Scotland to become a completely separate state outside the UK but inside the EU; 37 per cent wanted Scotland to remain in the UK but the Scottish Parliament to have more powers; 12 per cent wanted the Scottish Parliament to continue to have its current powers and 10 per cent wanted to abolish the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07012576000152"></a>In other words, adding together those figures, those who want some kind of independence add up to 31 per cent, those who want the present Scottish Parliament, perhaps with more powers, add up to49 per cent, and 10 per cent want to abolish it. I can say from experience of my independent position in the Scottish Parliament Chair that the Scottish Conservative Party plays a distinguished and useful role in that Parliament. I do not think that it will thank the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, for suggesting that it should fish for future support among the 10 per cent who are in favour of abolishing the Scottish Parliament. There is one element&#151;</p>

I am sure that he did not want to mislead the House. I did not at any stage in my speech argue for the abolition of the Scottish Parliament.

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="07012576000156"></a>I would like to see one element of the Act of Union repealed: that is its incorporation of the English Act of Settlement 1701 into Scots law. That stipulates that our monarch must not be a Roman Catholic nor be married to a Roman Catholic. However that may have been justified at that time in history, it is now thoroughly offensive. We are concerned in Scotland about sectarianism. The First Minister has spoken out about the effect of football clubs and extreme loyalties, and a Sunday newspaper has started a legitimate debate about the effect of separate Catholic schools, but here we have sectarianism entrenched in the law of the land. In practical terms, its presence means that the Princes William and Harry may fall in love with an atheist, a Muslim, a Jew, a Hindu, or a Buddhist but must take care to avoid any girl who is a Roman Catholic. That is a basic breach of their human rights, and it is high time that a UK Government repealed that odious measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07012576000157"></a>In a speech in Washington in 1969, Prime Minister Trudeau said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="07012576000274"></a>That was the Canadian view of living next door to the United States. By being in the union, at least we have some control over the behaviour of the animal. Thousands of Scots live and work in England and thousands of English live and work in Scotland; none of them wants to wake up one day to find he or she lives and works in a foreign country.</p>

I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, on giving us this opportunity to debate the union. I am very grateful for that. Like many people, I think of myself as British; I certainly do not think of myself as English because, as with most of us, I do not have to dig very deep to find elements of other parts of this island and parts of places further afield. One of the great strengths of our country is its diversity and its diversity in history. I am also very pleased to follow the noble Lord, Lord Steel. He showed much insight into the value of the link and I agree very much with many of his comments.</p>

<a name="70125-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07012576000159"></a>I have always regarded that link as having been made at a rather crucial time when the Industrial Revolution was developing. At the time, it opened up what was probably the largest single market in Europe and possibly much further afield, without any real constraints on the growth of science, technology and business. In doing that, it enabled the Industrial Revolution to take off even faster here than it was already doing. We should all be grateful for that and recognise that that is one of the many reasons why we led the world in the Industrial Revolution. I believe that that link was very important. When one considers the Scottish contribution, particularly to science and technology, and the number of railways around the world that were built by Scottish engineers, one recognises that that was a joint enterprise, fuelled by English capital but very often by Scottish skills. Those things are very important.</p>

<a name="70125-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07012576000160"></a>I declare an interest in that my failed attempts to get an education in England were finally put right in Scotland. At the age of about 20, I applied to Ruskin College in Oxford&#151;the adult education college mainly for people with a trade union and Labour background&#151;but it turned me down. That is why my street credibility is better than John Prescott&#146;s, because he was accepted at about the same time. However, I went on to Newbattle Abbey, which is a very good adult education college just outside Edinburgh. I am sorry to say that Malcolm Rifkind, who was on the board of governors at one time, tried to close it down, for reasons that totally elude me. There was a big debate about it at the time and changes were made, but it survived and, as far as I know, it still survives today and is still doing well. That also enabled me to go on to Strathclyde University.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07012576000161"></a>I have had many jobs in Scotland, the first of which was when I was still struggling to come to terms with some of the accents in parts of the west coast and in parts of Glasgow. I was a bus conductor on what was then called Alexander buses. On the Ruchazie or Easterhouse run on a Friday or Saturday night, collecting fares was a dangerous occupation and paying them entirely voluntary. The first comment when I asked a man for his fare on a Saturday night was, &#147;What&#146;s a Sassenach doing on my bus?&#148;. My attempt to explain that nationalism did not fit comfortably with the concept of international socialism failed rather miserably. I retreated to the back of the bus and consigned myself to ringing the bell occasionally to demonstrate that I had at least a nominal command of the bus, even if it was not realistic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07012576000162"></a>I discovered fairly early that, although there is at times a resentment of the English in Scotland at face value, it does not go very deep&#151;as my noble friend Lord Maxton said&#151;except for a small minority of people.</p>

<a name="70125-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07012576000165"></a>I often hear it said&#151;as it has been several times today&#151;that the British constitution is at risk from the anomalies and contradictions of the West Lothian question or whether Scottish MPs should vote on English matters. The British constitution is essentially a series of contradictions surviving through the practice of tolerance. That is what has probably made it by far the most successful constitution that the world has ever seen. It works largely because it is, at times, a contradiction.</p>

<a name="70125-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07012576000166"></a>Other, written, constitutions appear logical, but logic does not always translate into practice. The most obvious examples are ones such as the old Soviet Union constitution, from which you would have thought you were living in heaven when, in reality, you were in hell. The American constitution&#146;s opening statements, with all men being created equal and all the implications of that, did not apply to the negroes. Many of them&#151;this is not well known&#151;used to flee to Britain when they escaped slavery. At the front of the tract against slavery by William and Ellen Craft is the famous saying about when the slaves reached the English coast:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="07012576000284"></a>&#147;They touch our country, and their shackles fall&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012576000275"></a>Nor did the words of the American constitution apply to the North American Indian. Logic is not always a good driving force for constitutions.</p>

<a name="70125-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07012576000167"></a>The majority of people in Britain understand that there are going to be contradictions if you have one large country&#151;England&#151;with two neighbouring smaller nations as part of the same land mass. The same applies to Northern Ireland, but in a different context. People might grumble and groan about it at times, but it does not go that deep. There is and always has been a strong case for English regions. I do not accept the idea of an English parliament for reasons to which I have alluded. That is where the logic argument falls down. There may be a simplistic argument for an English parliament, but it does not work as a constitutional settlement given the relationship between these parts, whereas regional government within England does, as do the Scottish and Welsh parliaments. I strongly commend to this House the continuance of the union and the recognition that our constitution is not a logical document, but one that is joined together by tolerance, which is what makes it so successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="07012576000169"></a>It is clear that everyone who has spoken in the debate so far is strongly in favour of the union. We have had no Scottish nationalist voice; perhaps that is because all the Scots here want to remain in Westminster. I, too, am a strong supporter of the union and would greatly regret any break-up. I have personally benefited greatly from the union. I was born, brought up and educated in Scotland, have spent most of my working life in England and represented an English constituency. I have often thought that I got an English constituency partly because of my wife and partly because there are now so many Scots living in Norfolk who, I hope, voted for me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="07012576000170"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maxton, referred to going north of the border and crossing the Solway. I clearly remember that my three children, who have Scottish names, used to have a chant as we were approaching the border in the car, ending with a triumphant &#147;And we&#146;re in Scotland!&#148; when we arrived. I support Scotland at rugby and England at soccer. As my noble friend Lord Forsyth said, many Scots have been on the front line of national endeavour. We currently see it clearly in business and politics. It is highly significant that a number of Scottish Members of Parliament in favour of devolution nevertheless wanted to continue their parliamentary careers here at Westminster, in both Houses.</p>

<a name="70125-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07012576000171"></a>I do not want to comment much on the Scottish elections, as I am much less familiar with them than many here are. My understanding is that it is highly unlikely that the Scottish nationalists will get a majority vote, that there will be a referendum for independence or that it would succeed. However, as one with no objection to devolution at all, I believe that it must be fair on both sides. This is where I part company with the noble Lord, Lord Soley; although tolerance is a feature of the British race, so too is fairness. That is clearly shown in polls on both sides of the border, where there has been majority support for the understanding that English votes should apply to English laws.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07012576000172"></a>I was astonished by the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s nerve when he suggested in a recent speech that the blame for causing difficulties, by fanning English nationalism or anything of that sort, should be attached to the Conservatives. That is absolutely not the case. Labour decisions caused the problem; all we are doing is drawing attention to the problem and looking for solutions. We all understand why he framed his speech in that way: he was clearly worried that his position would be jeopardised by any move towards Scottish independence. That is not an argument for producing fallacious attacks on my own party.</p>

<a name="70125-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="07012576000173"></a>English votes on English laws is not a new point for me. I spoke on the proposal of my noble friend Lord Baker in this House on 10 February last year. I will not repeat the views that I expressed then, as they are all on the record. I will say that I spoke in the very first debate about devolution in the other place on 14 December 1976. There were then long debates through the night and, according to <I>Hansard</I>, I rose to speak at 5.32 am, so perhaps not many people were listening to what I had to say. I will not repeat the quotations, because they were recorded in the House of Lords  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1223"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1223</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><I>Hansard</I> on 10 February, but I drew attention to this problem. One person who was listening was Tam Dalyell, who intervened, raising one of the points that opponents of the proposal for English votes for English measures have always suggested. I replied and shortly thereafter he supported this general view, and the issue became known as the West Lothian question.</p>

<a name="70125-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07012576000174"></a>The Government of the day suggested that economic planning councils for England would be the answer. That was clearly wrong because, apart from all the other objections, they have no democratic legitimacy. Regional assemblies were proposed, and we now know that they are certainly not wanted by any English region&#151;not even the one that John Prescott thought most likely to vote for such an assembly. I was originally attracted to the idea of an English parliament, but have rejected it because it produces additional politicians, bureaucracy and expense. The only logical, just and fair solution is English votes on English laws. There are difficulties, but they can be overcome. I tried to suggest some ways of doing that in my speech last year.</p>

<a name="70125-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07012576000175"></a>Many of those in Scotland who oppose English votes for English laws recognise that the current position is indefensible. They either say, &#147;Do not ask the question&#148;, because they do not want to hear the answer, or they say, as the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, did, that we should stop harping on about the inequities and grievances. Frankly, those will not go away, and therefore the sooner we take on the solution, the better. It is the best alternative.</p>

<a name="70125-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07012576000176"></a>My next point concerns the problem of Scottish Ministers from Scottish seats having a department or responsibility for legislation that deals mainly with England. I do not believe that when, for example, John Reid was Minister for Transport he would in his heart of hearts have argued as strongly in the spending round for English roads as an English Minister would have.</p>

<a name="70125-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07012576000177"></a>That leads me on to the Barnett formula, which I shall discuss very briefly. I have long been against the Barnett formula, and I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, has now come out against it. It has long been felt to be a running sore. It is not just that 20 per cent more expenditure per head goes to Scotland than to England. I shall take my own region as an example, where the expenditure last year was &#163;5,605 per head, which is much less than the spending per head in Scotland. In fact, people in Scotland got about 33 per cent more than people in the eastern region of England. The obvious solution is that regional and national allocations should be based on need. In the case of Scotland, they are clearly not. I say to the Chancellor that it is clear that Conservatives strongly believe in the union and always have done, but the union is strengthened by being fair to all sides. At the moment, it is not in the case of English votes on English laws or in the case of the Barnett formula. We are not fanning feelings of English nationalism; we are addressing two running sores, which Labour Governments caused and which still need to be put right.</p>

As for celebration, I leave it to those with a deeper sense of history to get right when the celebration should be and whether it should be today or some other day. The second part of the Motion refers to the case for maintaining the UK. I am in favour of it, but what is the nub of the case? It seems to me that it is the &#147;how&#148;. The union is fine, but it is fluid. In the earlier part of the previous century, we had the breakaway of the Irish Republic, first within the Commonwealth, and then, halfway through the century, outside it. Then we had the commencement of the Stormont assembly, and in the last year of the century, we had the new Parliaments for Scotland and Wales.</p>

<a name="70125-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07012576000179"></a>We could be having a debate to celebrate getting on for eight years of the Scottish Parliament. There have been some achievements. I am not an avid reader of the <I>Scotsman</I> or the Glasgow<I> Herald</I>, and I could know more, but I know that Scotland has free social care for the elderly, does not have tuition fees and has an inclusive Parliament. Only yesterday or the day before, I&#151;and no doubt all noble Lords&#151;was favoured with a letter from an outfit called Rethink, which is concerned about mental health legislation. The letter is headed &#147;7-Nil&#148;. There has been some suggestion about the quality of politicians. These outsiders are saying that Scotland has the legislation right to the tune of 7-Nil against what is being proposed here. In Scotland, there are fair votes and the prospect of local government elections this May under the single transferable vote. That will mean that many places that were one-party states for the whole of the previous century will have a richness about them in terms of those who are able to take part in local government. They will be bubbling with ideas that were not possible in one-party state organisations.</p>

<a name="70125-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07012576000180"></a>There is a temptation to have public opinion polls as part of the celebration. Those have been quoted. As I understand it, the Scots say &#147;no&#148; to independence but want devolution with more powers. Then we hear that the English are saying, &#147;What about an English Parliament?&#148;. I am rather attracted to a Parliament in York, but I do not believe that people who are saying that they would like an English Parliament are saying that they want another Parliament in York, Nuneaton or Tunbridge Wells. If respondents answer, &#147;an English Parliament&#148;, they mean that this place should be for England. I do not believe they mean a Parliament elsewhere or that anyone is saying that they want an English Parliament and a UK Parliament as well. But people in England see successes in Scotland and some of them might slaver at them and want some of them. They wonder how on earth it can happen. They know that there are no more taxes in Scotland, which has not had to go to the 3 per cent extra available to it. They also know that there has to be a degree of financial redistribution in the Highlands and Islands and in other sparsely populated areas, but perhaps the benefits of the Barnett formula go a bit too far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07012576000181"></a>I return to the question of England. Having an English Parliament and looking at England separately does not seem right in terms of the balance of population. We must look at the regions of England. There are four points: first, we have got to think of regional devolution in England on a slim-line basis, not with puffed-up Parliaments all over the place, but a slim-line democracy; secondly, we know that there is devolution in England in government offices in the regions, and we want to democratise them; thirdly, we do not want sucking up from local government to those regions; and, fourthly&#151;and this is the problem&#151;we want to see UK ministerial power given up to the regions in England.</p>

<a name="70125-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07012576000182"></a>Reference was made to the referendum in the north-east of England. I am rather glad that the Government did not favour us with one in Yorkshire because it was very difficult to campaign for a &#147;yes&#148; vote when what was on offer was not worth having. If I had lived in the north-east of England, I would have had to go round saying, &#147;It&#146;s not much, but perhaps we can build something on it&#148;. That is not the best way to get regional devolution. As the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, said, we want to address the democratic deficit in England. He also remarked that we are of the same race and colour. That is not necessarily the case. I do not know the exact demography of race and colour in Scotland, but race and colour vary in England. It may well be that regional assemblies could be one way in which that deficit could be addressed. When one is making a fresh start in a fresh Parliament, that could be addressed.</p>

On 3 May the people of Scotland will go to the polls for elections to that Parliament. The central question before them will be whether the Labour/Liberal coalition and its several members, which they have had for those eight years, have delivered for Scotland, or whether they should be looking for alternatives. Unfortunately, this issue is becoming more and more confused with whether the Scottish Parliament is the correct constitutional arrangement. The Scottish press and locallyminded politicians see great mileage in stirring up this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07012576000184"></a>The issue in 1707 and still again at this time is what is a realistic concept of nationhood for our time. The Scots need to be wary of choosing outdated goals in an interdependent world. The noble Lord, Lord Maxton, touched on this topic. The Scots have always treasured concepts of nationhood and I like to think that my direct ancestors have been among those who tried to play a part. It was an ancestor of mine who was recorded as the right-hand man of William Wallace, pace the authors of <I>Braveheart</I>. Others were a signatory of the Declaration of Arbroath, which is acknowledged as the inspiration for the United States Declaration of Independence, and among those who fell defending King James IV at the battle of Flodden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="07012576000185"></a>The Act of Union was bound to be a controversial issue as it was trading certain elements of nationhood for a very active part in the major power structures of the day. The noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, outlined some of the reasons for Scottish support for the concept, but it is also quite interesting to note that four previous attempts at union had failed, even though England was already quite reliant on Scottish soldiers to fill the ranks of the Army. It was only when both the Scots and the French began to be beastly at the same time that the English thought that it was appropriate that a union should be formed.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="07012576000186"></a>My ancestor in 1707 was president of the Privy Council in the Scottish Parliament, but he turned down the invitation from the ancestor of the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, to be one of the commissioners to go to London for the negotiations. The Earl of Mar, in trying to turn his mind, wrote to him to say,</p>
<ul><a name="07012576000292"></a>&#147;the English nation were never in such a good disposition towards Scotland and if we get not a good union I have reason to believe it will not be their fault&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012576000187"></a>Perhaps the then marquis was aware that the Duke of Argyll as commissioner had complained that the Lord Treasurer had been,</p>
<ul><a name="07012576000293"></a>&#147;sending him up and down like a footman from one country to another&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="07012576000276"></a>and that any efforts made tended not to be reimbursed unless you finally fell in with the Government&#146;s wishes. Now that we have politicians who know how to be completely above board about their financial dealings, it can be easy to pick holes in the way in which business was done in those days. The whole construct engendered endless suspicion.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07012576000188"></a>My ancestor kept a list entitled, <I>The Peers and Gentlemen of Scotland who have appeared most zealous for the protestant succession with a note of the offices and pensions bestowed</I>. It would be nice to think that this was just a record of what he had noted taking place as one might do today, but I suppose it is possible that he had some role in it.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07012576000189"></a>One element that is easily overlooked is that these men, by the<I></I>responsibilities they held, were the local enterprise company, the highway authority, the social security providers, the financiers of education and even the local courts, so they had many calls on their finances, although, of course, for some reason which nowadays in our enlightened times we would find hard to understand, they often liked to do a bit too well out of it for themselves.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07012576000190"></a>Certain elements of the wrangling between partners have continued since then, but it is interesting to see in a letter from a young Graham relation the year after the treaty the statement&#151;some of this was alluded to earlier&#151;that,</p>
<ul><a name="07012576000294"></a>&#147;the revenue of the customs at Port Glasgow has increased: I find the merchants begin to taste the sweet of a direct trade to the plantations and how convenient it is to have their outward bound cargoes all of their own woollens and linen&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70125-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07012576000191"></a>The Scots have had a prominent role in spreading concepts of nationhood and freedom to the far corners of the world, but what we spread was, luckily for others, not what we had evolved in the years up to 1707, but something that was achieved by the uniting of the two traditions thereafter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="07012576000192"></a>The idea of a Scottish devolved legislature is still a very green concept and, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, pointed out, even those who set it up admit that it is being worked out as it goes along. A great deal still needs to be done to find ways to address what a number of Peers have identified as needless duplication and more efficient delivery. However&#151;I follow on from the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Maxton&#151;for all these generations, our civil structures have been built on concepts of the nation state. The drive for greater separation from the United Kingdom is based on the fond hope that somewhere out there it is still possible to achieve a nation state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="07012576000193"></a>An issue that is being discussed at this very moment in a gathering at Davos is that the advent of globalisation and the knowledge revolution mean that our institutions and systems of global governance are disintegrating and being reshaped. Next year, 2 billion people will be connected by the internet. The nation state on its own has no answer for climate change, rogue states, terrorism, the collapse of the Doha talks or the crisis in Darfur. As my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford was saying in this House yesterday in terms of defence, we are entering a period of immense change from what he described, using the terms that Thomas Friedman used for our economic outlook, as a very flat world, where vertical structures of authority are being replaced by horizontal networks of social communities and collaborative platforms. Klaus Schwab, the chief executive of the Davos Group said, in his introduction to that conference that we will have to reinvent ourselves, our social structures and our power structures within this flat world.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="07012576000194"></a>Seen in this perspective, my conclusion for Scotland is that it will be much more effective to remain working within the United Kingdom framework with those with whom we share so many concepts, rather than cast ourselves loose, like a shipwrecked container, in the hope that the winds of history will cast us up on some distant friendly shore.</p>

The Treaty of Union was presented to Queen Anne on 21 July 1706, solving the problems of that era. Lord Mar introduced the Union with England Bill on 10 October, and it was finally touched by the sceptre on 16 January 1707. British government extended to Scotland on 1 May, and the union parliament sat for the first time in that autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07012576000196"></a>During the summer of 1706, the commissioners from Scotland, including Lord Mar, read the runes correctly: Scotland was coming into a parliamentary union either voluntarily or by force.

English Ministers had too much influence over the Crown. This was after all a period of personal regal government. The Parliament of Scotland did not have a clear run at the Crown. The parliamentary union was an expedient&#151;workable but not necessarily just.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07012576000198"></a>Now, the parliamentary union is unnecessary. Scotland and south Britain should seek a new treaty. To spell it out, I want to retain the Union of the Crowns 1603 as a substantial symbol of the British social union, forged over so many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07012576000199"></a>Let us consider in passing how well we interact today with the Irish, despite the elongated process of parliamentary disengagement. The English-speaking people of north-west Europe thrive on their great affinity, and the two Prime Ministers stand together as equals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07012576000200"></a>My model for the future is a more successful version of the dual monarchy, with two separate sovereign governments under the Crown. Why will this work this time? It will do so because we have progressed from personal regal government to democratic government. This solution will bring the resentment to an end and it should happen soon. The Irish trauma came about because it was drawn out far too long.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07012576000201"></a>The parliamentary union is a cross between a forced marriage and a marriage of convenience. Considerable resentment is always a feature of such relationships. Since 2004 and EU enlargement, the need for Scotland to be submerged in a multinational state is over. I want Scottish mothers to believe that they have some influence over who we go to war with. I want to see Scotland&#146;s Foreign Minister addressing the UN, EU, NATO and the 50 or so other international organisations to which small countries normally belong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="07012576000202"></a>The Scottish Jacobites resented the loss of their international standing in Europe. They had just become some sort of funny English. I want their historic nationality back. The Scots need to depart from being subsidised, thinking that they are subsidised or thinking that they are being short changed. Only complete control of taxation can do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="07012576000203"></a>In north-west Europe there are many small countries to learn from. The post-war European movement is beneficial to those countries. When one considers the success of those countries in departing from multinational states, the omens are good&#151;Portugal in 1812, Belgium in 1830, Norway in 1905, Finland in 1917, Iceland in 1918 and Ireland in 1922. Recently, the Baltic states were welcomed into the EU by the UK, among others. I heard no one telling the Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians that they should go away and rejoin the Russian Federation. Now they enjoy full member status of international organisations.</p>

This spring I will campaign with them for more powers for the Scottish Parliament. Perhaps they will find a solution to how the federal policies can be decided on, but I cannot see how England can be expected to accept equality of decision-making with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. That would be undemocratic,

I recognise the insecurities which that suggestion throws up. When approaching a marriage or a choice of career there is a need for a mild degree of recklessness. You do it because you want to, come what may. It is the same for the people of Scotland. Ultimately, they will get more out of their national life with political independence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07012576000205"></a>Finally, what are the risks of staying in this parliamentary union whose 300th anniversary we are commemorating? These risks are, among others: being dragged into more, possibly illegal, wars; attracting terrorism because of superpower-style foreign policy; being subjected to macroeconomic policies that are suitable only to the south-east of England, with the wrong business taxation set-up; continuing to be subsidised, or thinking that one is subsidised; continuing with the dependency culture that the UK Government seem to have created in Scotland; and continuing to be submerged in a multinational state without a national passport.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07012576000206"></a>To conclude, the past 300 years have allowed the parliamentary union to run its course. It is now unnecessary in European terms and the people of these islands will feel better about themselves as they get on with their national lives without the redundant compromises that a multinational state requires. The parliamentary union was a good idea in the era of regal government and inter-European conflict. Those have disappeared and that is worth celebrating. The United Kingdom can continue as a social union and Scotland can re-find its own place in the world. Ultimately, the English-speaking people of north-west Europe will have more influence in the world through having three sovereign governments.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="07012576000208"></a>Often it is only when something familiar has gone that one begins fully to appreciate its true value. Whether it is a tree in a landscape or an old building in a town centre, sometimes only their loss leads to recognition of what they stood for. But if that is so with tangible things like trees or buildings, how much truer it is with something intangible but so much woven in many different ways into the fabric of our lives. That is the difficulty and the danger that we face in seeking to evaluate the Treaty of Union and what it means to us today. It is a treaty with which, after300 years, familiarity seems in some quarters to have bred, if not contempt, at least a measure of discontent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07012576000209"></a>It is easy for Scots to look over the fence to, say, Ireland, to which the noble Lord, Lord McNally, referred, where I suppose the grass is indeed greener, and to forget that for 50 years after independence from the British Crown, that country languished in relative poverty and emigration until it was saved, first, by EU grants&#151;no longer available since EU expansion&#151;and, secondly and dramatically, by a wholly admirable

That is a state of grace that has not yet been attained by the Scottish Executive, the Scottish Parliament or the Scottish electorate, but is one that would be vital to the survival of an independent Scotland&#151;a country where, at present, public expenditure amounts to over 50 per cent of GDP.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07012576000210"></a>I do not believe that the union is the cause of the present dissatisfaction that undoubtedly exists among many Scots and, now, growing numbers in England, but I do believe that the constitutional tampering with the union in recent years is mainly what has called it into question. Unless we acknowledge that the devolution settlement is the cause of the damage and do something about it, that dissatisfaction will grow and fester. I make no apology for having been a robust opponent of devolution, and thus, in a sense, I abandoned principle&#151;devolution in a broader sense being a central tenet of Conservative philosophy&#151;although in opposing it we certainly cannot be accused of advancing political self-interest. We opposed it because we were driven by a stronger principle&#151;the maintenance of the integrity of our nation state.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07012576000211"></a>Appeasement seldom pays, as the past few years have demonstrated, but at least we can now join together in recognising the problem that, far from killing nationalism stone dead, the devolution settlement has given it a new lease of life. We should all now together seek to pursue that higher objective of maintaining the integrity of our United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07012576000212"></a>Like my noble friend Lord MacGregor, I do not believe that the danger is as dire yet as has been claimed in some quarters. There are still a lot of 90-minute nationalists, in the late Jim Sillars&#146;s telling phrase, but the threat is real, could get worse and would be folly to ignore. We have an obligation to approach it in a positive way; first, with specific proposals to stabilise the present untenable imbalance created by the Scotland Act and, secondly, by actively promoting the many and huge benefits that flow both to Scotland and England from the union.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07012576000213"></a>On specific proposals, first and fundamentally, let the Government recognise, however belatedly, that the West Lothian question must be answered. Of course we know that there is no perfect answer short of full federalism, which would be a step too far and create new problems, but, at least as a minimum, let us face reality and stop Scottish MPs voting at Westminster on English domestic matters. Those who look for democratic deficits should consider the fact that, at present, English MPs can have English legislation forced on them by the votes of Scottish MPs. Simple certification by the Speaker of the Commons as to which matters fell into the English law category could easily facilitate the necessary process, in the same way that used to happen with Scottish domestic matters that were then referred to the Scottish Grand Committee. The Prime Minister repeatedly rejects that, solely on the argument that it would create two classes of Westminster MPs; but that blindingly facile and incompetent argument misses the point that the Scotland Act, as my noble friend Lord Forsyth pointed out, has already created two classes of MP, because Scottish MPs cannot vote on education,

All we ask for is even-handedness and fairness for England and Scotland if we are to have a hope of achieving constitutional stability.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07012576000214"></a>Secondly, to enable English MPs to deal with such certified measures, I have long favoured not the separate English parliament that some suggest&#151;that too would go too far and create further anomalies and problems&#151;but why not an English grand committee, in which only English MPs would debate their English business, but whereby the integrity of the United Kingdom Parliament would remain intact? A grand committee can be a highly flexible vehicle, as all the changes that I introduced myself to the Scottish Grand Committee in 1994 demonstrated.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07012576000215"></a>Also, the Government should implement many of the recommendations of the report by the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution on how the mechanisms of devolution have been operating between the United Kingdom&#146;s Government and the Scottish Parliament. In that report published in 2002, we found huge inadequacies and neglect in the establishment and use of mechanisms for dealings between the two Parliaments. Sofa government is not good enough, here or anywhere else. The report made 18 specific recommendations, such as the proper use of the joint ministerial committee, greater openness over the use made of that and other mechanisms, a number of recommendations on the Barnett formula and other expenditure matters, and indeed that consideration be given to ways in which Westminster could benefit from adopting some of the procedures developed by the devolved bodies. Perhaps the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor could tell your Lordships, in winding up, how many of the carefully considered proposals in that report have been accepted and what progress has been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07012576000216"></a>Money, as we always predicted, is at the heart of the tensions and resentments that are now growing on both sides of the Border. Just as the Labour Party fanned the flames of grievance&#151;never a hard task in Scotland&#151;in order to gain support for devolution, so the nationalists are doing the same now to gain support for its offspring, separation. That subject will have to be addressed in depth, impartially and with firmness, openness and fairness to both sides if the union is to survive in the longer term. Time does not allow me to plunge into the detail today; anyway, as the political historian Robert Kernohan once observed,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07012576000217"></a>The real task that we face now is to win the emotional battle and make manifest the reality in all our lives of what being part of this United Kingdom means.

The end of the union would be a tragedy for England, and even more so for Scotland. I am also a strong supporter of Scottish devolution and the existence of the Scottish Parliament, without which the pressure for Scottish independence would be far greater than it is.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07012576000220"></a>However, I am not trying to convert those who want Scottish independence, few of whom are present in your Lordships&#146; House today. I want to try and explain to those who support the union why the exclusion of Scottish MPs from voting on issues solely concerned with England and Wales would lead to the break-up of the union. I talk of England and Wales&#151;and, so far, only the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, has mentioned Wales&#151;because so long as the Welsh do not have the power of primary legislation then England and Wales must remain a single unit for these purposes.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07012576000221"></a>Ironically, the exclusion of Scottish MPs is supported by a great many Conservatives, including all who have so far spoken in this debate&#151;four of whom are, in fact, former Cabinet Ministers. Such exclusion would lead to chaos in circumstances, which happen sometimes, where one party has an overall majority of the seats in England and Wales but is not part of the United Kingdom Government.</p>

<a name="70125-0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07012576000222"></a>Let us take education as an example. That matter is devolved to the Scottish Parliament, so the United Kingdom Parliament would necessarily be responsible for education in England but not in Scotland. If Scottish MPs are excluded, imagine then the position of a Secretary of State for Education and Skills in the UK Government, who would presumably be a member of the governing party. That Secretary of State would have no power to get either primary or secondary legislation on the subject of education through Parliament, because he or she would have no majority. The Opposition, meanwhile, would control the power of voting but would play no part in administering the Department for Education and Skills, and would have no say or control in financing that department. Think of that situation: it is totally and completely unworkable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07012576000223"></a>We could, of course, have a separate English Parliament. It might be workable, but how would it work in fact? First, the English Parliament would insist on taking control of welfare and pensions&#151;the largest element in public spending, and a subject that would be of enormous importance to England. The English Parliament would next insist on setting its own taxes. It would not be prepared to leave control of the raising of funds, which the English Parliament would then need to spend, to a United Kingdom Government controlled by another party. The result would be that the powers of the United Kingdom

Do those powers contain enough glue to keep the union together? Clearly, they do not. The English Government would be far more powerful in everyday life than the United Kingdom Government, and if that happens then Scottish secession from the union seems almost certain.</p>

<a name="70125-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07012576000224"></a>Is there another answer? None is wholly satisfactory but I will suggest that, as I have indicated, we need to recognise that the circumstances giving rise to the English question&#151;or the West Lothian question&#151;are relatively rare. They happen only when one party has an overall majority in England and Wales, but at that time is not part of the United Kingdom Government. That condition can and indeed has occurred, but only rarely&#151;and when it has, the situation is usually unstable and has not lasted long. When that condition occurs, we need a pragmatic acceptance by the United Kingdom Government that they should not impose legislation on England that is not acceptable to a majority of English MPs&#151;although they would, of course, retain ultimate control.</p>

<a name="70125-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07012576000225"></a>I hope that this would become a constitutional convention, to be parted from only in exceptional circumstances. That is the best hope of retaining the union, while removing the right of Scottish MPs to vote on questions affecting England and Wales would have exactly the opposite effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07012576000228"></a>I want to respond to another point made by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth: he said that the way to get over the concept of what it means to be British is to teach history. Now, I am a fan of history and believe that it has an important place, but telling today&#146;s young people about what happened 300 years ago will not necessarily get them to understand what it means to be British in today&#146;s multicultural society. In my view, they want ideas about its relevance to today&#146;s society, not why we chose to get together 300 years ago. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, that Scottish nationalism, at its worst, wants to celebrate the glorious victory at Bannockburn and weep over the atrocities of Culloden. That does not really seem a recipe for taking us forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07012576000229"></a>The criticism of the current state of play seems to centre on devolution and what a terrible curse it has been. That analysis implies that there would have been no criticism whatever if we had just left the union as it was with no devolution. Apparently, everything in the garden would have been rosy. I find that hard to believe. I think that it was a reasonable accommodation at the time and has served us reasonably well. It is not perfect, as more learned commentators have said. The British constitution over the years never reaches a state of perfection, but it just about manages to work its way forward and balance the anxieties of the various parts of our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07012576000230"></a>I thank my noble friend Lord Anderson, although he is not in the Chamber, for reminding us of the problems that can arise from the struggles for national identity. We are certainly seeing a resurgence of that across the world and we cannot ignore it, even though those struggles, as in the example of Canada that my noble friend gave, do not always find a perfect way forward. I was surprised when the noble Lord, Lord McNally, accused the Government of being the most centralised. They have their moments, but they are still the Government who introduced devolution, the most decentralising measure, so I found that remark a bit paradoxical and a tad unfair.</p>

<a name="70125-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07012576000231"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, saw devolution as much more of a curse and failed to recognise that it was a necessary solution to retain a United Kingdom. I enjoyed the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Steel, because it was a measured analysis of the state of the union and suggested how it can develop.</p>

I found it fascinating to hear of the pragmatic and expedient decisions that took place even with regard to the claiming of expenses. I had not thought about that influencing the state of the union, but I should have realised that &#147;plus a change, plus c&#146;est la mme chose&#148;, as they say. I was also interested in the point made by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, when he talked about the global world that we live in now and how, at the same time, we must recognise people&#146;s understandable desire to feel a sense of national identity. That is indeed a telling point.</p>

It is interesting to what extent noble Lords from all parts of the House have been able to relate their personal and family situations and histories to the issue. I should like to refer briefly to my extended family. I am not often regarded in this House as a Scot, but in fact I am. I was born in Edinburgh, as were my parents and three of my grandparents. On my mother's side of the family, we look back to generations of Scottish people, some from fairly humble backgrounds&#151;one of my ancestors was a shepherd on the Lammamuir hills&#151;and some who achieved great eminence in their professions. The great Scottish doctor, Sir Robert Christison, who was physician to Queen Victoria, is an ancestor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07012576000240"></a>On my father&#146;s side, distinctions included the first professor of engineering in Edinburgh University, my great-grandfather. Incidentally, he was tutor to Robert Louis Stevenson, who did not think much of professors or of engineering. Also on my father's side, we can look back to the church. When I listened to Neville Chamberlain telling the country that we were at war, I did so in the home of my great-uncle, who was the Bishop of Argyll and the Isles. Anyone old enough to have heard that broadcast will never forget it; it was one of the great turning points in one&#146;s life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07012576000241"></a>I married a Scottish girl in Edinburgh Cathedral. Her mother&#146;s brother was one of the great generals of the Second World War, Sir Philip Christison, who was the first allied general to defeat the Japanese on land through a very distinguished campaign in Burma. As a young man, he served in the Cameron Highlanders. When I joined the Army just at the end of the war, I joined the Cameron Highlanders and was very proud to wear the tartan of Cameron of Erracht. So were two of my brothers. I was also taught Scottish dancing by a very fierce sergeant major. Three times a week, we paraded at seven o'clock in the morning to learn the steps.</p>

I listened to the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, with some interest and found it slightly strange that he finds himself able to sit on the Liberal Democrat Benches in this House.

The union of Scotland and England, which we celebrate this month, has, as others have said, proved to be one of the most successful, enduring and productive institutions of our time. The Scottish National Party claims that it is the emotions of the Scottish people that justifies their seeking independence from the United Kingdom. I do not deny those emotions, but millions of us, no less proud of our Scottish heritage, are just as emotional about our wish to remain in the United Kingdom. We are entitled to be heard loudly and clearly in all this argument.</p>

I am certainly British. The question &#147;what is English?&#148; is mixed up, and the Tory party&#151;but not all noble Lords here&#151;are dabbling in a dangerous way with English nationalism. It is something we should deplore and they should think hard about where it is taking them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07012576000247"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Shutt of Greetland, I want to talk about the English regions. The English question is an important one in the light of the new constitutional position, and a lot of the answer has to lie in devolution within England. Two years ago we saw the result of the referendum in the north-east. It was an ill-conceived proposal, and I am not surprised that people voted against it, as I would have been tempted to. The result was announced at about two o&#146;clock in the morning on bonfire day, and everybody thought it was English regionalism put on the bonfire for ever. I am not sure that is the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07012576000248"></a>My noble friend Lord McNally referred to a book from the Constitution Unit of University College, London. I refer to another by Mark Sandford, <I>The New Governance of the English Regions</I>, which clearly sets out just how much government is already taking place at regional level within England. He wrote:</p>
<ul><a name="07012576000296"></a>&#147;Regionalisation has slowly and quietly colonised an increasing range of policy debates, becoming an almost ubiquitous feature of the sub-national governance of England&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012576000277"></a>He makes an interesting and useful distinction between &#147;regionalism&#148;&#151;an advocacy or belief in the regional tier of government, particularly a democratic tier&#151;and &#147;regionalisation&#148;. This latter has been taking place surreptitiously but strongly. The system is still developing and growing. It includes a much stronger central government presence in the regions through the

Large numbers of executive agencies and national quangos have strong regional offices to deliver their agendas. I apologise for using &#147;delivering agendas&#148;&#151; this &#147;new Labour&#148;-speak catches up with you.</p>

<a name="70125-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07012576000249"></a>Regional development agencies exist in all the regions. More and more planning takes place at regional level, particularly the regional spatial strategies following the last Planning Bill that went through your Lordships&#146; House a couple of years ago. Structural planning has now been moved up from local government to the regional level in a way that affects us all. Regional economic policy is more and more important, and there are business organisations working at regional level to match this. A plethora of forums, boards and other groups are forming a veritable network of regional policy-making groups, with meetings and a huge amount of internet and personal communications. What ties all these things together is that a great deal of the membership is appointed from above by the Government, and a great deal of the funding comes from above, too. This is how central Government are able to develop and impose their own policy agendas and priorities in a top-down way.</p>

<a name="70125-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07012576000250"></a>I referred to the executive agencies, the regional quangos. There is a huge list of them: Learning and Skills Councils; the Environment Agency; the Arts Council; Sport England; English Heritage; the Countryside Agency and English Nature&#151;which are coming together as Natural England and including the rural development service. The Housing Corporation and English Partnerships are both strong at regional level. We now hear they are to be amalgamated under the rather ludicrous New Labour name of Communities England&#151;I really wish they would not do this. It will take over the whole of the housing market renewal functions, which are certainly important to many parts of the north-west region. There is then the Highways Agency, the strategic health authorities and many more. There are also the strategies and policies that come from these&#151;regional economic strategy, regional spatial strategy, regional transport strategy, regional housing strategy, cultural and waste strategies, strategies for biodiversity, tourism, energy, health, sport and the rural action plan. Of course, because all this exists there have to be integrated regional strategies to try pulling the whole thing together.</p>

<a name="70125-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07012576000251"></a>I do not in anyway criticise the people who are working on this. They are all working hard, doing their best for regions such as the north-west. Yet the democratic accountability is minimal, to put it mildly. In the north of England, some of these organisations come together to form the body called the Northern Way, which seems to have a lot of influence. Nobody quite knows what it is, what it does or how it do it. Every so often people say something is from the Northern Way, and so you have got to do it. If devolution is a process and not an event, the process that is taking place in the English regions is administrative and bureaucratic, and certainly not

It is about strategic co-ordination and planning, a lot of administrative decision-making, a lot of scrutiny, and what the Government call&#151;again I apologise for these words&#151;&#147;the engagement of stakeholders&#148;.</p>

<a name="70125-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07012576000252"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Young of Norwood Green, said that people do not want another layer of government, but we have got it. The problem is that the democratic accountability is not there. Of course there are the regional assemblies, what used to be called chambers, which bring in local government. Yet the real purpose of that is to bring in the local government, get it involved in the top-down decisions and get on board. It is not in any way a democratic, accountable system as we would normally know it. Again in the words of Mark Sandford, it is &#147;mimicking democratic practice&#148;.</p>

<a name="70125-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07012576000253"></a>As a democrat, I want to see real democracy. Democratic regional government has to be revisited. Two years after that miserable failed referendum, it is time to talk seriously again.</p>

It is always disagreeable to have to say that one does not agree with a single thing that a noble Lord has said in the Chamber. This includes the bizarre and geographically challenging notion that Lancashire is not part of England. Tell that to the Chancellor of the Duchy.</p>

<a name="70125-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07012576000255"></a>I have four points to make. First, I like the union. It automatically follows that I liked the excellent speech of my noble friend Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, and agree with absolutely everything that he said in his robust introduction. Like my noble friend, I got an invitation&#151;it was the first time in10 years of Labour rule in this country&#151;to a party at the Scotland Office last week, on Tuesday 16 January, to celebrate the excellence of the union. I went there full of hopes of being entertained by my two hosts. Yet the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Gordon Brown, was unable to be there because he was absent in India dealing with the diplomatic fall-out of the &#147;Big Brother&#148; programme. I had not met and longed to meet Mr Alexander&#151;I hope that he asks me again&#151;but he scuttled off to a television studio rather than spending any time entertaining distinguished guests such as my noble friend and myself. However, I liked the excellent speech by the Leader of the House in another place, Mr Straw, who spoke stalwartly in favour of the union and saved what would otherwise have been a complete social debacle for Her Majesty&#146;s Government in the Scotland Office. I liked whatMr Straw said and commend it to your Lordships. I also liked the party bag that we were given as we left, in the shape of a quite lengthy and well produced document, &#147;United into One Kingdom&#148;, which was written not by spin doctors or special advisers, but by historians.</p>

<a name="70125-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07012576000256"></a>The document is an excellent r&#233;sum&#233; of why the union is what used to be called a good thing, at least in every one of the 25 articles bar one&#151;the second,  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1239"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1239</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which discriminates against what the Act of Union called &#147;papists&#148; in the matter of the succession. I will not dwell on this matter for long, except to ask noble Lords to imagine that, if the Act of Union had discriminated against a religious group, such as Sikhs, against people with some personal orientation, such as lesbians, or against someone with a disability, such as blindness, the other place and this place would be up in arms putting it right. It cannot be allowed to go on, and I look forward to the Lord Chancellor&#146;s response to this in terms in his winding-up speech, particularly in these times of difficulty between the Roman Catholic Church and the state, in which some have sensed a bubbling anti-Catholicism in parts of government.</p>

<a name="70125-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07012576000257"></a>My second point is that the Government have brought on themselves the difficulties that they are in now by their legislation since 1997. For the time being, they have institutionalised constitutional asymmetry in our constitutional arrangements. This wrong will have to be put right by the next Conservative Government.</p>

<a name="70125-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07012576000258"></a>That brings me to my third point. This constitutional anomaly cannot be rectified by introducing an English parliament&#151;perish the thought in an already grossly overgoverned country with a multiplicity of layers on which the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, and his close friend and ally the Deputy Prime Minister want to superimpose a great number of regional bodies. I have done a little rough arithmetic. If one multiplies pro rata the proportion of the electorate to MSPs in Scotland, one can very easily come to a number of, in England, about 1,000 Members of Parliament and the assembly, endlessly arguing about putting right some injustice in Wessex or some misapprehension of pressing social need in the eastern counties, or whatever else would be discussed. The way to put this right, as many of my noble friends have said, is by ensuring that the Scottish voice is properly heard in Westminster and supports Westminster, but that in Westminster Scottish Members of Parliament do not vote on matters that do not concern Scotland. That is a way of underpinning the union, not diminishing it.</p>

<a name="70125-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07012576000259"></a>I do not know what the answer is in whole or in part to the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, who is not in his place at the moment, about what would happen to your Lordships&#146; House, but I suppose that the same logic would apply if there was ever an elected element, not that I think that there should be such an element in your Lordships&#146; House. Otherwise, it is a matter, as my noble friend Lord Forsyth said, for the Government to sort out the mess that they have created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07012576000260"></a>Fourthly, what are we in the Conservative Party going to do, and what are the Government going to do, to right this injustice? We have, in England in particular, the UK Independence Party. I do not see the group represented in the Chamber this afternoon. I hope that those who were my noble friends will soon be back as my noble friends. One of them was good enough to tell me in the Corridor the other day that the two of them meet in a caucus each morning to toss up who should be leader for the day. They have probably not been able to resolve the issue today. Although I  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1240"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1240</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can say that the UKIP policy on withdrawal from Europe is completely wrong&#151;I wholly support the stand of my right honourable friend Mr David Cameron, the leader of the Conservative Party&#151;my party must recognise that there are many people in England who are not necessarily UKIP supporters but who are fed up with the way in which the English are being treated. Some of them may well go to UKIP unless they have a clear indication of what the Conservative Party intends to do to redress the unfortunate situation in which the English electorate are discriminated against by our present constitutional asymmetry. My party cannot and must not go into the next general election without having a clear policy on this. I do not suggest that it should have one now; there is plenty of time between now and whenever the next general election is to address this issue.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07012576000261"></a>Lastly, although we may now have a few problems not with the details of UKIP policy but with the growing English backlash against Scottish over-representation, major problems will come to bite the next Labour Government. The dulcet tones of the leadership of the Labour Party, desperate for English votes, will echo around the hustings and the media studios at the next general election, so let me name a few members of that leadership: Mr Alexander,Mr Gordon Brown, Mr Des Browne, Mr Darling and Dr&#151;as he prefers to be known&#151;John Reid. They will find a considerable backlash from the English constituencies from which they desperately need English votes to form another Government if they have not addressed the unease of the English at the discrimination against them. I promise the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, who said that we should simply tell people to forget it, calm down and leave it alone, that this issue will not be left alone at the next general election.</p>

His speech was very much one of two halves. The first half was a finely argued and eloquent defence of the union, one of the best that I have heard. The second half was back to the old Michael Forsyth, doing what he does pretty well&#151;making narrow, partisan, party advantage points and dressing them up as the highest form of political altruism. That has always been his trade mark. I have fond memories of the noble Lord during his time as Secretary of State for Scotland. Rather, I have one fond memory&#151;let us not overstate it&#151;which is of the noble Lord looking absolutely splendid in his kilt as he escorted the Stone of Destiny across the bridge at Coldstream. It was a magnificent occasion, and the noble Lord, as he was not then, was particularly outstanding. The only trouble is that it did not do a great deal for the union or for the fortunes of his party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07012576000263"></a>Let us turn to the issues. To be quite honest, I am not prepared to take any lessons on maintaining the union from the party opposite. It is not that I doubt its sincerity; I do not. I think that it is totally sincere in seeking the continuation of the union, which is a great tradition in that party. It has simply gone about it in  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1241"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1241</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>completely the wrong way. In the 1990s, it stretched the union perilously close to breaking point. I invite noble Lords on a trip to a political wonderland and ask them to imagine the Conservative Party winning the May 1997 election without any Conservative MPs in Scotland. What would have been the nature of the constitutional debate that would have followed that outcome? Quite honestly, its policies on devolution and on the union have been tried and tested and found wanting by the people of Scotland, who have rejected it. Let us not take any lessons from the party opposite on how to defend the union, because it brought the union to a testing point at which the answer maywell have been one that none of us would havewanted.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07012576000264"></a>I shall not speak for long on the subject of English votes for English laws, as I spoke on it in our debate led by the noble Lord, Lord Baker of Dorking. However, I must ask the party opposite why this has become such an immediate and urgent issue now, given that for most of the 20th century it raised no objection to the situation brought about by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, which established virtually the same relationship with regard to Members of Parliament from Northern Ireland as the Scotland Act 1998 established with regard to Scottish Members. Could it be that that period of deafening silence was quite simply because the Conservative Party was in formal alliance with the Ulster Unionist Party? If there is not a convincing answer to that question, we have to suspect the motives behind the sudden interest in the argument for English votes for English laws.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07012576000265"></a>If devolution is to endure and flourish, I believe that it must be based on fairness for Scotland, England and the rest of the United Kingdom. Although I reject English votes for English laws, I think that there is a case to be made that some work and some thinking still need to be done on representation and public expenditure. However, that needs to be done with a view that looks forward to strengthening the union and does not try to make narrow points.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07012576000266"></a>As has been demonstrated in this debate, we are all, to some extent, products, if not prisoners, of our own biographies. I was born in the south of England; I was brought up in the north of England; my first job was in Wales; and I have lived most of my life in Scotland. I am British. Britishness is a value that is absolutely essential to my identity, and I wish to see it preserved, but in a way that strengthens the diversity of the United Kingdom&#151;a way that devolution has provided.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07012576000267"></a>I have one question, which I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, will answer when he winds up for the Liberal Democrats. The question looks forward to May and the Scottish elections, and after those elections. If&#151;and I hope and believe that this outcome will never come about&#151;there should be the possibility of a change of administration, would the Liberal Democrats sustain in power in Scotland a party that has as its principal policy the dismemberment of the union? It is important that we have an answer to that question as soon as possible.</p>

Frequently on occasions such as this when I am preparing my speech and listening to the previous speakers, I find that I have got bored. It has been the opposite on this occasion, which is testimony to the timeliness of my noble friend Lord Forsyth introducing this debate. I have enjoyed and have become more interested in the topic as it has proceeded. I do not know whether many other noble Lords went in the autumn last year to the Sir Thomas More lecture at Lincoln&#146;s Inn. Our judge in the European Court of Justice, Sir Konrad Schiemann, explained that in his view we are living at an interesting time in history because the nature of international relations is changing as the very nature of the world and society we live in is changing. Of course, political systems are propelled by what is going on in the outside world, and not the other way around.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07012584000008"></a>In Sir Konrad&#146;s view, one of the consequences of this change is that we are moving back towards a slightly different and older hierarchy of loyalties. Instead, perhaps, of a 19th century mono-focus on the nation, we are returning to a world where there is a hierarchy of complementary and not conflicting loyalties, among which obviously one can find: one&#146;s family; religion; in my case, the Conservative Party; Cumbria where I live, which, interestingly, was once part of Scotland until captured by William Rufus; the north of England; England as a whole; and Britain and Europe. In this context, I believe that the absolutely crucial political circumstance for stability in a free society is that any person or community must be prepared to accept the legitimacy of a decision with which they fundamentally disagree. If that breaks down, we are all in trouble. I think that the circumstances where that can apply may and do change over time.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07012584000009"></a>It is interesting to look at the relationships that existed between England and Scotland during the past 1,000 years. I learnt from those who taught me that roughly from the time of St Margaret and Malcolm III about 1,000 years ago until the English Plantagenet incursions, the countries were coming closer together. Obviously, after the Plantagenet involvement, they drifted further apart. Then we had James VI of Scotland becoming James I of England and the pendulum swung again. It may be that the pendulum is swinging a bit in the opposite direction now, although I pray for reasons I will mention later that it will not go as far as a schism or partition.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07012584000010"></a>I agree with those who argue&#151;I have to admit to being a Buchanan-Smithite Conservative&#151;that the pre-devolution relationship between England and Scotland had become unsatisfactory and unfair. That is because it was perceived&#151;I think that it was the case&#151;that the English were telling the Scots what to do, not because it was necessary for good governance but because the system in place made it inevitable in the circumstances of the time that that happened. I say this with some diffidence in the presence of a number of distinguished Conservatives, but, as a Conservative from the north of England, and from the perspective of the north of England, part of the problem that the Conservative Party has had is that it was perceived, rightly or  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1243"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1243</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>wrongly, as being the emanation of the sentiments of a south-east of England golf club. In the late 1980s and 1990s, there was an idea that real northerners and real Scots do not vote Tory. It was not a matter of predilection, it was a matter of definition, which is why I am glad that our new leader is trying to change that&#151;and more strength to his arm, say I. Whatever words one uses, it is difficult to be a credible unionist party if you have very little support in some of the component parts of that union.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07012584000011"></a>I believe that the problem of devolution is that it has created another problem which is more or less the mirror-reversal of the previous difficulty; that is, Scots have an excessive and unnecessary role in England. Here, there is an interesting parallel with the early years of the reign of James I in this country when there was widespread criticism of the Scots King and his favourites, for which one can now read Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers. As J M Barrie put it in the early part of the last century,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="07012584000232"></a>&#147;There are few more impressive sites in the world than a Scotsman on the make&#148;.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07012584000012"></a>In particular, it seems that it is felt that Scots politicians have too much political say in English domestic affairs and, as other noble Lords have said, that Scotland gets too much money from England, which means that they can have things that we are told we cannot afford&#151;for example, university top-up fees. It may even be untrue, but that does not matter because it is the perception that matters. These things rankle with people a lot. As they say, something must be done to get things back in kilter. I do not want noble Lords to get me wrong: I do not think that it necessarily follows from that that we have to mirror what has happened in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland in England. We need an English solution to an English problem which is compatible with the framework of the union.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07012584000013"></a>The party opposite appreciated that there was a potential problem and thought that they had solved it with their plans for regional government, but I do not think that regional government was the answer, as the people of the north-east of England said emphatically, because it entirely fails the test of political legitimacy. There is no natural homogeneity over the regions that have been identified. I believe, as does a noble Lord who spoke earlier, that Spain provides an extremely interesting and instructive example of the wayin which internal constitutional change can beexercised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07012584000014"></a>We want to be clear that there is nowhere an immutably precise constitutional definition of the union. It is something more than the sum of its component parts. It is also important that as the world evolves, in order for institutions to survive, they must evolve with it. I am an Englishman by birth. I believe that my Englishness is enhanced by being British. I am a British genetic mongrel: I am a bit English, but principally Anglo-Irish&#151;not that they exist any more because of the collapse of another union. Perhaps I may now illustrate that in literary terms: my culture is as much Carlyle and Scott or Yeats and Synge as Milton and Shakespeare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07012584000015"></a>It seems to me that the identity of Britishness is a curious combination of what in continental jurisdiction is known as &#147;jus solis&#148;, or where you come from, and &#147;jus sanguinis&#148;, or who your ancestors are. It is that combination that I think is so potent, and which makes Britishness so precious and why, if the union were to break up, we would all be losers. That would be as true for the English as for the Scots.</p>

I joined the Unionist Party in Scotland many years ago and recall, even at time, that a union jack draped the platform in some of the meetings&#151;something I expect the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, will never had had the pleasure to have seen.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07012584000017"></a>Nothing that has happened since those days has changed my allegiance from my party, as there is no doubt that the unity of the United Kingdom has been very beneficial to Britain&#146;s influence in the world. However, there is definitely a feeling of uncertainty creeping in in Scotland and even friends who are not political are starting to wonder what has changed and what the future holds. In other words, is the union under threat, and if so, why?</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07012584000018"></a>I should have thought that the cause is pretty obvious. If there is an election pending&#151;as there is&#151;and if the Government in power are having a rough time, people look around for an alternative. In Scotland&#146;s case, that seems at the moment to be the SNP. All Governments that are in power for several years are liable to fall from grace. This Labour Government are no exception, what with the Iraq war and all the recent antics in the Home Office, to name just two events. Yet they have by law to face the Scottish electorate in May. The Government, albeit with liberal involvement in Scotland, are of the same political persuasion both north and south of the Border.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07012584000019"></a>If we examine the alternative, it is of an SNP that is determined to take Scotland out of the union and which tells the electorate that they would be better off as a separate nation, like the Republic of Ireland, where corporation tax is 12.5 per cent as opposed to 30 per cent in the UK&#151;people are envious of a low tax rate. Surely, however, a Scotland governed by a socialist SNP will be almost certain to follow the exact opposite path to that which has made Ireland rich&#151;low tax on those who came to invest there and create the wealth so successfully. As a leading article in the <I>Spectator</I> this week said, any Scot loyal to his country&#146;s greatest economist&#151;Adam Smith&#151;would rapidly conclude that the wealth of Scotland is best preserved by keeping the SNP far from power, and that all the SNP would achieve would be to increase Scots&#146; public spending while cutting off the cross-subsidy from England which sustains it. In the light of this, and speaking more as a businessman&#151;having been involved in many Scottish companies and even as chairman of a joint Scottish bank&#151;surely it is time for the captains of industry in Scotland, collectively and individually, to take the floor. They should not be standing on the touchline but getting into the game.

The time is now.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07012584000020"></a>Listening to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, one would think that he bore no responsibility for where we stand now with the union. Yet it is the lopsided arrangement, as has been said by so many noble Lords today, of what passes for the Scotland Act that is aggravating the situation. If Tam Dalyell had been ennobled by the Prime Minister to sit on the Benches opposite, he would explain much better than I can why some call the current arrangements a constitutional anomaly.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07012584000021"></a>Speaking as a past chairman of a large pension fund I am afraid that I cannot forgive the Chancellor for virtually killing off good, defined benefit schemes by his total removal of ACT in one of his early budgets and for which we have suffered ever since. Not least to suffer have been the workers who have now had to put up with defined contribution schemes as a poor substitute. As the bully in the Scottish playground said when challenged by the teacher, &#147;It wisnae me&#148;&#151;and I do not need to interpret this for the noble and Learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. But it was him. And if the Chancellor appears to say any different of the threat to the union now and blame everyone else, he is saying, &#147;It wisnae me&#148;. And I reply with, &#147;It willnae do&#148;. For he and his colleagues, by agreeing to a lopsided and flawed arrangement which is the devolution settlement, is entirely to blame. As for his attack on the Conservative and Unionist Party, he has a nerve to do so. As the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, said on another matter, I will not take that from him. No, let us hope sense prevails in the May elections and the Unionist Party succeeds in stopping the SNP from obtaining power. When it is all over, a serious debate has to take place. I was interested and pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, saying that there was work to be done. Yes, there is work to be done. Work must be done on the removal of the Barnett formula and sorting all the financial affairs and Scotland and rest of the United Kingdom. There is also work to be done on what purports to be the West Lothian question. If this Government do not take the initiative, their successor must, if all the advantages of the United Kingdom are to be preserved.</p>

Indeed, he has chopped at least two minutes off my speech by referring to the unionists. During my youth I thought of unionists as people I saw in portraits, with moustaches and watch chains&#151;senior citizens and, indeed, the type of person I might find if I came into your Lordships&#146; House. The problem is that I am now considerably older than some of those who would have been depicted in those pictures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07012584000023"></a>Then I hear about the union. In my youth, I spent the first eight years of my life virtually entirely in Scotland, and the union jack was flying everywhere. I certainly became aware of the union jack during the

My father served with Scots Guards and as far as I can remember, many of his friends and many of those in the regiment came from south of the Border. Whether they were what I call Surrey Highlanders, Scots resident, I am not too sure. But the British Army and the regiment that I had the honour to serve with, after my father, came from throughout the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07012584000024"></a>1956 was a cathartic year for me. It was my last year at school. One must be careful about referring to noble Lords who are no longer in the Chamber but that would also have been the last year for the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, because Heart of Midlothian won the Scottish Cup&#151;indeed, I had the privilege of being in Scotland to see them do this. About a week after this great event, we had an event on the Kinnordy Estate during which a leading lawyer from Edinburgh came up and asked my mother what I would be doing when I left school. My mother replied with a wonderful backhand, &#147;Come and look after the broad acres&#148;. However, fortunately this lawyer had a bright idea and said that perhaps I might join one of the great institutions in Scotland, or might see if they would admit me one day to membership. Indeed it was thought fit and decreed that I should try to become a member of the Chartered Accountants of Scotland. I commenced my apprenticeship on 1 October 1962. They admitted me to a membership on 13 October 1967, with a request for 50 guineas, which I thought was quite reasonable. I am extremely proud of this. It was one of the proudest moments of my life&#151;that I managed to qualify under Scottish rules for a great institution that spreads throughout the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07012584000025"></a>But that insight into Scotland and Scottish showed me that the capital city of Scotland is Edinburgh. As my noble friends Lord Forsyth and Lord Sanderson will realise, in the 50 years since then Edinburgh has grown into one of the most flourishing cities in terms of finance and financial services in the United Kingdom. All credit is due to the Scots and perhaps also to those who have come in from elsewhere in the United Kingdom and all over the world.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07012584000026"></a>However, I ask noble Lords to proceed north out of the capital city, away from the media and the constant strivings of our new Scottish Parliament&#151;together with the other great city of Scotland&#151;and come up into the kingdom of Fife. Carry on through the old capital of Scotland, certainly it was the capital in 1437 when the ancestors of the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, killed King James I in the Blackfriars&#146; monastery. From there, come on to the area where I live because when you enter the county of Angus, you will find what I think is known as the source of Scotland. My noble friend Lord Forsyth is an honorary Angus man, as I am, and there should be plenty of others. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, probably is one. I do not know whether my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour is, let alone my noble and learned friend Lord Fraser of Carmyllie. But that five noble Lords in this House should come from one particular region of Scotland shows that we do have strength in the regions outside the great Scottish cities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07012584000027"></a>There are many advantages for those who live north of the Border in that there is plenty of space and the distances are great. The downside is that travel throughout Scotland can be difficult, as can some communications because of the unique nature of our geography. But the same goes for England and Wales, and one day it would be interesting to hear from the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor on whether they have the same challenges.</p>

<a name="70125-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07012584000028"></a>There is one more thing of which I have a tiny experience; that is, of living and working in the United Kingdom with a land border. Some years ago, in her wisdom my noble friend Lady Thatcher decided I should follow another eminent Scot, the Earl of Mansfield, in serving in the Northern Ireland Office. There one found a land border on a fellow island of the British Isles with different tax rates, different laws&#151;indeed, a totally independent country with borders and customs arrangements, yet things seemed to work. Reference has been made to the Partition, the separation of the island of Ireland into the Republic of Ireland and Commonwealth. Indeed, the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, who I am glad to see back in his place, referred to an idea concerning independent armed forces. A little banner is going through my mind that says, &#147;The Magnificent Mar in his Flying Machine&#148;. I am not quite sure how he envisages defending an independent Scotland from the air with goodness knows what armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07012584000029"></a>However, I have some experience of what can happen with different tax rates and so forth. Certainly in the area of agriculture in Northern Ireland we had immense fun with that sort of thing. Can noble Lords imagine that going on between Scotland and England, with cattle carrying some subsidies and sheep carrying different ones, as happened on the island of Ireland? I see that my noble friend Lord Sanderson is beaming. When he had responsibility for agriculture in Scotland I am sure he would have liked to have those subsidies as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07012584000030"></a>I conclude by thanking my noble friend Lord Forsyth for giving us the opportunity to celebrate what I believe has been an enormously successful union, and I am very proud to be a part of it&#151;except possibly on some Saturdays. On certain sporting occasions I am tempted to cheer on the North Koreans at, say, Wembley. A noted politician once said that we in Scotland are &#147;90-minute nationalists&#148;. Once the game is over and the minor differences are gone, I am delighted, proud and very happy to serve in your Lordships&#146; House or elsewhere and to be friends with my colleagues all over the United Kingdom.</p>

It is where I moved to and participated in politics in the late 1980s and beginning of the 1990s: it is Cornwall. Cornwall is a nation, a duchy and, of course, a county as well. Its union with England goes back to the 10th century, but even after that it had a Stannary Parliament which to a degree still exists and has a little legal force, although it is not exactly a democratic organisation. Cornwall has its own language, which is recognised as a European minority language. I had the great privilege of representing Cornwall in the European Parliament during the 1990s.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07012584000032"></a>When I first became involved in Cornwall, one of the great issues in the area was that of economic decline. In fact, like many of the other Celtic nations in the United Kingdom, it too had troubles with its traditional industries, those of fishing, farming and tin-mining. Many professionals and workers from that industry emigrated across the globe and throughout the empire in the 19th century, particularly to Canada and South Africa. That diaspora had a great reputation worldwide, and still does. Yet it was a time of great problems.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07012584000033"></a>During the 1990s and into this century, through its own hard work and with the assistance of the European Commission and of Governments of both colours in terms of changing rules and boundaries and giving economic assistance, Cornwall has managed to move away from those difficulties and has become a successful part of the United Kingdom in terms of its economic performance. It has a combined university for the county, it boasts the Eden Project and, if one looks at the indicators that are probably being considered in Davos in terms of the height of economic attainment, Cornwall does now have a Jamie Oliver restaurant to add to its fame.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07012584000034"></a>The point that has been made clear to me during the economic transformation that has started to really move forward over the past decade is that the concern, fear and resentment towards England I perceived when I began my political career&#151;although it did not show itself in a strong movement towards regional independence&#151;has, with increasing economic success, changed into a higher level of self-confidence within the community. With that increase in self-confidence there has been a change. No longer is there much of a drive for independence or growth in political parties like Mebyon Kernow or the Stannary Parliament. Rather, with increased self-confidence, Cornwall feels itself to be a much more equal partner with the rest of the south-west region and is able to hold its head high. No longer is there any of the inward and backward-looking behaviour that was the negative part of its great cultural and industrial heritage.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07012584000035"></a>From experience of the fourth Celtic nation of the United Kingdom, we can learn two small lessons. The first is that with economic success and moving towards the right sort of governance, communities and nations have increased confidence in themselves and do not look to move on; they are happy to be partners within a broader political framework. Devolution has conferred on Scotland self-confidence

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07012584000036"></a>If regional government and regional devolution are to have any chance of working in England, they need to relate to natural communities which see themselves as individual units. That is the case in Cornwall but it is not the case in many of the English regions that have been created bureaucratically but do not have public support. For devolution to move forward in England, which I believe is right, it has to have a democratic and popular mandate and its boundaries need to relate to natural communities; at the moment they do not.</p>

He was one of the architects of the Treaty of Leith, which laid the foundations for Scotland&#146;s inheritance of the English throne mentioned by my noble friend Lord Forsyth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07012584000040"></a>I am not sure that I agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that,</p>
<ul><a name="07012584000240"></a>&#147;a national debate about Britishness and the future of Britain is overdue&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012584000223"></a>My observation is that up and down the country there has been for some time now a greatly increased level of debate about these matters. I welcome the launch of the new &#163;2 coin bearing the inscription, &#147;United into one Kingdom&#148;, but think that the Government should have done more to celebrate the anniversary of the Act of Union, and as the Chancellor said,</p>
<ul><a name="07012584000241"></a>&#147;to acknowledge Great Britain for the success it has been and is&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012584000224"></a>But he is trying to have it both ways because he goes on to say that we are,</p>
<ul><a name="07012584000242"></a>&#147;a model for the world of how nations can not only live side by side, but be stronger together but weaker apart&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07012584000041"></a>It is, of course, a fact that England and Scotland are side by side but I believe that since the Act of Union we are one nation, comprising two peoples, or indeed three or four peoples, and that is what has made us stronger. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, might wish to include the Cornish as an additional distinct people. But if we are to revert to being two nations or more, by definition we would be apart and, as the Chancellor says, weaker. I believe that Scotland&#146;s

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07012584000042"></a>I lived in Japan for many years and noticed the many Scots among those who have built up and led the Asian operations of British businesses across all sectors. The Scottish contribution to our Armed Forces cannot be overstated, but I fear that the amalgamation of such great and proud regiments as the Black Watch and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders into a single amorphous infantry regiment called the Royal Regiment of Scotland will harm morale and regimental spirit, making a difficult recruiting situation even worse.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07012584000043"></a>Frankly, it beggars belief that Mr Brown is attempting to wear the mantle of protector of the union. Amazingly, the Chancellor praises my noble friend Lady Thatcher for rightly defending the union even when not expedient to do so. But unlike the Chancellor, my noble friend did not choose to defend things depending on expediency&#151;rather, it was on whether she believed in them.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07012584000044"></a>Noble Lords will remember that the previous Government consistently opposed devolution of the kind that this Government have introduced, correctly predicting that it would weaken the union and increase pressure for separation. The constitutional vandalism wrought by this Government will have consequences which will be very difficult for their successors to sort out. Surely what the Government should have done to respond to growing demands for Scottish votes for Scottish laws was to introduce legislation providing that Members of Parliament representing Scottish constituencies would meet in Edinburgh on certain days to debate and decide devolved matters, and attend here at Westminster on other days to debate and decide reserved matters. Such a grand committee of Scottish Members of Parliament could even have been called the Scottish Parliament. Such a system would have been entirely logical because Members of Parliament for English constituencies would continue to meet here on the days when their Scottish colleagues met in Edinburgh to handle devolved business. I think that this is also what my noble friend Lord Lang of Monkton proposed. Support in Wales for devolution was only from one-quarter of the electorate, but if there was really a strong demand for Welsh votes for Welsh laws, a similar arrangement could be introduced for Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07012584000045"></a>I know that we are where we are but I believe that in the longer term we have two alternatives. One is to retain the form of a unitary state but respond to the demand for devolved decision-making in some way such as that which I have suggested. The other alternative is to correct the illogical asymmetry of the Government&#146;s constitutional settlement, which is obviously not at all settled, by equalising the degree of devolution between Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and doing something similar for England involving the creation of an English Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="07012584000225"></a>But the Trojan horse for separation is the Scottish Parliament itself in the form created by this Government. Those writers who the Chancellor claims are anti-unionist are simply recognising the political difficulty of adopting the first of the two alternatives that we face in solving the mess. They recognise that the second alternative, the creation of a symmetric federal system, is a much easier road to follow. However difficult it may seem and however many complications will need to be addressed, we should follow the more difficult road and preserve the unity of this great United Kingdom which has gained, and continues to gain, so much from its cultural richness and the special contributions of all its people.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07012584000047"></a>It certainly appears that Scots are already seriously disillusioned with the Scottish Parliament in its present form, as only 49 per cent of the electorate bothered to vote at the 2003 elections. The noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, claimed that only 10 per cent of Scots are in favour of the abolition of the Scottish Parliament. However, I should be interested to know how Scots would respond to the question: would you support the reform of the Scottish Parliament so that it would in future consist of the Members of Parliament for Scottish constituencies meeting in Edinburgh to consider devolved matters?</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07012584000048"></a>I look forward to the speeches of other noble Lords and in particular to hearing how the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor intends to deal with the West Lothian question, which really must now be addressed.</p>

However, I believe that it should have been a government Motion to celebrate 300 years of the union. I agree with my noble friend that it is very disappointing, but typical, that the Government have done so little to celebrate one of the great success stories of modern Europe.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07012584000050"></a>There have always been, and always will be, friendship as well as tensions between Scotland and England, just as there are within Scotland and within England. Scotland is dominated by the central belt whereas in England it is London and the south-east that is the powerhouse. Opinions change over time and the pendulum swings between the advantages and disadvantages of any union between the two countries. John, Earlof Caithness in 1289 supported the proposed marriage of Margaret, the Maid of Norway and heiress to the crown of Scotland, to Prince Edward, heir to the throne of England. However, his son Magnus supported Robert the Bruce and signed the Declaration of Arbroath. Alexander, Earl of Caithness voted against the Treaty of Union in 1706, which was very unpopular throughout Scotland. He was the last surviving Peer of that old Scottish Parliament. Only six years after the Treaty of Union in 1713, the Earl of Findlater moved a Motion for a Bill to break the union which was defeated in this House by only four votes, all of them proxies.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07012584000051"></a>So restlessness on both sides is nothing new, but this time it is set against a very different background due to what has happened since the end of the last war. In Europe we are extremely fortunate that we have enjoyed such an unprecedented period of peace. One of the ingredients of the union from the English point of view was to bind together with the Scots against the French. When the present situation is taken for granted and there is no common enemy that is often the time when friends reassess and question their relationship. The empire has gone. When I was growing up I lived in Britain; that did not stop me shouting for Scotland at Murrayfield&#151;whereas now the UK is just another European country. Many in Scotland believe that it has moved from being a partner in a global imperial enterprise to being a region in a member state and part of their resentment of the EU is a sense that it is part of their downgrading.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07012584000052"></a>Then, of course, there is devolution. The West Lothian question has been well aired so I will not comment further on that. But I would like to pick up a point that my noble friend Lord Forsyth made. He told us that the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, said that English votes for English laws would be a Trojan horse for separation. That is not what he said in 1980. He wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="07012584000233"></a>&#147;Most of all, a revised Scotland Act could embody some form of the &#145;in and out&#146; principle. Under such a principle the remaining Scottish MPs at Westminster would not be allowed to take part in the proceedings of the House when it was debating England or Welsh domestic matters ... Labour ... may be expected to consider a plan along these lines in the future&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012584000226"></a>The Chancellor has clearly reneged on his beliefs.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07012584000053"></a>We have heard that Scotland receives more from the taxpayer than some parts of England. On the other hand there is concern in Scotland that the English continue to have an attitude of arrogant superiority which was exemplified by William Attwood's pamphlet in 1704, <I>The Superiority and Direct Dominion of the Imperial Crown of England over the Crown and Kingdom of Scotland</I>.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07012584000054"></a>So what of the future? There is no question that Scotland can be independent, even perhaps if it allows Orkney and Shetland to go back to Norway. There are smaller and less prosperous countries in Europe. The two questions the Scots have to determine are whether they would be better off or whether they would be better governed by being independent. If the evidence from the performance of the Scottish Executive is anything to go by, the answer to the second is probably no for those of us who live in the far north. I think that we did better under a Westminster Government than we would under a Scottish one dominated by the central belt. So far as local government is concerned, it will barely exist in Caithness as from May, for the Scottish Executive have built on the disastrous reform that we made when in government with the creation of the Highland Council by centralising even more power in Inverness.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07012584000055"></a>Will Scotland be better off? Again I have to answer no to that question on the evidence to date. From the perspective of Scotland as a nation, I believe that each of the constituent parts of the United Kingdom  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1253"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1253</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can exercise greater influence in the world and achieve more together than would ever be the case if they were separate nations. When it comes to the vital concerns of terrorism and defence, there is no doubt that sitting at the top table is very much in Scotland's interest. That is very important in all the international fora and particularly in the EU. It might well be that how we handle this within the union needs to be reassessed for there is a strong perception north of the Border that in our negotiations within Europe the Scottish voice is not being taken enough into account.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07012584000056"></a>To the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, I would say that the reality of working in Brussels is being able to form a blocking minority when one's interests are jeopardised. As from 1 January this year, 91 or more votes out of a total of 345 will be enough to block a proposal. At present the UK has 29 votes and thus only needs to ally with another 62. If Scotland was to be independent and accepted as a member of the EU, then it is likely to have only seven votes whereas England and Wales might well stay on 29 but at worst reduce to 27. It would be very much harder for Scotland to put together a blocking minority and it would stand a greater chance of having alien legislation forced upon it.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07012584000057"></a>The other perspective of being better off is purely the cash one. An independent Scotland could choose one of two options. It could follow the Irish model which, as we have heard, has become good only by following a low-tax, deregulatory, free-market and pro-business agenda; or it could follow the Scandinavian model, which is what the Scottish Executive lean to, of high taxes and socialist intervention.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07012584000058"></a>The main driver in the Scottish economy is the financial service sector, which contributes one-fifth to the gross value added. As a proportion of the total economy only the United States has a larger financial service share than Scotland. Since 1999 this sector&#146;s GVA has averaged 3.1 per cent. However, only 20 per cent of its output is for the Scottish market; of the rest 90 percent is for the English consumer. Even with this success story the annual GVA in Scotland has been less than that of the UK in five out of the last seven years and on a par with it for the other two. It has never in this period exceeded the UK&#146;s. This underlines the importance of the financial sector to the future prosperity of Scotland. Separation from England would pose a whole new challenge to it and London would become a powerful and aggressive competitor.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07012584000059"></a>The question for the English is, do they really care? Whatever the Scots did to help create a prosperous union, an empire and more recently to protect our freedoms in the last century, is history. The Scots are increasingly seen as an expensive addition in an unequal treaty. Should there be independence for Scotland the political landscape of England would change hugely. The Labour Party would clearly be a loser but some would shed no tears over that. More worryingly there would be increased tensions between the affluent south-east and other areas. The arguments that are being deployed now about the Scots would resurface for another area of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07012584000060"></a>The Act of Union may not have merged England and Scotland into a single country but it has lasted 300 years and brought many benefits to both countries. There is no comparison to it anywhere in the world and it has been a very great achievement. It is now being questioned in a way not seen for hundreds of years. Devolution is but a slippery slope and has not been the success it was intended to be. It is unfinished business as more powers have been sought for the Scottish Executive. The logic of the next step, independence, is that it does not need positive argument. If the union is to persist it must be argued for now. It needs to work better and more fairly if we are to keep something as successful as this union, but I would rather try than let it go by default or lack of interest.</p>

It is fascinating to me to follow my near neighbour the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, and to be able to agree with him at least in the general proposition that perceptions of the union have fluctuated since it was finally implemented on 1 May 1707, although the concept of union was a lot earlier than that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07012584000062"></a>I have to say in parenthesis that, despite my neighbourly outlook, I totally disagree with the noble Earl&#146;s view about how the north highlands is being deprived of local government. I would attribute the blame squarely to the former Secretary of State for Scotland, the noble Lord, Lord Lang of Monkton, who set up the Highland Regional Council. But let me not be diverted into such byways, as they may be perceived.</p>

<a name="70125-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07012584000063"></a>The differences of opinion go back centuries. In the 16th century, we had two distinguished Scottish historians at the University of Paris. One was Hector Boece, who wrote the tendentious account of the history of Scotland that provided Shakespeare with the mythological account of the story of Macbeth on which he relied heavily. At the same, time there was a fascinating account of the history of the British Isles&#151;or Greater Britain as it was called, albeit in Latin&#151;written by one John Major, a unionist of his day, followed in some respects by his perhaps better-remembered successor of the same name.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07012584000064"></a>After the Act of Union, opinion continued to fluctuate and the strength of the union, certainly in holding at bay the intrusions by a dominant partner that characterised the period of the union of the Crowns, of which my noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie spoke with a degree of sympathy&#151;some will recall it as the century in which Cromwell sought to impose his solutions across Scotland&#151;was not entirely appreciated. Recognition of the strength of the union, in its positive sense, was slow to come. Although 15 of the 25 aspects of the treaty were economic, the benefits were not felt instantly. Perhaps not until the end of the Seven Years&#146; War in 1763 was there full recognition in Scotland, and the United

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07012584000065"></a>One must acknowledge the persistence of myths, for example the myth that that achievement was the result of bribery. The scholarly view today in Scotland, as elsewhere, notably advanced by Christopher Whatley, a professor of history at Dundee, is that that myth is largely based upon the testimony of the disgruntled and mischief-making Jacobite George Lockhart of Carnwath and subsequent arguments have been based on it.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07012584000066"></a>We should be determining our future constitutional settlement not on the basis of re-fought battles or reminiscences, some of which are not entirely personal, but on our calculations of where the advantage of the constituent parts of our country lies. The Scotland Act, which is recently enacted, is an important step towards some of the constitutional principles that we ought to be embodying in a modern British constitution. I do not wholly go along with the view of the noble Lord, Lord Lang, that it is not possible to reflect in a written constitution principles that are lasting, effective and democratically accountable. India is a good example in a relatively modern period, as it has shown a stability and strength that have greatly assisted it. Many in this country would aspire to have our freedoms, which are not infrequently under attack these days, embodied in a written constitution.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07012584000067"></a>The relationship of the parts to the whole of the United Kingdom has been defined by written constitution, and it is certainly not perfect. In that, I go along with the general view of many speakers in this debate, including that of the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, who eloquently defended the union. I do not accept his prescriptions, which seem to embody the highly partisan and dangerous proposals of the Conservative Party first advanced in this House by the noble Lord, Lord Baker, in a debate in which he once again resurrected the idea of English votes for English measures, wholly failing to acknowledge that most so-called English measures, on expenditure at least, have a direct impact on all constituent parts of the United Kingdom. The formula adjusts up and down the money available to those parts, and it would be virtually impossible to tear those measures apart satisfactorily.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07012584000068"></a>The strength of the union will surely be enhanced if we look to achieve greater effectiveness, fairness and democratic accountability. It is always possible for us to improve these things in the light of experience. We should recognise that the purpose of the union is not only to address those questions but also to enable the Scots as much as the English to have an international role, which without the union it is quite inconceivable they could play.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07012584000069"></a>As individuals, Scots missionaries and so forth have played a notable part overseas, but the real strength of the Scots has been as part of the wider union. My judgment is that the Scots would not opt for a Baltic solution, as advocated in some quarters,

The voice of the Scot in the international councils needs to be heard and will be heard so long as the union is preserved and developed. Its development is critical. We do not have to worry about the loss of cultural identity. The Scots have a flourishing cultural life, with probably more internationally recognised writers&#151;I think not only of JK Rowling and the Harry Potter<I></I>series&#151;than at any time in modern life, perhaps since Sir Walter Scott, who was a creature of the union.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07012584000070"></a>Scotland also has economic strength. References have been made in this debate to the importance of the financial sector. That, too, must be preserved and strengthened. But there is a problem with matching the powers in a body politic to the electorate and ensuring that they can be exercised effectively and accountably. I put it to noble Lords in response to what has been said that we have not got this quite right. Greater fiscal responsibility in Scotland is highly desirable, and a better mechanism than the Barnett formula for distributing central government funding is obtainable.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07012584000071"></a>I draw particular attention to the example of Australia, where the distribution of central funding appears to take into account needs, resources and costs in a way that the Barnett formula does not.If such a formula were to be introduced as a constitutional reform, it would help greatly to remove any sense of unfairness. Of course, it would operate much more effectively if it were to be operated right across England, in the regions, which my noble friends Lord Shutt and Lord Teverson and others mentioned. That is part of the agenda for continuing constitutional reform, as should be the introduction of a fair voting system not only in Scotland, but in the United Kingdom as a whole. Were such a system to exist, the problems raised by the West Lothian question, which really are a chimera, would not be seen as major issues in any part of Britain, because there would be no overwhelming seizure of power by one party in one part of the country to the disadvantage of others.</p>

The debate is also immensely timely, as so many noble Lords have said. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, who tabled this Motion. I wonder whether it has struck other Members of this House that, when this Government came in almost 10 years ago, devolution was their flagship policy, and yet how few have come forward today either to praise their achievement or to celebrate the union that has served this country so well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07012584000077"></a>My noble friend Lord Forsyth of Drumlean is a proud Scot; he is a great lover and servant of Scotland and a great servant of the United Kingdom. I, too, am a Scot. Indeed, Mr Salmond, Sir Menzies Campbell and I are the three party leaders in the two Houses who were born in Scotland and live in Scotland. For the time being, that is. We all know that another Scot is shortly to receive his uncontested coronation at Westminster&#151;and not even Macbeth yearned more longingly for that crown. It will be a major change in our politics; it will be the first time since the Scotland Act that a Prime Minister, with power to direct policy in every nook and cranny of our public life, has come from Scotland. I am one of those who still firmly believe that there should be no bar to a Member of Parliament from a Scottish constituency being Prime Minister. Mr Brown has suddenly started a new party turn, about Britishness. For most of us, the idea of Britain does not come as the revelatory moment that it seems to have done for Mr Brown. Was not my noble friend Lord Forsyth right when he said that knowledge of history is the key to understanding Britishness? I wonder how the noble and learned Lord will respond to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07012584000078"></a>As a Scot, I have never had any difficulty in feeling a sense of also being British or of loyalty to the union, and to be frank I do not understand why there should be any such difficulty. I am sure that the noble and learned Lord feels the same way. Yet, as my noble friend said, how dismal and pathetic it is that the Government have been so mealy-mouthed about the celebration of the 300th anniversary of our union, which was the creation of the greatest voluntary partnership in history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07012584000079"></a>The facts are indisputable. The 18th century saw the flowering of the Scottish Enlightenment, and it was the union that forged the intellectual climate that inspired men such as David Hume and Adam Smith. The 19th century brought unprecedented prosperity and influence to Scotland as an industrial power and a participant in empire. As part of Britain, Scotland played its immense part in what my right honourable friend David Cameron called the greatest moral endeavour

Within the union, Scottish statesmen, churchmen, military men, writers, painters, intellectuals, industrialists, philosophers, explorers and honest hard-working men and women of every call and station in life have shaped not just the face of Scotland but that of the United Kingdom and indeed of the whole world.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07012584000080"></a>I do not pretend for one moment that every aspect of it has been good; it never is in any union. But it would be sheer madness to throw it all away. Even Alex Salmond knows that, which is why he is trying to take the curse off the nationalist vote by promising a referendum and relying on the natural revulsionof the Scottish people at the ineptitude and incompetence of the Lib-Lab Administration at Holyrood. Yet it would be an enormous error to put Scotland in the hands of an unreconstructed party of socialist high spending such as the SNP. Scotland&#146;s future, like Scotland&#146;s past, must surely be one of enterprise, vigour and optimism. It is not one of cutting links with the union and setting sail for the Faroe Islands, the role model proposed for Scotland by the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie. Even he did not say whether in his vision Scotland would keep the pound, join the euro, or create its own currency. We should face the fact that devolution has not been successful in sedating the separatist tiger. Given that the difficulties within the union flow from frequently quite unnecessary and avoidable misunderstandings, we certainly need to create no further institutional stimuli for separatism.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07012584000081"></a>My party has borne a great deal of criticism, much of it, as my noble friend and others have pointed out, quite unjustifiable, for defending the union over the past 30 years or so. My goodness, how great the historic responsibility is of the Labour Party in trying to push under the carpet the glaring unfairness unveiled in the West Lothian question. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, who sat through much of this debate but is sadly no longer in his place, said a few years ago that the best way to deal with the West Lothian question was not to ask it. The behaviour of the whole Government has been to live out that Canute-like view of the world.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07012584000082"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Crickhowell, who said that the dog is barking and biting. Sadly, every opinion survey shows the growing impatience of the English with the unequal relationships that flow from the present arrangements. Scottish MPs, who cannot even vote on reserved matters in Scotland, swan down to Westminster to impose policies on England that would not be accepted at Holyrood. The West Lothian question is a problem. It not only needs to be asked; it needs to be answered. It is hardly controversial in Scotland that MPs elected by the local electorate should not meddle in, for instance, English education when they can do nothing for the problems of local schools in their own constituencies.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07012584000083"></a>We need a parliamentary solution to this parliamentary problem. It is a problem that exists far less in this House than in another place. My right honourable friend David Cameron has asked the Conservative Party&#146;s democracy task force, led by Ken Clarke, to look at some solutions. We need to address the  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1259"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1259</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>asymmetrical nature of current arrangements and we should do so in a calm and considered fashion. That does not include behaving like the honourable company of ostriches who inhabit the government Front Bench and the Liberal Democrat Benches; both those parties refuse to acknowledge the very existence of the problem. Alex Salmond could not ask for more effective allies in his campaign to break up the union, given the growing sense of unfairness, not as in the past in Scotland, but increasingly today in England. My party will fight, all the way, those in England or Scotland who see the solution as separation for Scotland.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07012584000084"></a>What about the end to the Barnett formula? Even some Labour politicians, such as Ken Livingstone, complain that Scotland gets far more of the national pot than it is entitled to. I do not believe that it is quite that simple. Other areas of the United Kingdom receive more per head than Scotland. We should remember that before rushing to conclusions. Perhaps the time has come for a genuine reassessment of spending criteria throughout the United Kingdom. If we address the inherent constitutional unfairness to England resulting from the Scotland Act, grievances such as that will not gain purchase. That is the challenge for the Government at Westminster and it is one that so far they have hopelessly failed.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07012584000085"></a>The 300 years of the union stand as an astonishingly successful example of inclusive, civic nationalism, combined with wider diversity. Devolution was not needed to protect Scotland&#146;s legal or educational systems; that was inherent in the nature of the union. Together we have given the world so much. The message from this debate is that we should not be complacent about the dangers, but that, if we take the right action now, there is far more that our union still has to give, not just to the people of these islands, but also to the global community that we all inhabit.</p>

It is timely and has been of the highest quality. Perhaps I can quote the words with which he started the debate: the union is an historic partnership that changed the world. I could not agree more. His opening paragraphs, in which he defended the union, were so impressive that I very much agreed with them. I agree with my noble friend Lord Sewel that his speech went radically off the rails thereafter, but the beginning of the speech was absolutely enthralling.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07012584000087"></a>To start with, I want to draw four points from the debate. First, as the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, said, the debate has been absolutely fascinating in its historic dimension: the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, recanting on behalf of Lord Mar; the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, recanting on behalf of an earlier Marquis of Montrose; the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, recanting on behalf of an earlier Earl of Caithness; the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, telling us what he was doing at 5.30 in the morning in 1976 in beginning the process that led to the beginning of the West Lothian question&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_95"></a>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07012584000090"></a>We also heard from the noble Lords, Lord Lang of Monkton, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean and Lord Crickhowell, three people who also played their part in the move to devolution and what happened subsequently. As I listened to the noble Earls, Lord Mar and Kellie and Lord Caithness, and the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, I wondered whether there was something to be said for the hereditary principle. In generations to come, perhaps the great-great-grandchildren of the noble Lords, Lord Lang and Lord Forsyth, or even the grandchildren of the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell&#151;to whom he referred&#151;might have some insight into the rolethat they all played in the situation that currently exists.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07012584000091"></a>The second point to emerge so strongly from the debate was the close interconnectedness between Scotland and England, which was so ably demonstrated by what people said about their own lives. Who would have guessed that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, is in fact Scottish? Everyone will know that my noble friend Lord Maxton is Scottish, but who would have guessed that my noble friend Lord Soley spent so much time in Scotland&#151;in an attempt to get to Oxford he ended up at Newbattle Abbey, but many congratulations&#151;and even the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, was able to tell us that he lived in a house that had once been occupied by someone who had been the ambassador from Queen Elizabeth I to Scotland. So we all have links with Scotland.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07012584000092"></a>Thirdly, with the honourable but totally misguided exception of the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, every single person in the Chamber supported the continuation of the union and was extremely keen to see it in place.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07012584000093"></a>The fourth point to emerge so strongly from the debate was the stream of speeches that attacked devolution. It was not clear whether people were opposing devolution root and branch, although I think the noble Lord, Lord Lang of Monkton, was. I thought the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, had made the same mistake as the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, but he corrected that and said that he was not attacking devolution but simply a form of it. The noble Lords, Lord Lang, Lord Crickhowell, Lord Forsyth, Lord Patten and Lord Strathclyde, and the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, all made a series of complaints about devolution which had at their heart the proposition that in some way devolution has contributed to an increased desire for separation in Scotland.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07012584000094"></a>It was interesting that the only party to put forward that argument was the Conservative Party. It is also interesting that the Conservative Party had no seats  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1261"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1261</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>after the 1997 general election in Scotland and now has one seat in Scotland. I forgot the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, who raised questions about devolution in relation to the current settlement. But it is not without significance that the only people attacking the devolution settlement or its sense are members of the party that is listened to the least by the people of Scotland.</p>

It is very interesting that those noble Lords attack the devolution settlement and talk about English votes for English laws. One cannot come away with any sense other than that the Conservative Party, despite its proud history as a unionist party, appeared to be turning its back on Scotland. It is no surprise to me that the debate came down so firmly&#151;</p>

For many years, before devolution was enacted, we warned against the dangers that we thought would flow from it. We now all see those dangers coming into being. We are now saying that we must work to save the inheritance that we have as a result of devolution by removing the imbalances and thus protecting the union.</p>

The idea that English votes for English laws will deal with the issues of separation that have been raised seems to me to be completely wrong.</p>

<a name="70125-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07012584000099"></a>The point made by my noble friend Lord Sewel was incredibly forceful. What would have happened if there had not been devolution after the 1997 election and the Conservatives had won without one Scottish seat in the United Kingdom Parliament? It would not have been sustainable for a moment. Everyone involved in Scottish politics recognises the need for devolution and its importance in preserving the union.</p>

It was not a question of which was the biggest or the smallest party; the Conservative Party did not have one MP in Scotland. It is no surprise to anyone in the House that the debate came down so firmly in favour of the Treaty of Union and the maintenance of the United Kingdom. That is the Government&#146;s position and that is the position of the vast majority in this House. Together, over the past 300 years, England and Scotland have achieved things which I am sure would be entirely beyond their reach as separate countries. The union has created a model of a country of different nations and plural identities sharing common values and a common patriotism.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07012584000102"></a>It has never been the case the union should mean uniformity. It was born out of different interests. The English were concerned to secure the Protestant succession, and therefore to secure political stability and security. The Scots were anxious to gain access to the markets not only of England, but of England&#146;s growing overseas possessions. The Scots were also concerned to preserve their Presbyterian system of church government from what they saw as the potential tyranny of the episcopate. I agree with the point of the noble Lord, Lord Patten, that discrimination against Roman Catholics is wrong. While I agree with his basic points, there are of course so many other things that would have to be changed in the treaty and Act of Union to correct that that it is an issue for another day.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07012584000103"></a>The English wished to preserve their episcopal system of church government from what they saw as the potential anarchy of Presbyterianism. Each side equally wished to preserve its distinctive system of law. The commissioners for the union appointed by each Parliament took these differences of view and deeply felt concerns and&#151;despite what the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, said about historical research&#151;wove them into a union which has lasted for 300 years. They took the approach that diversity should continue except in those areas where a common approach was required. This was a union of two Parliaments, two nations which had hitherto simply shared a sovereign, to create a new nation and a new Parliament.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07012584000104"></a>Over the years, the union and the political stability it has brought have contributed to the greatness and the economic strength of the United Kingdom. A small, offshore country tucked away in the north-west of Europe at one time ruled half the world. Everyone is aware of the contribution that the Scots have made to that process, as engineers, explorers, soldiers&#151;as referred to by the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard&#151;doctors and merchants. The larger English economic, political and military strength provided opportunities that the Scots could never have forged alone, but the contribution of the Scots significantly enhanced the nation&#146;s ability to take advantage of them.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07012584000105"></a>The new state fostered a new cohesion and a British national identity, ushering in a period of extraordinary national success. There can be no doubt that the creation of the United Kingdom Parliament was an essential precondition for Britain&#146;s economic, social and democratic development, and for Britain&#146;s rise as a world power. It was also one of the important factors in the growth of a British way of life based on active citizenship, a volunteering spirit and a strong civic society. The treaty created the largest free trade area in 18th-century Europe. It is no exaggeration to say that building on the back of that has made the United Kingdom the world&#146;s fifth-largest economy. It is a significant market for Scottish goods and services. This, and our shared language, currency and geographical proximity are reflected in the fact that nearly two-thirds of exports from Scotland are to the rest of the UK. The Scottish economy is now a fundamental part of the wider UK economy.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07012584000106"></a>The Government entirely agree with those speakers who point to the continued importance of the union in sustaining our present position in the world. Yes, our particular concerns have changed. In England, we no longer fear the invasion of foreign powers through the back door of Scotland. The Scots no longer crave access to England&#146;s colonial trading routes. In turn, as a result of 300 years of union, we share, as the debate has revealed, increasingly deep family and cultural ties. This interconnectedness is mirrored in every field of life: cultural activities of all kinds, a wealth of charitable activity and a host of personal and family connections. Many Scots make their homes and careers in England, as do many English people in Scotland. Many families have relatives in both nations, as we have heard today. Almost one in 10 of the people living in Scotland was born in England. The union represents our values and gives them expression to the world. Our constituent nations have retained their separate identity, but at the same time have drawn from each other. We have a fully integrated economy&#151;not only between England and Scotland, but between all parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07012584000107"></a>Divisions within the island of Great Britain&#151;as everybody but the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, said&#151;would be a significantly retrograde step. Even if all the parties remained within the EU, barriers and differences of economic policy would distort our markets. I saw a report last week that, in an independent Scotland, the Scottish National Party would seek to jettison the pound and introduce the euro, thus introducing an exchange rate question into trade between England and Scotland&#151;not moving on into the future, but reversing 300 years of history.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07012584000108"></a>Globalisation will pose increasing economic challenges. To improve our competitiveness in that increasingly challenging world, we must continue to enjoy economic stability which provides the framework and opportunity for people to create wealth. The union has played a huge part in providing economic stability. The union stood against Nazism in the Second World War, and created the National Health Service in the years that followed. It was, and is, a collective undertaking. It should not be put in jeopardy.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07012584000109"></a>Unfortunately&#151;and this is where there has been debate today&#151;there have been disagreements about whether particular policies enhance or damage the union. It has been suggested that, in introducing devolution, or not changing it, the Government have put the union in jeopardy. We emphatically reject that allegation. Devolution, as I have said, was essential in securing and strengthening the union. It is unclear whether those questioning devolution today accept that proposition. Do they think devolution was necessary, post-1997? If they do not, what do they say should have happened?</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07012584000110"></a>Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have legitimate concerns that the overwhelming numberof Members of Parliament representing English constituencies means that specific Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish concerns can get lost when legislated for by the Westminster Parliament. Devolution provides the right balance between local and national concerns. It frees the constituent parts of the United Kingdom  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1264"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1264</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to innovate local solutions for local problems. If there are different policies in different parts of the United Kingdom, that is one of the purposes of devolution. Yes, the arrangements are asymmetric, but if we were seeking symmetry or even logic in the UK constitution, we would have to tear up most of it. We are not about constitutional symmetry. We seek practical changes for practical goals. The great strength of our constitution is its effectiveness. It can accommodate difference and rough edges in support of wider goals of national unity, affiliation to the institutions of the state and the service of those institutions to the public.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07012584000111"></a>But&#151;and this is my second point of disagreement&#151;I do not believe that it can accommodate an English Parliament or its proxy, the seductively entitled &#147;English votes for English laws&#148;. The noble Lord, Lord Shutt of Greetland, was right when he said that the critical point in this debate is not support for the union, which, with the one exception I referred to, all noble Lords are in favour of. Instead, the question is how best we achieve it. The big issue raised by this debate is whether English votes for English laws would promote the union or would, as I believe, be a significant step towards the break-up of the union.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07012584000112"></a>Make no mistake: if we were to introduce English votes for English laws in the other place&#151;and I note that there does not seem to be any suggestion that it should be introduced in this House&#151;that would simply be the first step on the way to an English Parliament, and the break-up of the union would follow. I echo the words of my noble friend Lord Anderson who said, &#147;Those who blow on the flames of English nationalism may find that those flames consume the union&#148;. I agree that that is what proposals about English votes for English laws would do.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07012584000113"></a>Why, it has been asked, should there not be English votes for English laws when the Scottish Parliament votes on Scottish issues? The reason there is a Scottish Parliament is because England is over 80 per cent of the United Kingdom. England has over 80 per cent of the population, over 80 per cent of Members of Parliament and over 80 per cent of the country&#146;s GDP. If we had English votes for English laws, how would the system work? I cannot better the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, who explained the absurdities and impracticalities that would arise. If we take what he said, and take it one stage further, all noble Lords would agree that the Government of the day must be formed by the party that commands a majority in the House of Commons. Is it seriously suggested that we could have a Government of the nation that could not pass legalisation in relation to England? That would be the effect of what is proposed. It is obvious that the moment that we do that, we end up in a situation where the United Kingdom Parliament gets completely dominated by English issues. The point of devolution is not a federation, because most constitutional experts who look at the concept of federation say that about 30 per cent is the largest that any one member of a federation can be without completely dominating it to the exclusion of its other parts. It is not a practical proposition, and it inevitably leads to an English Parliament.</p>

<a name="07012584000115"></a><b><a name="70125-0010.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07012584000289"></a>Lord Falconer of Thoroton:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord misses the point: if we want a union, which most people do, there needs to be a Parliament that brings the union together. If we go down the route of English votes for English laws, we separate Parliament into two bits. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, one bit would deal with issues to do with the DTI, defence, foreign policy and, perhaps, immigration and the other would deal with English domestic affairs. We would completely lose the institution and the constitutional arrangements that bind this country together. With respect, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, that that is the argument he has to deal with. He must ask himself whether going down the route of English votes for English laws would promote the union. I have very little doubt that it would have precisely the opposite effect. Where would it stop? Should London MPs be the only MPs to vote on London? If we had English votes for English laws, a UK Government elected on a UK mandate might find themselves unable to deliver key policies on which they had been elected.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07012584000116"></a>But if we put aside all that, we all understand that we as a nation, the whole nation of the United Kingdom, are inextricably linked. What we spend on education in England has a huge effect on what is available to spend in relation to education in the other parts of the country.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07012584000117"></a>I note from what the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, said that English votes for English laws only is an issue which the constitutional convention or committee, or whatever it is Ken Clarke is sitting on, is considering. I very much agree with what the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said. One of the great and important aspects of this debate is to seek to discover the Conservative Party&#146;s policies on the union and what steps it thinks will most promote the union.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07012584000118"></a>I believe that everyone in this debate is sincere in wanting to promote the union. We should hear what is said in detail by the Conservatives about the steps that they want to take. The people can then judge whether they promote the union rather than, as I fear, drive it further apart.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="07012584000119"></a>I do not want to end this debate on a note of disagreement. The noble Lord&#146;s Motion calls attention to the maintenance of the United Kingdom. I return to his opening words, in which he congratulated and identified what the historic partnership has achieved. I entirely agree with him that the continuation of that partnership is essential to our continued success in facing the new global challenges which our country as a whole will have to face in the 21st century. The 300 years of our union have created a great nation. Long may it continue.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="07012584000124"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am pleased to have the opportunity of opening this debate today. The wording of the subject is deliberately wide as &#147;health and care&#148; encompasses a vast part of all our lives. I thank those who are to speak in this debate, and who have particular experience and expertise from which we can all benefit.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07012584000125"></a>When I checked the dictionary for the definition of &#147;health&#148;, &#147;care&#148; and &#147;community&#148;, I decided that each of these means much more now than the definitions given, especially &#147;health&#148;. One cannot pick up any newspaper or magazine without finding some new angle on &#147;health&#148;. Fitness and health are often taken to be the same thing, but this is not so. A person can be healthy but unfit, or unhealthy but still fairly fit. Recently, a speaker at the Royal College of Physicians referred to &#147;the ill and the worried well&#148; and I thought that that accurately reflected part of society.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07012584000126"></a>In spite of constant advice to modify our habits or diets, the majority of people think more about health when they suffer some setback. The young have always believed they are immortal. The old are only too aware of their mortality and the ageing process. There is constantly published conflicting advice about the food to eat, exercise to take and the lifestyle to follow. Even those who just take everything for granted and never give a thought to health expect immediate National Health Service care and attention to be available at the moment of crisis, and usually it is.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="07012584000127"></a>Chronic conditions are something that people have to live with, often over very long periods and at home rather than in any medical facility. This is wherethe major problem arises. Many face the living bereavement of loved ones suffering from Alzheimer&#146;s disease or senile dementia. Others have children with special needs requiring a lifetime of care. There are so many different situations.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="07012584000128"></a>The dividing line between health and care is creating a huge gulf in services. Social care is provided by local authorities and can be simple or complex, depending on the needs of the individual. The noble  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1267"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1267</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord, Lord Bruce-Lockhart, introduced a very good debate in this Chamber on adult social care, particularly the local government aspect of it, on7 December. I do not intend to use this short time to repeat that debate, but commend it to those who have not read it.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="07012584000129"></a>The Department of Health, too, covers social care. If the words &#147;social care&#148; were included in the title of that department, it might be recognition of the importance of the issue.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07012584000130"></a>There is need for a much closer liaison between the fully funded NHS care and the social care inthe community that is often available only at a cost to the patient. Local authorities face a double budget difficulty with an increasing load being transferred to home care from the NHS and a restriction on increasing their council tax. Is it surprising that we constantly read reports and hear anecdotal evidence of social services being less available and more restrictive conditions being applied, so that only the most critical cases now meet the eligibility criteria for free personal care?</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="07012584000131"></a>The differentiation of treatment between NHS and social services has always been controversial. It is a great pity that more was not done by the Government in recent years to bridge that divide. It would have been easier to make changes when the Government were pouring money into the NHS&#151;sadly, without result. Until joint working of health and care is established, those problems will continue. The NHS is keen to send patients home at the earliest possible date, but someone has to deal with the continuing burden&#151;and that area lacks clarity. If the patient requires continuing health treatment at home, that is funded by the state; if their rehabilitation is classified as social need, they are not covered in the same way.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07012584000132"></a>At a senior management level, there are joint committees and there is some joint working and planning of NHS and social care; but there is need for partnerships to extend that down to the everyday working level. There should be joint NHS and personal care for people, whatever their needs. Where do you draw the line between health and care in the community? What exactly does &#147;personal care&#148; mean?</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07012584000133"></a>I look forward to hearing from other noble Lords who intend to speak about vital issues such as child services, respite care, terminal care and the hospice movement, and care at home to keep people out of hospitals. In addition to the many social workers employed by the councils, it is estimated that some5 million people provide care informally. No matter how much care is provided officially, the greatest amount of caring is done by relatives and friends who give their time to that dedicated service. Often, those carers are themselves reduced to a state of ill-health by their great efforts. The whole community owes them a debt of gratitude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07012584000134"></a>My noble friend&#151;and colleague in dentistry&#151;Lord Colwyn had hoped to be able to put the case for NHS dental services to be readily available to all. Unfortunately, he is operating today and cannot be here. It should be remembered that dentistry is not a free service for any

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07012584000135"></a>When I was a local authority chairman of social services, long before Ken and his freedom pass, we introduced free travel passes for retired people. We realised that keeping our older residents active and mobile was one of the best forms of social care and meant that those people were very much part of the community&#151;not isolated at home, perhaps seeing no one except the person delivering meals on wheels. Human contact is essential to keep people going and many voluntary organisations play an important part in that process.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07012584000136"></a>For some years, I was on the advisory committee of RSVP, the retired senior volunteer programme&#151;part of Community Service Volunteers. By involving the retired in helping others, volunteers not only provided much-needed assistance, but were given an important and demanding role from which they benefited themselves. I recall a retired bus driver who was helping a young person on a one-to-one basis; he was delighted to have achieved a result in a field outside his own qualifications and he went on to help others in the same way. Others shopped, read and provided company&#151;the needs were almost unlimited. The work continues and many voluntary organisations do a great deal to help people.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07012584000137"></a>In December, the joint report of the All-Party Group on Primary Care and Public Health and the All-Party Group on Social Care considered that there was a need to reconfigure existing provision and resources to achieve the increase in preventive health and social care envisaged in the Wanless report. As one of the signatories of that all-party group report, I took full part in the meetings and hearings of evidence on which it was based.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07012584000138"></a>The report concluded that current levels of funding are insufficient to meet present and predicted demographic pressures and that because the level of charges for domiciliary social care is&#151;to put it mildly&#151;unpopular with service users, it acts as a deterrent from using such services if the user has to pay. That often leads to earlier use of more expensive institutional care. In considering the best use of public money and the best way to provide services, it is important that the overall long-term costs and benefits are assessed.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07012584000139"></a>We know that the Government plan to have more NHS treatment centres available in the community, which should be good&#151;but only if those centres are up and running before the same services in the hospitals are closed. At the outset, that might be more costly as the services will need to be run in parallel during an overlap period, to establish the changeover. The savings would follow.</p>

<a name="70125-0010.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="07012584000140"></a>In London, many patients choose not to have a GP. They rely on going to the nearest A&amp;E when they have a health problem, which clogs up those important emergency services. It would be better if those patients were able to go to a community treatment centre. It will, however, remain essential to have additional major trauma centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="07012584000141"></a>On funding, the all-party group recommended:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="07012584000234"></a>&#147;2.1 The Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) must acknowledge and make provision for the demographic pressures on Local Authority and NHS care and training budgets reflecting growing numbers of disabled children and young people with complex needs, adults with multiple disabilities suffering social exclusion, and the sharp rise in older people with combinations of physical, sensory and intellectual impairments.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="07012584000235"></a>2.2 The CSR should make provision for new money to address the issue of health inequalities and the need for training and development of the work force in their new role.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="07012584000236"></a>2.3 Government should take further steps to promote maximum flexibility in the use of resources, including wider opportunities for pooled budgets, greater financial and decision-making delegation to front-line staff and people using services, schemes to combine statutory and community resources, and safeguards against cost-shunting.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="07012584000237"></a>2.4 The rationale for and impact of charging for domiciliary care should be rigorously re-examined. A public debate on funding for social care might help to explore alternative solutions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70125-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="07012584000142"></a>Many other matters were considered by the all-party group, such as the need for change from the culture of dependency, with patients taking more responsibility for their own health, particularly in preventive terms.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07012584000143"></a>Returning to my own comments, I have been involved in the NHS as a dentist and on the administrative side for many years, serving on area and regional health authorities and as an NHS trust chairman. Each time that the NHS seemed to be just settling down, it was re-organised, which was damaging to morale and usually financially wasteful. Nevertheless, I am suggesting further changes now. This is because social services and personal care are each essential parts of a complete healthcare system, and it is time that each human being&#146;s treatment should be considered as for the whole person.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07012584000144"></a>That takes me to exactly 12 minutes, the time which I was to have. However, I have been told that I have three minutes more. As a result, I will just quote from a letter that I received from the General Social Care Council on arriving in the House this afternoon. I was particularly pleased to have this and to realise how standards are improving and that there is a register. Social workers have always deserved such a degree of recognition. What also pleased me, in view of my comments, was that the General Social Care Council,</p>
<ul><a name="07012584000244"></a>&#147;realizes the importance of practitioners working together across the whole range of professional specialisms in health and social care to make joined-up services a reality for service users&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012584000227"></a>That summarises the whole thing. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

I must say that I very much agree with her about the importance of social care. As an ex-director of social services, I could hardly say otherwise. I am glad that she tabled this Motion for debate today, because it provides me with an early opportunity to engage in a kind of mini-retrospective of my time as a health Minister. That was a job which had two parts to it: continuing the repair job, if I may put it that way, on the NHS that has been in progress since 1997;

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07012584000146"></a>Those challenges are formidable: rapidly changing medical technology; rising public expectations; and a set of demographic changes involving a considerable rise in the numbers of over-80s that will increase demands on health and social care. I heard quite a lot in my time as a Minister from the Benches opposite about the shortcomings of the Government's approach to the NHS, but I have not heard a great deal about their policies. From the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, I began to discern some emerging policies. Another reorganisation sounds interesting. This week, we also saw some green shoots from the other place, from the leader of the Opposition, who seems to want a return to GP fundholding and the dropping of all national targets. I will return to them in a moment.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07012584000147"></a>First, I want briefly to refresh the memories of everyone on the Benches opposite on how they left the NHS in 1997, after running it for 18 years. It was an NHS short of doctors, nurses and virtually every other type of staff. Healthcare spending was at the bottom of the EU league at about 6 per cent of GDP. It is at 9 per cent now&#151;about the EU average. There was a deficit in 1996-97 of 1.5 per cent of turnover, which is about twice what the very noisy deficit was at the end of last year. The buildings, plant and equipment were in a parlous state, reflecting the failure to invest. Perhaps worst of all were the scandalously long waiting lists, appalling conditions in many A&amp;E departments and, if I may put it this way, unnecessary deaths from failure to invest adequately in cancer and coronary heart disease services. I do not want to dwell toomuch on that, but it is worth us remembering those things.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07012584000148"></a>I acknowledge that not everything that the Government have done on the NHS is perfect, but we have invested. We have recruited many more staff and improved their pay and conditions of service. We have built literally dozens of new hospitals and hundreds of new GP and community facilities. We have also provided a whole new generation of modern equipment. We can point to that extra investment improving patient services.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07012584000149"></a>If the leader of the Opposition thinks that the changes could have been achieved without some national targets, he is being managerially naive. If he believes that the Conservatives never resorted to national targets or objectives, he is badly briefed. I well remember that, as a health authority chairman under the Conservatives, we were interrogated quite vigorously about the 50 or more national priorities that the Government were running at the time. There was not much difference between those national priorities and targets.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07012584000150"></a>I shall spend the rest of my time referring to the continuing changes that the NHS needs and that the Government have initiated to meet the challenges of the future. I spent much of my time in the past two years pushing on with those necessary changes and I am pleased that we have done so. My only regret is that we did not start some of them sooner. This is  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1271"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1271</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>particularly the case with choice, an area we are now well and truly establishing. The public will insist that any future Government continue to pursue choice. It needs to be continually nurtured and promoted, against some professional resistance. We need to move choice into new areas, including end-of-life care and how we can leave this world with dignity, at a time and place of our choosing.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07012584000151"></a>As a Government, we have put in place a commissioning framework involving a smaller number of eventually better-skilled PCTs. Both Governments have been slower than they might have been on this issue, but we at least have grasped the nettle. I am particularly proud of our work in establishing practice-based commissioning. The GPs deserve great credit for embracing this idea. We will achieve virtually100 per cent GP coverage with practice-based commissioning, compared to the 50 per cent coverage that GP fund holding achieved. It looks as if the leader of the Opposition wants to abandon this improvement and impose an arbitrary change of GP fund holding on the profession and the NHS.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07012584000152"></a>Alongside commissioning and choice, we have done a lot to establish foundation trusts. By the beginning of 2008, we should have at least 100 of them, including many mental health trusts. There has been a great deal of effort to ensure that hospitals can achieve more autonomy from Whitehall. I do not have time to dwell on the other necessary modernising changes we have pursued, such as the national programme for IT or the important strategic White Paper on services outside hospitals, <I>Our Health, Our Care, Our Say</I>, which said much on strengthening integration of health and social care.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07012584000153"></a>Finally, on competition and markets, the Conservatives deserve a great deal of credit for the way they introduced a mixed economy into community care in the early 1990s. I was pleased to be involved in that. Yet I fear they lost their nerve on this issue when it came to the NHS. It has taken a Labour Government to face up to the fact that the public is on the whole indifferent to whether they get their healthcare from the public, private or voluntary or social enterprise sectors We have had the nerve to bring in plurality of providers, and a jolly good thing, too.

As so many problems arise at night, on bank holidays and at weekends, patients have to rely on the out-of-hours doctors services. Prevention is vital in so many cases. Checking blood pressure and sugar levels is easy, but unless patients ask for it this often does not take place. I personally heard recently of several patients who were misdiagnosed by the GP and not sent for a scan. These involve serious conditions of cancer and brain tumours. GPs should be vigilant not evasive in these cases.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07012584000157"></a>The correct procedure when people have strokes or heart attacks should be to get them to a centre of excellence, so that they can have a scan within three hours and, if appropriate, clot-busting therapy. Without scanners working 24-hour days seven days a week, this cannot happen. This is still a dream in some areas such as rural north Yorkshire, where I live.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07012584000158"></a>There must be a reliable emergency ambulance service. Is the Minister aware of the concern over the 45-minute meal breaks for ambulance crews, which are statutory under EU law but are subject to local negotiations? As about 13 deaths have been attributed to meal breaks that cannot be disturbed&#151;goodness knows how many near misses there have been&#151;I hope that the Minister will take up this challenge, particularly from the Scottish border to north Yorkshire.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07012584000159"></a>In the interests of patient safety, there is concern that the posts of specialist nurses for long-term medical conditions such as stoma care, diabetes, epilepsy, MS, strokes, Parkinson&#146;s disease, motor neurone disease and many others are being cut or not replaced when they become vacant, and that skilled nurses are being put on to general ward duties. This will be economically disastrous, as these nurses are the vital link between the specialist hospital unit and the community. They give support to the patientsand their carers. They monitor medication and equipment, and they support and train district nurses. Because they are paid by the hospitals, if not by voluntary organisations, I hope that the Minister will be able to sort out this vital matter with the hospitals and PCTs. Perhaps there will have to be joint funding, otherwise patients will become neglected in the community and land up in hospital.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07012584000160"></a>The North Yorkshire and York PCT has inherited debts of millions of pounds and has therefore made stringent cuts, delaying patient treatments and out-patient appointments. In the long run, I cannot see that this will benefit anyone. One of the silent cuts has been made to the wheelchair and equipment service. Two men deliver and collect these aids from and to patients&#146; homes in a wide rural area in the Harrogate district. A third man was employed to clean everything before it was reallocated. He has left, and the post has not been refilled, with the result that the equipment may not get a thorough cleaning. This is extremely dangerous, given infections such as C. difficile, which is very dangerous to vulnerable, disabled people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07012584000161"></a>In a prelude to my Question on 8 February, I feel I should alert your Lordships to the growing anxiety about forms of community-associated MRSA&#151;CA-MRSA&#151;which are easy to spread. PVL&#151;Panton-Valentine leukocidin&#151;destroys the white cells that the  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1273"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1273</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>body uses to defend itself. Because it can infect young people who are not expected to become ill, the infection is often not identified quickly enough to treat. High-risk groups are participants in close contact such as sports clubs, the military, residential homes and children&#146;s playgrounds. There should be regular bathing, showering, hand washing, and changes of linen and underwear, and sharing personal items such as toothbrushes, face cloths and towels should be avoided. Wounds should be covered.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07012584000162"></a>Fast NHS tests are needed that can track the spread of the disease from the community to infecting vulnerable people. Existing methods take more than two weeks to detect the organism, when it can kill within a day. In Texas, bacteria with the PVL genes continue to spread. They have risen to affect 10 per cent of all children in three years and cause symptoms ranging from pimples and boils to flesh-dissolving disease and the killer, pneumonia.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07012584000163"></a>In the USA, the incidence of CA-MRSA is screened nationally, and in Scotland there is a system of identifying all MRSA strains. Surely, with such risks, we should have rigorous surveillance and screening for CA-MRSA in the community. I hope that the Government will push this forward with the expertise of the Health Protection Agency. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, for securing this very important debate.</p>

As ever, she has brought to bear on these matters her first-hand experience of many long years. In the excellent debate last week on the social care workforce, which was initiated by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, all speakers rightly congratulated the Government on making more funds available for the NHS. They also spoke warmly of the many policy frameworks that have been provided for community care.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07012584000165"></a>However, last week, as today, we were obliged to confront the gulf between what has been provided and what people are experiencing at grass-roots level. I have no doubt that we will hear from the Minister&#151;he would be right so to say&#151;that funding for the NHS has increased from around &#163;34 billion in 1997-98 to around &#163;78 billion in 2005-06; that will save him a bit of time. We will also hear, correctly, that there have been real improvements in certain health outcomes, including a reduction in waiting lists and better facilities for patients, which are entirely welcome. But those of us whose reading includes the regional press&#151;I assume that that does not include the noble Lord, Lord Warner&#151;cannot have failed to notice the weekly, sometimes daily, stories about cuts, closures and crises in the NHS, which, if only partly accurate, are puzzling when set against government statistics. Sadly, these cuts, closures and crises more often than not affect community care. So what is going wrong?</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07012584000166"></a>In its report published last December on NHS deficits, the Health Select Committee in another place went some way towards providing the answer. The  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1274"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1274</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>report points out that the overall NHS deficit has increased over the past two years, partly because of funding formulae, but also because of,</p>
<ul><a name="07012584000245"></a>&#147;poor central and poor local management&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012584000228"></a>It says that government estimates of costs for, for example, <I>Agenda for Change</I> and doctors&#146; contracts,</p>
<ul><a name="07012584000246"></a>&#147;proved to be hopelessly unrealistic&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07012584000229"></a>which is a point apparently now accepted by Patricia Hewitt. The report adds that repeated policy changes imposed by the Government at short notice have contributed to the problem. Poor local management is also blamed. The extraordinary saga of the creation of a multiplicity of primary care trusts on the ground of improved local delivery, only for that decision to be reversed two years later, illustrates the problem.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07012584000169"></a>The situation of the NHS in Norfolk also illustrates the problem. We are told that Norfolk PCTs account for &#163;50 million of the overall NHS deficit. I do not see how this can be. I do not know what kind of management at national and/or local level can have incurred such a debt in one county that serves only 750,000 people. But, more seriously, what are the consequences of making good such a debt on health services in Norfolk? The only certain thing is that the people of Norfolk have to suffer reductions in service through no fault of their own. The impact of meeting these deficits is projected to be dire.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07012584000170"></a>Norfolk has nine community hospitals, which, as always, are much loved, supported and used. They provide a range of services, as well as, in most cases, a halfway house for patients being discharged, often after serious surgery. All these hospitals are being considered for closure or a reduction in the number of beds. I can describe these plans only, in the words of Sir Humphrey, as &#147;Very courageous, Minister&#148;, because they are not very popular. Earlier last year, I seem to recall, there were headlines about a&#163;750 million windfall to develop community hospitals. What happened to the windfall? According to local health chiefs, the emphasis is to shift to treatment at home.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07012584000171"></a>I can only ask the Minister, who is greatly respected and admired in this House for his knowledge in these matters, to look at the reality of care at home in a rural area. Who is to provide and deliver that care? How stretched is domiciliary care already? What are the travelling times and costs? Is it realistic to provide, say, physiotherapy in the home, where travelling times between patients could be up to an hour? I am quite sure that he understands these matters and is considering them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07012584000172"></a>Last week, we learnt that there are to be drastic cuts in the out-of-hours GP service across Norfolk&#151;again, in an effort to meet the &#163;50 million deficit. The number of bases manned between midnight and 8 am is to be cut from 11 to six, to meet demands for reductions from the PCT. Local GPs believe that the reductions will put patients at risk in such a large and thinly populated county. GPs are the cornerstone of community care. These cuts are bad news for worried and vulnerable people who have to use the service out of hours. A&amp;E will have to try to take the strain and so will families and carers. Social services will certainly not be able to help. As Dame Denise Platt points out in her second report on the state of social care, there is a gap between what the Government want to do and what is actually happening in people&#146;s experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07012584000173"></a>I have perhaps been unduly critical and gloomy. I recognise that the Government have been serious in their intention to put more resources into healthcare; indeed, they have done so. But, as Camilla Cavendish says in the <I>Times</I> today,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="07012584000238"></a>&#147;Money should never have been seen as a substitute for management&#148;.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="07012584000175"></a>In the last debate on the National Health Service in your Lordships&#146; House, I declared an interest as both consumer and stakeholder. I make no apologies for doing so again. Speaking today as a service user, I want to get away from the lofty heights of budgets and macro-numbers in respect of National Health Service provisions. We already know that investment in the National Health Service has doubled, that there are over 300,000 additional staff since 1997 and that waiting times have been reduced in many areas of clinical care.</p>

<a name="70125-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07012584000176"></a>I want to talk today more about the principles that should underpin the current NHS reforms&#151;the reform programme that the Government call &#147;Care Closer to Home&#148;. As a user, I welcome the objective behind the Government&#146;s proposals, which aim to provide a flexible, integrated and responsive health service, based on the community and built around the needs of the community. At the same time, there must be a recognition that our healthcare depends equally on our social care. I hope that, in the reform programme, the Government will ensure that a wide range of social care services, working with health services, is available in what is popularly called the one-stop care shop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="07012584000177"></a>The White Paper quite properly refers to preventive services. Preventive services ensure that an assessment is made of people&#146;s lifestyles so that they themselves can be mindful of the risks. The White Paperis encouraging on the issue of self-care. So the continuing challenge for the Government is to tackle inequality and, as part of social care, to ensure that they also attack the roots of poverty. We all know that if you live in poor housing, if your diet is poor and if you are among the long-term unemployed, your medical needs are likely to be that much greater. The Government and our care services must deal with the effects of these problems, but individuals can also make a contribution by dealing with the causes.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="07012584000178"></a>The significance of the next step in the reform agenda for the National Health Service is that services are required to be carried out within a framework of certain basic principles. I want to suggest one or two principles that I feel are necessary. Reform should be based on need and not driven solely on the basis of cost. In other words, what counts is what is best for patients. Treatment must remain free at the point of use. We cannot adopt the practices prevalent in some countries where your credit rating is checked before your pulse. There must be equality of access and universal coverage. Ours is a national health service, open to all and with care for all. Local services should be designed by and with local communities, but national standards should also apply. The next round of reform must also end the postcode lottery in respect of health access and provision. As a fundamental principle, there should be more collaboration in healthcare and less competition.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="07012584000179"></a>The best patient care is delivered when all service providers work in partnership and share best practice. The Royal College of Nursing has called for binding contractual obligations, requiring organisations tendering for NHS services to develop co-operative partnerships. I support that aim. The NHS belongs to all of us, whether patients or providers. We all have an interest in its reform. So the NHS has many needs, but what it now requires above all else is a period of stability, with continuity of policies. As we speak, there is a great danger that the NHS will suffer from what I call policy indigestion, leading to structural instability.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="07012584000180"></a>To sum up, we must co-ordinate all our care services, including health. We must involve both consumers and stakeholders in the decision-making process. The NHS must remain the centrepiece of this country&#146;s healthcare; public health and social justice depend on it. The staff of the National Health Service have played their part. They have adopted and are delivering <I>Agenda for Change</I>. If we now fail to secure a reformed NHS, we risk a return to the unhealthy, unequal country that was Britain before the NHS.</p>

All these provided support for people, enabling them to lead independent lives in their own homes for longer. I take this opportunity to place on record my thanks to all those people and to those who continue that work today.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="07012584000182"></a>Here we are today all these years later tackling some of the very same issues, but the major change is the increased longevity of many people. In 1971,16 per cent of the UK&#146;s population were over 65. By 2005, 6 per cent of the population were over 85, and the 2001 census showed that, for the first time, the number of people in England and Wales over 60 was greater than the number under 16. Therefore, the pressures we are facing to provide the services that we hope to provide are even more acute.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="07012584000183"></a>We should add to that the pressure on the NHS itself. The Department of Health expects a shortfall of 1,200 general practitioners in the coming years and the likely closure of a further 36 community hospitals, which I understand are under review, 10 having been closed since 1999.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="07012584000184"></a>I am very grateful to my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes for introducing this important debate. She and other speakers highlighted some of the important issues. I should like to pick up a crucial point that she made on pooled budgets and the possibility of shunting cost responsibility between health, social services and local authorities.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="07012584000185"></a>My noble friend Lady Shephard spoke of what happens on the ground. As your Lordships know, I have the great honour to be the Conservative Defra spokesman in this House. Therefore, I cover rural affairs and will address that subject today. Care provision is needed whether one lives in a town, a village or a remote hamlet. However, the cost of providing such cover is higher and more difficult to deliver in rural areas and in some cases is very fragmented. That is all the more reason to ensure that services are joined up. It is important that services should be provided in people&#146;s own homes and that people living in their own homes are enabled to attend surgery and hospital appointments when necessary.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="07012584000186"></a>I am glad to tell the House that earlier this week an all-party group on rural services was established. One of the issues suggested for detailed consideration was that of health and social provision in rural areas. Members of the group recognise that such services can be successfully provided only by overcoming any barriers that exist between the NHS and social care services. If we add to that the contribution made by many families, friends and voluntary organisations, we realise that there is a big challenge ahead and that proper provision has to be established.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="07012584000187"></a>I fear that in some cases the care provided is not adequate. In an era of modern communications surely we should be able to connect healthcare, social care, the doctor&#146;s surgery and other support services. It is much easier to do that than it was 40 years ago. As my right honourable friend David Cameron said in a recent speech to Age Concern:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="07012584000239"></a>&#147;We want to see more joint commissioning of both health and social care services acting together for the benefit of both the cared-for and their carers, rather than in opposition to each other, as so often they do today&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="07012584000188"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Morris, I looked at the health White Paper. I should like to draw two matters in particular to the Minister&#146;s attention. One of the first observations it makes is that in placing new responsibilities on local authorities and the NHS to work together, adequate funding will be needed. I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance on funding when he replies to the debate. Secondly, the White Paper refers to offering support for carers, including improved emergency respite arrangements and the establishment of a national helpline for carers as one of its priorities. Thirdly, the White Paper states that extending direct payments and piloting of individual budgets for social care to allow people to decide what their allocations are spent on must be achieved through primary legislation. I was surprised by that and I seek clarification from the Minister as to when that will happen and whether it requires primary legislation.</p>

Many doctors have appreciated that those who lose their jobs often suffer ill health as a result. Indeed, many patients who suffer ill health might improve if only they were able to find employment suited to their special needs.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07012584000191"></a>There was a fascinating experiment in 2001 which I should like briefly to describe to your Lordships. I am associated with the Tomorrow&#146;s People charity which specialises in helping the long-term unemployed into work. It has a brilliantly successful record in that regard. It appreciated that there were these patients who might be helped and this led to a liaison with the James Wigg general practice in north London whereby it was arranged that one of the advisers would go to the surgery on one day a week and offer to those who wished to avail themselves of it the package of employment support. In this case 200 people were seen and of those 61 agreed to go for the full package. As a result some found employment and others found voluntary work or went into training.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07012584000192"></a>The results were evaluated in 2004 by an independent authority. It found that 36 per cent were in employment and 55 per cent went for training or voluntary work. But what was most interesting was the health outcome. There were 20 per cent fewer GP consultations from the 61, 74 per cent less referrals to other practice counsellors and 19 per cent fewer antidepressant prescriptions after people had been on board with the GP for 18 months.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07012584000193"></a>This led to Tomorrow&#146;s People wishing to expand the initiative and it now has advisers in about 80 surgeries across the country. There are some in the area with which I am particularly associated&#151;Plymouth and Torbay&#151;and I happen to know the adviser who acts for these GP surgeries. He is a remarkable man and has even got himself into the pain management clinic of Torbay hospital.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1279"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1279</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70125-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07012584000194"></a>So it really works but it works because people are in an environment that they trust with doctors whom they trust and it is entirely voluntary. There is no pressure at all. The doctor may suggest to the patient that this would be useful and the patient can take it up or not. In some cases the patients learn about this through going to the surgery and seeing the adviser. I know that this has been sufficiently impressive for the Government to consider taking it up on a wider scale still through Jobcentre Plus. That sounds fine but I add a note of caution: one of the reasons for the success of Tomorrow&#146;s People or any similar voluntary organisation is that the advisers are totally independent. Many patients are scared of the official approach. Jobcentre Plus advisers cannot be anything other than official; it is the nature of the case.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07012584000195"></a>Furthermore, disturbing noises are coming from Ministers about trying to coerce people into seeking employment. In the very vulnerable sector with which we are dealing, that would be tantamount to disaster. It is essential that people decide themselves what they want to do. I trust that Ministers will bear that in mind if they really want to roll out this initiative on a much broader base.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="07012584000196"></a>There is much good in this approach. It has a very positive effect on people&#146;s health. There is a clear financial aspect, because the more people go back to work, the less dependence there will be on benefits. There is disturbing information from the Department for Work and Pensions that when someone has been on benefits for, say, a year they are likely to be out of work for eight years, which could even take them to retirement age, meaning that they never work again. There is immense pressure, if one wants to save public money, to pursue this line. I am concerned, however, that this initiative should not fall into the hands of bureaucrats, who, however well intentioned, will not understand that its success depends on its voluntary, non-official nature and its advisers&#146; willingness to work one to one with individuals for as long as it takes.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07012584000197"></a>Each session normally lasts from 45 minutes to an hour. Compare that with the average consultation with a GP or even a Jobcentre Plus worker and you will see how much time and effort is given. What is more, volunteers will carry on and on until the individual is in work or they have otherwise disposed of the case. It is a fascinating way of dealing with a long-term problem, and I hope that the Government will take it on board by funding some of these private initiatives rather than operating through Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07012584000198"></a>One of the things that restrains Tomorrow&#146;s People is the difficulty of finding funds from hard-pressed GPs, who would be very happy to take up such work but simply do not have the funds so to do. I leave that thought with the Minister.</p>

We must recall that this can be a meaningful debate only

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="07012584000200"></a>When last we debated the National Health Service, on 7 December, I drew noble Lords&#146; attention to the apparent uncertainty and confusion about the precise deficit currently forecast by the service for the current year, according to the quarterly report that it had filed in our Library on 9 November. Following that debate, I wrote to Her Majesty&#146;s Government requesting clarification of the precise deficit now forecast as the correct interpretation of the figures in the 9 November filing. The then Minister of State for the Department of Health, the noble Lord, Lord Warner, replied that the deficit forecast at quarter two for the National Health Service as a whole was &#163;94 million, after the application of a &#163;350 million contingency established by the strategic health authorities. I think that it was implied that they had been applied in the current financial year, which is a very important point. I was extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Warner, for his reply, which was extremely helpful and commendably prompt. I found it less than wholly clear on a possible second &#163;350 million contingency that was referred to in the same sentence, and it was not clear whether there were two separate contingencies of &#163;350 million or one, and how many of those had been applied to arrive at the &#163;94 million deficiency.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="07012584000201"></a>I am afraid that I submitted a further six Questions for Written Answer to the Government, each dealing with a very specific aspect of the same deficit forecast for the National Health Service this year. Those Questions were tabled on 9 January 2007. I anticipated a reply within the normal 14-day term, by 23 January 2007. I may have overlooked one of the many rules that I have had to learn on arriving in this House; perhaps a novice Peer is not entitled to a reply within 14 days. I am still waiting on those Answers. At present, none of the replies has come in, so I am talking today without the knowledge of what will be the result.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="07012584000202"></a>Without boring your Lordships with the detail of the six Questions, I summarise by saying that each of them was concerned with how far the &#163;94 million currently forecast deficit already took account of any provisions or contingencies that had been previously made by the National Health Service in setting its internal budgets for the current year, and what precisely might be the value of any such provisions and contingencies still remaining, which could be included later to adjust any further adverse variance which might be suffered by the NHS in the balance of the current year.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="07012584000203"></a>My curiosity about these figures was particularly acute because the noble Lord, Lord Warner, in his helpful reply, had recognised that the &#163;94 million forecast deficit was after the application of the&#163;350 million contingency. That raised in my mind the possibility that this might mean that the real running rate of cash deficiency&#151;if we were in fact talking about a cash deficiency for the current year&#151;was actually the sum total of those two figures at  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1281"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1281</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#163;444 million, or perhaps even &#163;794 million, if the sum of the other &#163;350 million mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, as apparently a second contingency, was also already written back. This question does, however, raise the issue of what precisely the deficit that we are seeking to quantify actually constitutes.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="07012584000204"></a>What I am trying to get to here&#151;and I can find no record anywhere in government reports to assist me&#151;is the net cash cost of running the National Health Service for each year, and then to compare how that net cash cost, stripped of all confusions caused by contingencies and provisions, compares from one year to another. If we can once get to the definitive net cash deficit for the NHS, then we shall have an accurate account at last of how far the NHS is performing within the central government&#146;s overall budget plan, and whether there is in fact a black hole for the current year, which will carry on as a reflection of operating net deficit, which will need to be filled by incremental funding from the public purse, from the taxpayers&#146; pocket, for the next financial year. Alternatively, there will need to be significant further reductions in NHS services to compensate, thus reducing the value of the health service that the taxpayers hope and believe they are paying for.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="07012584000205"></a>The Secretary of State was quoted by the BBC on 21 November 2006 as stating that she would take &#147;personal responsibility&#148; to restore the National Health Service &#147;to financial balance&#148; by the end of March 2007. Unfortunately, what the Secretary of State did not say was how the NHS will define the winning post for achieving a &#147;financial balance&#148; at the end of March 2007. Do the Government intend, as probably they should, that this represents the balance of cash spent compared to cash allocated in accordance with the Government&#146;s budget for health for the whole year, or do they have some alternative scheme whereby they intend to judge themselves ona performance based on what would effectively represent the trading account for a conventional corporate entity&#151;no loss/no profit&#151;which may be significantly distorted by the release and offset of contingencies and provisions on the lines that I have stated?</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="07012584000206"></a>My very strong belief is that all uncertainty should be removed now from this important issue, so that we may know precisely what figure will reliably show when the NHS budget is &#147;in balance&#148; and how that figure is quantified and defined by the NHS financial control arm. It is on the record as stating that 56 trusts and 119 primary care trusts are currently in deficit. I suggest that the accountants for the National Health Service must have discovered the holy grail of accounting if they can absorb 175 quasi-subsidiaries in deficit and still be in balance at year end. In which case, I shall bow my head in humble admiration of their brilliant accounting techniques.</p>

Earlier this week we heard from the LGA, and how the service is in danger of imploding through lack of adequate funding. Recently, I spoke in a debate on the pressures that exist in the social service budget of Lincolnshire County Council. Suffice it to say that the Government cannot expect councils to meet demographic changes and provide for increasing care needs without adequate funding.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="07012584000208"></a>I want to speak about community hospitals. A paradox is that the threat of closure comes when the Secretary of State is talking about building new ones. I join the debate to talk to the House about the opportunity that I believe exists and which suggests itself as a result of my direct experience of a small local community hospital, looking at things from the other end of the telescope from my noble friend Lord James of Blackheath.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="07012584000209"></a>I declare an interest as I remain a trustee of the hospital in Holbeach of which I was chairman for 18 years until last September. Time means that I must pr&#233;cis the story, but in 1988 when it became clear that Holbeach Hospital was to be closed, the South Lincolnshire Health Authority, as it was then, faced a budget cut consequent on RAWP, which some noble Lords will remember as the Resources Allocation Working Party. Rightly there was an outcry. Our nearest district general hospital was over 20 miles away. A group of us sought to set up a new model, which to the credit of the health authority was accepted and continues to flourish to this day.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="07012584000210"></a>We formed a community-based charitable trust and, backed by councils at county, district and parish level, we raised funds from local organisations and people. Converting the open wards to 26 nursing-home beds, we occupied them with many of the original long-term-stay patients. The hospital had very much been a geriatric long-term-stay institution. At that time the social security budget funded their care. The majority, with the exception of a few self-funders, are now social-services funded, of course. We also contracted with the health authority to provide six doctors&#146; beds and continued the out-patients&#146; clinics, including the physiotherapist clinic. The net result was an improved facility, running at an overall budget of half that which had been allowed by the health authority.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="07012584000211"></a>It has been an interesting adventure and not without incident, but the outcome has been remarkable. The trust benefited from a legacy which enabled it to extend the building and further improve facilities. From the original 26 beds, we now have 37 care beds offering different degrees of nursing care. The six doctors&#146; beds are now nine and they are used for terminal, respite and intermediate care. The out-patients&#146; facilities have been increased, so that out-patient clinics, the services of our part-time physiotherapist plus the nine beds are now provided in this current year to the NHS for &#163;273,000. The Minister will know that that is remarkable value for money for the NHS.</p>

<a name="70125-0012.htm_para30"></a>

A recent local fund-raising campaign means that we are on the verge of buying the residual freehold from the NHS, thus saving the rent that we have been paying.</p>

I certainly manifest the symptoms of excessive enthusiasm for my own ideas; that can be a fatal condition in a political speaker. However, I hope that it may prove infectious in this case. What better way has central government of keeping health resources at local level than trusting local people to run them on a voluntary basis? With imagination, closures can be averted. Valuable community resources can be maintained. Government can build on the local support&#151;indeed, affection&#151;of what people rightly consider to be their hospital.</p>

In these areas, we were always provided with packs containing syringes and instructions. There would be moments where one needed to use morphine, and the pack would say, in badly translated English, &#147;Get the posterior of the patient in a bent position, advance and stab him viciously&#148;.

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="07012584000218"></a>I would find&#151;this also happens in European countries&#151;that there was always an expert, ancien or wise man at local community level. While we look at the bigger picture of great hospitals and expenditure, little community activities seem to work extremely well in some other countries. In many of them, there is now a tendency to devolve and plurality is starting to arrive, as the noble Lord, Lord Warner, said. We could never reproduce the noble Lord, Lord Warner, so plurality is perhaps the wrong word; perhaps I should say the repetitiveness of certain services. As the noble Lord, Lord Morris, said, the nearer to a person&#146;s home, the better.</p>

When I have had foreign consultants here, and we have wandered around the corridors, they have said, &#147;We don&#146;t need to go any further to have a perfect sample of almost every form of disability or activity in the world&#148;.

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="07012584000220"></a>At local community level in many countries, I now find that the ambulance system compromises of three groups of people: people&#146;s children who, after their driving test, learn to become intermediate ambulance drivers; the ordinary paramedics who will turn up at any moment; and the fire brigade or community services, which will arrive within eight minutes. It is much better to ring them up because if there is a woman patient, they will send a woman doctor, a male paramedic and two others within a short time. At the other end, removing of people from hospital at an early date and providing local community services that will take them back as out-patients, deal with their drips, care for them, talk to them and not leave them alone is much more economic and efficient, particularly as we have modern technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="07012584000221"></a>Noble Lords will remember that one of the greatest scanners in the world was the British EMI scanner. If we look at diagnostics now, there is new equipment. Scanners can produce 128 slices instead of the normal 28 or 56 and can do a dual scan in half an hour. If referral could be made quicker, the throughput could be enormous.

Today is a perfect example of that. We have had a fascinating debate with a range of extraordinary contributions. The noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, took us off in an interesting direction, and the noble Lord, Lord James of Blackheath, gave a marvellous contribution because he is right that, until such time as we get to the bottom of the exact position of NHS funding, we are all shooting in the dark.

<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="07012591000006"></a>We also know from several surveys that, at the moment, social care is under-funded by about&#163;1.8 billion. That is an important place to start. In her opening speech, the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, spoke about the dividing line between health and social care. I want to talk about the interface and the overlap. It is important to do so now when we are in the run-up to CSR07 and when the Government, following a period of consultation, are about to announce the policy they intend to adopt on NHS continuing care criteria.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="07012591000007"></a>A lot of the debate centred on the relocation of health services. There has been a lot of predictable outcry when services such as A&amp;E wards or maternity services are closed. What rarely make the headlines are the consequences of those policies on non-emergency and non-elective procedures and, in particular, the consequences for social care.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="07012591000008"></a>The British Geriatric Society, in its response tothe consultation on NHS continuing healthcare and NHS funded nursing care in England, published in November 2006, noted that, in 2005, there was a loss of about 1,400 rehabilitation beds. More were lost in 2006. The effect of that was that people who had chronic disabilities and had undergone serious health problems such as strokes were being sent back into the community with far less rehabilitation.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="07012591000009"></a>The society noticed also that there had been an increase in admissions to hospitals because of the out-of-hours GP contract. What is increasingly happening is that an out-of-hours service gets a telephone call from an elderly person whom it does not know. To cover its back, it will send them into an acute admissions hospital, to doctors who also do not know them. Noble Lords should contrast that with the service outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, which runs effectively and well, and is reliant on people knowing in depth the patients whom they serve. There were many unforeseen consequences of the way in which the Government negotiated the GP contract. That was one of them. As the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, said, it has been an exercise in cost-shifting rather than in pooled budgets and joint working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="07012591000010"></a>An assumption was made in many of today&#146;s speeches that the transfer of care from an acute to a community setting would somehow be a straight replacement and cheaper. That is not always the case. As the NHS Confederation pointed out when it was talking about the future of general hospitals, although it is possible to move some functions such as rehabilitation which are now carried in acute hospitals&#151;even intensive rehabilitation following an operation&#151;there is never a point at which a functioning general hospital does not need that facility within its walls. In some cases, we are talking about duplication.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="07012591000011"></a>We are in the run-up to elections in Scotland. Therefore, the media south of the Border are beginning to pay attention to what is happening in Scotland. They are beginning to talk about the Scottish Executive&#146;s policy of free personal care. Much of that reporting has been misleading and simplistic. It is important to look at it because it has important lessons for those of us in England.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="07012591000012"></a>Research from Stirling University, which was commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and published in 2006, looked at the financial models of care in Scotland and the UK, and it came up with some interesting findings. It found that the introduction of the free personal care policy did not reduce the level of informal care, as had been predicted. Rather, it enabled carers to cope and to provide other forms of care, and, in some cases, to keep on working. It became an additional service and not a substitute. They found that the difference between Scotland and the rest of the UK in the public costs of personal and nursing care are very much smaller than is popularly assumed. In Scotland, people who are in residential care do not receive attendance allowance, for example; but they do in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="07012591000013"></a>It has been said frequently that the cost of the introduction of that policy has been a great deal higher than was expected. Yes, it was &#163;143 million in first year instead of &#163;125 million. That is still only0.2 per cent of the gross domestic product. Much of those costs would have arisen in any case. Care standards, for example, were introduced in Scotland and they had a cost attached to them.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="07012591000014"></a>Depending on the rate of demographic change and whether the costs of care rise in proportion to inflation, it is true that the cost of that policy could triple to2 per cent of GDP by 2053. However, in the intervening period, there is an opportunity for Government to take action that would offset it; for example, by prolonging the periods of healthy life in older people and, crucially, by extending care at home.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07012591000015"></a>The introduction of free personal care policy has had a beneficial impact on two groups of people in particular&#151;older people with modest means and savings, often women, and people who have Alzheimer&#146;s disease. If noble Lords think about many of the cases in the past two years where appeals have been won over continuing NHS care against decisions to refuse free nursing care in England, it is those people who are being disadvantaged by the unclear policy that this Government have deliberately pursued for the past seven years.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="07012591000016"></a>It is difficult to extrapolate directly from the experience from Scotland to the rest of UK. That is not because there are huge demographic differences. In practice, there are greater demographic differences within the four nations of the UK than there are between them. It is difficult to equate the fact that our system of social care funding is much more complex, and it is difficult to draw a parallel when much of the costs of social care are covered, for example, by the housing and benefits system&#151;the benefits system is slightly different in Scotland.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="07012591000017"></a>Perhaps the most important finding of the Scottish study is that the implementation of that policy of free personal care has enabled carers to cope and it has caused a transition of care to move away from institutions and towards homes. When noble Lords stop to think that the annual cost of caring for an older person in their own home in Scotland is &#163;3,000, they should contrast that with the annual cost of residential care&#151;there is a dramatic difference.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07012591000018"></a>Two weeks ago, CSCI presented its report on the future of social care. It called for a full and open debate about the settlement between the state and individuals about future care costs. We have known for many years, and all parties have accepted for many years, that since the major debates on the Royal Commission on the future of long-term care, the state will not pick up the full cost of social care. It is unlikely that it ever has done that. What is not clear, and is certainly not clear to individuals, is the likelihood of their social care provision being met by the state when they are older. Many people have wholly unrealistic views of what that is.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="07012591000019"></a>My suggestion is one that we have been making to the Government from these Benches for a long time&#151;since the publication of the Royal Commission report: just as is the case with pensions, there is a need to come to a settlement in which there is clarity, simplicity and an understanding of which aspects of social care will be paid for by the state and which will have to be paid for by individuals. Until we do that, we will have a continuing system of fragmentation for those who are trying to deliver social care and utter confusion for those who receive it.</p>

Like her, I see this short debate as an opportunity.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="07012591000021"></a>It is now just about a year since the Government published their White Paper, <I>Our Health, Our Care, Our Say</I>. That document was in many ways a landmark statement of policy. I was, and remain, enthused by a great deal of its content. Its ambitions were noble, its aims were absolutely to the point and, on the whole, it was realistic in so far as it set out a timetable for change that appeared reasonable. Therefore, as is not infrequent in health matters, we find ourselves sharing the Government&#146;s aspirations about the increasing emphasis that we should be  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1288"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1288</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>placing on delivering health and care services in community settings. We are very much with them on the idea of more and better joint working between health and social care. We are also enthusiastic about encouraging patients to be more independent, particularly those with long-term chronic conditions. We warmly back the idea of better support for carers. </p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="07012591000022"></a>That is the good news. The areas in which we find our doubts and fears coming to the surface are to do not with policy but with delivery. Many of the contributions today have focused on one or other aspect of that, and I believe that this kind of scrutiny is timely. I want to concentrate on three areas where there are real barriers to delivering the Government&#146;s community health agenda. They are funding pressures, commissioning and training.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="07012591000023"></a>Funding pressures are a hardy perennial of these debates, but absolutely crucial in the context of my noble friend&#146;s Motion. A lot of the problem stems from the acute sector. The combination of deficits in acute trusts, combined with government targets for elective treatment, has had a severe effect on the money available for rolling out the delivery of care in the community. A year on from the Secretary of State&#146;s assurances that no community hospital should close purely because of short-term budgetary pressures, 105 are still under threat of closure. The Government say that closure of beds does not always matter. Certainly, one can make a theoretical case for the closure of some beds, or whole hospitals, if joined-up community services are there to take their place, but we are still a long way off being able to make that claim. PCTs have seen their budgets top-sliced this year to feed the voracious appetite of the acute sector. That has seriously affected their ability to invest in community services.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="07012591000024"></a>For example, there is a government target to create 3,000 community matrons by March of this year&#151;nurses whose job it will be to keep people with chronic conditions at home and out of hospital. The latest Written Answer on this says that only 267 community matrons are so far in post. That figure has probably gone up, and the RCN believes that it is higher, but it is quite clear that the target will not be met by a wide margin. What about health visitors? The number of health visitors, if one looks at full-time equivalents, has gone down since 1997, and even since 2001. The number of midwives working in the NHS declined last year, even though the number of births went up. Midwife-led maternity units and birth centres are closing or under threat.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="07012591000025"></a>In general practice, there are further concerns. Many areas of the country are under-doctored, but we find that schemes encouraging doctors who have left the NHS to come back have been cut. There are also cuts in flexible career initiatives: 60 per cent of GPs recently surveyed said that their premises are unsuitable for present needs, let alone any expansion of activity stemming from the White Paper. Nearly half of all practices have complained that they cannot now provide enhanced healthcare services, because the budget for these has been withdrawn by the PCT. Yes, one can point to progress in some localities, and I am sure that the Minister will do so. The <I>Making it  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1289"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1289</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Happen</I> paper published in October refers to some successes, but they are patchy and as yet small in scale. All too often, the necessary momentum is simply not yet there.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="07012591000026"></a>At local government level, the picture is no less difficult. According to the LGA, seven out of 10 local authorities have found themselves hit by the withdrawal of NHS funding from jointly funded projects, or by a sharp increase in the referral of patients who would normally be cared for by the NHS. Some have experienced both, and the funding shortages are such that many authorities have reported increased waiting times for assessments and for social care services, while many are withdrawing services altogether. The structures for joint working are, in many cases, being put in place; but the means to achieve a step change in delivery are absent.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="07012591000027"></a>In many parts of the country, the squeeze on PCTs is not helped by the formula underlying the funding&#151;the so-called resource allocation formula. I have serious worries about the effect of the current formula on areas of the country where there is a high burden of disease but relatively low premature mortality. The Government&#146;s current formula weights the funding in a way that does not give sufficient emphasis to morbidity, as reflected largely in the age profile of the population. The result is that capitation payments in many areas are insufficient to cover existing demand for healthcare, let alone any heavier demand. I am aware that the Government are currently awaiting the weighted capitation formula. It would be helpful to know when the review is likely to be complete. My honourable friend Mr Lansley wrote to the Secretary of State about this more than two months ago but is yet to receive a reply.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="07012591000028"></a>My second concern relates to commissioning. Commissioning by PCTs is still weak. Part of the weakness lies in lack of skills, but part also lies in poor financial management. Of the 303 PCTs rated by the Healthcare Commission last year, none was rated excellent for use of resources. Only 24 were rated good and 124 were rated weak, which means that immediate action is required to remedy failings. In total, nine out of 10 PCTs were rated weak or barely adequate for their financial management. That is a hopeless basis on which to expect the ambitions of the White Paper to materialise successfully.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="07012591000029"></a>Meanwhile, payment by results is with us. One of the recognised features of payment by results is that it incentivises activity. Unless there is effective demand management on the commissioning side, the supply side, in the shape of acute trusts, will tend to suck in money from commissioners. At the same time, the tariff set for in-patient care is very broad brush. Rolled up in it is an element designed to cover the cost of convalescence. The tariff therefore provides no incentive to an acute trust to discharge a patient into step-down care in the community. Until the tariff is unbundled to separate the cost of intermediate care, the business of getting patients out of acute settings will continue to be hampered. The Government have insisted that such unbundling, if it is to happen, must take place locally, but they know full well that that is a

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="07012591000030"></a>My third concern is training. In the domiciliary and care home workforce, a large majority lacks training of any kind. Only 10 per cent of care home staff have any training in looking after people with dementia. On the nursing front, we have heard from the RCN this week that training for new district nurses and health visitors is being cut back drastically in many parts of the country. That is concern enough; but there is a wider issue here.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="07012591000031"></a>Despite the changing role of nurses, and increased specialisation into fields such as long-term conditions and public health, there is still nothing that one could describe as an established career pathway for nurses; nor are educational funding streams linked to the future shape of the nursing workforce that we all want in place. That lack of a career pathway for nurses and the absence of appropriate funding streams was one of the warnings made by Professor Dame Jill Macleod Clark at the major nursing conference that took place in London this week. I hope that the Government will heed it.</p>

<a name="70125-0013.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="07012591000032"></a>My overarching worry in the delivery of <I>Our Health, Our Care, Our Say</I> is that although the Government may have willed the ends, they have not sufficiently willed the means. The system is creaking badly; and it is very difficult to see how the five-year time horizon which the Government set themselves in the White Paper will be deliverable. At any one time, there are up to 1.5 million vulnerable people, notably the elderly, most of them at home, dependent on social workers and support staff for help. There are 17.5 million people with chronic diseases who are reliant on the NHS. For the sake of those people, I hope that if we revisit the issues in a year&#146;s time, we shall be able to point to a somewhat rosier picture than the one currently before us.</p>

<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1291"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1291</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been made over the last few years, such as in the number of staff now working in the health service&#151;about 325,000 more people than in 1997. The resource is going in, including capital investment, and above all the staff are doing fantastic work to develop services, reduce waiting times and give the people of this country the health service that they undoubtedly require and ought to have.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="07012591000036"></a>On this question of targets and priorities, I remember a search for how many priorities the health service had in about 1993, when I was working for the National Association of Health Authorities. We discovered about 57 and thought that we had better stop there. Whichever party is in government, there are lots of things that they will wish to achieve in a publicly financed national healthcare system. We, too, went down the target route. I believe that that was essential at the time, as we put resources into the NHS plan. Many of those targets have now achieved their purpose, and we are moving on to system reform, in which there are a number of components.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="07012591000037"></a>First, there is a lot more emphasis on the individual personal care that patients should receive from the NHS, much more accessible services and more choice. Of course there have to be some central targets; that is the deal with the taxpayer. It is absolutely right on such an issue as waiting times that the Government set a target for the NHS as a whole. The system of regulation and standards at the national level allows you to give much more freedom to individual organisations at the local level, with the financial incentive that payment by results gives to reward the best performers. We move from a situation where there have been a lot of centrally directed targets to a new system where there is a great deal of emphasis on the personal service to the individual patient, but with the safeguards of national regulation and safety standards. I am sure that that is the appropriate way to go.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="07012591000038"></a>We have all had a go at restructuring the health service and the noble Baroness invites us to have yet another go in health and social care. We have learnt that, whatever the structures, the key thing is whether people work together. Are there the right incentives? Can we remove the barriers to organisations working together? We have decided that it is better to try to get the incentives right to encourage people to do the right thing and to work together.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="07012591000039"></a>Nowhere is this more necessary than in commissioning. The changes that we have made, such as the reduction in the number of strategic health authorities and primary care trusts, 70 per cent of which will now be coterminous with the relevant local authority, have been a sensible approach alongside improvement in the capacity of the NHS to commission effectively. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, talked about commissioning capacity. I accept that the commissioning skills of many PCTs needed to be enhanced, but we believe that reducing the number of PCTs and strengthening commissioning capacity is the way to achieve an effective inter-relationship both between PCTs and NHS organisations and between PCTs and local authorities in the services that they provide. That will lead to a much greater integration

<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="07012591000040"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Masham and Lady Shephard, talked about the role of GPs and the out-of-hours experience. Let me say just one thing about the GP contract, to which quite a lot of attention has been given in recent months. The essential part of that contract is the direct relationship between the performance of GPs, in the quality and range of services that they give to their patients, and the financial rewards that they receive. That relationship is unique in modern healthcare systems throughout the world. The question of money has been about GPs exceeding the expectation of the degree to which they would provide the services according to the quality contract. We can build on that, but the structure is there to incentivise GPs to do the right thing by their patients. The result has been more services in primary care, more and better access, and more services such as minor surgery.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="07012591000041"></a>On the question of out-of-hours services, my experience in Birmingham is that the role of the PCT in securing the quality of those services has led to very much enhanced service at the weekends and in the evenings. However, I take note of comments that have been made. We expect PCTs to act as guardians of safety and quality, which noble Lords have discussed.</p>

I recognise that there are very different characteristics and that some of the organisational issues and challenges that would be faced in Norfolk and North Yorkshire are very different from those to be faced in downtown Birmingham. However, the key issue is still the same. It is the responsibility of the primary care trust to ensure that people in those areas receive a quality service. That is what we will monitor them against.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord James, asked some interesting questions about the definition of a deficit. I will not rise to the challenge of giving him a very technical answer now, although I promise to give him the answer in writing, which I will copy to other noble Lords. Essentially, for the National Health Service, clearing the deficit means exactly what it says.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="07012591000046"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, rightly mentioned MRSA. These are very tough challenges, but we have ensured that the NHS is taking the issue seriously. We have set a very challenging target and have local targets for C. difficile. The indications are that MRSA rates are coming down. We need to redouble our efforts, but I do not think that anyone in the health service is under any misapprehension that this very serious matter has to be tackled. My noble friend Lord Morris is right about the essential principles of the NHS and the tackling of health inequalities.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="07012591000047"></a>I endorse the views of the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, on the contribution of the WRVS. I also agree with her about the challenges of increased longevity; it is clearly a major challenge for our health and social care systems. Direct payments are available and, we believe, have been greatly welcomed. Thirteen local authorities are piloting individual budgets in order to get evidence to enable decisions to be taken on whether this should be rolled out nationally. Clearly, again, we see great potential there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="07012591000050"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, made some interesting comments, particularly on the potential of new equipment. There is no question but that there will be huge gains in productivity and speed of access to treatment the more quickly we can adopt proven new technology. We are committed to encouraging the NHS to embrace innovation as fast as it can. I also agree with him on the need to look at the provision of services in a bottom-up way. My understanding is that the resource allocation review will be completed by autumn 2007, and I am sure that there will be a great deal of interest in that.</p>

She suggested that it might be all right at director level but that, for people working in the field, it is not so hot. I do not share that view. None of these partnerships works without the staff of both organisations being committed.

<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="07012591000052"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Gardner of Parkes, Lady Byford and Lady Shephard, referred to resources. I will not repeat what I said in last week&#146;s debate on social care. There has been growth in the social care sector. Of course, I know people are arguing that it is not sufficient. The LGA report, <I>Without a Care?</I>, has proved to be of great interest to us all. It says that there is enough money in the system, but that it is in the wrong place. For local delivery mechanisms, the Government need to shift resources from acute NHS care to social care. I know that the LGA has also expressed serious concerns about whether central government funding is keeping pace with demographic change. These are issues that fall to be considered in our discussions in the next spending round. But I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that account was taken in reaching the 2004 spending settlement of pressures arising from rises in demand, pay and prices. There may be a debate about how successful that has been, but part of the spending review settlement process is to pick up and identify those issues.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="07012591000053"></a>There is of course continuing debate about the question of personal care as opposed to nursing care. Noble Lords will recall with fondness our great debates on these matters. Coming back to the LGA and the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Bruce-Lockhart, I would say to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that we are working closely with the LGA and the ADSS to identify long-term funding requirements for social care that will inform the spending review. We warmly welcome those kinds of debates. We understand the issue of demographic pressures. The evidence presented by Sir Derek Wanless is a matter of great interest to us all and we will feed it into the process. I also accept the comment made by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, about promoting financial flexibilities. We will continue to do that and to ensure that advantage is taken of them.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="07012591000054"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, made a fascinating speech about the links between the long-term unemployed and their health and life outcomes. She will know that I have just come from the Department for Work and Pensions, so what she said was music to my ears. The work being done by Tomorrow&#146;s People sounds wonderful. She says that advice coming from a neutral source for people who have perhaps been on incapacity benefit for a long time may be better received. I understand what she is saying, but the Pathway to Work pilots that my previous department undertook also showed that, when you work positively with people and give them the confidence and support to consider work again, even if they thought that they would never get back to work, that can have a remarkable and hugely beneficial impact when they do get back into work. I agree with her that having employment advisers based in GP surgeries is an excellent idea. It means that when a GP is asked to sign a sick note they can offer a constructive alternative. That would be very positive. I shall certainly

<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="07012591000055"></a>Noble Lords made a lot of comments about the value of community hospitals. The experience of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, was interesting and very encouraging. Let me repeat the Government&#146;s policy on community hospitals. We have made it absolutely clear that we want more services to be provided in settings that are convenient for patients, such as community hospitals, primary healthcare centres and similar facilities. We have also made it clear that closures should be proposed at local level not in response to short-term budgetary pressures but only where a particular facility is not considered clinically viable or is not being used effectively.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="07012591000056"></a>In this great world of devolved decision-making, which both parties are now signed up to, it is not for Ministers to intervene when there are local discussions. It would be wrong for us to do so. Our job is to signal the importance of what many community hospitals can provide. That is why the &#163;750 million capital programme was brought into being; it will encourage the provision of better facilities. On 22 December, my noble friend Lord Warner announced the first schemes to receive funding from the programme. So while I accept that at the moment some difficult decisions have to be made, noble Lords can be assured that we believe that community hospitals are a very important part of the development of community services.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="07012591000063"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this order was laid before your Lordships&#146; House on 28 November 2006, and a correction slip was issued on 13 December 2006 to correct two errors in that draft. One was a formatting error and the other the date for issue of the trade union code of practice, which I confirm was28 November.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="07012591000064"></a>The order specifies the classes of persons and organisations that are exempted from the statutory requirement to be authorised to provide a regulated claims management service under Part 2 of the Compensation Act 2006. Other related instruments setting out the scope of regulation and detailed regulations that underpin the framework were debated in your Lordships&#146; House on 5 December and came into force on 14 December. The conduct rules for authorised persons were published in December and the authorisation process was commenced.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="07012591000065"></a>The definition of claims management services in the Act is deliberately wide to ensure that there are no loopholes. The aim of the regulation is to target those who provide claims management services in certain specified sectors: personal injury, financial products and services, criminal injuries compensation, housing disrepair, unemployment and industrial injuries disablement benefits on a commercial basis. Individuals working in a voluntary capacity&#151;for example, in citizens advice bureaux or legal advice centres, or where claims management advice is given to a friend&#151;are therefore specifically excluded from the scope of the Act.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="07012591000066"></a>The order, which was debated in the other place on 22 January, is made under the power in Section 6(2) of the Act. The Government consulted on the order and discussed the proposals with a range of key representatives to ensure that the definitions accurately described the persons or classes of persons to be exempted. The order exempts legal practitioners, provided they act in the normal course of business permitted by the professional rules to which they are subject; the exemptions will apply only in so far as those concerned are already regulated in the provision of claims management services.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="07012591000067"></a>Those providing a regulated claims management service are regulated under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. This covers the handling of insurance claims by insurers, including where the

I am aware that there are concerns around this issue. The FSA has made it clear that it will take very seriously any allegations of impropriety over the handling of third-party capture claims by insurers. The activity of referring uninsured losses for a fee to a legal practitioner or an authorised person, however, is not covered by the FSMA and any person carrying out this activity will need to be authorised under the Compensation Act.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="07012591000068"></a>The order also exempts independent trade unions. The exemption for trade unions was debated at length during the parliamentary passage of the Act. We took seriously the concerns raised and have limited this exemption to trade unions that are certified as independent by the certification officer under the Trade Union and Labour Relations Consolidation Act 1992 in providing regulated services to members and members&#146; families. The strict criteria set out in this Act qualify a trade union, and the added requirement of a certificate of independence will help prevent a claims management business attempting to set itself up as an independent trade union and thus avoid regulation.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="07012591000069"></a>The exemption for trade unions does not extend to any subsidiary company, whether owned wholly or partly by a trade union, and any such company will be required to seek authorisation to provide a regulated claims management service. A condition of the exemption is that trade unions are required to act in accordance with a code of practice issued by my noble and learned friend the Secretary of State on28 November. The code sets out some key standards that exempted trade unions will need to apply in the provision of regulated claims management services to their members.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="07012591000070"></a>My department will work with the Trades Union Congress and the certification officer on monitoring the operation of the code of practice. A requirement of the code is that individual trade unions have an effective means for members to pursue a complaint. Clear breaches of the code can be reported to the TUC or to the Secretary of State. These will be investigated and appropriate action taken against individual trade unions. Very serious breaches of the code could lead to the exemption being withdrawn from an individual trade union, which would then have to apply for authorisation or cease providing claims management services.</p>

<a name="70125-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="07012591000071"></a>The order also exempts: charities and not-for-profit advice agencies; the independent complaints reviewer; students&#146; unions; the Motor Insurers&#146; Bureau; the Medical Protection Society and the Medical Defence Union; and individuals who refer or introduce a claim but only if they meet the strict criteria set out in the order. This exemption may apply to garages and body-shops that pass on referrals for fees, reward or gain, but only if they meet the tests I have outlined today. The order provides for an exemption from the need to be specifically authorised and does not imply exemption from the rules of conduct.</p>

Approximately 95 per cent of their work on behalf of insured clients is regulated by the Financial Services Authority, and therefore exempt under the regulations. A very small proportion of their endeavours, however, involve making referrals in circumstances where there is an element of uninsured risk. This activity falls outside financial services regulation.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="07012591000075"></a>Instead of legislating so as to bring these transactions within the scope of FSA regulation as well, insurance brokers are to be subjected to these new regulations, so they are now faced with two separate bodies that have responsibility for regulating intermediary claims activity.

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="07012591000077"></a>The second question is: how would an individual who felt the exempt body had behaved badly have their complaint dealt with? Other than that, we support the order.</p>

As he rightly indicated, BIBA requested an exemption. My officials met with BIBA to discuss the reasons, which were very carefully considered. The noble Lord indicated that BIBA made the case for exemption on the basis that brokers are regulated for other activities and that further regulation brings with it greater burdens. We  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1299"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have decided that is not a reason for exemption. A broker dealing with a claim which is not under a policy arranged by him or on behalf of a client is not regulated by the financial services Act. This is most likely to occur when a broker is aware of a possible personal injury claim by a client for whom he has arranged a multi-policy. If the broker chooses to deal with that claim by referring him to a solicitor, this activity is not regulated by the financial services Act. We therefore need to regulate it under the Act.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="07012591000079"></a>The noble Lord referred to a possible extension of the financial services Act. That would take primary legislation and it is not appropriate to waste time on this. We need to regulate properly now. I know BIBA is aware that this is the case and I believe we can work closely with it to ensure that the regulation works effectively. As it says in the order under Article 12, where brokers refer fewer than 25 cases per calendar quarter they will be exempted by the introducer exemption. I am grateful for the chance to explain our reasons.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="07012591000080"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Harris, raised the question of mutual societies, et cetera. I am sorry my honourable friend was not able to answer it. They are either voluntary, so excluded on the face of Bill, or they are not for profit so they are exempted. I hope that gives Mr Simon Hughes the answer he is looking for.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="07012591000081"></a>The noble Baroness asked me too about the process by which people could complain if things went wrong. We have set in place slightly different systems for trade unions and companies. An individual who feels a company has misbehaved can get in touch with the company, which will be required to have a complaints procedure, or we have set up a monitoring compliance unit through the regulation process. That unit will deal with complaints; it will investigate; it will also do mystery shopping and spot-checks through trading standards. We are also working with the Solicitors Regulatory Authority to put together a memorandum of understanding so that we can intelligence-share in order to get information. If the rules have been breached, there can be an oral warning, a public censure, and a suspension of the authorisation; we can put conditions on the authorisation, or ultimately cancel it. I hope that gives the noble Baroness the answers she is looking for.</p>

<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1300"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1300</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70125-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="07012591000085"></a>The case is called B and L v United Kingdom and concerns a couple, B and L, who by virtue of marriage were father-in-law and daughter-in-law. Over the course of time both parties&#146; marriages broke down and both ended in divorce. Some time after the breakdown of those marriages, B and L formed a relationship and started to cohabit. L&#146;s son shared the home with B and L, and although B is his grandfather, the child called him &#147;dad&#148;. Some years later, B and L decided that they wished to formalise their relationship by getting married; however, the superintendent registrar of deaths and marriages at the local register office correctly informed them that such a marriage would be impossible unless both their former spouses were dead.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="07012591000086"></a>The couple argued that the relevant provision in the Marriage Act 1949 was incompatible with Article 12 of the convention, which concerns an individual&#146;s right to marry. The European Court of Human Rights accepted those arguments and declared on13 September 2005 that those sections of the Marriage Act 1949 were incompatible with Article 12.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="07012591000087"></a>I shall outline the effect of the Marriage Act 1949 (Remedial Order) 2006. Section 10 of the Human Rights Act sets out procedures for remedial action to remove any incompatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights. The remedial order amends Section 1 of and Schedule 1 to the Marriage Act 1949 to remedy the incompatibility immediately. It removes the current prohibition on marriages between former parents-in-law and children-in-law. It also exempts a Church of England or Church of Wales clergyman from what would otherwise be his obligation to solemnise such a marriage.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="07012591000088"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that the Civil Partnership Act contains similar prohibitions on civil partnerships between former parents-in-law and children-in-law; however, they have never been commenced. The judgment in B and L v United Kingdom came after the Civil Partnership Act had completed its passage through Parliament but before it was implemented. The prohibitions on civil partnerships between former in-laws therefore appear in the Act but have not been, and will notbe, implemented. In time the provisions will be repealed.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="07012591000089"></a>Although the Government could have taken the opportunity to amend the Civil Partnership Act using the remedial order, there were concerns that the power to make incidental, supplemental or consequential provisions under the Human Rights Act might not extend to those changes and that they could be considered out of scope. As the provisions in the Civil Partnership Act have not been implemented, the decision not to include these amendments in the remedial order has no practical consequences.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a><a name="07012591000090"></a>The Government considered a number of options to address the Act&#146;s incompatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights before deciding upon a remedial order. They may have applied for the judgment to be referred to the Grand Chamber. However, the judgment was not out of line with the direction of government policy intentions for marriage legislation. The Government&#146;s view was that the European Court  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1301"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1301</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Human Rights had not inaccurately interpreted or applied the convention. They therefore decided to accept the judgment.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="07012591000091"></a>Secondly, consideration was given to introducing primary legislation to amend the relevant sections of the 1949 Act. We decided not to do this because the necessary amendments fell outside any planned legislation, and the need to seek parliamentary time could lead to a substantial delay in implementing the judgment. Bearing in mind that the couple in question were waiting to marry, such a delay was considered unacceptable.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="07012591000092"></a>Finally, having decided to use a remedial order, we had to decide whether to use the urgent or non-urgent procedure. The Government considered that the urgent procedure would not be appropriate in this case as, given the importance of marriage as a fundamental social institution, it is appropriate for the proposed draft order to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny before coming into effect.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="07012591000093"></a>Noble Lords will have had the opportunity to read the 16th report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which considered the proposed draft remedial order. In its report the committee agreed that the Government had compelling reasons for proceeding with the amendments by way of remedial order rather than primary legislation. It also indicated that proceeding to remedy the incompatibility by way of a non-urgent order rather than an urgent order strikes a reasonable balance between the competing considerations of the need to avoid undue delay before remedying the incompatibility and the need to afford a proper opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="07012591000094"></a>The Government received two representations on the order. One raised a question of vires. It queried whether the Lord Chancellor had the requisite power to remove the age restriction on marriage between parents-in-law and children-in-law, on the basis that the European Court of Human Rights did not consider the age restriction and, had it needed to do so, the Government might well have been able to mount a strong case for saying that it was not incompatible with Article 12.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="07012591000095"></a>The Government conceded that the European Court of Human Rights did not expressly consider the age restriction but they considered it necessary to remove the restriction in order to address the incompatibility with Article 12 of the convention across the board. They have the vires to do so by means of the remedial order.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="07012591000096"></a>The Government consider that there will be very few cases involving a party under 21. That is because the younger individual must have been 16 or over to enter into their first marriage, and then could not divorce for at least one year afterwards, and secondly because very few couples marry at so young an age. It should also be remembered that, as the younger party has already been through both a marriage and a divorce, the law has recognised them as an adult on at least two occasions. The Government therefore consider that requiring a couple who are ready to marry to delay that marriage until the younger is 21 is a breach of Article 12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="07012591000097"></a>Noble Lords will also have had the chance to read the 29th report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which considered the draft order. In that report, the Joint Committee took into account the representations that were received from both individuals and the public. Two such representations were received; one made observations, while the other proposed a change to the draft order. The Joint Committee accepted the Government&#146;s argument, and concluded that the Lord Chancellor is entitled to reach the view that the age restriction on marriage between parents-in-law and children-in-law is incompatible with Article 12 of the ECHR as a result of the Court&#146;s decision in B and L v United Kingdom, and that he therefore has the power under the Human Rights Act to remove the age restriction by remedial order. The Joint Committee concluded that the special attention of each House is not required to be drawn to the draft order on any of the grounds on which the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments may report in relation to most other instruments.It also recommended that the order should be approved.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="07012591000098"></a>I should also point out that the judgment in B and L v United Kingdom has already been implemented by Scotland in the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006, which amended Section 2 and Schedule 1 of the Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977 and came into effect on 4 May 2006; and by Northern Ireland in the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006, which came into force on 19 September 2006.

As the noble Baroness has pointed out to your Lordships, the order is the consequence of the case of B and L v United Kingdom, in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The individuals concerned were, by virtue of marriage, father-in-law and daughter-in-law. Subsequently, both divorced and decided to get married to each other. This, they discovered, was prohibited by the Marriage Act 1949, unless both their former spouses were deceased. The Court held that this provision of the 1949 Act was incompatible with Article 12 of the convention.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a><a name="07012591000101"></a>Although it was no part of the judgment, the Joint Committee on Human Rights, as the noble Baroness has indicated, concluded that the Government were entitled to conclude that the age restriction of 21 in the 1949 Act between parents-in-law and children-in-law was also incompatible with Article 12. Although it is almost inconceivable that any of the very few couples who are likely to fall within this order will be under 21, they will perforce have been marriedbefore, and in our view the age restriction serves no purpose.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a><a name="07012591000104"></a>The aim of the original prohibition was to uphold the sanctity of marriage, to prevent the development of inappropriate intimate relations or rivalries within the family and to protect the parent-child role. We accept that in the light of the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights the Government are obliged to amend the Marriage Act 1949. However, we regret that it has been judged necessary to make such a substantial change. I hear what the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, say about age, but retaining a legal impediment to marriage between parent-in-law and child-in-law, at least in cases where the younger party is under the age of 21, would have been our preferred outcome. Regrettably, that would not appear to be permissible following the decision of the Strasbourg court. Nevertheless, we are glad to see a conscience clause for the clergy of the Church of England and the Church in Wales included in the draft order, as the Minister has indicated.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a><a name="07012591000105"></a>In light of those changes to marriage law, the Bench of Bishops seeks the Minister&#146;s assurance that the Government will continue to uphold marriage. I think she referred to it in her speech as a fundamental, social institution and, if I have understood her correctly, perhaps she would be good enough to reinforce that. I also ask the Minister to give an undertaking that the Government will seek to encourage healthy relations within families.</p>

It is precisely because we want to uphold the importance of marriage as a fundamental social institution that we want to allow this to happen. There is nothing to prevent such people living together and never has been; it is not regarded as inappropriate in that sense. The individuals, having been together, may wish to marry. I think the right reverend Prelate would applaud that, but I understand his reservations.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a><a name="07012591000107"></a>The order allows these people who want to be together to solemnise that fact in their own way. I completely understand that for all sorts of reasons one has to be cautious about the pressures we put on people. I hope that the church will continue its teachings, as I am sure it will, to ensure that people understand the importance of the solemnity of marriage.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="07012591000108"></a>We have thought pragmatically about the age issue. People can get married at 16 and these individuals have already had a marriage and a divorce so they will already have been recognised in law twice as adults. Such people will not be 16 because there is not time to do everything and still be 16. I hope they will want to be with each other for as long as possible, if not the rest of their lives. While I accept the reservations of the right reverend Prelate&#151;I completely understand what he has said&#151;he has been good enough to raise them in a spirit of understanding what we are doing. We recognise that marriage, sometimes in unusual circumstances, is still fundamentally important.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="07012591000111"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in this short debate, I want to examine the merits of organic farming. There is no doubt that it is a great business success story. It is expanding rapidly and has become a major and profitable industry with a turnover, in Britain alone, of well over &#163;1 billion a year. It is backed by a powerful and influential lobby group, the Soil Association; it is heavily promoted by supermarkets; and organic food is popular with consumers. They pay premium prices because they are persuaded that organic food tastes better, is healthier than conventional food and that by buying organic, they benefit the environment and are helping to save the planet. We are constantly told that ethical living&#151;which is all the rage&#151;means buying organic. Who can possibly question the merits of organic farming? It is like questioning motherhood and apple pie.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="07012591000112"></a>I started without any prejudice against organic farming. I have no financial interest in supporting it or opposing it. If the evidence supports the claims made for organic farming I will back it. Unfortunately, it does not. Blind tests have shown that when people compare organic and conventionally grown fruit that is equally fresh, they cannot tell the difference. Time after time, tests by the independent Food Standards Agency have shown that organically grown food is not significantly different in terms of safety and nutrition from food produced conventionally. In one respect, it is arguable that it can be more likely to endanger health. Nor, perhaps surprisingly, is organic farming better for the environment. Far from saving the planet, promoting it can damage the environment and make global warming worse.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="07012591000113"></a>I start with health. People buy organic food because they feel it is free from synthetic pesticide residues, which are widely believed to cause cancer. In fact, the organic creed is founded on the principle that synthetic chemicals are bad and dangerous, while natural chemicals are safe and good. That is, of course, a scientific howler. It ignores the fact that a molecule is a molecule, whether man made or natural. Any number of synthetic chemicals, such as anti-bacterial drugs, are highly beneficial; any number of natural chemicals, like arsenic, ricin or aflotoxin, are highly poisonous. We consume many thousands of times more natural pesticides, manufactured by plants themselves to ward off pests, than synthetic ones.</p>

<a name="70125-0015.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a><a name="07012591000114"></a>Fear of pesticide residues is one of those media-hyped scares that has no scientific basis. It ignores the lesson taught by Paracelsus, of which no one in the Soil Association seems to be aware, that it all depends on the dose. Every mouthful we eat contains poisons, but in such tiny quantities that they do not harm us. Regulations set the safety levels for pesticide residues so high that they are between 100 and 1,000 times above concentrations at which any harmful effect might result. We should note that

Stomach cancers, which might be expected to be closely related to the carcinogenic effects of ingested pesticides, have declined by about 60 per cent in the past 50 years.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70125-0016.htm"/>


<a name="70125-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a><a name="07012591000115"></a>Indeed, concentrating on organic food may have bad effects on the health of our population. Evidence suggests that a diet rich in fruit and vegetables protects us against cancer. However, eating habits, certainly for the lower income groups, are influenced by price, and organic food costs more. When every lifestyle magazine urges readers to eat organic food, and implies that we are not looking after the health of our children if we do not, people on lower incomes may feel that they should buy more expensive fruit and vegetables, which means they are likely to eat fewer vegetables and less fruit, which may increase their risk of developing cancer.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a><a name="07012591000116"></a>On the environmental effects, I accept that many people take up organic farming because they want to benefit the environment, and no doubt they succeed. However, in a recent, carefully conducted experiment at Boarded Barns in Essex, where one farmer farmed similar land for 10 years in three different ways&#151;conventional farming, organic farming and the system known as &#147;integrated farm management&#148;&#151;therefore making the best possible comparison, it was shown that the system adopted is the least important factor for wildlife. What matters is leaving ample field margins and hedgerows, where 80 to 85 per cent of wildlife exists. On balance, of the three systems, integrated farm management came out best for biodiversity. Organic farming came out relatively badly, because it used the most energy.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="07012591000117"></a>Two vitally important factors contradict the environmental claims made for organic farming: its dependence on the plough, and its lower yield. No-till, or low-till, agriculture&#151;avoiding the use of the plough&#151;greatly benefits the environment. It prevents soil erosion, improves the structure and quality of the soil, increases its water storage capacity and reduces the need for irrigation. It reduces the risk or extent of flooding. It reduces the run-off of nitrogen and phosphorus into rivers. It avoids disturbing birds&#146; nests, earthworms and insect life in the way that ploughing does. Crucially, it reduces carbon emissions and sequesters carbon into the soil. Ploughing, on the other hand, an integral part of organic farming, is incompatible with conservation agriculture. Promoting conservation agriculture should be a prime objective of government farm policy.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a><a name="07012591000118"></a>In fact, what greatly facilitates no-till farming is the cultivation of genetically modified herbicide-tolerant crops. They have enabled American farmers to increase overall no-till to 35 per cent of all farmed land; compare that with Britain, where only 3 per cent of arable land is farmed without the plough. The carbon sequestration achieved by no-till or low-till agriculture in 2005 brought a saving of more than8 billion kilograms of CO2, which is equivalent to removing 3.6 million cars from the roads. These are huge environmental benefits. The organic movement denies us these benefits. GM crops, which the organic

Yet perversely, contrary to all the evidence, we back organic farming and oppose GM crops.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="07012591000119"></a>The second count against organic farming is even more serious and is its relative inefficiency. It makes less effective use of land than other systems. That is why organic food costs more. Supporters of organic food cannot have it both ways. If organic farming is not less efficient, then the premium prices charged for organic food prices are a ramp. In fact, the higher prices reflect a lower yield. Various studies show that the yield of most organic crops is 20 to 50 per cent lower than the yield from conventional farming. That may not matter to prosperous Europeans, but the world as a whole desperately needs more efficient farming. The supply of good farming land is running out, which is what drives South American and Indonesian farmers to slash and burn tropical forests. Saving tropical forests requires more, not less, efficient agriculture.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a><a name="07012591000120"></a>At present, nearly a billion people do not have enough to eat. Further, by the middle of this century, we will have to feed at least another 2.5 billion people. Hundreds of millions in Asia will adopt western styles of living, will eat more meat and vegetables and will have millions more pets, which are unlikely to be vegetarians. Finally, climate change threatens to increase droughts and heat waves and turn more areas of the world into deserts. What can organic farming, with its low yields, offer the developing world when it desperately needs more efficient agriculture?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_431"></a><a name="07012591000121"></a>In the words of the eminent Indian biotechnologist, CJ Prakash,</p>
<ul><a name="07012591000190"></a>&#147;the only thing sustainable about organic farming in the developing world is that it sustains poverty and malnutrition&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012591000186"></a>The Government should act on the basis of the evidence. They should recognise that, whatever the popular fashion and the hype, the organic movement is based on a scientific howler, commands premium prices that represent no extra value, holds back farming practices that benefit the environment in vitally important ways, and, if exported to the developing world, would be disastrous for the campaign to reduce poverty and hunger. Nothing can justify spending scarce resources on such counter-productive purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_432"></a><a name="07012591000122"></a>I have a feeling that the Minister may sympathise with some of the points that I make, but I am not sure that Defra will allow him to say so.

It is disappointing that there is an unusually low turnout of speakers, especially as the topic touches on several important matters of public debate, such as the relative merits of organic versus conventional produce, public support for various production systems and farming in general and the relative environmental impacts of different systems, as well as health and food.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_433"></a><a name="07012591000124"></a>I declare an interest as a conventional dairy farmer, a director of Dairy Farmers of Britain, a farmers&#146; co-operative marketing both organic and conventional dairy produce, a past president of the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers, a former chairman of Cheshire CLA and a member of the NFU and CLA. I was also a member of Sub-Committee D of the European Union Committee of your Lordships&#146; House in the late-1990s, which undertook an inquiry into organic farming.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a><a name="07012591000125"></a>I was drawn into agriculture through exposure as a student to the merits of organic farming by reading the pioneering literature of Lady Eve Balfour, Newman Turner and others and through working as a WWOF&#151;Working Weekends on Organic Farms&#151;volunteer. I am pleased that organic farming is now recognised as a valid niche in the market, that organic produce can be purchased more widely than from health food shops and that sales of organic food grew by 30 per cent last year, with the industry now worth some &#163;1.6 billion, which is about 4 per cent of total farm produce.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a><a name="07012591000126"></a>Organic farming is based on the belief that sustainable agriculture is maintained through attention to the soil and its health, rather than the crop or produce grown on it. That is why the Soil Association is so named. It is recognised by the EU as one of the certifying bodies for organic standards in the UK.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a><a name="07012591000127"></a>Organic production is generally recognised to be less efficient in terms of reduced output and/or increased costs, yet it can nevertheless be profitable through higher prices. The Government originally gave grants to farms under the organic farming scheme to help them in the two-year conversion process involved in qualifying for the organic standard, a period when they had higher costs, yet could not be deemed &#147;organic&#148; to attain higher prices. This has now changed to the organic entry level scheme or OELS&#151;I think that that is correct. Farmers would not say that it encourages them to convert, rather that it provides support for those in conversion in recognition of maintaining organic management requirements to deliver effective environmental benefits.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a><a name="07012591000128"></a>Once a farm is converted to organic standards, it is up to the farmer to harvest or market the benefits. I would think that one of the primary objectives of the Soil Association is to maintain supply just below demand. If this balance is lost, as it was in the late 1990s, with a subsequent crash in prices, farmers will be caught in a situation where they will have to repay the conversion grants if they can no longer afford the losses and wish to go back to conventional production.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a><a name="07012591000129"></a>Organic produce is criticised for being some 63 per cent more expensive than conventional food, according to recent research by Morgan Stanley. Relative pricing is up to the market to determine, but, generally, it must be welcomed that one of the attractions of organic production is that the producer can begin through his own marketing to set his or her pricing at a level which the market will bear, and not be subject to having to accept deflationary pricing undertaken by the mass-market

The resulting dynamics of supply and demand, inflationary costs and deflationary pricing will determine the extent of the organic market.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a><a name="07012591000130"></a>The impetus for this debate was supplied by the recent reports of the debate at the Oxford Farming Conference, where the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, David Miliband, said that the Government were pleased to give extra support to organic production, totalling some &#163;30 million annually, in recognition of the public benefits from organic food and organic production. He later said in an interview in the <I>Sunday Times</I> that there was no proof that the health benefits of organically produced food were greater those of conventionally produced food.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a><a name="07012591000131"></a>The Minister is correct on both counts. The Secretary of State is supported by the Food Standards Agency. Sir John Krebs has said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="07012591000189"></a>&#147;In our view, the current scientific evidence does not show that organic food is any safer or more nutritious than conventionally produced food&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012591000187"></a>It is for this reason that organic production is often dismissed as &#147;muck and magic&#148;.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a><a name="07012591000132"></a>In a paper prepared by Defra&#146;s sub-group on the European Action Plan for Organic Farming in July 2002, the relative merits of claims and counter-claims are assessed. Regrettably, there are few comparisons between organic and conventional extensive farms. In any case, comparisons between different systems are relatively insensitive and variables so numerous that a clear definition of conventional agriculture can become rather meaningless.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a><a name="07012591000133"></a>However, it can be stated in the generality that, under organic production, biodiversity is improved, pesticide pollution is less, soil organisms benefit and waste is lower. It is generally the case that the farming skills and good practice are more relevant than the system. The care and controls in place throughout the food chain are far more significant.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a><a name="07012591000134"></a>What irks the farming fraternity more in this debate is the missionary attitude of the Soil Association and its spokesmen towards conventional production. Its claims are misleading and without evidence. The Soil Association is believed even to have suppressed evidence that did not reinforce its prejudices. I have been led to understand that recent research commissioned by the Soil Association at the Scottish Agricultural College found that the modern Holstein cow performed best in an organic system, yet that has not been publicised. A philosophy based on the soil does not have any bearing on genetics, yet the Soil Association is backward-looking in disqualifying genetic improvement through embryo transfer and is ignoring the debate on genetic modification and the benefits that that could bring. In the different, but related, matter of cloning, in a recent press story, Lord Melchett propounded opinions without foundation or evidence regarding a daughter of a clone recently born on a farm in Staffordshire.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a><a name="07012591000135"></a>That said, it is right for consumers to be concerned about their diet and health. Poor diet probably contributes as much as one third of the risk regarding  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1309"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1309</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>two big killers&#151;cancer and cardiovascular disease. Jamie Oliver recently highlighted the benefits to health in providing good food in schools. The Food Standards Agency aims to help effect changes in diet to improve health. It is also right for producers and the food chain to be concerned about production methods, handling systems and food quality. Government support for organic farming provides a framework within which consumers have choice and which they demonstrate they are willing to pay for.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a><a name="07012591000136"></a>The Government, through the taxpayer, provide support for public goods. Good food is instrumental in providing good health. It is well to reflect on the use of partnership between government and industry. Against the background of BSE and the foot and mouth outbreak, the debate is engaged concerning government support, best practice, the public good, industry independence and so on. The Government are keen to promote a partnership approach within agriculture, especially as regards cost-sharing in their health strategy. For that to work, it is essential that partnership does not take on an Orwellian meaning, whereby some partners are more partners than others. Partnership between government and industry should mean transparency and combining to run systems jointly. That means open books. If industry is paying to run systems, the industry has a duty to scrutinise those systems and alter them if it is felt that they could be run better. That means that industry is part of management and is not used as a victim. Partnership means commitment and support from both sides to make decisions that are carried out both by government and industry whereby both sides must gear up for the job. In that regard, severe dismay is being expressed on the introduction to the change in the pre-movement test requirements.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a><a name="07012591000137"></a>It is only a week until 1 February, the first anniversary of the wholly insufficient tabular form of valuation for compensation to farmers caught up in the TB outbreak. While this debate is not concerned with such wider matters, it is nevertheless part of a general debate on government support for agriculture. The industry, which in this case means Holstein UK, which registers and certifies the parentage of three dairy breeds and some beef breeds, has put forward a more just, rational and logical tabular form of livestock valuation. Can the Minister agree to give that swift attention to correct an imbalance and dishonest practice that is hurting the rural community?</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a><a name="07012591000138"></a>I will end with one more query for my noble friend. The organic farming scheme closed for new applicants in about 2004. Such agreements are still in place for some producers. The OFS producers are encouraged to transfer to OELS, Organic Entry Level Stewardship, but some 90 known producers have come forward, saying that they have received repayment demands from Natural England. I understand that that relates to handbook guidance that is unclear on the eligibility of OFS to OELS conversion and has captured some OFS in countryside stewardship, which is not eligible for OELS. Can my noble friend undertake to look at this with a view to issuing clearer guidance in the handbook, and discuss that with Natural England to pursue a more lenient attitude in the mean time, given that so many producers are involved?</p>

If public money is going into them, we need to consider carefully the benefits of the various methods.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a><a name="07012591000140"></a>My noble friend is quite right to point out the great importance that soil plays in food production, in flooding and in carbon sequestration. He addressed some remarks to a worldwide situation, but I will restrict mine to the UK&#151;partly as this debate is focused on the support that the organic sector gets from the UK Government, and partly as it is a wide enough brief anyway.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a><a name="07012591000141"></a>The organic sector set the standard for agriculture to lay emphasis on things that in the 21st century are agreed to be important again: animal welfare, biodiversity, soil management and so on. Yet, at the time when the Soil Association was struggling to promote them, these things were regarded as not at all important. Quantity was all. The Soil Association had to fly the flag for the importance of those issues, and did so effectively through those years. It still has an important role to play in bringing forward debates: for example, on antibiotic use in animals.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a><a name="07012591000142"></a>The Minister is probably more aware than I that research has not yet come forward to prove any case for linking the rise of diseases such as MRSA in hospitals with the fact that humans are increasingly resistant to antibiotics yet are, of course, consuming them in various forms. That may be because they are taking them for their own illnesses, or as a result of what they are eating. All sorts of issues need to be raised, and the Soil Association has a strong part to play in that.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a><a name="07012591000143"></a>I would agree with my noble friend that the Government need to look closely at their policies again in the light of climate change. Ploughing is not necessarily integral to organic production. In my neck of the woods in the West Country, for example, organic farmers are primarily concerned with poultry and dairy production, which does not involve vast amounts of ploughing. Their organic standards are much more based around animal welfare, and the sort of grass mixes that can be used.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a><a name="07012591000144"></a>Some interesting research done by the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, showed that organic milk from cattle fed on red clover had a vastly increased amount of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in their milk&#151;the very ones that the FSA is anxious that people should have in their diet, although they are conventionally regarded as coming only from fish. So, that sort of dietary implication needs to be borne in mind.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a><a name="07012591000145"></a>A study conducted over 21 years addressed the very issue that my noble friend Lord Taverne was talking about. It took place in Switzerland and looked at the long-term efficiency benefits in comparing organic and integrated farming. It found that yields were 20 per cent lower in the organic system, but that fertiliser and energy input were 34 to  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1311"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>53 per cent lower. That is extremely important when thinking about climate change, as fertiliser is one of the most energy-hungry types of substance that one can get. Pesticide input was 97 per cent lower&#151;which, again, is very important when one considers the cost of cleaning up our water from pesticides. About&#163;120 million is spent in the UK on removing pesticides from the water supply. Those pesticides are mainly a result of the chemicals used in conventional farming. I have that figure from research done in 2000.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a><a name="07012591000146"></a>To return to the Swiss comparison, the organic system also had high soil microbial biodiversity and activity and greater soil particle stability&#151;both very important for stability as climate change, flooding, and so on is likely to rise in importance. The reference for that research is from <I>Science</I> magazine in 2002. The organic farming sector can continue to hold its head high. It has every claim to be able to meet the issues brought about by climate change.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a><a name="07012591000147"></a>I turn for a moment to the issue of why consumers buy organic food. As the noble Lords, Lord Taverne and Lord Grantchester, have said, the organic sector has grown considerably over the years. Despite what Sir John Krebs said, consumers continue to have faith in organic food. That is partly because of what is not in that food rather than what is in it. There have been no conclusive tests about taste issues: they are very subjective. I have already mentioned antibiotics. People are often concerned about their food containing pesticides. One lot of Cox's apples, for example, can be sprayed up to 16 times with 36 different pesticides. The Government&#146;s official advice is to wash and peel vegetables and fruit to remove those pesticides.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a><a name="07012591000148"></a>It is extremely important for consumers that they are not consuming things that they feel unhappy with. But I think that they are also convinced by the case for biodiversity and the importance of field margins, beetle banks, ponds, and hedges. They all cost money to manage. Part of that is recovered through the organic premium. I am surprised by the figure cited by the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, although I would not question it. If we take milk, for example, organic milk costs 20 per cent more at most. A chicken, which is at the very top end of the range of what might be more expensive, is about 50 per cent more. In many cases, the conventional and the organic product are only some pence apart&#151;carrots or lettuce, for example.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a><a name="07012591000149"></a>In my remaining time, I should like to ask the Minister about a piece of research done by Manchester Business School for Defra, commissioned at the cost of &#163;140,000, I believe, to investigate whether purchasing an organic or a conventional trolley of goods had more environmental impact. It did not conduct any new lifecycle assessments. Crucially, considering the importance of the impact on biodiversity and landscapes, which must be considered, Natural England was not consulted at any stage of the study, which seems a big gap.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a><a name="07012591000150"></a>I would also be grateful if the Minister would tell us what plans Defra has to continue funding such important research as the Organic Conversion

<p><a name="stpa_459"></a><a name="07012591000151"></a>I should also like to ask the Minister about undersupply in organic British livestock feed. If the Government&#146;s official policy is to cut down food miles, as the NFU has pointed out, that needs to be addressed. Currently, 70 per cent of organic livestock feed is imported. Clearly, that is not in keeping with the principles of low food miles.</p>

<a name="70125-0016.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a><a name="07012591000152"></a>In conclusion, the organic sector has the confidence of the consumer and of the Government. Liberal Democrats have a proud record of supporting the organic sector.</p>

It is important because claims are being made by one side of the industry that, in some ways, belittle the contribution made by the other side. A chance to talk about it today is extremely important. I was also pleased that he particularly mentioned the real value of the integrated farm management scheme, which I claim as LEAF&#146;s. As president of LEAF, I claim it with even greater joy. LEAF has enabled many farmers to farm commercially, while protecting and conserving the countryside. Lord Peter Melchett was the main speaker earlier this week at the City Food Lecture, obviously speaking on behalf of the Soil Association but also of organic producers. Interestingly, he also recognised the value of integrated management. I was particularly pleased when, in the question time,Sir Stewart Hampson, chairman of John Lewis, with Waitrose one of their businesses, again recognised the importance of LEAF.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_464"></a><a name="07012591000157"></a>The behaviour of the British shopper is definitely changing, and sales of organic products have risen steadily. They now form an important part&#151;albeit a small one&#151;of the total. The Secretary of State recognised recently that it was only 4 per cent of the total farm produce, not 40 per cent:</p>
<ul><a name="07012591000191"></a>&#147;I would not want to say that 96 per cent of our farmed produce is inferior because it is not organic ... Despite the rise in organic sales being &#145;exciting&#146; for shoppers, they should not think that conventionally produced food is &#145;second-best&#146;&#148;.</ul>

We used to have livestock on our farm&#151;sadly, we do not anymore&#151;but the whole question of how livestock are raised is important in the wider field.

Apparently, that concept is old-fashioned and no longer the way in which the country&#146;s finances are judged. I am disappointed that we now produce less than two-thirds of our own food requirements, and that proportion will continue to fall steadily if we are not careful. The Minister is well aware that I still have concerns about food security overall, which I know he also supports. I am not saying that we should produce everything, but, as the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, commented, in an era in which there is pressure on a growing international population as a result of climate change and difficulties with the water supply, we and other countries that can grow our own food are beholden to grow it. I am grateful that the current Minister appreciates that.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a><a name="07012591000161"></a>I echo the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, and others: no science has said that organic is better or not so good. The Secretary of State has said so, as did Sir John Krebs when he was chairman of the Food Standards Agency. The whole question is therefore one of choice, but I must ask how the consumer makes that choice. I do not know whether the Minister happened to see it, but I was very concerned that, at Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time yesterday, following a Question from my honourable friend Jim Paice, the Prime Minister could not explain why Ministers in another place had blocked four separate attempts to bring a labelling Bill into being. Such a Bill would require at least country-of-origin labelling, and, I hope, would have greater detail that would help people to make that wise choice. As I have indicated, it is important. We want the general public to be able to feel confident that the food that they buy is good and healthy and that as much of our food as

These matters are all important, and it is vital that we can pass this on to the general public.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a><a name="07012591000162"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taverne, asked whether the Government would be withdrawing their financial support. I will not pick up directly on the issues that have been raised. The NFU briefing was good on that, so I will let the Minister refer to it. The organic farmers have certainly had direct support in the past five years. I want to broaden the issue so that it is not the Government&#146;s responsibility. I was surprised to learn recently that the National Lottery had given the Soil Association large sums of money for farming projects. From 2001 to 2006, the total funding that it received&#151;noble Lords will not believe this&#151;amounted to a staggering &#163;17,909,679. I could not believe it. I am not saying that it will not be wisely used, but there are many ways in which we could use National Lottery money rather than directing it in that way. If the Minister has a view, I would be grateful if he would share it with us when he comes to respond. Defra clearly tries to put its money where it thinks it should be spent. Obviously, there is never enough money, so it has to take difficult decisions, but &#163;17 million to a particular organisation that is involved in only 4 per cent of the food that is produced overall is nonsense. I really am concerned about that.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a><a name="07012591000163"></a>Briefly, another contribution to the debate was made at the Oxford farming conference by Professor Diana Bowles. Her contribution was very exciting. She talked about the great opportunities that would be available in the next five and 10 years. She reflected on how not only would crops be able to produce food but other aspects of the same plant could be used in new ways.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a><a name="07012591000164"></a>The key to such innovation requires adequate funding, which has already been touched on. It is worrying that, in recent years, research funding has reduced. I very much hope that this will be a priority for Defra in easier times when it does not have to look at the &#163;200 million budget deficit and will be able to put money back into research and science, without which we cannot make proper judgments.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a><a name="07012591000165"></a>I have indicated that I am not against organic production. I certainly do not say that it does not have a place or that it is not right. Consumers should have choices, but they must have the ability to make those choices. We believe that farmers should be encouraged to follow whatever form of production suits them wherever they think the marketplace is, but I want to ensure that we do not see one side of the farming community belittling the contribution of the other. I return to where I began: I am very proud to be a member of LEAF. It leads the way on how we can continue production on a commercial basis while conserving and protecting, for example, wildlife, and, more particularly, water and soil, which will be crucial to us all.</p>

<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1315"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1315</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>possible. I will not be able to deal with some issues, but I shall try to answer as many of the detailed points as possible. On any points that I am unable to address, I will do a note. On declaring my interests and in terms of being pro-organic or anti-organic, I make no bones about it: I am pro-GM, but I declare an interest as a member of the Soil Association. I do not see anything incompatible in that. I became a member out of solidarity some years ago. I had a family member who was having chemo and wanted to have fewer chemicals in their body. Going organic was one way to assist with that.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a><a name="07012591000167"></a>Organic cannot be one-size-fits-all. Some claims made on both sides of the argument are quite ridiculous and are not based on any science. Nor do I subscribe to the anti-science view around the country, particularly of those who do not want trials to take place because they are worried about the information that might be gathered from experiments. To that extent, I oppose and criticise the people who rip up crop trials. How do we get information if we do not do trials? Not wanting the information to be out there because it destroys one&#146;s original concepts or prejudices is not on.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a><a name="07012591000168"></a>I also want to make it clear that there is no unsafe food on sale in this country. I repeat: no unsafe food is on sale. No one can make a claim that their food is safer than anyone else&#146;s. Any unsafe food would be illegal if it was on sale. It is as simple as that. However food&#151;whether it is crops or meat&#151;is farmed or produced and wherever it is produced in the world, there are checks and surveillances of residues and other matters that are beyond the imagination of the public in terms of the numbers and the quantity in the policing of the system to protect the whole food chain. We publish the results, so there are no secrets, including where we buy produce from.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a><a name="07012591000169"></a>To that extent, John Krebs was right. No one can say that because a food is organic it is healthier. It can be claimed that because a food is organic there may be less chemical residue. But if the residues are within the limits, they are perfectly safe. The two things are not incompatible. No one can claim that commercially produced, ordinarily produced, intensively produced food is any less safe than organic food. That cannot be the case. Going with the science is important.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a><a name="07012591000170"></a>As for some of the prejudices that are around, the other week I was in a 12.5-acre greenhouse, which was next to the site of a 14-acre greenhouse that was being constructed. It will produce one product&#151;tomatoes&#151;in England between March and November. Those tomatoes will be grown on our land and everything used will be the by-product of another food&#151;the carbon dioxide, water and heat. Even the bees for pollination are home-grown. In every calculation, the produce out of that greenhouse would be organic if the root was in soil. But it does not classify because the root is not in soil, even though the product is as organic as any organic tomato. It is a by-product of sugar production at the largest, most efficient sugar plant in Europe, which is in Norfolk. So there are prejudices about the way in which the product has to be produced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_476"></a><a name="07012591000171"></a>The organic movement is a voluntary movement. It is highly regulated&#151;the Soil Association is just one of the certification bodies. But because it is a voluntary movement, it can make its own rules. There are European standards now and that is important. The noble Lord, Lord Taverne, did not push very much on the monetary aspect in his attack on the concept of organic farming, but in our view there is a public good out of the money that the Government use to support organic producers. It is an infinitesimal amount&#151;&#163;30 million to &#163;40 million a year&#151;in terms of environmental goods, but the single farm payments to farmers stand at &#163;1.5 billion a year. The idea that we are paying out this money for the public good only because the produce is organic is wrong. It is an infinitesimal amount compared to the overall scale of public support for farming, and quite rightly so, because we are buying an environmental good.</p>

<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="07012591000172"></a><b><a name="70125-0017.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07012591000226"></a>Lord Taverne:</b> My Lords, just on that point,&#163;30 million to &#163;40 million a year would be very valuable for publicly funded research into agriculture.</p>

<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="07012591000173"></a><b><a name="70125-0017.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07012591000227"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, it would be, but of course our publicly funded research into agriculture receives much more than that. However, with reference to the latter points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, I saw those adverts and I said to someone, &#147;Where did the money come from?&#148;. I saw a full page of adverts a couple of weeks ago, and I discussed the matter with Sir Don Curry, who assists Defra these days. It is far more money than we have to fund the Year of Food and Farming, which will start later this year. I cannot criticise the National Lottery and the way in which this was done. I do not know the reasons and the background and why such a large sum of money was given to one organisation for one narrow aspect of agriculture. I do not criticise that, but I do not know the background or the reasons.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a><a name="07012591000174"></a>Since 1997&#151;the year the world started, of course&#151;there has been a 13-fold increase in land being farmed organically in the UK. The figure stood at just over 51,000 hectares in 1997 and it is 620,000 hectares in January this year. That is a substantial increase and it represents around 4 per cent of the total agricultural area of the UK. A lot of that is in Scotland. There is a disproportionate amount there&#151;that is not a criticism, it is just the way in which the land has been used.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a><a name="07012591000175"></a>But that does not mean that the ordinary, intensively produced food, whether it is grown or whether it is livestock, is second best. Nobody is saying that. In fact, we could not feed ourselves if we went organic. I know that people will dispute this, but if we went all organic we would be importing huge amounts of food, whatever people might claim, because the yields would be so much less. I appreciate that one has to look at the totality of the energy that is used. There would be fewer pesticides and other things that are used to produce the crops if we went organic, but we want to encourage choice.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a><a name="07012591000176"></a>I agree 100 per cent with what the noble Baroness said about LEAF. I wish every farm was operating LEAF rules and practising integrated farming. We  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1317"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1317</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>started a similar process in Northern Ireland when I was there; I said, &#147;This sounds like LEAF in England&#148;. I went to one of the farms in Gloucestershire where farmers go to learn about the LEAF techniques. It is absolutely vital. It is good for the environment and it needs supporting. It is good that supermarkets and other retailers are recognising this in their marketing. It is not marketed as being safer, but it is marketed as being more environmentally friendly and as encouraging greater biodiversity. There is no question about that at all.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a><a name="07012591000177"></a>The fact is that since we increased the level of support for organic farming, the amount of land given over to it has gone up 13-fold. It helps our sustainability objectives and provides environmental benefits&#151;I know there can be arguments about this&#151;by encouraging biodiversity, and it gives farmers a choice. A lot of young farmers are involved in the organic movement. They are often much more entrepreneurial than the older generations. I have met some of them, as has the Secretary of State. These farmers are willing to use different systems and techniques and to enter into new marketing arrangements for their products.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a><a name="07012591000178"></a>If there is any criticism to be made, and one can always find lots to criticise, it is on the dairy side. All these new probiotic yoghurt drinks are imported, save for one being produced by a co-operative in Scotland for Marks &amp; Spencer. However, all organic yoghurt is made here at home in the UK. But in terms of added value, of getting more out of the produce for the premium, others are showing the way on that side of the dairy industry. But Yeo Valley, for example&#151;the only yoghurt I will touch&#151;and others because I must not advertise too much, produce all their yoghurt in the UK. That is a lesson to the rest of the dairy industry. The probiotic drinks producers went for a certain kind of marketing in a niche area, and have been very successful, but we have let that opportunity pass us by.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a><a name="07012591000179"></a>Consumers want organic food for a variety of reasons, whether for animal welfare, the environment or other reasons. The choice is theirs, and that is the point. The noble Baroness is quite right: sometimes people buy organic produce because they think it may be better for them. There is nothing wrong in that so long as the claims made are accurate. Indeed, more flexibility on this is on the way with the introduction of European labelling, which I shall come to shortly. At present, certain organic foods cannot use an organic label if the whole product is not organic. Some of the ingredients may have been produced organically, but it is difficult to get an organic label for them. The European Union is producing more flexible rules to assist in that, which is good for organics, consumer choice and improvements in labelling. The proposed regulation before the EU Agriculture Council would require origin labelling for some organic produce where the EU organic logo is used. On the organic conversion scheme, we are working on a new one which is to be launched later this year.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a><a name="07012591000180"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked about long-chain omega-3 fatty acids. That got me going because it is not in my brief. I am reliably informed by the Box that organic milk contains short-chain omega-3 fatty  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1318"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 1318</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>acids which are not the same as the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids found in oily fish, which are what protect us against cardiovascular disease. What we need are long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, so organic milk cannot make that claim because it contains short-chain omega-3 fatty acids. If these claims are being made, one has to look closely at the science.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a><a name="07012591000181"></a>On the TB evaluation, we are in touch with the sector on a realistic valuation for organic reactor animal slaughter. This is an issue and I appreciate it very much in terms of the distress caused to farmers in any event. We are looking at the cases mentioned by my noble friend with Natural England. I shall come back to him on that because it is a somewhat specialist issue.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a><a name="07012591000182"></a>I turn to legal safety standards, and here I cannot impress on the House enough the fact that organic produce and conventional produce have to meet exactly the same legal food safety standards, as would any GM foods. So far as I know, there has never been a food safety issue related to GM foods. Notwithstanding some of the arguments that have been made, that is the case. In fact, we know more about some GM foods than we do about traditional foods because of the science involved in the gene and DNA work being carried out. Nutrient levels are similar whether food is produced by organic or conventional agriculture. That is the evidence.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a><a name="07012591000183"></a>Support for organic farming by the Government does not mean to say that we see it as the only way forward. We support a range of farming activities. As I say, the amount of money here is small, but it is necessary to encourage farmers who wish to take the organic route. They are not forced or encouraged to do so but schemes are available if they wish to do that. The Government are saying to farmers, &#147;We do not want to subsidise production. We want you to be nearer to the market&#148;. That is important for freshness, as the noble Baroness said. We want farmers to be nearer to the market, to market their products better and to get more control over their aspect of the food chain, which is also important. We are saying to farmers that if they want to go that route there is an opportunity to do so if they wish to take it. Farmers are not forced to go that route and must accept the risk of doing so.</p>

<a name="70125-0017.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a><a name="07012591000184"></a>Organic farming makes an important and profitable contribution to the farming industry; we make no bones about that. Certainly, it contributes to biodiversity and has environmental advantages. However, biodiversity and environmental advantages can also result from aspects of LEAF farming and integrated farming. So it is not the case that one kind of farming is all good and another is all bad. A realistic assessment is needed. All forms of farming and different aspects of production can meet customers&#146; needs. It is important that we should produce as much of our own food as we can and slightly lengthen the seasons, if we can. However, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, that the Government do not propose to pull the plug on their support for organic farming.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000011"></a>I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 and Clauses 15 and 16. These amendments are designed to give us the opportunity to explore the intentions behind the whole raft of provisions in Clauses 13 to 16. These clauses move considerable powers away from the Secretary of State, where they currently reside, to either the Learning and Skills Council in England or the Welsh Assembly. These powers for the setting up and dissolution of FE colleges may be merely procedural, but I still question why it is necessary for the LSC, in particular, to wield them.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000012"></a>The contrast between England and Wales makes this step even more doubtful. Whereas FE colleges in Wales will at least still be governed by an elected body and will be accountable to the electorate that the colleges are serving, in England FE colleges are not given the same opportunity; instead, we see yet more expansion of the Learning and Skills Council.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000013"></a>I am glad that the Minister listened to the concerns of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee when he moved his Amendment No. 36 on the first day of Grand Committee. That is a move in the right direction but we do not think that it goes far enough. As I have said already and will no doubt say several more times in these debates, colleges need more power, more flexibility and more independence. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000018"></a>I welcome any Bill that addresses the need to raise the standards of skills. I believe that is vital as the UK faces a challenge with its ever-increasing skills gap. The Further Education and Training Bill does not have enough content, and I consider that a missed opportunity.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000019"></a>Amendments Nos. 38 to 39 would prevent a transfer of the Secretary of State&#146;s power of intervention to the Learning and Skills Council for England in Clauses 13 and 14. The Learning and Skills Council is an unelected body not accountable for its actions and, through this Bill, it will have the power to direct a college to remove principals and senior post holders. It will also have the power to create and abolish colleges in England without the permission of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000020"></a>The Learning and Skills Council, which spends &#163;11 billion a year on further education and training for young people in England who are not at university, managed to carry out three internal reorganisations in just five years. It is a depressing achievement for a fairly new body such as the Learning and Skills Council to have already accumulated redundancy costs of &#163;54.4 million. A further &#163;61.9 million of taxpayers&#146; money was spent in the year before its launch, in winding up its predecessor, the national network of Training and Enterprise Councils, bringing the total bill to more than &#163;116 million since 2000. That has threatened to undermine attempts to ensure that young people have the skills they needed to survive in an increasingly competitive job market.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000021"></a>The recent report by the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, on skills and training, which was commissioned by the Treasury, warned that the UK needed to find an extra 500,000 apprenticeship places by 2020. The &#163;116.3 million spent on reorganising the LSC and its

Surely this would suggest that the Secretary of State should remain the appropriate authority, as he is an elected official and accountable.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000023"></a>In respect of the powers that we are discussing in Clauses 13 and 14, I reassure the Committee that under those clauses the LSC will be required to publish proposals for dissolving or incorporating institutions, as now, and to carry out structured consultations taking account of local needs, as now. The Bill makes no changes in those respects; what it does is to give the LSC final responsibility for decisions in that area subject to the power of the Secretary of State to intervene when he considers that the council has acted unreasonably in relation to any of its statutory duties. So there is a reserve power for the Secretary of State in cases in which he believes that the council has not acted reasonably.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000024"></a>We believe that this is the right way forward. The Learning and Skills Council for England is the body responsible for planning and funding high-quality education and training for young people and adults. It is best placed, we believe, to ensure the most appropriate arrangements for delivery of such provision. By transferring these powers to the Learning and Skills Council, we expect that the process of establishing institutions will be simpler, quicker and less bureaucratic.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000025"></a>I stress that most incorporations and dissolutions take place as a result of college mergers, where one corporation is dissolved and subsumed by another or where two corporations are dissolved and a new one is formed. In practice, very few merger proposals have raised concerns and all of those proposed in recent years have been brought into effect. We need to get this power in perspective.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000026"></a>Let me give some concrete figures. Since 1997, 13 new further education corporations have been established; 11 of them have been set up as a result of merger proposals. Similarly, since 1997, 68 further education corporations have been closed but 67 of them were closed as a result of merger proposals. In the overwhelming majority of cases, these have not been contentious proposals.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000027"></a>The powers in Clause 14 will require the Learning and Skills Council to publish all proposals before a decision is made to establish a new further education corporation or to dissolve an existing corporation. The process for publishing proposals is set out in existing regulations, which we intend to keep in their present form. Through maintaining these regulations, we can be sure that there is an appropriate level of communication and engagement at local level. We will need to make minor changes to reflect the transfer of

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000028"></a>Simplifying the decision-making process in the way that we intend will, we believe, encourage the FE system to ensure that it is fit for purpose and properly meets the needs of learners and employers. However, in doing all this, we want to ensure that in exceptional circumstances, the Secretary of State, as the elected Minister ultimately responsible for the education system, retains a reserve power to direct the Learning and Skills Council in relation to its functions regarding the establishment or dissolution of further education corporations.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000029"></a>In taking account of all the points I have made, I hope that the noble Baroness will be reassured.</p>

First, I apologise to the Minister: at Tuesday&#146;s proceedings, <I>Hansard</I> and I got in a muddle and attributed some words in a letter to the Minister when they were mine. I have so informed <I>Hansard</I>, which is correcting the record. It is in column GC 323.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000031"></a>Secondly, on Tuesday my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth referred to what I might characterise as poacher/gamekeeper situations. He suggested that some of the provisions in the Bill might put the Learning and Skills Council on both sides of the fence. He might have wanted to cite this as a situation in which that could happen. The point is neither complicated nor difficult to understand in the light of my noble friend&#146;s amendment. Should the proposal and advice given by the Learning and Skills Council be subject to the decision of the Secretary of State or should the council, having listened to whatever anybody else says, be responsible for the decision as well? The amendment simply says that the decision should rest with the Secretary of State and not be transferred to the Learning and Skills Council.</p>

I also thank the Minister for his, as ever, courteous and thoughtful reply. I listened carefully, but I am afraid I was not persuaded by the argument. We simply do not understand why this has to happen, especially as the Secretary of State retains reserve powers. Although the Minister says that that simplifies the process, we think that it complicates it and moves decisions further away from direct accountability to the electorate.

</ul>
<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000046"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 42 to 44. Clause 17 raises the same sort of issues as those we have been discussing. However, rather than being about transferring powers to the LSC to establish and dissolve further education corporations, the clause is about the power of intervention in the management of such institutions.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000047"></a>Amendment No. 40 would remove the power in the Bill for the Learning and Skills Council to intervene where an institution was performing less well than it might be expected to do in all the circumstances. Amendment No. 42 would insert a right for the Learning and Skills Council to advise governors of further education institutions rather than to direct them. Amendment No. 43 would remove from the Bill the power of the LSC to order the dismissal of college principals. Where the council has any serious concerns about the performance of the principal of a college of further education, Amendment No. 44 requires that it must make a written report of its concerns to the chair of the governing body, with a copy to the principal, and the chair of the governing body must respond appropriately outlining what action he or she intends to take in the light of the report.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000048"></a>The proposed power of intervention in the Bill is an infringement on the rights and responsibilities of governing bodies, which are made up of dedicated individuals who carry out their responsibilities with great skill and passion for their colleges. Indeed, my noble friend Lady Sharp is such a person as a member of the Corporation of Guildford College.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000049"></a>The further education White Paper states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012588000327"></a>&#147;A college, led by its governing body, is responsible for determining its own mission, managing its own affairs, meeting its statutory responsibilities and improving its own performance&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012588000307"></a>We are very much in favour of quality assurance mechanisms but we do not believe that it is appropriate for these powers to be taken away from the Secretary of State in the first instance and given to the unelected Learning Skills Council, although we accept that the Secretary of State has a reserved power. There is something to be said for the fact that the Learning and Skills Council is closer to the colleges than the Secretary of State and probably understands such organisations better, but were the Secretary of State to operate these powers of intervention, he or she would inevitably seek the advice of the Learning and Skills Council. We  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC428"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC428</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>believe that the power should remain solely in the hands of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000050"></a>This power is an unprecedented interference in the affairs of an independent institution. There is no parallel power in other parts of the public sector, including schools or higher education institutions. Even in a politically charged policy area such as crime, the Home Secretary does not have equivalent powers. If he were dissatisfied with the performance of a chief constable and wished to direct a police authority to remove him or her, he would still have to draw up procedures to do so with the representatives of police authorities and senior police officers. He would have to state his intention of doing so in writing to the chief constable, set up an inquiry and allow both the authority and the chief constable to make representations. Clause 17 gives the LSC more powers to end the careers of college principals of notionally private sector organisations than the Home Office has over chief constables. I have looked at the guidance and I cannot see any argument contrary to that statement.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000051"></a>The intervention of a third party&#151;the LSC&#151;into the relationship between a governing body and the principal&#151;an employee&#151;could make it more difficult for governors to take action, particularly as it might create grounds for an individual to argue that they had been unfairly dismissed. The Explanatory Notes to the Bill admit that if the LSC uses its intervention powers, the dismissed principal would be free to take a legal case under employment law in a petition for judicial review or under the Human Rights Act 1998. Who will pay the compensation if an individual wins his or her case, the college or the LSC?</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000052"></a>The Bill specifies the circumstances in which it would be legitimate to require the dismissal of a senior post holder when a governing body is guilty of mismanagement or the college is underperforming, but there is nothing in the Bill to say that the principal or other senior post holder, whoever we happen to be talking about, has to be the person responsible for the college's underperformance. There are many reasons for a college's underperformance and it is not always the fault of the leadership of the organisation&#151;very often it is, but not always. Besides, there is actually no definition of,</p>
<ul><a name="07012588000352"></a>&#147;significantly less well than it might in all the circumstances&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07012588000308"></a>in the Bill, hence our Amendment No. 40 to remove that phrase.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000053"></a>I have some serious questions for the Minister. Will the LSC be able to order the dismissal of senior post holders without giving them the notice to which they are normally entitled under their contracts of employment? Will the college or the senior post holder have the right to make representations to the LSC about the proposed direction? I wondered what would be the rights of the college or senior post holder in question to make representations about a notice to improve or a direction to sack a member of staff, so I consulted the recently published guidance and found that if a person or a college wants to do that, they must follow the published process for making a complaint about the council's administration. Committee Members may ask who will determine the fairness of the direction in question&#151;an  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC429"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC429</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>independent body? No, it is no less than the council's solicitor, its complaint administrator or one of the national regional executive directors. We moved away long ago from having police forces investigating themselves, for obvious reasons, yet apparently, as I read the guidance, the LSC will be doing just that. What is worse, when we come to looking at whether there is underperformance, the long courses will be evaluated on results and not by Ofsted inspection. The process contravenes natural justice and needs a good deal of improvement.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000054"></a>I am also concerned that a college governing body that has been directed to dismiss an employee may not be able to comply with the statutory dismissal and disciplinary procedures in any meaningful way, because any representations the individual is able to make to the college would not alter the decision since that decision rests with the LSC.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000055"></a>We need to ask where the local authority comes into this. After all, it is responsible for the 14 to 19 year-olds who attend the college. They would be impacted by any changes in the leadership of the college as a result of this sort of intervention action by the LSC. I must also ask the Minister why we need this provision. The quality of provision and leadership in the colleges has proved over the past few years to be at least as good as that in the universities or in the schools. Colleges have acted decisively in response to critical inspection reports. They have raised success rates from 59 per cent to 76 per cent and have met every target set for them by the Government. I am very pleased to note those figures because the vast majority of colleges would not fall foul of the guidance, which indicates that underperformance means anything less than a 50 per cent success rate in exams on long courses. Hopefully, we would not be talking about many colleges here, but it is important that we talk about these principles.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000056"></a>The Office for National Statistics defines colleges, like universities, as &#147;private-sector institutions&#148;. Although colleges receive 80 per cent of their funding from public sources, their current private-sector status offers advantages for both the Government and for colleges. We are concerned that these might be lost as a result of these new powers.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000057"></a>What is the alternative? Many of us believe that it is always best to work with an organisation if you want to affect change from the bottom, so it would be better to work through the governing body rather than by directions coming from the LSC. If the Government are interested in this approach, they could replicate the model already used in the school system. Regulation is passed under Section 35 of the Education Act 2002.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000058"></a>School Staffing (England) Regulations 2003 give a local authority the power to send a written report of its concerns to the chair of the school governing body. This power is made effective by the associated duty on the chair of governors to respond in writing to the local authority setting out what action the governing body proposes to take; hence our Amendment No. 44, which sets out a similar model so the local council has a stronger steer to intervene when things go wrong.

That provision would avoid all the legal problems that we foresee in Clause 17. Our proposed amendment replicates the text of that part of the School Staffing (England) Regulations 2003 and makes it applicable to the further education sector. We think that that is a more positive and constructive way forward when addressing the underperformance of colleges. I beg to move.</p>

I shall speak to Clause 17 stand part, which is grouped with these amendments. Clause 17, which gives the Learning and Skills Council greater powers to intervene in FE colleges, and Clause 18, which does the same for the Welsh Assembly, go against even the recommendation in the Government&#146;s report for the development of the further education sector of more independence for the colleges and a greater willingness to allow a real diversity.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000060"></a>Although we understand the necessity for last-resort intervention in a failing college, we think the degree of intervention that will now be possible, as well as the development of the power to intervene given to bodies, which will necessarily be in close contact with the colleges for more day-to-day matters&#151;for instance, in Clause 10, where they are allowed to have partnerships&#151;could very well be a conflict of interests; as does my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth, who, sadly, is not in his place today because he is at a degree-awarding ceremony, of which we shall hear more later. Therefore, we think that this provision is misguided.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000061"></a>Does the Minister not feel that giving the Learning and Skills Council for England the power to intervene in colleges to which it already issues guidance will only increase the likelihood of colleges playing it safe and following the standard line, rather than exploring innovation, for fear of sanctions? I understand that a college will still be able to appeal to the Secretary of State, but I am worried by the trend that the Bill seems to indicate of devolving yet more power away from the Secretary of State not to the colleges, where we would like to see it go, but yet again to the unelected LSC. Have there been any times when the current powers of intervention and guidance have not been sufficient?</p>

I find it astonishing that an outside body should have the knowledge and competence to look below the principal and identify such fault that it could direct a governing body, notwithstanding consultations that should have taken place, to take this action. I should have thought that if such a person were dismissed, good arguments could be made for wrongful dismissal. By implication, if the principal and the governing body were not prepared to dismiss him, they did not think that he should be

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000063"></a>The point about the principal I begin to understand, but it concerns me. Below the level of principal, that could not happen. I agree with Amendment No. 44 that the next stage would be to issue a letter to the governing body and require it to respond. If there were a residual power to dismiss, the principal would have a strong case to argue before an arbitration tribunal that those who were his employers and knew him best disagreed with the decision.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000064"></a>Furthermore&#151;and speaking as a former chairman of more than one funding body&#151;I am concerned that sometimes the principal may be strong-minded, a pain somewhere or another, and if he does not have the confidence to stand up, the well-being of the institution and its management will be damaged. It may be that men and women are afraid to make themselves unpopular because if their college enters a period of less-than-desired performance, they will be particularly vulnerable. I do not dissent from the view that this is a difficult situation. When I read Clause 44, I say yes, but what if the governing body is still resistant? There must be a sanction somewhere. The answer may be that since the responsibility is vested in the governing body, it is a question of the resignation of its chairman rather than dismissal of the principal because he represents the employer.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000065"></a>It is surprising that the power, which is wide-sweeping, goes down to any member of staff. It is repugnant that an outside body should have such power in relation to any member of staff. I am therefore deeply disturbed about this subsection.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000066"></a><b><a name="70125-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07012588000380"></a>Lord Sutherland of Houndwood:</b> I, too, want to speak to Amendment No. 43, relating to Clause 17(6). I shall not repeat the eloquent words of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, as he has made a strong case. However, I want to make one comment and ask two or three questions. My first question has implicitly been answered by the noble Lord&#146;s remarks. I was going to give the benefit of the doubt and ask whether the intention was that the provision could apply to any member of staff or simply to a principal. They are in different situations.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000067"></a>The one comment that I have to make that might encourage the Minister to move away from this fairly draconian clause is that I have seen heads of institutions moved on the basis of questions raised by funding councils and investigations set in place by them without this specific power having to be invoked. I refer to the university sector. It can be done and has been done&#151;and I could give examples of that. The power to do what is sometimes sadly necessary is perhaps already there in the system, if what happens in higher education could be adapted in statute for further education.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000068"></a>My questions bear on the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, about the identity of the employer. An employer-employee relationship is a contractual one; if I am an employee, I am contracted to do X, Y and Z by my employer. But it would seem that that relationship has been questioned here, so  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC432"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC432</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there is a real question of who the employer is under law. Until that is resolved, this statute will cause all sorts of difficulties.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000069"></a>Dismissing people in higher education is not easy, which is perhaps a pity in some cases&#151;but I have been through the process and done it, and it almost always ends up with an employment tribunal. If the tribunal is made up in the way that they are made up today, one of the first questions that it will ask is against whom the case has been brought. That is a legal question that requires an answer before we proceed down this line; is it being brought against the funding council or the employer&#151;apparently, the institution? That would apply equally to principals. I would much prefer an alternative route to, in the extreme situation, moving principals out; but we need an answer to the question where the case would be put when, inevitably, it comes to an employment tribunal.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000070"></a><b><a name="70125-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07012588000381"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> I have two points. My first point is that this is a second example of my noble friend Lord Norton&#146;s concerns about poachers and gamekeepers. This discussion has gone along those lines; I shall not repeat them, but I am in 105 per cent agreement with the points that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and others made. I think that my noble friend Lady Morris will also be found to be in support of that thesis.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000071"></a>On my second point, I should like to suggest to the Minister a way of testing the clause. He might do well to discuss it with the Mayor of London. If the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, on Tuesday went into the Bill, the strategic leadership would be handed over to the Mayor. I do not think that he, in setting out his strategic leadership&#151;which might of course be somewhat different from the strategic leadership provided by the LSC to other people&#151;would be at all happy or would take a decision that one of his colleges, as he would see it, should be inconvenienced as is described in these clauses. That would be conflict&#151;and on Tuesday we edged around the subject of creating conflict. So that is a test that I suggest the Minister makes.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000073"></a>Noble Lords who have had experience of the higher education sector can probably imagine the reaction if it was proposed that the Higher Education Funding Council should be given the power to direct university governors to dismiss senior staff of universities. It is possible to have a lengthy and interesting debate about the definition of public and private bodies, but as the Association of Colleges and, indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, have pointed out, universities and colleges are now defined as private sector bodies by, among others, the Office for National Statistics. Many of our universities receive a large proportion of their funding from the public purse, some of them up to 70 per cent from the Government in the form of  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC433"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC433</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>support for teaching and research. They are quite properly accountable for the use of those funds, but they remain autonomous institutions, responsible for their own financial management, their admissions, their academic standards and their compliance with the law.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000074"></a>Centrally managed systems of higher education exist in Europe. The Government could look to France as a model where appointments and dismissals are a matter for civil servants. It is just that I do not think that is a very effective way of managing a very important sector of education.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000075"></a>I find it odd that Ministers are arguing that on the one hand colleges should be trusted and their status enhanced by the measures in Clause 19, which we will come on to later, and on the other proposing a measure that seems to me to argue precisely the opposite of that trust. Giving the LSC the power to act effectively as a shadow governing body is not conducive to good governance, any more than it would be proper to allow shadow directors to operate in the context of companies.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000076"></a>The governing bodies of colleges, as of universities, currently have the ultimate responsibility of the effective management of their institutions, including meeting the statutory responsibilities and appointing or dismissing senior staff. I must ask, as have several other noble Lords: what is the Government&#146;s evidence that this has not been effective in the further education sector? It would be helpful for us to understand this a bit better if the Minister could give an example of where those powers might have been exercised.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000077"></a>It is important to say clearly, before we reach what I imagine will be the rather choppy waters of Clause 19, that my opposition to Clause 17 as it is currently drafted is entirely compatible with my desire to see the many fruitful partnerships between further and higher education institutions protected and encouraged. Universities want strong partners that are properly supported, but not micromanaged, by the Government and the LSC.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000078"></a>I support the amendments tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Walmsley, opposite, which would remove the power of the LSCs to direct a governing body to dismiss members of staff. I agree with Amendment No. 42, that the LSC should be empowered to provide advice, not direction.</p>

We also agree that in the overwhelming majority of cases, these issues will be resolved by the college itself. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said that we should be working through colleges, and that will be the almost invariable practice. Where that is not possible because of the reluctance or unwillingness of the college to take action, when it is believed by the Learning and Skills Council on the basis of objective evidence that it should be taking such action, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, that the council will have

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000080"></a>I should note in passing that, although those are alternative means, particularly threats that there might be about funding, or other processes the LSC might set in train, I would not necessarily suggest that they are less onerous. My noble friend Lady Warwick said that further education colleges were self-governing institutions, which is of course true, but the overwhelming bulk of their money comes from the public purse. The LSC has an absolute right on behalf of the Government as the funder to take an interest in the effective management and value for money being provided by colleges. The power will be exercised in very rare cases. There must be some process for seeing if ultimately they believe, as custodians of those public funds on behalf of the taxpayer, that those funds are not being effectively used. There must be some redress.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000081"></a>At the moment, of course, there is redress on the part of the Secretary of State. The issue we are debating is not whether there should be some ultimate redress; Parliament has accepted that there should be. We do not accept the principle that the self-government of colleges is an absolute right that holds in all circumstances, however great the level of failure. When we strip away those rather grand statements, we are debating the much narrower point about whether that ultimate power of intervention should be exercised by the Secretary of State, or whether it is appropriate that those powers&#151;</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000086"></a>As well as the role of the Secretary of State who has ultimate powers of direction, the proposed new Section 56B also requires the Learning and Skills Council to prepare and publish a statement of its policy with respect to the exercise of its powers under new Section 56A. It will be the duty of the council to have regard to its policy and any guidance given to it by the Secretary of State&#151;which, in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, is a further role for the Secretary of State&#151;before exercising these powers and to keep the policy under review.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000087"></a>Until the Bill receives Royal Assent, the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s guidance document <I>Identifying and Managing Underperformance </I>gives an overview of the processes that will be used to identify and address underperformance and inadequate provision. A copy of this document is available in the Library.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000088"></a>The concept of underperformance, set out in proposed new Section 56A(2)(d), inserted by Clause 17, is not a vague one. The Learning and Skills Council&#146;s intervention policy spells out in clear and objective terms the circumstances in which institutions will be held to fall into this category. Paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 of the document set out those criteria. Paragraph 12 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012588000328"></a>&#147;Withdrawal of LSC funding, restructuring or intervention options will be considered in cases of outright failure, defined as those where ... Ofsted has judged a provider as inadequate ... 25 per cent of more of the provision on offer has failed to reach the minimum performance levels defined in this document ... financial viability is seriously at risk ... underperformance is identified and improvement does not occur within the specified period ... Apprenticeship provision does not meet minimum performance levels&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012588000309"></a>This is not in any way an arbitrary power. The document sets out the circumstances in which it could be exercised. Even then, in the overwhelming majority of cases, we would expect to see these issues resolved by the college operating through its normal processes.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000089"></a>Clause 17 empowers the Learning and Skills Council to direct the dismissal of a college principal or senior staff. This is not a wide-ranging power by which the Learning and Skills Council could undertake a wholesale removal of college staff. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and the concerns that he raised, this could be so interpreted. I stress that it is strictly limited in scope, enabling the Learning and Skills Council to direct dismissal only where the governing body has the power to dismiss under its own institution&#146;s articles of governance and only in cases of serious underperformance. In colleges, it would affect only a small number of senior staff.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000090"></a>We accept that the oversight of the principal and senior staff of a further education institution is the responsibility of the institution&#146;s governing body. On the evidence of recent years, we are satisfied that the  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC436"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC436</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>vast majority of governing bodies act swiftly and decisively on their own initiative to remove senior members of staff who are ineffective, of whom there are relatively few in the further education system. However, we also consider it important that the Leaning and Skills Council should be able to tackle effectively any cases where poor college management is letting down learners and employers and where governing bodies fail to take the necessary action to rectify matters on their own initiative.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000091"></a>As to the comparison with schools, an issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, there are powers for very significant intervention in schools on the part of their own regulatory and oversight body&#151;the relevant education authority&#151;including, for example, the power to suspend the delegation of funds to a governing body. I stress that with that power goes the full staffing responsibilities, which transfer to the local authority, and the decisions which can be taken about the future of the head teacher and senior staff. Although we have to make allowance for the fact that the precise regulatory structure is different, these are not powers without precedence in other parts of the education system where the value for money of public funds is at stake.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000092"></a>Amendment No. 43 would prevent this important part of the improved powers of intervention. We want to place decision-making powers as close to the front-line delivery as possible. As the body responsible for planning and funding high-quality education and training for young people and adults, the Learning and Skills Council, we believe, is best placed to hold these powers. The present arrangements distance the power to intervene from the body best placed to exercise it.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000093"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, suggested that these provisions might undermine the position of college governing bodies in leading their organisations and might impose a third party in the employment relationship with college leaders. I stress that the Government wish to support college governors in leading their institutions effectively and have no intention of making things more difficult for them. As the LSC&#146;s recent publication, <I>Identifying and Managing Underperformance</I>, made clear, the LSC would work through an intensive dialogue with the provider concerned before even issuing a notice to improve, which would itself be only the first stage of the process. Governors would have the opportunity to take action to address underlying problems before there was any recourse to these powers on the part of the LSC, and we are confident that most governing bodies would want to do so.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000094"></a>In the extreme case where a direction was given under new Section 56A, the termination of the employment relationship and any financial consequences would remain the responsibility of the college concerned. I believe that meets one of the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000095"></a>The intervention policy required to be prepared and published by the Learning and Skills Council under new Section 56B will set out the operational procedures surrounding the exercise of these powers. This policy will be the subject of consultation with  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC437"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC437</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>providers and, amongst other things, these procedures should ensure that colleges act consistently with their legal responsibilities as employers in cases where a direction to dismiss would, in practice, be given at the end of a process based on clear evidence.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000096"></a>The procedure envisaged by Amendment No. 44 is very similar to the arrangements set out in the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s intervention strategy, to which I referred earlier. The Learning and Skills Council will, in all cases where it has concerns regarding levels of performance, issue a formal notice to improve to the chair of governors and the principal. This notice will be a letter which sets out the conditions for continued funding and the timeframe in which improvements are required, usually within a minimum period of 12 months. Of course, in the overwhelming majority of cases such improvements would be made in that period. We would expect the college to set out its actions to address the notice conditions in its development plan and to inform the LSC.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000097"></a>In most circumstances, the LSC would also ask the Quality Improvement Agency to work with the college to help make the required improvements. We believe that the underlying intent of this amendment is to ensure that the chair of governors and the principal are fully informed of the LSC&#146;s concerns and are given the opportunity to remedy them and respond appropriately. We fully support that intent. However, we believe that the administrative details for such arrangements are more properly cited in operational guidance rather than in primary legislation. The procedures envisaged by the noble Baroness are close to those that we envisage ourselves. </p>

<a name="70125-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000098"></a>In summary, I stress again that we see this as a last resort intervention. We expect the LSC to exercise these powers only in exceptional circumstances where all other options have failed and where the relevant governing body has not taken the action required. It is the role of the governing body to lead the college and secure the best interests for its learners. We believe that having the powers available to the LSC and the possibility of them being exercised would in some cases be the trigger for governing bodies to act themselves more expeditiously. The proposed amendments to Clause 17 would deny the Learning and Skills Council the tools to secure improvement in a sufficiently rapid and robust manner and in the interests of learners and employers. Therefore, we do not believe that it would be appropriate to insert them.</p>

We do not want to remove it completely, but we do propose to take some of the more draconian powers away from it. The Minister said that we were talking about outright failure, but I do not think that we are. We are also talking about performance that is,</p>
<ul><a name="07012588000353"></a>&#147;significantly less well than it might in all the circumstances reasonably be expected&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07012588000310"></a>to be. I still say that that is a woolly expression and that there is no definition.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000102"></a>We are all agreed that we would be talking about only a small number of colleges, particularly in light of the fact that colleges now are required to have a strong self-evaluation process. In most colleges, that works pretty well.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000103"></a>We all also accept that organisations that get 80 per cent of their funding from the public purse should, of course, be accountable for that money. But the difference between us is that we believe an elected representative of the citizens of this country&#151;whose money it is&#151;should make that final decision, not a quango appointed by the Government. It smacks of passing the buck from the elected Government&#151;the Secretary of State for Education and Skills&#151;to the LSC, which is absolutely wrong. The Minister made my point for me. When I said that the system seems to be much more draconian than that in place for schools or higher education, which the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, expanded on, he talked about a system for schools where the local education authority can intervene. That is an elected body.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000104"></a>The local education authority is absolutely the right organisation to intervene when dealing with schools. Because it is an elected body it has the authority of the citizens it represents and for whose children it provides education. In this case it should be the Secretary of State that takes the power and the responsibility, obviously with the advice of the LSC and any other appropriate person, but ultimately it should be that elected body which takes the responsibility to intervene.</p>

<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC439"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC439</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="07012588000362"></a>3 pm</h5>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000110"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 18 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="07012588000111"></a><b><a name="70125-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07012588000391"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> I have given notice of my intention to oppose Clause 18.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000112"></a>The Assembly for Wales has existing direction-making powers for use in relation to education and training to ensure high quality. Yet Clause 18 specifies certain powers and procedures which the Assembly must take to itself if a college is performing</p>
<ul><a name="07012588000354"></a>&#147;significantly less well that it might in all the circumstances reasonably be expected to perform&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012588000311"></a>Putting aside our objection, which I have just expressed, to this loose and undefined phrase, the basis of our objection to this clause is that it should be part of the devolutionary process to leave it to the Welsh Ministers to decide what powers they wish to have in these circumstances. If we remove Clause 18, we accept that the Welsh Ministers would then have to seek to amend these powers in accordance with the needs of Wales. I think that we should leave it to them to do that, and I am sure that they will do it swiftly. To enable them to do that we have tabled Amendment No. 56 to Clause 26, which would add a provision for intervention to the list of matters over which the Assembly may make measures.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000113"></a>Clause 18 throws up issues about accountability in Wales too, specifically, a lack of an independent appeal process. In England, in the end, a principal could appeal to the Minister. The same thing is not available in Wales. So we believe that these matters are best left to detailed scrutiny within the Assembly by Assembly Members who know and work with the education system, as set up in Wales.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000114"></a><b><a name="70125-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07012588000392"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> I believe that in this case I can fully meet the concerns of the noble Baroness. Amendment No. 56 would add another matter to the list set out on pages 19 and 20 of the Bill giving powers to the National Assembly for Wales on education and training. The proposed matter would insert:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012588000329"></a>&#147;Provision for intervention in the event of mismanagement or breach of duty&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012588000312"></a>into Clause 26 on page 20.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000115"></a>However, I am advised that that does not add to the legislative competence already proposed in the clause and that Matter 5.2 confers legislative competency on the National Assembly for Wales to make provision about the property rights and liabilities of institutions,</p>
<ul><a name="07012588000355"></a>&#147;concerned with the provision of further education, and ... [the] bodies that conduct such institutions&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="07012588000313"></a>and to make:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012588000330"></a>&#147;Provision about ... the governance and staff of such institutions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012588000314"></a>We therefore consider that the subject of the proposed amendment is incorporated within Matter 5.2 of Clause 26. So I believe that the noble Baroness&#146;s concern is met.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000116"></a><b><a name="70125-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07012588000393"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> I wonder whether it would be appropriate for me to speak to Clause 26, which is also on Welsh issues. Clause 26 was originally grouped with Amendment No. 56.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC440"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC440</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000117"></a>My noble friend Lord Roberts, who is the authority on Wales in my party, was going to speak on this, but I have also put my name down as opposing the clause. We gave notice of our intention to do so for probing purposes. We want to tease out the implications of the clause, which amends Schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act and, in effect, transfers legislative power over further education in Wales to the National Assembly.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000118"></a>When the Government of Wales Act passed through this House last Session, one of the most contentious parts, as I am sure everyone involved remembers, was the order-making power in what became Section 95, which defined the scope of the Assembly's legislative competence. This allowed the Secretary of State to amend Schedule 5 and increase the scope for Assembly measures by means of an Order in Council. It involved a complex procedure, leading eventually to the approval of both Houses.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000119"></a>As the Government have the option of using this order-making power, can the Minister explain why they are not using it? A cynic might speculate that the necessary preparation involved in the Order in Council process is considered too onerous and that this Bill was selected to be the primary legislative vehicle for the quick devolution of legislative powers over further education simply because it offered the easiest way to achieve that end.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000120"></a>I am not altogether convinced that Clause 26 is legitimate in its use of statutory powers to change Schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act. Section 95 of that Act specifies that Part 1 of Schedule 5 may be changed by Order in Council. There is no reference to any other means or source of power to change it.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000121"></a>I am sure that the Minister will be very quick to reassure me that Clause 26 is a perfectly proper means of adding to the legislative competence of the Assembly, as he has just said. I should very much like to know what consultation there has been in Wales about this devolution measure and what the results of that consultation were. It would be an extraordinary act of devolution if these steps were taken without any measure of approval from the colleges and institutions that will be affected by it.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000122"></a>I should also be interested to know what debates have been held in the National Assembly on this matter. The Order in Council procedure anticipated that the National Assembly would be the instigator of the process, asking Westminster for the legislative powers. Given the apparent absence of that innovative process, I hope that the National Assembly is sufficiently prepared for the extra responsibilities that are about to be foisted on it. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000123"></a><b><a name="70125-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07012588000394"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> The noble Baroness is so fair-minded that she often gives the replies to her own queries when she raises them. She rightly said that the UK Government&#146;s policy to transfer legislative competence to the Assembly, as set out in the <I>Better Governance for Wales</I> White Paper published in June 2005, indicates that the Order in Council is intended to deal with the issue of there being no suitable Bill in the Government&#146;s programme to address the Assembly&#146;s needs. Of course, this constitutes a suitable Bill to address those needs.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC441"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC441</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000124"></a>With regard to the transfer of the legislative competency, the answer that the noble Baroness suggested is in fact correct. This is an England and Wales Bill and, therefore, discussing these provisions in this context is entirely appropriate. If these provisions were left to the Order in Council route and removed from the Bill, not only would that be contrary to the Government&#146;s policy but we would have to return at a later stage to a discussion on the same issues covered by the scope of this Bill. We therefore regard it as good parliamentary management that it is done at this stage in the context of an England and Wales Bill.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000125"></a>The noble Baroness also raised the issue of consultation in Wales on the further education policy. If I may say so, I took her remarks to be directed to the National Assembly as much as to myself. I am sure that, when the Members of the National Assembly come to discuss this matter, they will pay careful attention to her remarks and, implicitly, the views and concerns of her noble friend.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000126"></a>Perhaps I may set out what processes are in train at the moment. Consultation on the future of further education in Wales will be carried out as a consequence of the independent review of the mission and purpose of further education launched on 22 November last year by the Assembly Minister for Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills. The report of the independent review will be published in autumn this year, and policy direction for further education in Wales will be informed by the outcomes of the independent review. Taking the opportunity to gain broad framework powers for the Assembly within the clauses of this Bill will ensure that, once the review is completed, the necessary authority and mechanisms will be in place to implement any changes that the Assembly may wish for Wales. But I stress that the Assembly Government have an independent review taking place and will ensure that proper processes are observed in taking forward reforms in this area.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000127"></a><b><a name="70125-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07012588000395"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> I thank the Minister for that reply and for responding at this stage. I thought that it would be better to deal with these issues together.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000128"></a><b><a name="70125-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07012588000396"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> I, too, thank the Minister. As he knows, we on these Benches are great fans of devolution. We will query anything that smacks of keeping the powers in the centre and not allowing the Welsh Assembly to decide for itself.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000129"></a>I shall go away, look carefully at the Minister&#146;s words and consult my Assembly Member colleagues in Wales as to whether they are satisfied with what he said. I am convinced by what he said about the Bill being an appropriate mechanism rather than waiting for an Order in Council&#151;I do not have a problem with that&#151;but I would like to consult further about whether the way in which the powers of intervention are being established in Wales is the right way ahead. </p>

<p><a name="07012588000132"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is based upon one that the Government moved in response to Lady Blatch&#146;s amendment at the Report stage of the Education Act 2002. I have spoken already of the importance of reducing the bureaucratic and regulatory  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC443"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC443</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>burden on both the public and private sector. Colleges fall into both categories and so bear a double burden. They are subject to the same liabilities as the private sector and their survival is dependent upon appealing to the public enough to maintain a student body.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000133"></a>At the same time, they are subject not only to the Learning and Skills Council but the 22 other organisations counted by Sir Andrew Foster, all with some role in planning, funding and regulating them. The amendment is designed to make the LSC consider this burden before it adds to the flurry of circulars, forms and directives heading towards colleges. The requirement to monitor what impact the veritable snow storm is having will help create an incentive for its reduction while leaving necessary bureaucracy untouched. In this way, both colleges and the LSC can move toward a more efficient and streamlined relationship by means of self-regulation, an end on which both we and the Government can agree.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000134"></a>But in case the Minister is not persuaded by my words, perhaps he can be persuaded by the words of his honourable friend David Miliband who, in moving the Government&#146;s amendment during consideration of Lords amendments in another place in 2002, was far-sighted enough to say,</p>
<ul><a name="07012588000342"></a>&#147;we want to reduce burdens on schools ... I believe, and the Government believe, that a requirement to report annually to Parliament listing the Department&#146;s direct communications with schools could reinforce our determination to do so ... an annual report to Parliament would establish the right incentives for both Ministers and civil servants, making them think not just twice or three times but perhaps four times about communications to schools ... it will provide much greater transparency&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 15/7/02; cols. 73-74.]</ul>
<p><a name="07012588000315"></a>I hope the Government will take this amendment in the same spirit as they did in 2002 when they accepted it for schools and that we will see the complexity and overregulation of the further education sector start to abate. I beg to move.</p>

If anyone wishes to access the learning and skills website, they will notice that 17 items were added to it last week, most of which advised members of further education colleges what they should take into account in what they have to do. The amount of verbiage that hits the education sector is quite unacceptable. Last night, I was wading through the draft criteria for foundation degree awarding powers. Having been trained as a civil servant back in the early 1960s, when drafting was quite a skill, I felt I could have reduced them to about three or four pages. The amount of duplication and verbiage is totally unnecessary, and yet one has to wade through it time and again. <I>Plain Words</I>, which I know is issued to every new civil servant, needs to be taken into account. It should be put in practice rather than simply aspired to. I add my voice and those of these Benches in support of the amendment.</p>

As a Minister, I am always anxious to see the most concise presentation of documents. We would welcome her services.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000137"></a>We are in favour of any action that reduces unnecessary bureaucracy in the FE system, and we are as committed as both noble Baronesses to resisting what the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, referred to as the veritable snowstorm. I hope it is not quite that bad, but we believe there is a continuing challenge to see that bureaucracy is reduced and that concision becomes the order of the day in the production of those documents that are essential.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000138"></a>In the FE White Paper, we said that the Learning and Skills Council would introduce a single gateway for all its publications and data returns. The communications gateway is modelled on the gateway for publication sent to schools, which followed the action by my right honourable friend David Miliband, which the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, referred to. We are establishing a panel with members drawn from colleges and providers who can describe real examples of information overload. I will draw to the attention of the panel the particular instance the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has just given. It will challenge the department and other agencies to reduce the amount of prescriptive guidance they send out. We will shortly be inviting nominations for the new panel, from the Opposition parties as well as from the sector itself.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000139"></a>As for reducing the bureaucratic burden across the system, we have also set up the Information Authority, a body that includes representation from the DfES, providers, inspectorates, HEFCE and the QCA. It will be independently chaired, and the IA will determine the amount of data to be collected from FE colleges, and when.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000140"></a>The Bureaucracy Reduction Group has representatives from all the key bodies plus practitioners, trades unions, associations and managers from the FE sector. The group, which reports to Ministers, has a key strategic role to scrutinise and challenge any aspects of policy implementation that, it considers, result in excessive material or administrative burdens. We are on the case, but I am sure we can always do better.</p>

I thank the Minister for his reply. I am not at all surprised by it. I still think this is an area where colleges are out of step with everyone else, and we would like to see this provision in the Bill. I hear what he has to say about the Bureaucracy Reduction Group; I just hope that one day it is not completely reduced itself. I may well come back with this, but for now, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000145"></a>The noble Baroness said: We have had the trailers; now we are at the main event. In moving Amendment No. 46, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 47, 50, 54 and Clause 19 stand part.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000146"></a>Much of the disquiet over Clause 19 has come about through lack of consultation. Proper consultation would have done much to smooth the ground for this clause, and it is hardly surprising that we now find ourselves in this position. Let us put all that behind us, though. In that spirit, I hope that as the Bill moves through this House we will be able to create a consensus across the two sectors about how we should move forward. From the Opposition perspective, we are anxious to be constructive and positive in exactly how we do so.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000147"></a>We feel that many of the universities&#146; concerns, as made clear in various Second Reading speeches, as well as in their briefing notes, are easily addressed in ways that do not hinder the development of the further education sector. During our briefings, it was remarkable how often both universities and colleges spoke about how important the continuation of inter-sector relationships was to them. Neither side has lost sight of the primary purpose of foundation degrees&#151;to introduce more students to the possibility of higher education and to provide a clear pathway to that opportunity.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000148"></a>Our amendments are designed to tease out the common ground between these two opposing positions. First, I would like to address how foundation degrees could be awarded in the future. Rather than moving directly to a situation where colleges can suddenly award foundation degrees with no involvement from a university, we would prefer to see the very productive partnerships that are currently in existence maintained. Instead of encouraging colleges to go it alone, we would like to see further education institutions take a more equal role with these partnerships by allowing them to develop and diversify without losing their links with higher education. Our amendments therefore continue the necessity of working with a higher education institution, but allow funding and overall responsibility to lie with whichever institution has taken on the predominant role in providing the foundation degree.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000149"></a>Also, in order to strengthen relationships between the two sectors, we have inserted subsection (2)(b), which is designed to make it harder for a higher education institution to refuse to work with a further education college on foundation degrees without a good reason.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000150"></a>Another of our amendments provides for the publication of the guidelines on the criteria used to decide whether a college should be given permission to grant foundation degrees. This guidance would then be subject to affirmative procedure before it could be changed. We are perfectly happy to accept that there may be better ways of doing this&#151;we see Amendment No. 52, in the names of the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Sharp, as entirely complementary to our amendment.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000151"></a>We hope that our proposal will reassure many in both sectors who are concerned about the standards that the Government will apply to colleges and that,  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC446"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC446</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ultimately, it will make the whole process more transparent. It is in everyone's interests that foundation degrees maintain their credibility. The damage caused by the perception, whether accurate or not, that A-levels have become worth less, provides clear warning. Foundation degrees must continue to be awarded only by competent institutions if their appeal is to continue to grow, and this amendment would help to ensure that that happens.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000152"></a>Finally, we have also included provision that any change allowed by this proposal would be reviewed after six years. The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, has a similar amendment with a slightly different time, but it is an important point. If a university&#146;s concerns prove to be well founded, this will be an opportunity to remedy any mistakes and repair any damage. If it has proved a success&#151;I certainly wish them every success in this role&#151;the provisions will become permanent.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000153"></a>It is predicted that only a handful of colleges have the resources to take advantage of Clause 19 as it currently stands. We hope that our amendments would embrace a far greater number of colleges than is currently envisaged, working in partnership with universities rather than in competition. Our amendments would protect foundation degrees from the possibility of them losing credibility and would maintain the inter-sector relationships that so much work has gone into developing. Colleges would be given greater status within these relationships and gain more control over the funding&#151;steps that we believe would address many of the concerns about the current status quo.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000154"></a>As I have already said, we are determined that a consultative approach to reconcile the legitimate concerns of universities and colleges is not only possible but vital. I hope that the Minister will approach our amendments with an open mind. Even if the Government do not agree with them, some kind of binding agreement is necessary. Will the Minister take the opportunity of the time between now and Report to write to universities and colleges to explain how their relationship can be preserved and nurtured? Our amendments represent at the very least the first steps towards a workable compromise, and I hope that our contribution to this debate will bring that end a little closer. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000155"></a> I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 48, 49, 50A, 51, 52 and Clause 19 stand part, which are part of the group. We have put our names alongside others for the clause stand part debate because our preferred solution is that the Government withdraw the clause and consult over it properly before bringing it back for subsequent legislation. Given the Leitch report, which was published after the Bill was published, and the subsequent commitment by the Secretary of State to raising the school-leaving age to 18, it is clear that further legislation on the issues covered by the Bill will be in the pipeline fairly soon. It is also clear that the procedures suggested in Clause 19 will take two to three years to take effect. We cannot, therefore, see any necessity for pushing Clause 19 through so quickly without proper consultation.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC447"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC447</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000156"></a>Not only were we surprised when Clause 19 was incorporated in the Bill, but it also became evident that, outside a small number of further education college principals who had been working with the Secretary of State and urging this action upon him during the past year, there was no consultation&#151;no consultation with the universities or with employers&#151;specifically about this; although I admit that both the Foster report and the Leitch report talk about the need for foundation degrees within this area and the need for more flexible mechanisms for foundation degrees. Many further education colleges&#151;those outside the small group who were close to the Minister&#151;did not know that this was going to be raised.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000157"></a>As became very clear at Second Reading, many noble Lords feel that this is not the way to make legislation and that it is much better to go through the proper procedures of consultation, to iron out unintended consequences of something that is bounced into the legislative framework and to produce a measure that will not need amending three years down the line. Legislate first, think afterwards is not a good way to do this, and we get it too frequently from this Government. Therefore we, on these Benches, put our names to the clause stand part debate.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000158"></a>As I said, in many senses our preferred solution is still that the Government should withdraw this clause, think about it again and come back with legislation later. However, while that is our preferred solution, we have tried to be constructive and to look for ways in which this clause could become more acceptable to us. We have a number of reservations about awarding further education colleges blanket powers to accredit and award degrees. Unlike universities, where all courses are regarded as higher education courses&#151;NVQ level 4 and above&#151;further education colleges provide a range of courses from basic literacy and numeracy up to teaching and training at levels 4,5 and 6, which are graduate, and even post-graduate levels on occasion. We accept that there is this very broad range within the further education colleges.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000159"></a>Like schools, where the students sit external examinations and gain qualifications set by boards outside the schools, further education college students sit a whole range of qualifications set by outside bodies, such as the City and Guilds, Edexcel and RSA. We do not deny that some further education colleges have capabilities in some departments to teach and examine at degree level, but the granting of degree-awarding status by the Privy Council is given to whole institutions. Unlike universities, most of the work of further education colleges is below degree level. Amendments Nos. 48 and 49 propose that for further education colleges, the power to award degrees should be by subject area, and that only those subject areas designated by the QAA as being capable of teaching to degree-level standards for foundation degrees at level 4 and 5 should have that power.</p>
<h5><a name="07012588000363"></a>3.30 pm</h5>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000160"></a>Reading through the draft criteria for foundation degree-awarding powers made available to us yesterday and based on the QAA&#146;s current criteria for taught degrees, it is clear that much emphasis is put on the  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC448"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC448</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>general competence of the organisation in terms of financial management and governance. Two criteria in that draft, including B1, requiring an appropriate regulatory framework to govern the award of its HE qualifications, and B2, requiring clear and consistently applied mechanisms for defining and securing the academic standards of HE provision, would need to be judged department by department.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000161"></a>I note that in the briefings that we have been sent that the 157 Group think our proposals would make the whole process unduly bureaucratic. I would argue that, on the contrary, a college aspiring to grant its own degrees would need general institutional clearance from the QAA, but could then relatively easily, quickly and flexibly gain clearance for specific departments.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000162"></a>With Amendment No. 50A we are flagging up how anxious we are that foundation degrees, while a qualification in their own right, should also be seen as a stepping stone towards further qualifications. In particular, we are very anxious to see them placed with the QAA&#146;s framework of higher education qualifications and set within a national credit framework with accepted processes for credit transfer and accumulation. We are well aware that that framework does not exist at the moment, but this is a good opportunity to establish it&#151;which has now been talked about for years, with some players, mainly the Russell Group of universities dragging their feet over the whole process.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000163"></a>If the Government really want to create an environment that encourages and incentivises the learner to upgrade skills and qualifications and devote their own time and money to doing this, which is what Leitch and the adult skills agenda is all about, there must be some sort of framework that enables on-the-job and off-the-job training to be aggregated together, allowing the individual to be flexible in their approach, to study part time, earning and learning, or full time, as suits them and their requirements at particular moments of time. Requiring foundation degrees to be part of such a credit accumulation framework could catalyse action and, finally, get such a system in place.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000164"></a>Thirdly, with Amendment No. 51, we are unhappy that under the current Privy Council an institution once accredited to award degrees may then act to accredit others, just as universities do with FE colleges. Amendment No. 51 aims to limit the privilege to the higher education institutions and not to extend it to the further education institutions.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000165"></a>Finally, with Amendment No. 52, we are anxious that, if passed, such a measure accrediting further education colleges should be subject to monitoring and review. Amendment No. 52 would ensure that the QAA keeps a weather eye on standards of foundation degrees in the further education colleges and on the degree to which those taking them progress on to subsequent studies. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, we on these Benches are anxious to see the current collaborative arrangements continue, many of which have taken a considerable amount of time and  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC449"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC449</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>effort to get on to the table. The links between further education colleges and universities are extremely important.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000166"></a>The UUK briefing suggests that that might impose unreasonable bureaucratic burdens on the colleges, but we think that it is wrong in that. The amendment makes it clear that the burden is on the QAA, which is required, like Ofsted, to monitor overall performance and report on it to the Secretary of State. Looking at this document, which I note was based on one produced by the QAA, I think the QAA clearly spends far too much time drafting documents and merely producing words.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000167"></a>The four amendments together create a coherent system with overall quality assurance procedures and accreditation of institutions by specific departments, further education colleges having no powers to accredit degrees in other institutions and foundation degrees being firmly placed in a framework of qualifications, offering a flexible and user-friendly way in which to get a foot on the ladder of higher qualifications. As I made clear, our first preference would be to throw all these ideas into a proper consultation and have the Minister withdraw the proposals for the present. But if we cannot persuade him to do that, we believe that we have presented a coherent set of amendments which, if accepted, could make the Bill acceptable to these Benches.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000168"></a><b><a name="70125-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07012588000402"></a>Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe:</b> Clause 19 is the thorny heart of the Bill. Ministers have argued that the creation of a new category of degree-awarding powers for the FE sector does not represent a major change. I disagree. This is a fundamentally significant development that could have major implications for the way in which our higher education sector is perceived internationally and the general understanding of what is meant by the term &#147;degree&#148;.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000169"></a>I understand that Ministers do not intend a large number of FE colleges to gain the new degree-awarding powers, but I question that assumption. If foundation degree-awarding powers are intended to enhance the status of further education colleges, which governing body will not want them&#151;if not immediately, then in future?</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000170"></a>Before I turn to the detail of the amendments, I would like to debunk a myth that seems to have been thrown into the debate. Ministers have said that universities are opposed to this measure because they are afraid of competition. That is not so; universities are well used to intense competition&#151;it is a pervasive part of the landscape, in which they are extremely adept. They operate in it both at home and internationally. As one vice-chancellor wryly put it:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012588000344"></a>&#147;If I were afraid of competition from my local FE college, I would have a grave problem&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012588000316"></a>He collaborates very successfully with his local FE college.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000171"></a>The real point about unleashing competition in areas where collaboration has recently been the norm is that it is very likely to prove a barrier to further collaboration between FE and HE institutions. As several institutions have told me, if the foundation  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC450"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC450</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>degree becomes the signature qualification in the FE sector, why should my institution offer it?</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000172"></a>I understand that the Minister may think that the arguments of the universities are purely self-interested and that they are concerned only with protecting their own markets, but that is really not the case. There is a widespread and genuine concern that the measures introduced by Clause 19 will prove actively counter-productive if, as I believe, the Government&#146;s aim is to increase the take-up of foundation degrees and the number of providers offering that qualification.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000173"></a>The foundation degree was first offered in 2001. Then there were just 4,200 students; since then, student numbers have grown to about 60,000. Eighty institutions with degree-awarding powers offer foundation degrees and a further two are in the process of developing that provision. There are about 2,000 courses currently running and a further 750 in development, so the current arrangements are hardly unsuccessful in terms of growth. Perhaps more important than the growth, with this qualification, is the fact that it has proved an invaluable catalyst for collaboration between the further and higher education sectors&#151;and virtually every noble Lord who has spoken in this debate has made that point. It has formed the basis of partnerships, such as the lifelong learning networks, and proved an invaluable tool in efforts to widen participation. So this is a success story. Along with other noble Lords, I have asked Ministers in the past, &#147;If it ain&#146;t broke, why fix it?&#148;</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000174"></a>The arguments that current arrangements are &#147;broke&#148; appear to rest on the following assertions: that universities are slow to validate new courses, that they charge too much for their services and that they sometimes lack the expertise to develop the courses that FE colleges want to deliver. In one sense, my answer to these charges is simple. Eighty institutions are validating foundation degrees. Any college that is dissatisfied with the service that it receives from its validating institution is free to look elsewhere. Effective partnerships are clearly in operation.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000175"></a>Evidence gathered by Universities UK over the past few weeks demonstrates that the speed of validation can vary. We recognise that it varies, but it can do so by as little as six weeks or as much as several months, with a typical timescale being about five to six months from the initial idea to the first students starting a course. At a recent meeting organised by the Association of Colleges, one businessman said in response to this point, &#147;Yes, but if I want a shirt, I don&#146;t want to have to wait several months for it. I want it today&#148;. However, as the Pro Vice-Chancellor of the University of Derby put it, we are not really in the business of selling shirts.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000176"></a>Speed has to be balanced with quality. Where we know of examples of foundation degrees that have taken several months to develop, there are often good reasons for it. Indeed, we have been told that delays are sometimes occasioned by the fact that staff in FE colleges do not have enough time to devote to programme development alongside their often very heavy teaching duties. So I am not convinced that when colleges are responsible for all aspects of  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC451"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC451</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>programme development, including quality assurance and enhancement, they will find that they are able to set up new courses any quicker than they do under the current arrangements.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000177"></a>As for the costs, again, our evidence suggests that they vary from zero to about 25 per cent of the fees and funding per student, depending on what each partner is contributing. For example, one institution told us that where a college gradually took on more responsibility for programme design, it reduced the share of the fees accordingly. We also have examples of a number of institutions that provide a validation service at a loss precisely because they value the relationship with the college, for the reasons that I mentioned earlier.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000178"></a>If there are problems with the current system, they may well have been exaggerated. I am certainly not aware that there is any evidence&#151;other than the anecdotal evidence offered by the Mixed Economy Group and the Association of Colleges, which after all, like me, I guess have a vested interest&#151;of a widespread problem. As other noble Lords have noted, it is a shame that we were not able to debate these issues before legislation was announced and that there was no prior consultation.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000179"></a>My view is that the legislation now before us offers a potentially problematic sledgehammer to crack a nut. As I noted in my contribution to the debate on Clause 17, if the Government&#146;s real motive for introducing these powers is to raise the status of FE colleges&#151;I know that the Minister has said that elsewhere&#151;I find it odd that we should find this measure alongside the previous measure, which, in my view, undermines that status.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000180"></a>It is rather reckless to use degree-awarding powers as a status-raising tool when there are genuine concerns. There are concerns about the potential impact on the qualification in question, on the degree brand, on the UK&#146;s reputation for quality higher education and, finally, on the partnerships between further and higher education.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000181"></a>I shall comment briefly on the detail of the amendments. Amendment No. 52A, which stands in my name, is intended to achieve a similar effect to Amendments Nos. 51 and 53, removing the power of further education colleges to authorise other institutions to award degrees on their behalf. In view of the fact that managing quality and standards in collaborative arrangements presents particular challenges, I think that this aspect of the clause substantially increases the risk of maintaining quality. It seems to me that it would also undermine the Government&#146;s intention that only a small number of further education colleges with substantial experience of delivering foundation degrees should benefit from these new arrangements.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000182"></a>My amendment goes slightly further than Amendments Nos. 51 and 53 by also preventing institutions with foundation degree awarding powers offering joint awards with other institutions. As currently drafted, it would also prevent the awarding institution depriving a person of an award granted by that institution. I am willing to be persuaded that the drafting of Amendments Nos. 51 and 53 is preferable; none the less, I think that the principle is important.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0004.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000183"></a>I support the thrust of the rest of the amendments standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. They would seek to protect the interests of students by ensuring that progression arrangements remained a requirement of foundation degree qualifications. Not all students want to progress to further study, but 59 per cent of foundation degree graduates currently do so, and those opportunities must be maintained. So it should be incumbent on the awarding FE college to secure the necessary progression arrangements as a condition of offering the award.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000184"></a>I also thank the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Walmsley, for tabling Amendments Nos. 48 and 49, which provide an opportunity for me to draw attention to the fact that in some cases the subject spread of major FE providers delivering foundation degrees can be quite narrow. Although Universities UK does not support the suggestion that degree-awarding powers should be subject-specific, it is important that colleges applying for foundation degree-awarding powers should be able to demonstrate a sufficiently strong track record in the design, development and delivery of foundation degrees, which should be supported by a reasonable depth and breadth of higher education expertise within the institutions.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000185"></a>Finally, on Amendments Nos. 46 and 47, I admire the efforts of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, together with John Hayes in another place. They have made seeking a middle way an important part of their approach. I welcome the intention of these amendments, which is to preserve the partnership arrangements between further and higher education institutions. I hope it does not diminish my appreciation if I say that I have concerns about the practicality of the amendments as currently drafted. In particular, I worry about the likelihood that any higher education institution would voluntarily enter into an arrangement with a further education college. As far as I can see&#151;I take the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp&#151;it still looks rather more bureaucratic than the current arrangements for the provision of foundation degrees.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000186"></a>There are genuine practical difficulties with the awarding of joint degrees, which relate to clarity over who has final responsibility for standards and issues relating to student welfare and complaints. The Conservative Front Bench seems to have recognised that it is unlikely that the scheme proposed in Amendments Nos. 46 and 47 will appeal to higher education institutions, because Amendment No. 50 provides for the Secretary of State to compel an unwilling HEI to collaborate in the delivery of joint degrees. Of course, I oppose that wholeheartedly. I doubt whether the Committee would indulge me for long enough to go into the reasons for that but, in the first instance, it would be a gross infringement of institutional autonomy. Enforced collaboration would be the least effective means of promoting partnership between the further and higher education sectors.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000187"></a>I should prefer this clause to be removed entirely, and I hope we shall have the opportunity to debate  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC453"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC453</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that option on Report. I know that my noble friend Lady Blackstone regrets very much not being able to be here today, as I know that she, too, remains opposed to Clause 19. At the least, I hope that the Committee will see the sense of the measures proposed by Amendment No. 52A or Amendments Nos. 51 and 53 and remove the provision that would allow for the franchising of foundation degree courses by the colleges that achieve the new powers.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000188"></a>Beyond that, all I can say is that the only other way to guard against the fears I have outlined lies in robust quality criteria. I thank the Minister for making draft criteria available. I have studied them with care. The key issue, as indicated in the draft document, is the requirement for a scholarly environment, and I suspect that we will return to that debate on a number of occasions before the Bill leaves this House.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000189"></a><b><a name="70125-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07012588000403"></a>Lord Dearing:</b> I have an amendment in this group. I do not propose to go over the general points that I made at Second Reading but, as I said then, I regard the standing of the brand of the British degree as being of immense value. It has been said to me that some other countries let the market play and that there is an informal ranking of universities, as in the United States and Japan. We did not think that was in the United Kingdom&#146;s interests in higher education and beyond. If we may make a comparison with the United States, half the world would like to be domiciled there, and getting into an American university is a way in. We do not quite have the same pull.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000190"></a>We have been immensely successful, through the standard of the British degree, in attracting a very large number of students from throughout the world. I am thinking in terms not only of income-generating benefit to the balance of payments but of the quality of mind in research, in particular, in our universities.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000191"></a>I do not intend to go over the general arguments; I shall concentrate on the four parts of my amendment, which are based on a premise that the Government&#146;s intentions will be implemented, although I hope that they will be modified. The first part of the amendment is based on a view that the interest that is most at stake here is that of the student, in terms not only of the quality of the education but of the standing of the award. Since what is proposed is a change in the award and, to some extent, its standing, the student has a right to be consulted. I am aware that Clause 21 provides that governing bodies must have regard to any guidance that is given, and I am grateful to the Minister for providing us with copies of the guidance. I have read the relevant part on further education institutions, which says that the guidance,</p>
<ul><a name="07012588000356"></a>&#147;encourages governing bodies of further education institutions to consult with learners&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012588000317"></a>It goes on to say that the guidance &#147;offers advice&#148;. That is hardly a vatic.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000192"></a>I am sure that if the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester were with us, he would be glad, as I am, to see the references about consultation on the faith and spiritual needs of learners, but there is no mention of consultation on the specific important  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC454"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC454</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>point&#151;whose degree it is. I place particular emphasis on consulting students before an application is made.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000193"></a>My second point is that it should be a condition of power being granted by the Privy Council that the institution makes arrangements with an institution or institutions of higher education for progression. Reference has been made to the high proportion of students who seek to go beyond the foundation degree. The word &#147;foundation&#148; suggests that it is the foundation for something beyond, and the interest of the student is very much that it should form the basis for progression to something else so that he or she does not, in a dislocated way, have to start again. I regard this as a particularly important requirement of any institution.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000194"></a>My third point relates to not authorising other bodies to award a foundation degree or a credit or to provide courses. I hope that there will be an opportunity to discuss the wording of that provision carefully so that there is complete clarity. When I led a committee looking into the future of higher education, we looked into that matter. Although things worked very well in the main, there were occasions when people took risks. That is particularly so&#151;and I believe that it would apply in this case&#151;when the power, if there is one, extends overseas, because the channels of communication are so long. In paragraph 10.77 of the report of the committee that I chaired, we drew attention to the problems that had arisen, including serial franchising,</p>
<ul><a name="07012588000357"></a>&#147;where one institution validates or franchises provision to another, which in turn franchises this provision elsewhere&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012588000318"></a>We said that that must cease. These things have to be controlled; it is a major step to grant a power to a limited number of institutions. That power should be exercised within their bailiwick, as it were, rather than that they should start spreading the power elsewhere.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000195"></a>My final point has already been referred to by the noble Baronesses. After a reasonable interval&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, said six years; I said four&#151;there is a check of the quality of what is going on. I went for four years because that is long enough for things to settle down and, if things are not going well, it is desirable that they are remedied quickly, but the four-year period was purely arbitrary. This is a new power, and the interest of the student and of the standing of the British degree suggest strongly that it should be used circumspectly and carefully.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000196"></a><b><a name="70125-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07012588000404"></a>Lord Sutherland of Houndwood:</b> The debate so far has made many good and important points, eloquently supported. I refer, in particular, to the proposals for amendment from my noble friend Lord Dearing, which I support wholeheartedly. They all refer to questions of the brand and standards. That is critical for any innovation that we bring in, and this is a major innovation. That said, I support the intention to increase the flexibility and variety in the provision of foundation degrees. The more flexible and innovative we can be, within a structured system, the better it will be for the community at large.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000197"></a>I hope I can say, without being offensive to anyone, that I have heard some of these arguments before. The  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC455"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC455</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>last time they came around was when degree-awarding powers were offered to what were then called polytechnics, so there is a question in my mind about how far the doom being predicted will eventually materialise. If we get the provisions right&#151;and that is the spirit of many of the amendments being put forward today&#151;that need not be the case. There can be flexibility and positive innovation, rather than doom and limiting the brand. </p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000198"></a>I want to refer to a matter that I raised at Second Reading. I did not want to table amendments at this stage, but the matter to which I spoke principally concerned standards and, by implication, the brand. The Bill gives an assurance on the kind of advice that the Privy Council would receive if it made a decision to give degree-awarding powers to a further education college. The advice, however, would be almost wholly concerned with capabilities and potential process. It would be to do with facilities and staffing levels. Inevitably, it could not be a matter of what standards would be operated in the degrees in question, because they have not yet been offered.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000199"></a>That is why it is essential that there is a provision in the Bill to ensure that some form of external assessment of the standards operated when these degrees are being offered and awarded is built into the system. I stress &#147;external assessment&#148; for all sorts of good reasons. I shall not go into them in detail, but they have to do with temptations to slip and slide and be on the edge of the famous slippery slope that it seems we are always on. One of the ways that could be done, and I simply instance this, would be by taking due account of proposed Amendment No. 52, which sensibly suggests that there should be an annual report&#151;perhaps that would be too prescriptive in due course, but initially I think annual would be right&#151;on the standards of the foundation degrees awarded. If the amendment were accepted, one way to deal with my point would be that the standards in the report should include reference to the nature and quality of the external assessment of those degrees. That is a critical element of retaining the brand, and the acceptability of the brand, of British degrees in an international circuit where we are in deep competition, particularly with other English-speaking countries.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000200"></a>I rest my point at this stage. I may well come back on Report with an amendment, unless there is some clear movement to include reference in the Bill to the external assessment of standards.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000202"></a>I agree with the arrangements proposed in Clause 19 that will allow for further education institutions to apply for powers to validate their own foundation degrees and enable the Privy Council to grant institutions the power to award foundation degrees.

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000203"></a>That being said, the potential break-up of further and higher education concerns me. There are currently 275 further education colleges offering foundation degrees. Of these, it is expected that only a small number, mostly from the Mixed Economy Group of colleges which currently provide 14 per cent of all foundation provision, will wish to apply for the foundation degree-awarding power. That will weaken the brand of UK universities internationally if further education colleges are permitted to award foundation degrees. They will be seen as further education qualifications, undermining their credibility with employers who view them as a fragile new qualification.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000204"></a>Furthermore, the proposal will potentially jeopardise the partnerships built up between further education colleges and universities. They will be competing with each other instead of working together for the further development of learners. It is not clear whether this measure is intended to boost the status of colleges or whether it is a gamble to increase numbers to meet targets.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000205"></a>I welcome the aforementioned amendments as, in this case, a market solution is not necessarily in the best interests of learners. It is important that colleges continue to work in conjunction with universities. Further education institutions will have a more equal role in foundation degree courses with their higher education partner and in some cases a greater role. Surely the Minister will welcome this compromise as the college and university partnership is vital to the betterment of our education system.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000206"></a><b><a name="70125-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07012588000406"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> Clause 19 clearly raises issues of considerable concern to the Committee.

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000207"></a>I thank all noble Lords who have engaged with my honourable friend Bill Rammell and me in the extensive discussions we have had on this issue since Second Reading. We are deeply appreciative of the contribution which all noble Lords, from all parties and none, have made. I make special mention of my noble friend Lady Warwick and the ongoing discussions we have had with Universities UK, which have been immensely valuable. I note, too, the highly constructive approach from both opposition parties in this regard, which has been fully reflected in the speeches we have heard today. I should like to mention John Hayes, the colleague of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, who has had further extensive discussions with my honourable friend Bill Rammell.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000208"></a>I know there is a general desire to find an effective way forward and, with regard to the point of the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, a recognition that there are significant issues to do with meeting skills needs and empowering all those who have the capacity for the benefit of students. There is a vital issue of national interest at stake, and we all recognise the importance of getting this right.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC457"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC457</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000209"></a>The purpose of Clause 19 is to empower the Privy Council to grant foundation degree-awarding powers only, and no other degree-awarding powers, to further education institutions in England. We believe that the clause will enable the FE sector to respond more quickly and effectively to employers&#146; needs, meeting the skills challenges set out by my noble friend Lord Leitch in his recent report.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000210"></a>At present, further education colleges have the option of applying only for the full taught and/or research award-making powers which include degree-awarding powers. In practice, it is virtually impossible for them to succeed in this because the criteria for being granted full award-making powers quite rightly make reference to the quality of an institution&#146;s academic research and its ability to provide teaching up to higher degree level.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000211"></a>Therefore, in practice, FE institutions set up new foundation degree programmes in partnership with an institution that has degree-awarding powers, which is usually a higher education institution. Most of these partnerships work well; in such cases, we anticipate that the current validation arrangements will remain in place to mutual advantage.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000212"></a>The encouragement of partnerships and collaboration, as referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, when speaking to AmendmentsNos. 46, 47 and 50 is therefore a cause which wefully support. In some cases, further education colleges with considerable experience in providing good quality employer-focused higher education qualifications such as foundation degrees have been unable to respond with the necessary speed to approaches from employers with whom they have strong links. That is part of the justification for the proposed powers in Clause 19. Some large Mixed Economy Group institutions have had difficulty in finding a validating university with relevant experience in some foundation degrees.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000213"></a>As we take forward these new powers, we will continue to place great emphasis on partnership and collaborative working. The reforms we are proposing, which remove an unnecessarily strong legal constraint, equally uphold stringent quality criteria and will help those colleges that are already well equipped to draw more learners into higher education to do so even better, without jeopardising necessary collaboration across the two sectors.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000214"></a>It will be for the Privy Council, taking into account advice from the Quality Assurance Agency, to decide whether a further education institution applying for foundation degree-awarding powers should be granted those powers. Students and employers will rightly expect the same standard of provision whether a foundation degree is awarded by a further education institution or a higher education institution. To this end, the department has published draft criteria, referred to by several noble Lords, that we propose that the QAA should use in assessing an application for foundation degree-awarding powers. The criteria can be found on the Further Education and Training  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC458"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC458</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Bill web page, accessible by the department&#146;s website. I am also arranging for copies to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000215"></a>The criteria are extremely closely based on those currently used to assess fitness to award the whole range of awards, including all taught degrees. The essential difference is that, in deciding whether a further education institution should be granted foundation degree-awarding powers, there would be no need to assess the college&#146;s ability to award other qualifications because they would not be given the power to make such awards.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000216"></a>At present, any institution that is granted award-making powers under Section 76 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 is able to authorise other institutions to make awards on its behalf. This provision has been at the heart of degree law for 15 years. In practice, it means that a university with degree-awarding powers can authorise another institution to grant degrees in its name. In addition, the powers allow an institution, usually a university, to work with overseas providers and to authorise them to grant an award that bears the name of that university.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000217"></a>Amendments Nos. 51, 52A and 53, in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, my noble friend Lady Warwick and the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, seek respectively to remove from a further education institution granted the power to award foundation degrees the power then to authorise another institution to make awards on its behalf or to accredit another body to provide courses leading to an award of the institution with foundation degree-awarding powers, a process which the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, likens to the franchising arrangements which applied in the recent past.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000218"></a>Some FE institutions already undertake substantial activity overseas, and provided that it is of high quality, I am sure that we would all want to see this flourish. We believe that in time, when some leading colleges have established a track record in awarding their own foundation degrees, they should be able to offer them through overseas institutions. However, mindful of the points made in the debate and set out at some length by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, we are aware of the issue of &#147;external authorisation&#148; being a contentious one and fully understand the concerns that a number of Committee Members have voiced over the damage that might take place to the United Kingdom&#146;s higher education brand. This &#147;brand&#148; is something of which we are all proud, and it is right that it should be carefully guarded. It is important to bear in mind, as the noble Lord said, the importance of ensuring that the perceptions of overseas customers about quality are maintained, as well as the underlying reality of how good the product actually is. I therefore undertake that my ministerial colleagues and I will reflect further on the points made in this debate. I hope that I will be able to return with the conclusion of that consideration before Report.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000219"></a>There are three further elements to Amendment No. 53, proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. These address the question of whether FE colleges  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC459"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC459</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should be under a duty to consult their students before applying for foundation degree-awarding powers; whether a condition of the new powers should be the existence of clear progression arrangements for foundation degree students to honours degrees; and whether the Privy Council's powers to grant foundation degree-awarding powers to FE Institutions should be subject to review after four years. I will take these three issues in turn.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000220"></a>It is vital that our proposals take into account the views of learners. We are therefore sympathetic to the noble Lord's suggestion that the views of the student body should be taken into account whenever an institution seeks to make significant changes that will impact on the learner experience. This requirement can, we believe, be reflected in the QAA criteria themselves. We intend to look further at how this can be done and I hope to return to the noble Lord and to the House on a way forward in this regard before Report.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000221"></a>Similarly, the criteria against which any institution applying for foundation degree-awarding powers is assessed will cover the issue of progression, which was highlighted by many noble Lords in our discussion. Progression arrangements, which were particularly raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, and John Hayes in our discussions, are a vital issue. They have helped us greatly to work through our own thinking on how this can be effectively safeguarded. I want to be clear that our proposals for reform are made within a stated intention that higher education providers in the FE sector should work in partnership with the established higher education sector and vice versa. That is best for both sectors and it is essential for learners and employers.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000222"></a>The Quality Assurance Agency's qualifications benchmark for the foundation degree incorporates the requirement for,</p>
<ul><a name="07012588000358"></a>&#147;clear routes that facilitate opportunities for progression from Foundation Degrees towards another qualification&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012588000319"></a>That qualifications benchmark will be written into the criteria for institutions seeking to award their own foundation degrees. Indeed, this particular criterion is essential to ensuring parity of the foundation degree wherever it is delivered. We are therefore confident that transparent and articulated progression routes will continue to be available to all learners and that the precise amendment at stake here is unnecessary. However, although the draft criteria that we have circulated go a long way towards assuring Committee Members of our bona fides in this regard, it may be helpful if we expand on what is meant by progression.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000320"></a>I therefore propose that before Report, we should bring forward further details on how the articulation agreements between further and higher education will work in practice. I propose also to provide further clarity on the options that are available to the QAA should a further education college that has been awarded the new foundation degree-awarding powers fail to fulfil its responsibilities in terms of articulation or of wider quality issues. I will also consider how higher education and further education institutions should promote the articulation arrangements to learners so that learners are able to see for themselves that arrangements are in place to guarantee effective progression.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000223"></a>I am conscious of concerns that have been raised on all sides regarding the risk that universities which have voiced opposition to the proposals may withhold essential co-operation with FE institutions. We are confident that this will not be the case. Universities have been very clear in the public debate on the proposals that they want to work with colleges, and I welcome the remarks of my noble friend Lady Warwick in that regard in this debate. Collaboration with the FE sector is a key element of local partnership working which is, and will remain, consistent with the mission of universities. Lifelong learning networks are already funded and work well, promoting co-operation between institutions and providing a sound economic incentive to encourage collaboration between the sectors.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000224"></a>The third item in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, concerned a probationary period. The noble Lord argues that, after a period of four years, the power of the Privy Council to grant foundation degree-awarding powers ought to be subject to review. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, proposes having a review after six years. We are sympathetic to the spirit of such a suggestion, if not the precise letter of the amendments. It must be right that Parliament and the wider public should be able to understand what has happened following the introduction of these new powers, and we undertake to reflect further on how this might best be achieved. I will again come back with further proposals in this regard before Report.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000225"></a>It is right that Parliament and the wider public should be able to understand and assess the impact of the new powers. Our view is that the most helpful approach to Parliament to understand the practical effect of the new powers might be for the Quality Assurance Agency to publish a specific report on this, looking at all the evidence after a suitable period of time. The report could usefully describe the Quality Assurance Agency criteria which the FE colleges have successfully met before being awarded the new powers.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000226"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, makes three further proposals in Amendment No. 54. The first goes to the question of funding. The noble Baroness proposes that the Secretary of State should be able by regulation to enable the Higher Education Funding Council for England to provide direct funding to all FE institutions with foundation degree provision. We completely understand the purpose behind the noble Baroness&#146;s amendments, but it is important to be clear that the Bill is not about the funding of higher education in FE colleges. Its provisions will have no impact on the way in which colleges are funded. This seems an important observation to make because there have been criticisms that we are opening up competition for student numbers between colleges and universities where none existed before. This is not the case. It is for the Higher Education Funding Council for England to decide whether colleges are  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC461"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC461</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>suitable for direct funding. It is HEFCE that has the public responsibility for allocating such funding. HEFCE already has the power to fund the provision by institutions in the further education sector or prescribed higher education courses, but direct funding is not suitable for all colleges. Indeed, a college will often prefer to conduct its business either under a franchise agreement with a university or as part of a consortium of providers which share out funding and student numbers.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000227"></a>The funding council&#146;s current consultation on higher education within the FE sector rightly contains proposals for improving the transparency of franchise arrangements and for developing consortium funding arrangements to promote collaboration. It is true that there is higher education-level provision within the further education sector that HEFCE is not able to fund directly&#151;the so-called non-prescribed courses. Funding for those courses is possible via the Learning and Skills Council, or indirectly via HEFCE. We believe that it is worth exploring whether that split in funding responsibilities should be changed. My department is looking at the issues with the funding bodies to see whether we should take them further forward.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000228"></a>The amendment then proposes that the guidance for criteria for foundation degree-awarding powers should be laid before Parliament and capable of change only through the affirmative resolution procedure. The Government should be as clear as possible about how these powers should work. That is why from the outset we have said that our objective is that foundation degrees should be of the same standard, no matter where they are awarded, and why we published the very full draft of the criteria we propose that the QAA should use.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000229"></a>However, we believe that it would be inappropriate to tie down the criteria in the way proposed in the amendment. The current system for assessing applications for degree awarding powers is rigorous, but the criteria used by the QAA in its assessments are not enshrined in regulations, and there is no need for that to happen. It must be right that the QAA and others are able to use their good judgments to advise the Government and the Privy Council on how the criteria might change incrementally over time without having to have recourse to Parliament again before doing so.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000230"></a>We also believe that there is a real risk in treating the criteria to be used for further education colleges in this way, when similar criteria to be used for other providers seeking degree-awarding powers are not subject to such procedures. Indeed, such a divergence of approach goes against our aim of creating a common approach to the assessment of all applications in this regard.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000231"></a>In Amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 50, the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, proposes that FE institutions should be allowed to apply for powers to award foundation degrees only in conjunction with a higher education institution. The published draft criteria makes clear  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC462"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC462</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that a further education institution receiving the new powers will need to provide robust evidence that its courses include opportunities for progression to honours degrees after the completion of the foundation degree. Paragraph 30 of the QAA&#146;s foundation degree benchmark statement is relevant here. So the requirement to have progression arrangements in place means that it will not be possible for a college awarding its own foundation degrees to operate independently from the higher education sector, which was a concern raised repeatedly by my noble friend Lady Warwick in her remarks. We stress again that we are not giving up the importance of progression in the new arrangements.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000232"></a>The amendments also propose introducing a system which monitors applications from FE institutions to work in conjunction with an HE institution and provides an appeal mechanism involving the Secretary of State. Again, we appreciate the motive behind the amendments but fear that it will unnecessarily involve the DfES and Ministers in a process that up to now has not been required and add significantly to the bureaucracy of the process. But again we will reflect on what has been said about progression and articulation arrangements and the promotion and monitoring of partnerships and will report progress on these issues to the Chamber before Report.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000233"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, proposes in Amendment No. 52 that the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education should be required to report annually to the Secretary of State on the standard of foundation degree programmes awarded by FE institutions and the opportunities available to the individual to request honours degrees. Under her amendment, the Secretary of State would be required to lay the reports before Parliament. The mission of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education is to promote public confidence that the quality and standards of awards in higher education are being safeguarded and enhanced.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000234"></a>The QAA currently undertakes reviews of foundation degrees on request from HEFC. These reviews cover the scope envisaged by the noble Baroness in her amendments. In carrying out the reviews, the reviewers draw on a range of external reference points to ensure consistency of the review process, irrespective of the status of the institution where the review is being carried out. Evidence from reviews undertaken by the QAA would indicate that this process works very effectively. It has given confidence to the sector and to students, that programmes that do not meet the standards will not achieve a judgment of confidence.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000235"></a>The noble Baroness also requires the QAA to report annually on the ability of individuals with foundation degrees from FE institutions to progress to honours degrees. As the Committee knows, it is a requirement of the foundation degree programme specification that progression routes to higher level study are articulated, therefore offering foundation degree graduates the opportunity, if they choose, to progress.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000236"></a>We would not wish to see a system of annual reporting introduced in this regard. It would only be

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000237"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has further proposed in Amendment No. 50A that there should be a requirement for foundation degrees to be awarded on the basis of a credit framework developed by the QAA. Perhaps I may address this amendment with a few words of explanation regarding the existing framework for higher education qualifications. I accept that what I am about to say is, again, rather technical, but we believe it is important to have it on the record to inform the debates that will take place on Report.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000238"></a>The QAA has developed a qualifications framework for higher education, but this is not, strictly speaking, a credit framework. The purpose of the QAA framework is to uphold public confidence in academic standards by ensuring a consistent use of qualification titles. Thus, the existing framework consists of five levels, three of which describe qualifications at undergraduate level and two at postgraduate level. Within this framework, the foundation degree is classified as an &#147;intermediate level&#148; qualification, sitting immediately below honours degree level. The foundation degree is a two-year higher education qualification that is recognised as having a value equivalent to two-thirds of a full honours degree.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000239"></a>We welcome the intention behind the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, to ensure that the foundation degree is firmly embedded in a framework that guarantees its currency within the wider landscape of higher education qualifications and that allows students to maximise that currency, should they so wish, by progressing to further study. However, we believe that the amendment is unnecessary, as the requisite safeguards to guarantee the status of the foundation degree and its articulation with other higher education qualifications will be put in place without the need for legislation.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000240"></a>The draft criteria that we have published incorporate the qualification benchmark statement that the QAA already uses to set out the defining characteristics of all foundation degree courses. To quote paragraph 30 of that statement:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012588000345"></a>&#147;Clear routes that facilitate opportunities for successful progression from Foundation Degrees towards another qualification are an important feature of Foundation Degrees&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012588000322"></a>Such routes would have to be established when foundation degree awarding powers were first granted. To quote the benchmark statement again:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012588000346"></a>&#147;Institutions awarding Foundation Degrees normally guarantee progression to at least one bachelor's degree with honours, with an expectation that this should not normally exceed 1.3 years for a full time equivalent student in England&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012588000323"></a>Paragraph 31 of the same document states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012588000347"></a>&#147;The identification of explicit progression arrangements should be available to learners on Foundation Degree programmes through course handbooks and prospectuses&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC464"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC464</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07012588000241"></a>These criteria will have to be satisfied if a further education institution is to succeed in its application for foundation degree awarding powers. Imposing these conditions is an essential part of ensuring parity of esteem for the foundation degree qualification wherever it is delivered and awarded. Learners can be confident that the same standards and safeguards are in place, no matter where they choose to undertake a foundation degree, and that their achievement will be recognised as a sound basis for further higher-level study, should that be appropriate for them.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000242"></a>As I explained a moment ago, the QAA does not operate a national credit framework for higher education qualifications. Indeed, strictly speaking, no such national framework exists, and arrangements for credit accumulation and transfer are dealt with by individual institutions or regional consortia. However, a report has recently been published by the Measuring and Recording Student Achievement Scoping Group, chaired by Professor Robert Burgess, Vice-Chancellor of Leicester University. This report recommends the establishment of a national framework for academic credit in higher education in England. The intention is for institutions to have credit-rated their main provision by the commencement of the academic year 2009-10. This will be done on a voluntary basis, although the Burgess group was clear that most institutions will find a national framework helpful and that the arguments in favour of establishing such a national framework are persuasive. Within such a framework, the foundation degree would have a &#147;value&#148; of 240 credits, while a full honours degree attracts 360 credits.</p>
<h5><a name="07012588000367"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000243"></a>We believe that following up the recommendations of the Burgess group, which I will be happy to send to Members of the Committee, is the proper way to address the question of establishing a framework for academic credit in higher education. I hope, therefore, that I have been able to assure the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that I concur entirely with her wish to ensure the status and currency of the foundation degree wherever it is awarded. Our assessment criteria will ensure that the potential for progression continues to be emphasised as an important factor in all foundation degree programmes.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000244"></a>In Amendments Nos. 48 and 49, the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, proposes that an FE institution&#146;s power to award foundation degrees should be restricted to subject areas designated by the Secretary of State. We have made very clear since we introduced this proposal that we will ensure that foundation degrees awarded by further education institutions are of the same standard as those awarded by universities. The extensive and very robust criteria we have presented to the Committee show how this objective will be delivered. We therefore are not persuaded that the additional safeguard proposed by the noble Baroness is necessary. We believe that the approach we take to granting foundation degree-awarding powers should follow as closely as possible the approach currently taken for what are commonly referred to as &#147;degree-awarding powers&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC465"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column GC465</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000245"></a>There is no precedent for placing a statutory restriction on degree-awarding powers that limits them to a particular subject and we do not believe that it would be appropriate to do so in this case. There will, as I have described at too great a length so far, be a set of elaborate and robust procedures to be satisfied before an FE college can secure foundation degree-awarding powers and we believe that these are sufficient for the purpose.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000246"></a>At the risk of my voice running dry entirely, let me turn now to Amendment No. 52A, tabled in the name of my noble friend Lady Warwick. The amendment addresses the fact that, at present, where an institution is granted award-making powers under Section 76 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, this includes certain other powers. These are the powers to authorise other institutions to grant awards on its behalf; the power to grant awards jointly with another institution; and the power to deprive a person of an award granted to him by or on behalf of the institution. The amendment seeks to deny these additional powers to a further education institution that is granted the power to award foundation degrees only.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000247"></a>I referred earlier to the power of an institution to authorise another institution to grant awards on its behalf and I have given assurances which I hope my noble friend will find helpful about our intention to proceed with great caution in this regard. However, we feel that the amendment goes a step too far in the other restrictions which it seeks to impose. The question of joint foundation degrees offered by two or more institutions, each of which has award-making powers or foundation degree-awarding in its own right, seems materially different to what is sometimes referred to as the &#147;franchising option&#148;. We do not believe that the risks to the higher education brands that have been flagged up in the case of franchising arise in the case of joint of awards of this kind. A restriction on joint awards may restrict the joint award of foundation degrees by two further education institutions and also the joint award of foundation degrees by further education institutions working in partnership with a university, which, of course, is precisely the kind of pattern that my noble friend and other noble Lords are seeking to promote. We believe, therefore, that we should be very cautious before imposing restrictions on the ability of suppliers to shape their programmes to meet learner and employer needs in this area.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000248"></a>We also believe that a further education institution which has granted a foundation degree should have the right to remove it from an individual in appropriate circumstances. This surely is an important safeguard in ensuring that the standards that we have all agreed need to be maintained are in fact maintained.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000249"></a>I have some further minor points but I believe that I have detained the Committee for as long as is humanly possible. When I read the full account in <I>Hansard</I>, I will be happy to take up further points in writing but I hope that I have covered all the major points. I reiterate that on many of the substantive issues where we share the concerns that have been raised in discussions, we will come back to the House and to noble Lords individually before the Report stage.</p>

We shall await the noble Lord&#146;s proposals with interest. This has been a wide-ranging debate. By and large there is a coalescence of interest around particular issues which have arisen, and these are the ones that I think the Minister has addressed.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000253"></a>On the specific proposals we put forward, I am sorry that the Minister does not see fit to limit the provision by designated area. I see real problems because the criteria for the degree-awarding powers relate, above all, to issues of governance within the institution, which can be satisfied in relation to the institution as a whole. It is quite clear that the academic standards required can be satisfied in relation to specific departments. It is also clear that a further education college is a very different institution from a university, or even from the former teacher-training colleges which are now recognised as universities. It poses some problems, and, indeed, will pose problems for the QAA in monitoring standards because it will be required to monitor specific standards within specific departments.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000254"></a>I hear what the Minister says. I have a copy of the Burgess report regarding credit transfers and credit accumulation; our amendment was tabled partly to raise that. It seems to me that Britain has taken an unconscionable time to move in this direction; and that we need to move in this direction if we are actually going to provide the flexible framework that, for example, the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, in his report is looking towards. The sooner such a framework is set up and working the better.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000255"></a>There is, as I said, a certain coalescence of agreement around a number of the issues. Clearly, we will be returning to this matter on Report, and talking at length about it. As some Members of the Committee know, I shall not be here for Report, but I shall read <I>Hansard</I> with considerable interest when I return.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000257"></a>I also thank the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, for their kind comments.

<a name="70125-gc0006.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000268"></a>Clause 22 expands upon the power that the Secretary of State has already to make regulations about what qualifications the principal of a further education college must have or be working towards. It gives a further power to set a time limit on how long a principal can continue to hold his or her post while studying for the qualification and removes an exemption for principals who were appointed before 2002. Can the Minister explain why the clause has been found necessary? Have there been cases where a principal has drawn out the process of attaining a necessary qualification beyond what is reasonable?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70125-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="70125-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000269"></a>The White Paper suggested that newly appointed principals would be given three years to achieve the qualification. Is this still the case and will it apply to all principals? Forty-seven per cent of principals are 55 years old or over and it is unlikely that they are planning to change jobs before their retirement. Are the Government expecting those near retirement, who have taught successfully for many years, to work towards the qualification too? I look forward to the Minister&#146;s answer and to being reassured that this clause will be applied sensibly.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000271"></a>The clause will enable us to bring in regulations for the mandatory qualification of existing college principals moving to a new post in England and enables Ministers to bring in future regulations for all principals in England if deemed necessary. The reason for this is our belief that strong, effective leadership is required to support the FE reforms which will improve quality in the sector, benefiting all concerned. This will help to address the weaknesses in FE leadership identified by Ofsted in its inspections and Sir Andrew Foster in his independent review of further education. Therefore, requiring the

<a name="70125-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000272"></a>Following the passage of the Bill, we intend to lay regulations covering principals who move to a new principal&#146;s post. These will apply from April 2009. However, we do not intend at this stage to make this leadership qualification mandatory for serving principals who remain in post, which is the group I believe the noble Baroness has in mind.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000273"></a>However, there is a clear expectation that serving principals should undertake the new principals&#146; qualifying programme on a voluntary basis. In cases where the serving principal is on the verge of retirement, that may not be appropriate and I am sure that commonsense will apply in this matter, as in all others under the Bill.</p>

As I mentioned at Second Reading, given that further education colleges have some of the best Ofsted reports in the whole of the public service, I think principals will have taken on board the requirement for continuous professional development and will have done their best to achieve it. I am very pleased that no one will be made to do it when they want to dedicate their last few years to doing the job that they have done so well for such a long time.</p>

I understand that the clause is designed to remove an unnecessary technicality for the industrial training boards to prove a consensus has been reached that the levy should continue.

<p><a name="07012588000279"></a>An illogical and inefficient requirement may seem in isolation no more than a minor irritation, but it is the cumulative effect that imposes such a debilitating drag on our productivity and effectiveness. I hope that this clause will indeed streamline procedures to the benefit of everyone involved.

<p><a name="07012588000282"></a>The two current industrial training boards&#151;the Construction Industry Training Board and the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board&#151;have expressed concern that over the past 25 years more employers are not choosing to join these organisations. Assuming this continues, without changes to the current system there is a real risk that the ITBs will not be able to demonstrate support, despite the 2006 CITB survey of employers in the construction industry showing that 70 per cent of employers who are not federation members support the continuation of the levy. The current legislation recognises these organisations as the only means for the boards to demonstrate employer support for the levy proposals.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000284"></a>We on these Benches do not believe that an increase in compulsory levies is the way forward&#151;certainly not when questions remain about how much constructive business involvement there is in the courses that would have to be funded. Instead, I hope that the Government will look at ways to encourage voluntary levies. The UK film industry&#146;s voluntary decision in August last year to confirm a levy on its membership shows what the possibilities are when an industry is properly involved in the training of its future employees.</p>

<p><a name="07012588000285"></a><b><a name="70125-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07012588000415"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> Let me first confirm to the noble Baroness that this clause does not enable the imposition of levies in addition to those that can already be imposed under the Industrial Training Act 1982. The clause amends Section 11 of that Act to enable industrial training boards to demonstrate support for the levy proposals in a manner that retains a strong accountability but reflects the makeup of today's business community. Currently, Section 11 of the 1982 Act requires that, where the amount of the levy payable by any employer will exceed a specified level, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that one of three conditions is met. The first of these three conditions is that the board has industry consensus for its levy proposals. However, the board can only show this consensus by consulting organisations such as employer federations and trade associations that represent employers in their industries who are likely to be liable to pay the levy.</p>

The support for levies is not declining; the means by which that support is measured has become outdated.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000287"></a>However, even with the amendment, ITBs will continue to have to demonstrate that more than half of the employers, both by value of levy to be paid and by number, support the proposals that they wish to implement, if these are to be implemented on the basis of industry consensus. Clause 23 broadens the means by which an ITB can demonstrate that it has such a consensus. It will also enable the Secretary of State to make provision in regulations setting out reasonable steps that an ITB may take for this purpose. The Government have made available a draft set of indicative regulations which illustrate the likely types of such steps.</p>

<a name="70125-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07012588000288"></a>The changes will not prevent an industrial training board consulting any organisation such as a trade federation which is authorised to speak on behalf of its members who are likely to pay the levy. Rather, they will enable it to seek the views of employers by other means including, for example, the use of sampling or approaching employers directly. It will be for the industrial training boards to choose the consultation process that best suits the needs of its industry, and in all cases the Secretary of State will need to be satisfied that the process followed by the board is reasonable. On the basis of those assurances, I hope that the noble Baroness will be satisfied.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="07012575000008"></a><I>Due to an internal production error the Statement on Foreign Language Training for Members of the House of Lords was mistakenly printed under the name of Lord Bassam of Brighton yesterday. The Statement was in fact made in the name of The Chairman of Committees and is reprinted correctly below.</I></p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="07012575000009"></a> The House Committee agreed at its meeting on 18 July 2006 to establish a scheme for the provision of free foreign language training for Members. Details of the scheme appear in the new edition of the <I>Members&#146; Guide to Expenses </I>published today.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07012575000010"></a>The scheme is similar to that provided by the House of Commons. Members may recover the cost of attending foreign language classes provided by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The language course consists of an initial registration followed by 10 consultations. Members seeking reimbursement must obtain prior approval from the Clerk of the Parliaments and indicate how the course would help the Member in the performance of their parliamentary duties. Members will be required to confirm that all classes have been attended before reimbursement will be made.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07012575000012"></a>I have placed in the Libraries of both Houses, alongside this Statement, copies of the December update of the G8 Gleneagles Implementation Plan for Africa. This plan is updated monthly by the Department for International Development (DfID) on behalf of all departments.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="07012575000013"></a>A year ago, the Government set out 11 objectives that we hoped would be achieved by the end of 2006 (Annexe 1&#151;Box 1). I am pleased to report that the majority of these have been met, although more progress is needed on the Africa Standby Force and donor support for 10-year education plans and significant progress is needed on trade.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="07012575000014"></a>Effective international monitoring mechanisms have been put in place. G8 leaders reviewed progress at the 2006 summit and will do so again at the 2007 summit in Germany. The Africa Partnership Forum produced its first three progress reports in October 2006, with four more expected in May 2007. The civil society, African Monitor, is gaining momentum. The UK has helped create the Africa Progress Panel, to be chaired by Kofi Annan, to complement these other mechanisms.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="07012575000015"></a>Global aid rose 32 per cent in 2005 to $106.8 billion&#151;a record high. Preliminary aid figures for 2006 will be available from the OECD in April 2007, with the EU publishing a progress report for member states in May. Aid levels may fall back in 2006 and 2007 as debt relief declines, but the UK will continue to press donors to meet their 2005 pledges so we meet the overall target to increase global aid by $50 billion by 2010. The UK is on track to meet its target to provide 0.7 per cent of national income as aid by 2013. Future spending projections are being finalised as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="07012575000016"></a>The first bonds for the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm) were released in November 2006, raising $1 billion. In total, the IFFIm will raise $4 billion, and these additional resources should save more than 10 million lives including five million children before 2015.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="07012575000017"></a>The World Bank, International Monetary Fund and African Development Fund have implemented the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) agreed at Gleneagles. Twenty-one countries (17 African) have reached &#147;Completion Point&#148; and had debts worth $36 billion cancelled under the MDRI.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="07012575000018"></a>The UN Peacebuilding Commission has been established and begun work on Burundi and Sierra Leone. The African Union is making progress towards its objective of a fully operational African Standby Force (ASF) by 2010. The ASF has around 15,000 troops pledged, Brigade Headquarters have been established and are manned in three regions. But faster progress is needed on this.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="07012575000019"></a>The UN Convention Against Corruption has entered into force and international agreement been reached on mechanisms for implementing and monitoring it, for tackling international asset recovery and co-ordinating technical assistance. Twenty-six countries have signed up to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. Three countries (Ghana, Kenya and Rwanda) have completed the Africa Peer Review Mechanism review process and are beginning to implement recommendations. South Africa and Algeria should be peer reviewed in 2007. We would like to see more countries with self-assessments underway.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="07012575000020"></a>The launch of a major new education initiative at the Financing for Development conference in Nigeria in May 2006, and the UK's pledge to provide &#163;8.5 billion for education over the next 10 years, have helped to stimulate 25 African countries to begin work on long-term education plans. The Education Fast Track Initiative (FTI) is being expanded to 60 countries. Twenty-eight countries have FTI-endorsed education sector plans. Three further plans are likely to be approved in early 2007 with a further 15 likely by end of 2007. A conference&#151;to be convened by the EU and the World Bank in the spring&#151;will encourage donors to make long-term commitment to fund these plans.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="07012575000022"></a>The UK issued a global call for action on water and sanitation&#151;linked to the 2006 UN Development Programme Human Development Report, which highlighted the urgency of the challenge and action the international community should take to meet this. Alongside this, the UK has increased its own efforts: DfID is focusing on 12 African countries, with Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo identified as top priorities.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="07012575000023"></a>The number of people receiving AIDS treatment in low and middle income countries rose from 400,000 to 1.6 million between 2003 and 2006, rising tenfold in sub-Saharan African alone to around 1 million. This represents around a quarter of those in need, so there is a long way still to go. Treatment has prevented around 250,000 to 300,000 premature deaths in developing countries in 2005. The international focus is firmly on achieving universal access to comprehensive prevention programmes, treatment, care and support by 2010. The UK is providing substantial funding, both for new initiatives like the International Drug Purchase Facility (UNITAID) and increasing its contributions to organisations like the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria (GFATM) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="07012575000024"></a>The EU is developing an Action Plan on Recruitment of Health Workers to address training and retention, to strengthen developing country health services and to ensure EU member states' recruitment policies do not adversely affect developing country health services. This should be finalised shortly. The new secretariat of the Global Health Workforce Initiative is helping countries and regional institutions such as the African Union in areas like human resource planning and lesson learning across countries.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="07012575000025"></a>Important changes have been made to the international humanitarian system, to increase its ability to prevent and to respond to emergencies. The new Central Emergency Response Fund (CERT) has already demonstrated its value as a source of rapid-response funds for &#147;neglected&#148; humanitarian crises such as in Timor-Leste where in April and May 2006 more than 135,000 became displaced overnight following the outbreak of fighting. The UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator (HC) system has being strengthened, with a new secretariat focused on training and deployment. Twenty-one experienced co-ordinators have been trained, providing a pool to respond to crises, most recently in Lebanon. The &#147;Cluster Approach&#148; has increased co-ordination among agencies. A joint World Bank/DfID programme is supporting integration of disaster risk reduction measures into development strategies, focusing on particularly vulnerable countries (including Malawi and Mozambique). Reform of the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction is gaining momentum. DfID is supporting this, alongside other initiatives like the Pan-American Health Organisation's programme for emergency preparedness and disaster relief and the ProVention Consortium of international donors on disaster risk reduction.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="07012575000026"></a>The one area where progress has been very disappointing is trade. Informal talks on the Doha round of World Trade Organisation negotiations restarted in late 2006. The UK Government continue to push for early agreement on a deal that will substantially help poor countries, provide extra aid for private sector development, cut agricultural subsidies and end export subsidies.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="07012575000027"></a>The UK Government are delighted that Germany has identified Africa as a top priority for its G8 and EU presidencies this year. We will be working hard to ensure that this delivers further progress on Africa. As part of the Government's commitment to accountability, we have established 10 milestones which we believe need to be achieved by July 2007 (Box 2 in the Gleneagles Implementation Plan). I will provide a full report on these at that time.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="07012575000029"></a>I am pleased to inform the House that the Attorney General of the US, the Lord Advocate of Scotland and I have agreed guidance for handling cross-border cases between the UK and US.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="07012575000030"></a>I believe that the guidance will improve communication by facilitating the early sharing of case information and consultation between prosecutors in those jurisdictions. International co-operation in fighting transnational crime is essential. Further, this guidance should assist prosecutors to have the earliest notice of cases that could be of interest to them for possible investigation and prosecution in the UK. The guidance retains the UK prosecutor's powers to decide that a case should be tried in the UK when this is possible and in accordance with the law and public interest.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="07012575000031"></a>The guidance agreed between the UK and US is augmented by domestic guidance for prosecutors in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The domestic guidance will enable my office to ensure that each of my prosecuting departments is informed of cross-border cases in which it may have an interest.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="07012575000035"></a>The panel's terms of reference were to:</p>

<a name="07012575000040"></a><b><a name="70125-wms0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07012575000053"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Transport (Dr Stephen Ladyman) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="07012575000041"></a>This Statement is to inform the House of the events surrounding the beaching of the MSC &#147;Napoli&#148; at Lyme Bay, east of Sidmouth. The chain of events began on the morning of 18 January. During severe weather conditions, the MSC &#147;Napoli&#148;, a UK registered vessel, experienced difficulties on the French side of the English Channel, 40 miles off Cornwall. The master  


<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS70"></a><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column WS70</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of MSC &#147;Napoli&#148; made the decision that the danger was sufficient that the crew should abandon the ship. Despite the heavy seas, all of the crew were successfully rescued by UK helicopter from Royal Navy Air Station Culdrose.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="07012575000042"></a>In accordance with the Anglo-French Joint Maritime Contingency Plan (Mancheplan) the initial assistance to the ship was a French-led operation (conducted in close liaison with the UK Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention&#151;SOSREP). An on-scene assessment of the condition of the MSC &#147;Napoli&#148; was made, and the conclusion of this assessment was that the least environmentally risky option was to tow the vessel to a place of refuge in UK waters.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="07012575000043"></a>The need for a place of refuge and its location are always driven by the circumstances of an incident, including such event-specific data as the weather, the geographical whereabouts of the incident and the type of threat posed by the vessel and its cargo. On this occasion, the south coast of England provided better options for a place of refuge than the French coast. On the French coast, there were no suitable places of refuge within reasonable distance.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="07012575000044"></a>Accordingly, Portland Harbour was selected asthe destination for the MSC &#147;Napoli&#148;, owing to the extent of its port facilities. A tow was attached on the evening of 18 January. However, in the early hours of 20 January, the condition of MSC &#147;Napoli&#148; began to worsen significantly due to continuing severe weather and it became clear that it would not be possible to reach Portland. Priority was given to giving the vessel shelter and keep it in one piece as there was real concern that the vessel might start to break up. The decision was made to turn the vessel towards an identified beaching site in the sheltered waters of Lyme Bay. Environmental groups and local authorities were consulted, and it was on this basis that the decision was taken to beach the ship just to the east of Sidmouth.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="07012575000045"></a>On the evening of 20 January, tugs attempted to pull MSC &#147;Napoli&#148; harder aground. At this time there was some leakage of oils into the water and a boom was deployed around the vessel to contain it. The oil leaking from MSC &#147;Napoli&#148; created an eight kilometre wide sheen.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="07012575000046"></a>The MSC &#147;Napoli&#148; was carrying approximately 2,300 containers, of which 157 are believed to contain hazardous materials, including perfume, pesticides and batteries. One hundred and three containers were lost overboard, and some have washed ashore. Seventy-six of the containers have been found, many of which have been identified and have had their contents verified. The contents and positions of all but 27 containers have now been identified. Three of the containers washed ashore contained perfumes, small gas cylinders and battery acid.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="07012575000047"></a>Security around the Lyme Bay area has been a concern, with looting widely reported. A heavy police presence has been deployed in the area. The ship's owners have appointed a private security company to guard containers while the owners arrange for recovery. The beach at Branscombe has been fenced

Footpaths down on to the beach are also fenced off, as Devon County Council temporarily closed the paths leading to the beach from Branscombe to Beer on Monday for health and safety reasons. Contractors appointed by the ship's owners to deal with any shoreline clean up are setting up a compound by the beach to hold the waste and their equipment. Recovered material will be returned to the owner, recycled, or else will go to landfill.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="07012575000048"></a>SOSREP is leading the response to this incident. The national contingency plan has enabled us to take prompt and appropriate action in assisting the stricken MSC &#147;Napoli&#148; and there has been strong co-operation between SOSREP and all the parties concerned, including French authorities.</p>

<a name="70125-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="07012575000049"></a>Because of the fast moving nature of this incident, I anticipate making a further Statement to the House next week.</p>

This includes &#163;6 million to the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) to increase agricultural productivity; $30 million to the Investment Climate Facility to make Africa a better place to do business; and $20 million to the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa to support project preparation and co-ordination. DfID is a major funder of the Africa Peer Review Mechanism to promote good governance, initiated by NePAD, and has contributed around &#163;2.7 million to date (including to support the process in Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Mozambique and Uganda). DfID has also provided &#163;325,000 to support the African Union/NePAD Consolidated Plan of Action on Science and Technology.</p>

This will alert the local divisional veterinary managers of the bird's arrival and specify the necessary checks on quarantine that will need to be made, as well as any additional tests that may need to be carried out.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_12"></a><a name="07012581000047"></a>Birds for commercial import from other member states of the European Union do not have to go to quarantine. If birds are sent to quarantine then the SVS attends frequently to supervise and enforce rules. An SVS officer visits at least three times: at the beginning, during and at the end of the quarantine period.</p>

The exact sum is not known, and the attempt to breed these birds in captivity was unsuccessful so no captive bred specimens were released into the wild. No programme for breeding any of the other species has been undertaken using public money by Defra, Natural England or their predecessors.</p>

This was the first time that any part of the service police had been subjected to such a rigorous and in-depth independent examination, applying national bench-marking for police investigations. HMIC identified a number of areas where it felt that improvements could be made and these questions are linked to the report's recommendations. This important work is ongoing, including an assessment of resource implications.

The largest donor to the HIV/AIDS sector in PNG is the Australian development agency, AUSAID. DfID is working closely with AUSAID on major programmes to address HIV/AIDS in a number of other countries in south-east Asia. These include the Three Diseases Fund in Burma, in which poverty and conflict issues have similarities to those found in PNG. Through this joint working, DfID is seeking to transfer some of the UK's expertise in tackling HIV/AIDS in extremely poor countries to AUSAID to apply to its programmes in the region.</p>
