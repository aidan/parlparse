Their primary focus is now on training and mentoring the 14th Division of the Iraqi army until it is fully operational. They also support Iraqi-led operations when requested, as they did during the recent successful Iraqi operations in the city. In addition, our forces facilitate economic reconstruction&#151;in particular at Basra&#146;s international airport&#151;and lead the training of the Iraqi navy.</p>

As we know, strong evidence suggests that most of the weapons being used by the Iranian-backed group there, including mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and ever more sophisticated roadside bombs, are of Iranian origin. What are we doing diplomatically to counter the threat to Iraqi stability and to the lives of our troops, and how successful have we been on the ground with Iraqi troops in preventing the transfer of those weapons into southern Iraq and the Iranian training of the insurgents?</p>

It is a topic of great concern to us all. We are taking action diplomatically in a number of ways, including by trying to involve influential countries in the region as well as exerting our influence directly. We are supporting the Department of Border Enforcement in Iraq, and our fast jets help and assist in that. That is very important. Everybody involved recognises that the problem of weapons coming in to the insurgents from Iran is very significant.</p>

Similarly, when Iraqi troops have been moved into Baghdad, British advisers and support people&#151;those who were mentoring and training those divisions&#151;did go with them. So it is nothing exceptional for coalition forces that are mentoring specific divisions of the Iraqi army to go with those divisions when they are on operations.</p>

The recent events in Basra city proved very successful in attacking the militia and criminal elements. The Iraqi forces took the lead but they had support and help from elsewhere. That was important. On that basis, it would be wrong to try to set a target date for when that training and mentoring could come to an end.</p>

Is it not clear that there have not been adequate forces to best achieve the missions which have been so brilliantly performed by our Armed Forces in Basra and Afghanistan? Would it not be better to switch the Basra forces to Afghanistan? Will the Government overall make up their mind on whether they will adjust the resources to the commitments or the commitments to the resources?</p>

I acknowledge the noble Lord&#146;s praise for the work of the Armed Forces and the fact that he says that they have been brilliant in what they do. But at this stage it would be somewhat premature and somewhat irresponsible to go for a simplistic solution such as switching troops from Iraq to Afghanistan.</p>

As I indicated, we are spending more in this coming year than we did last year. However, there is no direct correlation between the levy and the sustainability fund. The levy is not a hypothecated tax, and it goes to many other purposes beyond the sustainability fund. The sustainability fund has a significant role to play and we are increasing expenditure accordingly.</p>

It would be rash of me to say that in every case the sustainability fund has been the decision-taker, but of course the fund produces those benefits in crucial respects, and it is important to the environment. There is a broader issue. We need price signals to be sent out to the industry in order that it goes for the recycling of materials rather than the constant exploitation of natural aggregates.</p>

The question of aggregates covers so many issues with regard to the land and, I might say, with regard to marine resources. One of our major projects is to look at the impact on the seabed and marine life of the withdrawal of aggregates from the sea. All these issues have to be taken into account, which is why there has to be a relationship between National Heritage and the sustainability fund. A great deal of research has been carried out in recent years to enable the fund to target successfully.</p>

I am sure the noble Lord would not wish it to be seen as a stealth tax, but &#163;24 million into the sustainability fund does not sound like a particularly robust use of that money in environmentally sensitive ways. To what extent has the pattern of spending changed over the years? The noble Lord told us that the planned spend this year was an increase. Could he give us figures for the previous three or four years, just to give us the pattern of spending?</p>

The House will recognise that the levy is not a hypothecated tax. It is there to sustain aspects of the industry as well and to send out a price signal, for which the noble Lord is likely to offer his support, that the aggregates industry has a particular responsibility regarding the environment. That is why the levy is in place to the level it is, although it has been increased this year only as an inflation index.</p>

Work is under way on this and proposals from the European Commission are expected in January 2009. The Food Standards Agency, on behalf of the UK, has been actively engaging in the Commission&#146;s work on setting maximum levels through discussions. As noble Lords will appreciate, other member states in Europe take a different view from that of the UK. We have the most liberal market in this respect. We are working with member states to ensure that the levels set are flexible and risk-based, to balance consumer protection with the impact on UK business.</p>

As part of the layered approach to security, all airside pass holders at UK airports, regardless of their nationality, are also subject to extensive pre-employment background checks, and those engaged in security activities must also pass a counterterrorism check.

I cannot agree with the noble Lord that the difference between airside workers and non-airside workers is blurred. Airside workers have to be physically searched. A whole range of physical security measures is in place for staff and used daily; that is clearly not the case for those working non-airside. Staff are subject to detailed security checks in much the same way as the noble Lord or I would be as passengers.

All non-EU nationals must prove their right to work in the UK. Staff have to go through a background check that looks at their work history over the previous five years. You would have to be a long-term sleeper in an organisation to get past that check. Those checks are very rigorous and full references have to be taken up.

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="08051564000081"></a>When I first raised this matter, some Members of this House and, of course hospital trusts, rubbished my allegations and refused to accept that any of it was happening at all. They really cannot do so today. There is a mass of hard evidence that my claims are only too true. Television programmes have highlighted it. There is hardly anyone who has not heard of the familiar allegation of nurses placing food or a cup of tea too far from a bed-ridden patient for the plate, cup or tray to be reached. The nurse bustles in some 15 minutes later, exclaiming, &#147;I see you don&#146;t want that, then&#148;, and whisks it away before the patient can say a word.</p>

Some patients get cheese slices, wrapped in something that they cannot undo; sandwiches are also wrapped that way. Some get hard-crust bread with which their dentures cannot cope. Of course, this does not happen in every hospital, as thousands and thousands of really exemplary nurses are caring devotedly for their patients. I make no criticism whatever of them, but we deceive ourselves if we think that standard is universal. It is not. We must recognise the truth and seek to be effective.</p>

Some said that there was really no point at all in complaining, as the relative or friend about whose treatment they had complained had died of it and was gone. As for taking legal action, that is never really possible unless someone is very rich. The NHS is the biggest and mightiest business in all of Europe, and it is difficult indeed to take a case up against it. In fact, I am told that it is nearly impossible to find a lawyer who will do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="08051564000085"></a>With the agreement of some complainants, however, I was able to give the Minister a dossier of 22 cases  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1122"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>where bad nursing and no feeding were alleged. Names, ages, addresses, dates and hospitals where deficiencies occurred were all accurately listed. I do not blame the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for what happened next. He passed on the cases for investigation, perfectly properly. I blame those charged with investigating; their arrogance and blindness to the facts was absolutely appalling. Not all&#151;a few hospitals tried hard to respond properly, the health authority in the north-east being one, although I still do not quite understand why or how the families&#146; sworn allegations to me were not judged to be evidence. However, most authorities did not respond as they should have. Eight out of my 22 cases, so carefully detailed, did not get one word of comment. Other authorities commented on only parts of the complaint but totally ignored other parts.</p>

<a name="80515-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08051564000086"></a>Allegations about lack of feeding were hardly ever referred to, although one or two mentioned a rather mysterious red tray&#151;but no explanation of what that meant was ever made to me. I have since found out that, if a red tray comes along carrying the food, it is meant to signal that the patient needs help to eat. The authorities did not tell me that, and gave me no clue at all whether, or how, or to what extent the red tray signal actually results in help being given. Nurses are extremely busy and do not have time to spoon-feed people. I recognise that difficulty. Yet complaints are coming in all the time about lack of feeding, red tray or no.</p>

<a name="80515-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08051564000087"></a>An old MP friend and colleague of mine in the other place visited his wife, who had cancer. He sat by her bed as long as he could. After three days, he thought, &#147;That&#146;s strange; I haven&#146;t once seen this girl being fed&#148;, so he asked the nurse, &#147;When do you feed my wife?&#148; &#147;Oh, we&#146;re not feeding her&#148;, the nurse said. &#147;Not feeding her&#148;, he said, &#147;Why? Who said that? Did she ask for it? Did I ask for it?&#148;. He created an awful row, and the result was that his wife was fed and things got better. I listed all this carefully in my complaint. The response was, &#147;In this case, communications failed&#148;. That was it, nothing else. The authority admitted the allegations were true, but there was no explanation and no apology.</p>

<a name="80515-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08051564000088"></a>Other allegations of poor care, in addition to lack of feeding, which were totally ignored included two examples of deaf aids being removed and never returned because they were lost. If you are reliant on a deaf aid and you cannot hear what is being said to you, you give rather peculiar answers, you are immediately put down as being a bit gaga and therefore your feeding is not normal. Nothing of that was ever referred to, although I think it is a very serious complaint. A man who was told to arrive at the hospital no later than  7 am when no bed or food was available until 10 pm was another complaint not mentioned. A husband who had to dress his wife&#146;s bedsores because nobody else did was not mentioned either. There may be perfectly reasonable reasons why all these things happened. If so, the reports I received failed to respond to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08051564000089"></a>The letter from the health chief executive summing up the whole matter said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08051564000520"></a>&#147;I am assured that adequate policies on nutrition and hydration are in operation and that negligence has not occurred. In the light of the depth of the investigation and findings, I do not consider that a further investigation will be necessary&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08051564000503"></a>How could he possibly say that in the light of what I have told the House? Considering that eight of my cases were never investigated or commented on and a number of specific complaints were not referred to in the responses made, I find those words from the chief executive astounding in their complacence and arrogance. They are also extremely depressing because they obviously show that he is perfectly satisfied with the situation as it is and will take no steps to alter what is going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08051564000090"></a>Further examples are coming up all the time. In the past 24 hours, I have received lengthy communications from Age Concern, the Stroke Association, the Royal College of Nursing, Help the Aged and others concerning up-to-date cases of this happening. A headline in the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> of 8 February 2008 read:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08051564000521"></a>&#147;One in five patients leaves hospital malnourished&#148;.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000505"></a>I admit that some patients come into hospital undernourished before they ever step over the threshold, but the Department of Health&#146;s own figures show that the nutritional condition of at least 8,500 patients a year worsens while in hospital.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08051564000091"></a>I believe that Ministers acknowledge that when patients are in the care of the National Health Service a clear responsibility lies on that service to give them the ordinary essentials of life. There are no more basic essentials for the business of living than food and liquid, as well as medical care. Ministers must be less trusting of the reports they sometimes get from chief executives and trusts that flatly refuse to see that anything is wrong.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08051564000092"></a>There is a very great deal wrong. All of us have a duty and an obligation to see it righted. There are many ways to do that. Hospitals could ask patients&#146; relatives if they would be able to come in to help feed them, which would save the nurses a lot of trouble. They could ensure better quality meals to which a patient can address himself and eat. They could arrange for help for patients with immobilising conditions such as multiple sclerosis or motor neurone disease. I had complaints about that that were not addressed.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08051564000093"></a>They could order that meals must be put in reach of patients. Since the May elections, government spokesmen have repeatedly assured us that they will listen. All right, then&#151;listen. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

Hospital food and the nutrition of patients is an extremely important issue. I have more reason than many people to know that, because I have more experience of hospital food than is desirable for anybody. As someone who has spent a considerable part of recent years in NHS hospitals, once for a continuous period of almost seven months, I know only too well what important punctuation marks in a hospital day the mealtimes are, and how important the food is. The ordering, expectation and eating of it acquire an importance  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1124"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>way beyond that of simple nutrition, important though that is, as the noble Baroness has reminded us.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08051564000095"></a>Before I turn to some of the specific points I want to make about food, I mention nutrition more generally. The nutrition of patients goes wider than the food they receive. For four and a half months of my longest stay in hospital I could take no food whatsoever, and was kept alive, as many patients are, through intravenous Hickman lines, which had to be put in under general anaesthetic, constantly monitored and renewed each day with a bag of artificial food. This had to be done with great skill by specially trained nurses and at huge cost to the NHS. I believe every bag of food cost at least &#163;75. I am enormously grateful. Because of the way I received this food, I never tasted it, but I am very grateful that it kept me alive. I mention this only because we must remember that the nutrition of patients is a wide issue, which engages many skilled and experienced staff in our hospitals. Once I had the Hickman line removed, I had to learn to eat again, which was not easy. At that point I was very well supported by dieticians, special calorie-laden items and very close attention. There are not many times in one&#146;s life when one asks for more calories.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08051564000096"></a>That was all on an acute ward. I know that many people are concerned about the nutrition of patients on acute wards and in long-term care, where perhaps not enough attention is given, not only to the food, as the noble Baroness has reminded us, but to helping people eat it. We should rightly be concerned about that, but we should also keep a sense of proportion. In that regard, I quote from the Healthcare Commission&#146;s report, which came out yesterday, in a timely fashion. A higher percentage of patients said that the quality of food was now very good. Only 18 per cent said that in 2002, and 19 per cent in 2007, but yesterday&#146;s report said that over half said that the food was either good or very good.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08051564000097"></a>However, there was certainly far too much variation among those who need help with eating. In the lowest-scoring trusts, 42 per cent said that they did not receive enough help with food, while in the highest-scoring trusts the figure was only 3 per cent. The commission&#146;s chief executive, Anna Walker, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08051564000523"></a>&#147;The government has made absolutely plain that it wants the NHS to listen to the views of patients and respond to their concerns&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000098"></a>That is very important in light of what the noble Baroness said about the professionals&#146; response. These reports are based on the views of patients. Anna Walker goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08051564000524"></a>&#147;It gives the most comprehensive picture available of how patients feel about NHS hospitals ... Overall, it&#146;s encouraging that a steadily increasing percentage of patients say care is excellent. It is good to see advances on issues like the quality of food ... and team working between doctors and nurses.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08051564000525"></a>But the survey also shows that in some hospitals the NHS is struggling to deliver on some of the basics of hospital care ... Those performing poorly must learn from those who perform well&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000506"></a>I am sure all noble Lords will agree with that. She goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08051564000526"></a>&#147;It is crucial that trusts take this information on board. The patient voice must be heard loudly on the boards of trusts across the country&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1125"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08051564000507"></a>This annual assessment, as the voice of patients, is very important. It is clear that some progress has been made, but we all acknowledge that there is a lot more to do.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08051564000099"></a>Let me point out some of things that the Government have done in regard to nutrition. <I>Improving Nutritional Care</I> was published in October 2007 and the programme is monitored through a delivery board chaired by the head of Age Concern, a very important point. That board is accountable to my honourable friend in another place, the Minister for Care Services. There will be an in-year progress report this summer, which we should all watch out for, and then an update in December.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08051564000100"></a>We will all remember the Better Hospital Food programme, which was set up in 2001, if only because of the involvement of Lloyd Grossman, who chaired it. It made great progress in improving the quality of hospital food.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08051564000101"></a>I should also mention the introduction of ward housekeepers to look after the basic non-clinical needs of patients, some of which have been mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Knight. Nurses have a responsibility for food service but they now have someone to support them in delivery. By the end of 2004, housekeepers had been introduced into 53 per cent of all hospitals. In larger hospitals, where the majority of patients receive treatment, that figure rose to 70 per cent. These figures continue to rise.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08051564000102"></a>Given the reputation that some hospital food has it may seem odd to think about an NHS recipe book, but hospital meals have been redesigned to introduce better ingredients, to improve flavour and to include patients&#146; favourites such as curry and other kinds of world cuisine. Many patients find it difficult to identify the name of the dish when choosing from menus, and important progress has been made by introducing photographs of what the food likes like to help patients choose.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08051564000103"></a>From my own experience, I know that important progress has been made by making proper food available 24 hours a day. As the noble Baroness reminded us, it is not acceptable for you to wake up from surgery to have only a sandwich&#151;still less a bit of cheese in wrapping that you cannot deal with&#151;available to you. Eighty-nine per cent of hospitals have introduced ward kitchen services to provide light snacks, 80 per cent have snack boxes and 84 per cent also provide extra snacks during the day. Again, it is very important that patients can choose a hot meal in the evening&#151;before there was only soup or a sandwich&#151;and 94 per cent of hospitals now provide this service.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08051564000104"></a>Progress has been made in quality. However, we have to understand that providing food in large quantities to a large number of people on a necessarily limited budget is never going to be easy. We always have to remember that when we consider food in hospitals.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08051564000105"></a>As nurses and ancillary staff are so important in monitoring eating in patients, we should also acknowledge that the huge increases in funding for the NHS and the increase in nursing staff&#151;there are now 80,000 more nurses than in 1997&#151;has played an important part. But, of course, an increase in nurse numbers will not help if nurses do not see helping patients to feed  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1126"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>themselves as part of their essential duties. We must therefore ensure that nurse training includes this as a priority. Where hospitals have reintroduced matrons, it has had the effect of helping nurses to remember that nursing is about caring as well as about technicality and targets. I do not in any way downgrade the importance of the technical side of nursing because I have reason to know how very important that is. We must remember, however, its caring side as well.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08051564000106"></a>I do not think this is too much of a digression, and I also want to mention that, though we are concentrating on food in hospitals, we must remember that this issue is also of concern in residential care homes and nursing homes where many elderly people are cared for. People with dementia, learning difficulties or severe physical disabilities would have the same problems the noble Baroness set out for hospital patients. We must remember how important food is in these places, too. The Commission for Social Care Inspection has always made that part of their inspection process. We must make sure that that inspection and regulation is carried forward to the Care Quality Commission which is now being considered under the Health and Social Care Bill currently passing through your Lordships&#146; House. I believe that the menu improvements that have been made in hospitals must be included in care homes.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08051564000107"></a>Some of the difficulties raised by the noble Baroness could also have been circumvented in hospitals and in care homes by the use of volunteers. Many hospitals and community facilities, not to mention hospices, have excellent teams of volunteers who help out at mealtimes. They can collect the menu choices, help with serving and, most importantly, sit with patients to see that they can eat the food served. Some health and safety issues have to be addressed, but often all the patient needs is someone who will not feed them but sit with them while they eat. Most of us expect mealtimes to be a sociable occasion and volunteers can alert the staff if the patient is not eating.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08051564000108"></a>The recent excellent report on volunteering by the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger&#151;I declare an interest as president of Volunteering England&#151;pointed out the potential of volunteers in situations such as this. As someone who used to be a voluntary services co-ordinator for a health authority, I certainly commend the idea and I hope that this debate will focus more attention on the potential of volunteers in this regard.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08051564000109"></a>I certainly would not want to suggest a lack of seriousness in the complaints the noble Baroness has brought to our attention in this debate, but we should also acknowledge that a lot of progress has been made. Certainly there are still shortcomings and we must continue to tackle these with urgency and with determination for the sake of all patients in our hospitals and outside.</p>

In Wales, we have our own regime, as health is devolved. One thing that has followed from that is that a nutrition catering framework was produced by the All Wales Catering/Nutrition Group for the Welsh Assembly Government some years ago. The aim was to improve patient  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1127"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>nutrition and hospital catering services. NHS trusts in Wales were required to implement the framework at all hospital sites. This framework emphasised the importance of nutrition to in-patient care in NHS hospitals in Wales. As we know, this can impact on the speed with which a patient recovers and contribute to an early discharge from hospital. It is most valuable.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08051564000111"></a>The framework also stresses the importance of choice of meals for patients, assistance with eating their food, if that is required, and uninterrupted time in which to eat. It also recommends the availability, as has been mentioned, of meals and snacks when mealtimes are missed. The framework covers issues such as allergy, feeding problems and measuring intake of food and fluid. It also covers language, because in parts of Wales Welsh is the first language and the most homely language for patients, nurses and staff to discuss things together. It also deals with nutrition adequacies, patient-feeding assistance and menu structure.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08051564000112"></a>In 20 years or so as a hospital chaplain I have often spoken to patients in different hospitals. The situation regarding hospital food has varied tremendously from hospital to hospital. I do not in any way condemn the majority of hospitals. What they provide is good and the way they provide it is totally acceptable. Those that receive complaints are in a minority. Only this Monday I was in Glan Clwyd hospital&#151;a large hospital in north Wales&#151;where I met members of the community health council who were carrying out an inspection visit. The response was favourable and positive, as I suggest is the case in most hospitals, at least in Wales.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08051564000113"></a>Do community health councils have sufficient input? When they visit hospitals, can they make recommendations and, if so, are they accepted? What standard of food are they expecting? In the Grand Committee debate on the Health and Social Care Bill on 6 May, the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, mentioned that hospital meals cost about &#163;2.65 each. Given rising food prices, is that sum adequate for the needs of patients, who need the best food possible? I was speaking this morning to catering staff in this very establishment. Poor-quality meat is likely to be unacceptable, especially to those who are frail and need special attention.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08051564000114"></a>If I do not have a boiled egg available I am lost, but some folk are expert at making meals out of hardly anything. With a low allocation of funds for food, catering staff are sometimes in a dilemma about how they can best meet the needs of the patient and still remain within their allocation. How much training is there for the staff involved in preparing hospital food? Do our catering colleges have a special course in feeding patients for people who will be involved in hospital nutrition? Surely this is a specialised area that we should consider. What is the standard of those who come from our catering establishments? Is it appropriate for today&#146;s needs?</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08051564000115"></a>If patients are frail and a tray of food is placed out of their reach, it could be the best meal in the world and it would make no difference. Also, plastic knives and forks are not easy implements to handle. When I am sitting in a plane&#151;and I always travel economy, if I travel at all&#151;I wonder how on earth I will be able to cut any meat with these plastic implements. If you are frail, it is a problem in itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08051564000116"></a>Some patients need help with their meals and even assistance with feeding. Most of the hospitals provide this; the nurses go out of their way to meet this need. The University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff has had a volunteering scheme for some time&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, might mention this. I was told this morning by the previous Minister, Jenny Randerson, that having volunteers and family coming in at mealtimes to help patients had improved the situation 100 per cent. It involves families and the community in supporting their local hospital. We need somehow to increase the number of hospitals and perhaps even care homes that have this facility so that no patient is unable to access a good meal and make the most of it.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08051564000117"></a>What assessment is made of the eating needs of patients when they are admitted to hospital? People can sometimes be embarrassed. Hospital meals might include chocolate, cheese and heavy cream, which people with migraine, for instance, are unable to touch. What assessment is made of people with migraine and with allergies, such as those who cannot eat wheat in any form? What are the alternatives? As we become a more multicultural society, what assessment is made of the religious needs of those from other faiths in our hospitals? I am sure that such assessment takes place but I would like to know exactly how much is done in this area and what the difficulties are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08051564000118"></a>Certain other things can be embarrassing, such as ill-fitting dentures. You cannot easily tackle a meal unless you are able to chew it. When people come into a hospital, an elementary basic assessment should be made. Are there any problems? Are there any things that might increase embarrassment? That would help tremendously, so that stage one of a patient&#146;s introduction to hospital food is at least knowing that his requirements have been considered.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08051564000119"></a>Finally, let me say a word of tremendous appreciation to all those involved at every level in providing food in our hospitals. In my experience over many years, they do a tremendous job. As has been said, they have come a long way and many improvements have taken place. Much more needs to be done, but we should encourage the staff and not discourage them with any words of condemnation.</p>

It is fitting that this debate should fall the day after the service in Westminster Abbey filled by 2,000 people&#151;mostly nurses, midwives and health visitors&#151;to commemorate the life of Florence Nightingale.

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08051564000122"></a>I was fascinated to read some recently discovered manuscripts about a 2,000-bed hospital in Jerusalem in 1099. A list of basic care was given, with one item relating to nutrition. There were two kitchens&#151;one general and one for the diets of patients suffering from digestive disorders. Fresh meat was served three times a week, with plenty of bread, water and a wide range of fresh fruit.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08051564000123"></a>Some 10 centuries later, however, we are faced with evidence of poor nutrition. Only this week, I heard of a patient suffering from coeliac disease who had informed the hospital prior to admission that she required a gluten-free diet. Joy oh joy, as she travelled down the corridor to the ward, a large poster advertised coeliac disease and the importance of a gluten-free diet. She thought that all was well but, as she went though the ward door, all was not well. No gluten-free diet appeared and the nurses were unaware of what coeliac disease was or of the need for a gluten-free diet.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08051564000124"></a>One could spend the whole length of this debate repeating anecdotes of patients&#146; experiences, but we are all familiar with hearing and reading of hardships suffered by patients. I declare an interest in that my profession was nursing for 40 years and I spent eight years as an NHS trust chairman. I am currently president of the Florence Nightingale Foundation.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08051564000125"></a>The Royal College of Physicians states that nutrition is &#147;a doctor&#146;s responsibility&#148;. The nursing regulatory body states that it is the qualified nurse who is responsible for ensuring that food is provided appropriate to patient care. I was a nurse in training in the 1950s. In our introductory course, we were given instruction in invalid cookery. In those days, each ward had a kitchen and nurses could supplement patients&#146; diets by cooking boiled or scrambled eggs, for example. We were taught nutrition and the importance of diets. We served breakfast&#151;and what a nightmare that was, with two nurses serving 30 patients. There was a choice of cereals or porridge, or a cooked breakfast with each egg cooked for a different number of minutes. Then there was toast and marmalade&#151;and this was just at the end of rationing.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08051564000126"></a>Lunch was the main meal of the day. The ward closed at 11.45 am and patients prepared for the meal, which was served at midday by the ward sister or the staff nurse in charge. Nurses helped to feed those who needed assistance; any meals left were reported and if necessary a supplement was given. Patients were weighed weekly. The ward reopened at 1.30 pm, the patients having had a rest time after their meal. Supper was served at 6 pm, consisting of a light meal followed by a hot milk drink of cocoa, Horlicks or Ovaltine at  8.30 pm. Today, mealtimes are not always well spaced and there is not always a protected main meal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08051564000127"></a>There is available to the NHS a great deal of guidance, from NICE, the Healthcare Commission, the Food Standards Agency and the Department of Health, to name but a few. Yet we learn year on year that more people are being discharged with malnutrition. Evidence shows that good nutrition aids recovery, healing wounds

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08051564000128"></a>Why is it, then, that guidance is not being followed everywhere and why are patients&#146; complaints about food escalating? The Healthcare Commission is reporting improvements, but in a survey conducted by <I>Which</I><I>?</I>, the consumer watchdog, 250 patients out of 1,000 said that they were reliant on relatives or friends bringing in edible food. Some food served was still frozen in the middle or congealed on the plate and most were unhappy at the presentation of food to a point of repulsion. Dietary needs were not met.</p>

<a name="80515-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08051564000129"></a>Some 13 million meals, mainly untouched, were thrown away last year. In answer to a Question in the other place last year, the Health Minister said that &#163;162 million of taxpayers&#146; money was thrown away by the NHS in the past five years. The average cost of an NHS meal was &#163;2.65 in August 2007. Malnutrition is common, but it is often not recognised, not prevented and not treated. What an indictment, when it is known that good nutrition is a cost-effective method of treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08051564000130"></a>Within the NHS there are pockets of good practice, where leadership usually comes from the director of nursing, who pays great attention to the practice of serving meals in an orderly way and with great determination introduces protected mealtimes. This often requires shift patterns for nurses to be changed, as well as the routines of other healthcare professionals, to ensure that the patients&#146; mealtimes are sacrosanct. I know of one director of nursing who has introduced a weekly meal-tasting routine, visiting wards at random and not only tasting food but monitoring the serving of meals and the patient care given. A few directors of nursing have been given responsibility for the catering services.</p>

His most recent report, <I>Leading Local Change</I>, which was published last week, ahead of nine local strategic health authorities&#146; visions, to set them in the context of the next-stage review, emphasises the importance of clinician-led services and evidence-based change and sets out the principles governing local service change. I pay tribute to the work of the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, who has led the many healthcare professionals and stakeholder groups that have been working with him over the past year. The number of working groups and consultations that have taken place and continue to take place is absolutely staggering, covering not only the clinical pathways of all specialties but future education and training requirements, workforce planning and career developments.</p>

</ul>



<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1131"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08051564000508"></a>The context of this debate is to call attention to the case for improving arrangements for feeding patients in NHS hospitals. We take that as an excellent example of where nutrition ties into the quality of care in terms of clinical outcomes, patient experience and the safety of patients. There is enough evidence to indicate that change is necessary in meeting nutritional standards, which affect clinical outcomes in terms of healing and the prevention of infection. There will be a need to see local service changes that ensure that patients have a choice of edible food in suitable portion sizes and attractively presented. Patients should have regular meals served and supervised, with assistance given with feeding where needed and with adequate reporting.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08051564000134"></a>The clinical pathways led by the clinician will need to be designed to include the nutritional content determined by the clinical condition. The patient&#146;s weight should be recorded and monitored regularly to prevent malnutrition. Menus should be reviewed regularly and the patient experience should include attractively served meals that are well cooked and nutritious. Patient safety should require health and safety regulations to be followed for the preparation and serving of food.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08051564000135"></a>However, none of those changes will happen unless there is leadership in the organisation concerned with the delivery of high-quality care. Evidence from the number of complaints and the increase in the number of patients with malnutrition demonstrates the lack of attention paid to nutrition. As has been mentioned, guidance is available in abundance, but in many instances it is not applied.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08051564000136"></a>I am sure that the Minister and Members of this House will expect me at this stage to re-emphasise my passion to improve the quality of care to patients. That requires accountability from the patient to the board and authority and accountability from the board to the patient. Unless that is brought about, nothing will change. There must be an officer at board level with authority and accountability for the performance management of care delivery. Nutrition is but one aspect of many. Unless there is a culture change within the NHS with regard to the delivery to the patient of the care required for good nutrition, again, nothing will happen.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08051564000137"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Darzi, has repeatedly said that change must be determined locally according to circumstances, but surely there must be some central requirements for governance, accountability and authority. Otherwise, nothing will change. Current arrangements are often too comfortable to introduce changes, as those might present problems, but this is where culture change is required. Indeed, board members&#151;executive and non-executive&#151;need to re-examine their governance arrangements to ensure that attention at board meetings is not constrained to matters relating to finance and government service targets, but is balanced with the inclusion of performance management of care and patient satisfaction.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08051564000138"></a>I hope that the Minister will refer to the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, the example of nutrition, which clearly demonstrates the need for performance management of care with accountability and authority from the patient to the board and the board to the bed.

The debate is timely because your Lordships are scrutinising the Health and Social Care Bill, and I hope your Lordships can see the need for a good standard of nutrition to be written into the legislation.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08051564000140"></a>The Royal College of Nursing says that the body&#146;s immune system is highly dependent on nutritional status, and research shows that malnourished medical and surgical patients experience higher rates of complications and stay in hospital 30 per cent longer than nourished patients. With the great concern most people now have when being admitted to hospital of the dangers of hospital-acquired infections, that serious problem may have overshadowed the need of some hospital trusts to consider the importance of having good standards of food and beverages for their patients.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08051564000141"></a>The noble Baroness has continued to bring to the notice of Parliament the need for good standards of food and feeding. She has cited some terrible cases in the past of neglect and downright cruelty to patients who have been denied food and drink in hospitals. I congratulate her on her humane persistence on this matter. Now is our chance to raise standards across the country. That will be done only by getting that enshrined in legislation.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08051564000142"></a>I declare an interest: I have been a patient at Stoke Mandeville Hospital on a few occasions. For years, patients&#146; food has never been a high priority. Patients on the spinal unit are there for long periods, and food becomes more than nutritional need: it can lower or raise morale, depending on its quality and desirability. When patients are in spinal shock and at risk of pressure sores, good nutrition is essential. Also, spinal patients who have been waiting for a bed in a spinal unit because there are not enough beds often arrive in a terrible condition as there has been lack of knowledge about how to treat them in a general hospital. They have to be built up, because of the effects of infection, sepsis and terrible pressure sores. Nutritional needs are vital for these patients&#146; recovery.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08051564000143"></a>When I broke my legs and was on the spinal unit for several weeks a few years ago, I found the food bland and uninteresting. That is not surprising, as I think it comes precooked from somewhere in Wales. I craved fresh vegetables, and my late friend Baroness Darcy de Knayth, who visited me in hospital, brought me raw carrots and celery, which kept me going. Some years ago I became friendly with a young man from Kuwait who had broken his neck and was paying an enormous amount of money for being a private patient in that hospital. The food was so unsuitable that his mother brought him food every day from the embassy. There were also many patients who sent out for takeaway

The problem was that some of the patients then got into debt and had to borrow money.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08051564000144"></a>One of the porters at my block of flats has recently been a patient at St Thomas&#146;s Hospital. His operation was a success, but he said the food was so awful that he lost weight as he could not eat it. He asked me to bring the matter up in your Lordships&#146; House. I told him about this debate, and he said, &#147;I hope it comes up soon&#148;. I will give him a copy of <I>Hansard</I>.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08051564000145"></a>I have a physiotherapist who comes to me periodically. She told me that this year, her husband had a serious skiing accident and smashed his jaw, which had to be wired up. The accident happened in France and while he was in a French hospital, he was given suitable soft food. However, when he returned to England, he was given food that he could not chew or eat. Surely we could do better.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08051564000146"></a>Much has been said about suitable food and care for elderly patients; but everybody, whatever their age, needs suitable food for their individual condition. Some very ill patients sleep at different times. We need a flexible approach, as they will need nutrition when they wake up. This flexible approach is often used in hospices. However, many people do not go there and their needs, too, should be catered for in national health hospitals.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08051564000147"></a>Hospital trusts throughout the country vary in their standards of feeding patients. I heard praise for the Brompton hospital in London, so I contacted the hospital to hear about it first hand. It might be useful in helping to raise standards throughout the country&#151;and, I hope, of interest to your Lordships&#151;if I say something about the Brompton hospital. The trust has recognised the importance of how good-quality fresh food and drink contributes to the recovery of patients, especially those who have undergone surgery. The trust also believes that, when patients are well fed and enjoying their meals, they are happier and therefore more receptive to treatment by medical and nursing staff.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08051564000148"></a>The hospital is fortunate in having a full production kitchen, which operates like a hotel kitchen. Chefs are allocated to areas&#151;for instance, to the pastry section, where they make a cake daily for the patients&#146; tea. There is a larder section for daily salad production, a main area and a special-diet kitchen. Every dish on the menu is made on site. The hospital purchases  24 per cent of food locally from Kent farmers and small suppliers&#151;making it fresher, tastier, seasonally British and more nutritious. Purchasing direct from the farmer is cheaper and therefore gives value for money to the trust. All milk in the hospital is organic, from a dairy farm in Bedfordshire; and commodities for children&#151;for instance, beef burgers and chicken nuggets&#151;are 100 per cent meat and are organic, additive-free and dairy-free. Emphasis is put on a healthier diet and staff try to educate patients in the importance of a healthy diet and lifestyle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08051564000149"></a>Hospital catering managers and dieticians also meet patients regularly to ensure that the service meets their requirements, and to make changes to the menu to ensure satisfaction. All meals are served at ward level by the catering staff&#151;hosts and hostesses&#151;and this

The ward hostess service means that the catering department is responsible for ordering, preparing, distributing and finally serving the food. Staff feel that this is a significant factor in ensuring that a quality product reaches the patient.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08051564000150"></a>I end by saying that, with many severely disabled patients&#151;including blind patients&#151;with frail, elderly patients who need help with feeding and with nurses saying that they do not have enough time to do this, it seems that there should be trained volunteers who could be mobilised when needed to help with this time-consuming but vital need. There is nothing worse than rushing the feeding of patients when there may be a swallowing problem&#151;and a swallowing problem can become a choking problem. Volunteers would have to be trained and they could also become a very important befriending service, as some patients do not have much family support and live far from friends.</p>

I will share with the House some very good experiences that patients who attend Barnet and Chase Farm hospitals go through. I agree with other noble Lords that nutrition in hospital has been a very important subject over several national campaigns. The noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, raised the issue of the Government&#146;s Better Hospital Food initiative in 2001, which was a real landmark for hospitals to move on from.</p>

All patients, within 12 hours of entering hospital, have an interview with a member of the nursing staff. That involves a scoring system. I know that we are not supposed to have props in this House, but I have a form here and I would like to mention the procedure that leads up to the red tray. What happens as a result of that discussion is that this form is completed. This form has a series of headings, underneath which are a series of questions. That dialogue between the patient and the medical staff ascertains where they are. They may have an issue around how they swallow or how quickly they can eat; or other issues that are specific to their nutritional needs, and where we may have to help them by referring to dieticians and the like. A red tray identification only results if that dialogue goes on consistently. The noble Baroness has made the point that this needs to happen everywhere and not be a stroke of luck. That is what happens in my trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08051564000155"></a>At Barnet and Chase Farm, we have undertaken some excellent work to improve food and nutrition. We now have a food and nutrition steering group, which has patient involvement, which is very important&#151;other noble Lords have referred to that. It is The important to involve patients because they have experienced&#151;we hope&#151;good things, but also things that are less than good, and it is most important to learn from that. Among the initiatives introduced through the work of that group is the red-tray system, to which the noble Baroness referred. I started to tell the story of how red trays are identified as the key way forward in supporting someone who needs extra care with feeding. Certainly no tray&#151;whether it is red or, in the case of my trust, cream&#151;should be too far away for the patient to be able to reach it, as the noble Baroness described. I agree that that is an incredible and unforgivable practice.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08051564000156"></a>A couple of days ago, I visited a ward at Barnet and Chase Farm with a couple of nursing colleagues to refresh my memory about how the system works. That is something you do when the trust is set up to ensure that you know everything, but I also went round one of the wards ahead of this debate, to which I value the opportunity to contribute. The nursing staff and volunteers were delighted that this interest should be shown and they enthusiastically showed me what happens there. As noble Lords probably know, there is a white board in all wards, and when a patient at Barnet and Chase Farm has been identified as needing a red tray, a little red mark is put on the board. It does not identify anything to anyone who is not involved in the red-tray system, but it immediately brings to the attention of those who are involved that so-and-so needs a red tray and that they must ensure that all the facilities are in place for that to happen.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08051564000157"></a>The process of observing is something to which the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, referred. We take for granted that certain things will happen to our loved ones, friends or neighbours when they are in hospital but we must ensure that we also keep an eye on what takes place. For me, besides identifying the need for a red tray, evaluation is most important. Having a red tray is great but if, for different health reasons, the individual does not get much nutritional value from the food, although it is not as bad as not having a red tray, it certainly becomes a cosmetic rather than a real exercise.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08051564000158"></a>Therefore, in our hospitals we keep a checklist of every single meal throughout the day, whether it is a snack or a main meal&#151;breakfast, lunch or dinner. Alongside that is a score which indicates whether individuals have eaten a quarter, a half or three-quarters of their meal. At the end of each day, when the score is  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1136"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>looked at and the information gathered, if they have had not had the necessary nutritional value to keep them going, build them up and help towards their recovery, they receive a supplement, which may be a vanilla-flavoured or soup-like drink. This contains all the nutrients that they need for a whole day. The supplement, in fluid form, ensures that, even if the patient has not been able to eat what has been in front them, despite being cared for, fed and so on, then we can be assured that at the end of that day he or she will have received the nutrition about which everyone who has spoken so far has been concerned.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08051564000159"></a>I have shared with noble Lords what happens at Barnet and Chase Farm hospitals, but surely all the best practice cannot be in just one trust. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, that we need to ensure that good practice exists in all places. An example of that is food service assistants and ward housekeepers, who are to be found in my trust. Their priority is to ensure that the meals are identified correctly for the patients and that they are correctly delivered.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08051564000160"></a>Other speakers mentioned the environment in which patients eat. My noble friend Lady Pitkeathley referred to something with which many of us would agree&#151;that eating is also a social event, although that possibility is often limited in hospital. However, what is important in hospital is the environment in which the food is served, and something can be done about that. In my trust we have introduced, as I am sure others have too, a system in which there are no interruptions during mealtimes. Lunchtime, for example, is advertised outside the wards as being between noon and 1 pm or 1.30 pm, and not only are visitors not allowed but non-essential ward rounds do not occur. People are not taken for blood tests or X-rays, because the priority is for the patient to have the opportunity, with support if necessary, to sit quietly to eat a meal, just as the rest of us do. Perhaps we do not all do that too well&#151;we interrupt our meals to answer mobile phones and so on&#151;but in hospital mealtimes are very important private times. That is a new concept in hospitals and it has an important part to play in the whole cultural change that we need to see happening across the piece.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08051564000161"></a>The other important issue, to which the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, and other noble Lords referred, is that there should be an opportunity for people to eat at different times. If you are poorly, you do not always feel like eating at the set time when lunch or dinner is served, or perhaps you are asleep. In my trust, we have introduced&#151;I hope that this happens elsewhere&#151;the &#147;steamplicity&#148; system. It sounds complex but it is very effective. The meals are cooked and plated off-site and are then regenerated in microwaves. That may not sound very appetising but the meals are steamed in a microwave using a patent system whereby a special valve is put into a container which keeps the moisture inside. Therefore, when the meal is delivered to the patient, it is nourishing and, one hopes, enjoyable. That means that if at any time a patient wakes up or feels hungry, he has the opportunity to have a proper meal rather than just a sandwich. A menu is also available, which, again, is great. Meals are described  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1137"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with photographs&#151;something that was referred to earlier&#151;so that individuals can say, &#147;I really feel that I would like some of this&#148;.</p>

<a name="80515-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08051564000162"></a>Therefore, lots of good things are happening, as the noble Baroness and other noble Lords acknowledged. A lot of issues surround providing everyone in hospital with tasty food, but that is very difficult to do. It is a question not just of what can be afforded but of people&#146;s different tastes, and we need to debate that in this House. Places that are not up to the mark have a long way to go. Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals NHS Trust will be very happy to share our ideas on best practice. Importantly, as the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, said, we ensure that patient care is the first thing on our agenda at board meetings. We put the patient experience before finance and everything else, and I am very proud that that ethos has been introduced since I became involved as chair of the trust. It leads every other thing that happens to patients when they walk through our gates or are driven in by ambulance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08051564000164"></a>In some ways, I am sorry that the debate is confined to hospitals, because real concerns also exist in relation to care homes and to patients who are isolated in their own homes and are reliant on care coming into the home. These are people who can suffer long-term malnutrition over many years. Indeed, it is long-stay patients who are at particular risk if their feeding fails. During the debate, we have heard about examples of good practice, and I hope that they will be taken up and rolled out by other hospitals and areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08051564000165"></a>I want to address the important issue of a patient&#146;s nutritional status for treatment response and healing, and how feeding is a human instinct in caring that we may be failing to recognise. Our failure to address nutrition may reflect a cultural issue in our society&#151;perhaps we do not value the quality of our food as much as we should. I have been particularly struck by the quality of food for patients and staff in hospitals in France, which has much more of a food culture. There, mealtimes are sacrosanct for both patients and staff. I am not sure that a glass of wine at lunch is always such a good idea, and it is not something that I would recommend for staff.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08051564000166"></a>To return to nutrition, it is important to differentiate between starvation, which is food deprivation and results in death after days, weeks or months&#151;usually weeks or months&#151;and malnutrition, which occurs when there is a paucity of lean body mass that can exist for years and years undetected. The commonest form of malnutrition is protein energy under-nutrition where patients suffer from a lack of protein. The other big problem is dehydration, from which people die within days, irrespective of their nutritional status.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08051564000167"></a>I do not think nutrition and hydration should be lumped together without very careful thought. Chronic dehydration is the most common cause of clinical  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1138"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>deterioration in frail, elderly patients. Through poor perfusion of the kidney, patients slip into acute renal failure and, as a consequence, they do not excrete drugs very well. They often have other metabolic disturbances, become confused, drink less and enter a cycle of rapid decline. This process was dramatically seen in 2003 in the heat wave in Paris, where an estimated 15,000 mainly elderly people died. I am glad to see that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, is having a drink at the thought. Chronic dehydration is quite a big problem in our society. Urinary incontinence is common as people get older, afflicting about 40 per cent of women over the age of 40. People often think that if they drink less, they will leak less, so they tip into a downward spiral of chronic dehydration. That undermines their appetite, meaning that they do not eat well and have long-term poor nutrition. When they finally go into hospital, they are already malnourished.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08051564000168"></a>There are lots of reasons why people lose their appetite when they are ill, including the side effects of many drugs, a loss of taste, a loss of smell, the disease itself, depression and social isolation. Anorexia compounds a malnutrition that already exists and causes under-nutrition. Malnutrition is a really serious issue in our hospitals and increases the patient&#146;s risk of infection, affects the function and recovery of every organ system, increases the risk of pressure sores, extends the stay of patients in hospital and makes readmission more likely. Last year it was estimated that more than 130,000 patients were malnourished when they were admitted to hospital. That was an increase of 12 per cent on the previous year. The data for patients leaving hospital are no better, with estimates that malnutrition levels have risen by 85 per cent in the past 10 years to almost 140,000 patients last year. So the problem is not being addressed while they are in hospital, and indeed, many are only there for a short time. It seems that almost as many enter hospital malnourished as then leave hospital malnourished.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08051564000169"></a>These figures become even more worrying when you consider that malnutrition is undiagnosed in about 70 per cent of patients. It is difficult to diagnose because blood results become altered by disease processes, making interpretation difficult. Most worrying of all was the survey from Age Concern that reported that nine out of 10 nurses think that they do not have time to help patients who require assistance with eating. The Healthcare Commission&#146;s national survey of inpatients, as already referred to, reports 20 per cent of patients saying that they did not get enough help from staff to eat meals and another 20 per cent saying that they got enough help only some of the time. It seems from that survey that the quality of food is good but physical difficulties are just not being seen to.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08051564000170"></a>Malnutrition does not only affect the thin. On admission to hospital, many obese patients are severely malnourished. They have eaten badly for years and they lack the essential trace elements and nutrients to cope with their illness. So what is the answer to the problem? The five-step Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool is easy to use and has been validated in most patients&#146; groups. Furthermore, NICE has stated that every patient should undergo nutritional assessment and monitoring. I should like to ask the Minister how successfully the 2006 NICE guidelines have been taken  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1139"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1139</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>up in screening for malnutrition and whether she has any idea how many hospitals have audited their malnutrition screening and management processes.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08051564000171"></a>For most patients in hospital, loss of appetite is part of their disease process. They need encouragement to eat, with nutritional balance being presented in an appetising format. It has already been said that around 13 million perfectly good meals in hospital are thrown away of the 300 million meals prepared each year. This comes to around &#163;34 million of wasted food. Some of this is understandable&#151;for example, if the patient has gone home, died or deteriorated&#151;but if it is because the patient cannot feed themselves, then that wasted meal represents meal deprivation.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08051564000172"></a>Many patients have culturally diverse dietary habits, such as being used to eating highly spiced foods or very bland foods. Unfortunately, health and safety regulations seem to have been overinterpreted in many hospitals, so families are not encouraged, or even allowed, to bring in food for a patient, even when it would match the patient&#146;s appetite far better than the standard hospital fare. Health and safety regulations also get quoted when relatives want to use the microwave to heat up food. It seems that in some hospitals the only thing that you can get is toast, and the large number of times the fire alarm goes off means that toasters have been removed because of the bill when the fire brigade gets called out.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08051564000173"></a>Relatives are a wonderful resource at mealtimes, yet sadly they are often underused for patients and visiting hours sometimes actually exclude mealtimes. Nevertheless, families need to be taught about effective food intake and they may need to learn new feeding techniques for patients who, for example, have had head and neck surgery. Families themselves are keen. I am often asked, &#147;What should I give him or her to eat? What would be the right thing to prepare as food?&#148; Actually, for many patients, any food is good food. Eating is a social activity and it is so much easier to eat when others around you are eating with you. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, for referring to hospices, which have done a great deal to ensure that food is presented in a pleasant way, using volunteers to sit and encourage patients to eat. I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, who cited the University Hospital of Wales, where some years ago my own registrar did an audit and found an appalling number of times that meals were not within reach of patients; for example, meals being put on the disabled side of someone who had had a stroke. That has been picked up by management and addressed. I feel quite proud of what Wales has done to address nutrition in hospitals.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08051564000174"></a>So why do we not encourage more families to bring a snack in with them to eat? If you visit a hospital in India and many parts of the world, families are camped outside, preparing food for their relatives. Make no mistake, I am not advocating Primus stoves in the car parks, but I wonder whether we have gone a bit too far the other way and forgotten the interpersonal importance of meals. Eating with people around stimulates the appetite. In my own hospital in the cancer centre we have protected mealtimes. The patients get meals from an old-fashioned trolley and one of the advantages is that there is a nice smell to the food. Quite often the  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1140"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>patients&#146; food is a lot more appetising than the food that I find in the staff canteen. There is also help to encourage these patients to eat and patients can choose how much they want.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08051564000175"></a>What about those patients deemed unable to eat? A sign saying &#147;Nil by mouth&#148; is readily put up over a patient&#146;s bed and yet an assessment of their swallowing may not happen that day or, in fact, for some days. I wonder whether the Department of Health knows of a hospital that has audited their use of &#147;Nil by mouth&#148; signs for patients other than those who are going for an anaesthetic.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08051564000176"></a>When food is made on site and kitchen staff come to the wards and know that patients and relatives approve of and enjoy what they prepare, they become aware of how important their job is. That is something that can happen in small units, small hospitals or hospices and helps kitchen staff to value their job.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08051564000177"></a>Families really want to show love through feeding and often when the patient has lost their appetite or just cannot eat, families become very distressed. Even when someone is clearly dying, families still want to feed them. Let me illustrate this. Some years ago I was asked to visit the only son of a family of ice-cream makers. He was dying, could not swallow and was barely responsive to anything. His parents were understandably overwhelmingly distraught. His mother said that she could accept him dying of his disease, but not of starvation. After careful explanation of the risks, I put down a nasogastric tube there in the house so that she could feed him. After he died, his mother remained very grateful. Her comment to me when I met her some time later was, &#147;We put our best ice cream down the tube, so I know that he was still being fed and died of his disease&#148;. In reality he probably would have died at the same time, whatever I had done, but the family had to live with it afterwards. It just demonstrates how families want to be involved.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08051564000178"></a>When someone is clearly dying, investigations and treatment, including many drugs, become inappropriate and of course should be stopped. Trying to push nutrition becomes futile, but that does not mean that fluids become futile. Fluids can be given as sips by mouth, carefully and gently, to dying patients. However, some people need to have a drip. This can be done at home; patients do not have to be admitted to hospital. They can have a subcutaneous line put in through a tiny butterfly needle and a drip-bag hung from a picture-hook in the wall; indeed, I have done that myself. Then the district nurse can change the bag every 12 or 24 hours, which might be enough to maintain comfort.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08051564000179"></a>Nutrition is terribly important in people who are ill. It cannot be considered in isolation from all other aspects of patient care. I wonder how many hospital boards have nutrition as a specific item on their agenda. The attitude must improve at grass-roots level. It is a sad indictment of the professionals that we, as doctors and nurses, have failed to say, &#147;This is our responsibility&#148;. We have the resources of dieticians, but this is a core part of the clinical care of every patient. We must address the nutritional needs of every patient. If the professions address this, inappropriate blame will no longer be dumped at the Minister&#146;s door.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08051564000181"></a>The issue of food and medicine is not easy; it is quite complex. We have concentrated a lot today on the poor old NHS, but it is more complicated than that. I know a gentleman, a practitioner of complementary medicine, who told me about being in an Ayurvedic&#151;traditional Indian medicine&#151;hospital in southern India. He and a bunch of other students were being taken around by an Ayurvedic doctor. They stood by the bed of a very ill lady and were asked to make their diagnoses. As is often the case in groups of students, they tried to outdo each other with their smart diagnoses. They were all way off. The doctor said, &#147;No, what wrong with this lady is that she is starving. She needs some food. Once we do that, she will be fine&#148;.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08051564000182"></a>Equally, the story of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, made me think about an incident that I know of. A gentleman was admitted to a major American hospital because he had high levels of arsenic in his blood and, unsurprisingly, was feeling very ill. For the first few days in hospital, he showed a remarkable recovery, but then the arsenic levels kept going back up. It was something of a puzzle to the clinicians until they discovered that the cakes that his wife was bringing in to him were the source and part of her long-term plan to poison him and collect on his insurance. So relatives are not always good news.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08051564000183"></a>I was most interested to think about why so many people go into hospital malnourished. In a debate like this, it is important to say that things which happen in the community can always have an impact in acute hospitals. Many older people suffer malnutrition for two reasons, one of them alluded to by my noble friend Lord Roberts. Lots of older men, principally, think that kitchens are dangerous places into which one should never go. They do not know how to cook. They may eat&#151;rather well; they might go out to eat&#151;but can still end up malnourished, as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, said. Other people simply do not like eating on their own, and do not bother. We cut the funding to lunch clubs at our peril.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08051564000184"></a>Like the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, I too was interested in the article in the <I>BMJ</I> about malnourishment. As she said, 70 per cent of people with malnutrition in hospital are undiagnosed. Today, we have concentrated, perhaps understandably, on those who wind up, say, in surgical wards and so on for some time. The noble Baroness is right that people who are in hospital for a long time often suffer the most. The people who are in hospitals most are those with mental health problems. We would do well to remember that when people are receiving compulsory mental health treatment, they are often being given very toxic drugs, the side effects of which are often to make them put on weight and so on. It would be understandable if, in those circumstances, people were reluctant to eat. We should not confine ourselves to looking at this in terms of physical health.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08051564000186"></a>The article in the <I>BMJ</I> alluded to the fact that clinicians can use quite a number of different practices, such as the MUST&#151;malnutrition universal screening tool&#151;that has been devised. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, that the Social Care Institute for Excellence has also gathered together a number of different models&#151;not just red trays, but having knife-and-fork symbols by people&#146;s beds. Crucially, the Alzheimer&#146;s Society has produced a training video to enable staff, without being patronising, to deal with people who cannot eat. Sometimes being fed can be a very undignified process if it is not done properly.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08051564000187"></a>A strong point made in the <I>BMJ</I> editorial was that nutritional support should be an enforceable requirement, and universal throughout the health system. Nutritional support should be on a par with how medication is treated within the health service. Additionally, the <I>BMJ</I> article made the worthwhile point that nutrition should be recognised as a discrete discipline which all medical graduates ought to have studied to a basic level. I understand that a formal sub-group of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has established a course on human nutrition, which is mandatory if you are to go into certain medical disciplines, particularly gastroenterology and metabolic medicine. However, as we have heard today, nutrition is important across a whole range of conditions: cancer treatment, cardiology and diabetes.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08051564000188"></a>I do not wish to go over many of the points which other people have made, but the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, talked about the scheme at the Royal Brompton Hospital. I was intrigued to discover how that change in its food regime came about. Its new director of catering discovered that it was serving people with food that had absolutely no food whatsoever in it. It had no nutritional value at all and was made up just of colouring, which prompted that big rethink.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08051564000189"></a>The NHS is a major purchaser of food in this country. It purchases 300 million meals, so it has a role to play in developing sustainability. The scheme that I read about and was impressed by was that of the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, which, in conjunction with the Soil Association, has gone through a process of growing, buying and sourcing its food locally. That has meant a great increase in locally produced and organic food, which has helped not only with nutritional standards in its hospitals but with the health economy of that area.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08051564000190"></a>There were some really interesting examples of what that trust had done. The noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, talked about powdered, nutritional drinks, which I know are important as I have relatives who are alive because of their availability. Yet the Royal Cornwall, in its scheme, looked at using locally made clotted cream ice-cream for people who needed calorific intake. Let us be honest; who, given the choice, would go for the powdered milk drink in that circumstance?</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1143"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80515-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08051564000191"></a>Having a whole strategy of concentrating on locally produced fruit, vegetables, eggs and milk has made an enormous difference there, and has been achieved within the budget of &#163;2.50 per patient per day. That is the trust&#146;s rough figure for expenditure on patients. More than that, it has managed a 67 per cent reduction in food miles, which has to help the environment. Although that may be a return to the days of 1947, when the health service started, there is much to be said for it as an approach for the whole NHS. Indeed, other hospitals, in addition to the Royal Brompton, are beginning to do the same.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08051564000192"></a>I want to pick up on two other points that people have made during this debate. Noble Lords have talked about the use of volunteers, and I understand their wish to do so. It is, obviously, preferable that a volunteer spends their time rather than a highly skilled medic, but I caution your Lordships that the use of volunteers should be additional. Important here is making sure that food and nutrition takes a more central place throughout all NHS processes&#151;from governance to management and right through to practice. Never mind what the Healthcare Commission does; if the board of the trust will not eat the food in a hospital, that is the biggest indicator anybody needs. We need to see the role of food becoming much more central in medicine.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08051564000193"></a>Finally, I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay; as ever, the French have much to show us in the area of food. I would not take on everything that they do as an approach&#151;giving pregnant women red wine seems uniquely French&#151;but in the French health system, it is realised what a role food plays in patients&#146; recovery and in the maintenance of good health. With the National Health Service, we really should be able to take some of their best practice and adopt it.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08051564000195"></a>Malnutrition in hospital is no longer a subject relying on anecdote or hearsay in order to prove its existence. The hard evidence for it is unfortunately all too abundant, as we have heard from all speakers&#151;it is not simply the findings of occasional consumer surveys but the hard data collected by trusts and government agencies, all of which tell the same story. As my noble friend said, we are talking about wards and hospitals where the food is unappetising, unsuitable, insufficient or inaccessible&#151;sometimes all four. It is right to pay tribute to Ministers, particularly Mr Ivan Lewis, for the frank way in which they have  acknowledged the scale and gravity of the problem. That acknowledgement is surely the first step towards solving it.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08051564000196"></a>Of course, things are not all terrible. There are shining examples of good practice, such as the Royal Brompton, which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, described, serves wonderful, fresh organic food as well  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1144"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as additive-free, gluten-free and low-fat food for those who need it. As we have heard, hospitals in Cornwall serve locally sourced food so delicious that one almost sees people who are perfectly well queueing up to eat it, while the Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals NHS Trust also sets a fine example&#151;I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Wall, on her part in bringing that about. Yet inevitably it is bad practice on which much of the focus rests. That is as it should be, because serving unappetising or inadequate food in a health service that professes to be world-class should be enough to eliminate you in round one of the competition.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08051564000197"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, gave us the statistics. In the 10 years to 2006-07, the number of people admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of undernutrition has gone up from 70,000 to 130,000, an increase of 85 per cent&#151;and those are only the people whom we know about, because by no means all hospitals screen patients for malnutrition as they are supposed to do. NICE guidance recommends that all patients should be screened for nutritional risk on admission to hospital. However, NICE itself has estimated that only about 30 per cent of patients are screened and a recent survey by the British Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition found that more than one in 10 hospitals did not have a nutrition screening policy in place.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08051564000198"></a>The Age Concern campaign &#147;Hungry to be Heard&#148; highlights, among other things, the greatly increased prevalence of malnutrition among hospital patients over 80 compared to those under 50, which chimes in well with what we heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay. In many of those people malnutrition is often not identified. The most shameful fact of all is that more people are discharged from hospital in a malnourished state than are admitted. Those figures are an indictment not only of the care given in certain hospitals but of the way in which malnutrition goes unrecognised in the community.</p>

<a name="80515-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08051564000199"></a>The strange thing is that hospitals have every reason in the world to make sure that patients are properly fed. The effects of malnutrition are well documented and we have heard many of them today. They are prolonged bed occupancy, delayed recovery, an increased risk of contracting healthcare-associated infections and poor respiratory function. In some studies, undernourished patients are estimated to have a mortality rate up to eight times higher than that for well nourished patients, yet that condition is relatively easy to diagnose.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80515-0006.htm"/>


<a name="80515-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08051564000200"></a>The malnutrition universal screening tool, or MUST, which the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, mentioned, is available for healthcare professionals&#146; use. Once hospital patients are identified as being at risk, they can be supported in their nutritional needs by a variety of measures. Some are simple: noble Lords have mentioned red tray schemes and protected mealtimes. Specially formulated foods can also be taken by mouth or tube. Once the diagnosis is made, as long as there is good nursing, the tools and remedies are there.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08051564000201"></a>After doing very little for a number of years, the Government have now, to their credit, taken some useful steps, not least in publishing the nutrition action plan in October last year. The implementation of the  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1145"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>plan is being overseen by the Nutrition Action Plan Delivery Board, which includes dieticians and representatives of charities, CSCI and the Healthcare Commission. That is all very positive, except that, as I understand it, the board is going to exist only until December 2008 before being wound up. If that is so, it would be helpful to hear from the Minister what, if anything, is going to replace it.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08051564000202"></a>Nutritional care is also prioritised in the core standards monitored by the Healthcare Commission. Core standard C15b shows that an individual&#146;s nutritional, personal and clinical dietary requirements are being met. That ought to ensure that we know exactly how good or bad the picture is. Unfortunately, it is not quite like that, because hospitals are left to assess themselves on how well they are doing in adhering to the standard. The reliability of self-assessment is seriously questionable: in 2006-07, none of the 34 NHS trusts that discharged the highest number of patients in an undernourished state failed the Healthcare Commission&#146;s core standard C15b.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08051564000203"></a>A similar point could be made about overreliance on what patients say. The noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, said in last week&#146;s Grand Committee debate on the Health and Social Care Bill that the Government are tackling undernutrition through the NHS operating framework, which now takes account of the patient experience. The patient experience is important, but I question whether in this context it tells us much. Many people at risk of undernutrition are not going to know it or will be unable, or too frightened, to report that they have had a bad experience. There are 63 targets flowing from the operating framework, classified into tier 1, tier 2 and tier 3. Nutrition is not listed in any of them. I find that extraordinary. I am no fan of having too many targets, but the tier 3 indicators are designed essentially as internal management tools and nutrition could easily have been included in them. I ask the Minister why it was not. I am advised that there is a readily available published indicator that could act as a good proxy for the quality of nutritional care commissioned by PCTs, but it is not made use of.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08051564000204"></a>There are other missed opportunities. One of them relates, again, to nutritional screening. Even though screening is one of the most basic tools in nutritional care, historically the Government have not collected data on how many hospitals actually do it. That changed last year when, for the first time, the National Patient Safety Agency asked each hospital whether it nutritionally screened all its patients. Do we have the results of that questionnaire? No, because this component of the inspection was aggregated into a more general score about the quality of hospital food. The various components of the score, we are told, cannot be disaggregated. I ask the Minister why the basic data about screening have apparently been destroyed and whether she will use her good offices to ensure that the NPSA does not do the same thing again this year. The information would be useful for commissioners in performance-managing their providers.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08051564000205"></a>However, we know from the NPSA that the uptake of screening in hospital is often hindered by lack of equipment, such as weighing scales. It is also hindered by less tangible but equally serious things such as a  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1146"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>lack of leadership at ward level, a lack of staff training and a culture that does not place enough importance on the weighing of patients. I was heartened to read the brief sent to me by the Royal College of Nursing, which brings home how seriously it is confronting the issue of malnutrition and how much emphasis it is placing on nurse training and education in this area. This field is likely to become ever more sophisticated as hospital treatment becomes more complex, not least in areas such as intensive care, kidney disease and cancer, where the needs of patients can be very specialised.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08051564000206"></a>I hope that the Minister will agree that the Government, the Healthcare Commission, the NPSA and, when it arrives, the Care Quality Commission need to keep their eye on the ball. There is a good case for conducting a national audit. We simply cannot have an NHS that fails to recognise and treat a condition as basic as malnutrition. When we return to this issue in future, as I do not doubt we will, we must all hope that the efforts that so many people are now making to improve nutritional care in the NHS will have resulted in some visible and substantial progress.</p>

I agree with noble Lords that we owe her a debt of gratitude for her determination to keep this issue up the agenda, and she is right that only by constant vigilance will improvement be achieved.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08051564000208"></a>The nutrition of hospital patients, so clearly described by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, has been a major concern for this Government. We know that malnutrition predisposes individuals to disease, delays recovery and impacts negatively on clinical outcomes, personal health and well being. It also impacts on the length of stay, delays discharge or transfer and causes enormous distress if not got right. It is therefore something that hospitals must get right.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08051564000209"></a>We know that in the general population people over 65 are at higher risk of malnutrition and that this risk can be increased when people are living in institutional settings or at home alone. This means that some patients will be malnourished when they are admitted to hospital, as many noble Lords mentioned. Poor nutrition can also arise when responsibility is diffuse and when there is a lack of integrated infrastructure within hospitals and between healthcare organisations.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08051564000210"></a>It is tempting to hark back to the good old days, but we should not fall prey to the myth that this is a recent problem brought about by a &#147;generation of uncaring nurses&#148;. The noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, reminded us of the history and the challenges that nurses have faced over time. Many studies dating back to the 1950s show that nurses struggled with the same issues then as they do now. A 1963 study that examined food intakes in 153 hospitals reported that the preparation, cooking and service of food was regarded as a second-rate activity, an unfortunate necessity and an inconvenient intrusion into the real work of the ward. There was no excuse for poor nutritional care then and there is none now. We should not fall prey to the idea that this is a  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1147"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>recent problem. Feeding an anorexic or confused patient or one who cannot swallow is extremely difficult and ensuring adequate food consumption can sometimes feel impossible. It is easy to identify poor care, but we should not underestimate how difficult good care can be. We may call it &#147;basic care&#148;, but it is anything but simple, as has been recognised by several noble Lords.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08051564000211"></a>We know that there have been some significant achievements in improving nutrition. That can be seen in the HCC adult in-patient survey referred to by my noble friend in which 54 per cent of respondents rated the food as good or very goodand just over three-quarters of respondents&#151;79 per cent&#151;were always offered a choice of hospital food. However, despite the sterling efforts of dedicated catering and care staff and increased staffing levels on the frontline of care, reports from key organisation such as Help the Aged, in its <I>Hungry to Be Heard</I> report in 2007, and observations from patients and visitors show that there is still more to do.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08051564000212"></a>I shall mention some of the things that we are doing. Patient environment action teams now evaluate the quality of hospital food every year. The Better Hospital Food programme introduced 24-hour availability of food, snack boxes and daily snacks and, in partnership with the Royal College of Nursing and the British Dietetic Association, introduced protected mealtimes to create an oasis of calm where unnecessary activity gives way to allow patients and staff to concentrate on enjoying good food.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08051564000213"></a>In 2001 we launched the &#147;Essence of Care&#148; benchmarking toolkit for frontline practitioners to evaluate aspects of the care given to patients. Food and nutrition were identified, unsurprisingly, as among the first fundamental areas of care to be benchmarked. That has had a big impact on the quality of care that patients receive, including nutritional screening of patients on admission to hospital, regular weight monitoring for at-risk patients, and discreet ways of identifying patients for extra assistance by means of coloured trays.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08051564000214"></a>Last October we published the nutrition action plan &#147;Improving Nutritional Care&#148;, which is monitored by a delivery board chaired by Gordon Lishman of Age Concern. The board&#146;s work is progressing very well and the chair is due to report in the summer, as part of the mid-year progress update, to my honourable friend Ivan Lewis, Minister for Care Services, on how far the plan has been implemented. I thank the noble Earl for his remarks about my honourable friend&#146;s commitment. Indeed, he has shown great determination in taking this issue forward. As a result of all this activity, statistics are improving, although I absolutely acknowledge that there is still a way to go. The PEAT assessments show year-on-year improvement since 2002, so we have much on which to congratulate NHS staff. I take this opportunity to thank hard-working doctors, nurses and other health professionals for helping to bring about these welcome improvements.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08051564000215"></a>However, we are not content to rest here; of course we are not. There is still work to do. Having installed what we hope will be a robust framework for raising the quality of food for patients, we have turned our attention to how we can make sure that they eat it, and in sufficient amounts to ensure that they are well nourished. While this is not entirely a nursing  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1148"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>responsibility, good healthcare is always a team effort, as referred to by my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley. I know that nurses consider the nutrition of patients a central tenet of their work, so much so that the Nursing and Midwifery Council has included this as an essential core skill, which all nurses must master before being admitted to the register.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08051564000216"></a>We have heard today that events can conspire to prevent patients getting the help they need at the right time. We must help our nursing staff to fulfil the key role of ensuring that all patients have the food and drink they need. My noble friend Lady Wall has described the model in her hospital. I congratulate her and agree that that hospital is not alone in this excellence. However, it is totally unacceptable that any patient in our NHS hospitals should go without food they can eat when they want it, or that untouched food goes unnoticed and is not acted on. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, in her praise of the Royal Brompton Hospital. We cannot underestimate the importance of food and drink in aiding recovery. That is why proper nutrition of patients remains high on our agenda. I was struck by the perceptive remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, about the mentally ill and the problems faced by accident and emergency departments. I remember being in an accident and emergency department at 3 am with one of my children, thinking that I was about to expire with hunger. If I were diabetic that would, indeed, be a huge problem.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08051564000217"></a>Turning to further activity, we are now working with SHAs to roll out the Productive Ward: Releasing Time to Care programme, which encourages staff to review the ward environment and working practices to find ways of releasing time to spend on patients. Ministers have visited wards involved in the scheme, and have been impressed by the improvements that they have seen. This is being led by the nurses and sisters on those wards, with front-line staff finding that by making such small changes as altering patient handover times, reorganising storage facilities, and making better use of data, they can double the time that can be spent with patients, reduce time spent on paperwork, improve the accuracy of patient observation and minimise food wastage. The vital component of this programme is that is inspired and led by those nurses who are implementing the changes. The Secretary of State announced on 8 May that &#163;50 million is to be made available to enable all patients in all wards, across the NHS, to benefit.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08051564000218"></a>Nurses have to find time to nurse. We are trying to reduce unnecessary pressures on them, but this is not all. We realise that one of the most important factors in improving nutritional standards for patients is what they are actually fed. We have to make sure that nurses and staff providing direct care have the skills and knowledge they need; the leadership to help them; are there in sufficient numbers to meet the needs of patients; and can access the support they need from others. My noble friend Lord Darzi is leading a programme on how we can maximise the contribution nurses make to the quality of care. This will strengthen nurse leadership so that such issues as patient nutrition become a matter for all. I will raise the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, to ensure that they have been included in the noble Lord&#146;s survey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08051564000219"></a>I move now to some of the points raised by noble Lords. The noble Baroness, Lady Knight, raised the issue of patients saying that they have not been fed. I apologise if she felt that that the response of the Chief Nursing Officer, and Ian Phillips, who reviewed the investigations into the allegations, were not satisfactory. I have also reviewed that correspondence. I suggest to the noble Baroness that we meet and review it together, to make sure that she is satisfied. If she is not, I undertake to raise those issues again. The noble Baroness also raised the issue of patients leaving hospital in a worse state than they were in when they went in, as did the noble Earl, Lord Howe. Patients have a diagnosis recorded on admission and every time they see a new consultant. If they do not have a separate diagnosis recorded on discharge it means that doctors have built up a picture of a patient&#146;s illness during their stay, so the last diagnosis may record something that has not been picked up earlier. It does not necessarily mean that that condition developed as a result of their care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08051564000220"></a>I undertake to look into the issue raised by the noble Earl and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, of the NICE guidelines and how effectively they are being rolled out. That is a legitimate area of concern. I also undertake to find out whether it is possible to disaggregate the information to which the noble Earl referred. We have to emphasise the importance of screening for nutritional needs on admission. That is absolutely right. Identifying a nutritional problem is the first step towards solving it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08051564000221"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Knight, and the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, raised the issue of nursing support for eating and drinking. It is important to remind noble Lords that the level of trust in nurses&#146; competence remains extremely high at 96 per cent. When patients were asked whether they received enough help from staff to eat their meals, 79 per cent said &#147;always&#148; or &#147;sometimes&#148;. That is an improved figure, but is certainly not good enough. It means that 21 per cent possibly did not feel that, which is a large number of patients. I accept that.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08051564000222"></a>There is little that I need to add about how the red tray system works. I apologise that it was not explained to the noble Baroness when she heard it for the first time. My noble friend Lady Wall has given us an adequate explanation of how the red tray system works and how it is helping to improve patient feeding. My noble friend Lady Pitkeathley raised the issue of the Better Hospital Food programme. I was pleased to hear mention of the value of housekeepers in supporting patients to eat. This, along with the other improvements of the Better Hospital Food programme, has made a real difference.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08051564000223"></a>Central initiatives can go only so far. Funding previously allocated centrally is now being passed to the NHS to allow it to develop the services that are right at local level. Several noble Lords mentioned volunteering. The noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, and the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, all mentioned it.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, also mentioned volunteering. I am pleased to say to all those noble Lords that we fully support the proposals raised in the Age Concern report about the use of volunteers. They perform an important role, not only in helping patients to eat, but in keeping them connected to life outside the hospital. My noble friend Lady Pitkeathley and the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, both referred to the wide variation in the surveys about helping people to eat. This is not acceptable, and the worst definitely have to learn from the best.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08051564000226"></a>Noble Lords who have been with me in the Grand Committee considering the Health and Social Care Bill will be aware that the draft registration requirements for the new Care Quality Commission, which are under consultation at the moment, include at point 5:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="08051564000529"></a>&#147;Ensure, where meeting nutritional needs is part of the service, that people have access to safe and sufficient nourishment. This includes: the provision of support for eating, drinking or feeding where required; the provision of a sufficient choice of palatable food to meet religious or cultural needs; and the prevention of harm through lack of access to sufficient nutrition and hydration&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000509"></a>That final point was mentioned by the noble Baroness. That requirement, or a version of it, will be part of the registration that the new Care Quality Commission will establish.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08051564000227"></a>My noble friend Lady Pitkeathley was right to mention the issue of food in care homes. It is important that people in care homes also get good food. That is why we have included a representative from this sector in the nutritional action plan.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08051564000228"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, referred to the cost of food. I am constantly impressed&#151;this was borne out by the story told by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, and my noble friend Lady Wall&#151;about the high quality of food that so many hospitals manage to produce on a relatively small budget. Indeed, the Audit Commission 2002 found that there is no relationship between spending on food and its quality. It showed that excellence can be achieved within the current budgets; it is to do with the will to do it and the leadership to produce it.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08051564000229"></a>Several noble Lords referred to the issue of screening for nutritional needs on admission. More than 80 per cent of trusts have a policy for nutrition screening. This includes attention to food needs, such as vegetarianism and wheat-free, and issues such as dentures. It includes an assessment of the nutritional state, including weight and recent weight loss.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08051564000230"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, raised an issue about the past. She mentioned that wards are closed at lunch-time&#151;this was also mentioned by my noble friend Lady Wall&#151;which shows that a modern hospital is also now adopting the system of closing wards, and quite right to.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08051564000231"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, and other noble Lords raised the issue of the quality of hospital food. The Better Hospital Food programme has accomplished some very specific things: it has made sure that food is available around the clock, including snacks at all times; it has ensured that modern dishes are introduced alongside traditional ones; it has ensured that patients   


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1151"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can choose a hot meal in the evenings; it has ensured that meals have been redesigned, using better ingredients to improve their flavour and nutritional content.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08051564000232"></a>On the issue of relatives bringing in food, the NHS strives to provide food suitable for all&#151;it is one of the central planks of the Better Hospital Food programme&#151;but we should not assume that it is always a bad thing for friends and relatives to bring in food. When staff and family are working together they are able to provide a truly personalised service.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08051564000233"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, referred to the problem of dehydration in healthcare, which is important. The National Patient Safety Agency, with the Royal College of Nursing and the Hospital Caterers Association, launched a hydration best practice toolkit in September last year and support a hydration best practice award, which this year was won by the Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08051564000234"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, also raised the issue of protein energy malnutrition and its effect on recovery. We know that a malnourished patient takes longer to recover and a recent screening survey by the British Association of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition shows that more than a quarter of patients are at risk from malnutrition when admitted, and the number is even higher among older patients. There are many reasons why sick people become malnourished, as so eloquently described by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08051564000235"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, mentioned the implementation of NICE guidelines, which provide a clear set of instructions to inform clinical care. Although we do not audit them directly from the centre, we have a strong system for holding the NHS to account. This shows how seriously we take this issue.</p>

<a name="80515-0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08051564000236"></a>I have covered many, but not all, of the points raised. I shall write to noble Lords on the issues that I have not mentioned. Perhaps I may say in winding up that, without the staff, good intentions remain at the hospital gates. We have increased the number of staff working in the NHS, especially in nursing. There has been an increase of more than 25 per cent since 1997.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08051564000237"></a>I should like to finish by speaking very briefly about the multidisciplinary team and the contribution of the allied health professionals mentioned by my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley. As I said earlier, feeding patients is not solely a nursing responsibility. Dieticians assess patients and design treatment plans that may involve modified diets and nutritional supplements; speech and language therapists may need to assess whether patients can swallow; and occupational therapists may need to assess whether patients need adapted cutlery. Together with physiotherapists they can advise on the correct positioning of patients and equipment. This multiprofessional approach to feeding supports nurses to feed patients and identifies patients at risk of malnutrition. These are real, positive improvements for those in our care. We shall not stop in our efforts to secure the very best for our patients&#151;whether in numbers, working practices, paperwork, knowledge, skills and leadership&#151;so that no one leaves our care malnourished physically or mentally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08051564000239"></a>I thank everyone who has spoken in the debate. I have been struck by the fact that, in a small way, the debate is indicative of the service that this House gives to the country. What we do, on the Back Benches and outside, we do for nothing&#151;we receive no kind of pay&#151;and yet we have in this Chamber a wonderful collection of knowledge and experience through the people who serve the House. We have heard some wonderful speeches, particularly from the noble Baronesses, Lady Emerton and Lady Finlay. Between them they have so much knowledge of being a doctor in the present health service and being a nurse for many years and seeing so much. The House is grateful for what they have said. The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, who is perhaps one of the favourites on all sides of the House, spoke from her experience and her knowledge.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08051564000240"></a>I particularly thank the noble Baroness, Lady Wall. My complaint about that part of my dossier was that the words &#147;red tray&#148; were written without the slightest indication of what they meant. I am not a nurse or a doctor&#151;I never have been&#151;and I needed an explanation for any of it to make sense. It was that kind of attitude towards the complaints I made that prompted me to go on and make sure that the complaints go through. Without the knowledge of Members such as the noble Baroness, Lady Wall, and the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, who knows and visits his hospitals, we would have been much poorer in the debate today. I am most grateful.</p>

My mind goes back only a very short time&#151;perhaps two or three months&#151;to when the Minister in the other place, who has already been referred to and complimented, said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08051564000245"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am delighted, after several months of effort, to have secured this debate. It is only proper to say that the timing is absolutely relevant to negotiations that are taking place or will shortly take place at the United Nations in New York. There is a long history of attempts to achieve some sort of control of the arms trade. I do not want to go into the details of that except to say that if ever there was a time when this was particularly important it is now.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08051564000246"></a>The British Government have done well but there is a need to push even harder to achieve the outcome that is wanted&#151;a fully comprehensive arms trade treaty. A few years ago, we signed up to the Ottawa treaty on anti-personnel landmines, which was an important breakthrough. Next week, a conference on cluster munitions will start in Dublin; I hope that a comprehensive treaty to ban cluster munitions will be signed there. Many eyes are on the United Kingdom Government because support for such a treaty by our Government will put us in a much stronger position to persuade other countries to adopt a proper international arms trade treaty.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08051564000247"></a>Having said that, there is an awful lot of support already: 153 states have signed a resolution in support, with only the United States voting against, although there were important abstentions, including Russia, China, India and Pakistan. The United States apparently claims that it has sufficiently tight controls over its arms trade not to need to take part in an international treaty; I entirely reject that proposition. It is&#151;I hope that the Government will listen to this&#151;important to use all methods of persuasion on the Governments who are currently blocking progress towards a treaty. It is also important to gain maximum support from the Governments of the south, whose people have all too often been the victims of uncontrolled arms sales.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08051564000248"></a>There are currently no effective global legally binding controls on the arms trade. There are a number of poorly enforced regional agreements which are easily evaded by the unscrupulous arms dealers that are proliferating. There can be no doubt, therefore, about the need for such a treaty. It is estimated that 1,000 people a day are killed as a result of armed conflicts in the world. Many others are tortured and forced to flee their homes or even their countries. My contention is that many of these deaths and other tragic events would be significantly reduced if there was a proper treaty controlling the arms trade.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08051564000249"></a>The world is currently awash with arms&#151;there are more than ever before. There are unscrupulous countries or arms dealers who are seeking to make money out of this trade. Let me give one or two examples. The most well known is the recent incident concerning the shipment of arms to Zimbabwe from China. Fortunately, the dockers in South Africa refused to unload the ship and its whereabouts are currently unknown. It is still possible it will seek to find the shore somewhere where these arms can be unloaded. It is perfectly clear that those arms, if they get to the Government of Zimbabwe, would only be used against their own people. Surely that is part of the basis of seeking to have a treaty.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08051564000250"></a>Let me quote a few other examples; if there are any doubts about this process, examples certainly sharpen  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1154"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>one&#146;s mind to it. I am grateful to Amnesty International for some of the very diligent documentation that it has produced. I turn to the Democratic Republic of Congo. In July 2005 it was revealed that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051564000534"></a>&#147;large quantities of weapons and ammunition from the Balkans and eastern Europe were flowing into Africa&#146;s conflict-ridden Great Lakes region, despite evidence of their use in gross human rights violations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000535"></a>Let us examine this. Amnesty has revealed that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051564000536"></a>&#147;arms dealers, brokers and transporters from many countries&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000537"></a>have played a part in this trade. These countries include,</p>
<ul><a name="08051564000538"></a>&#147;Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Israel, Russia, Serbia, South Africa&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000539"></a>the United States and the UK. I am not saying the British Government did that or that the arms left Britain. However, by quoting Amnesty, I am saying that arms dealers and brokers, who may be British operating but elsewhere, have taken part in this trade. It also mentioned a particular Russian arms trafficker who, with his close associates and using local operators, has secretly armed all sides in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08051564000251"></a>In Rwanda, there have been hundreds of tonnes of, </p>
<ul><a name="08051564000540"></a>&#147;mostly surplus Kalashnikov ammunition shipped from Albania and Serbia to Rwanda with the involvement of Israeli, Rwandan, South African and indeed UK companies between the end of 2002 and mid 2003&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000511"></a>There are other examples from Rwanda.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08051564000252"></a>There are apparently arms-for-diamonds agreements involving the Democratic Republic of Congo Government and companies in the Czech Republic, Israel and Ukraine. One can go on.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08051564000253"></a>I turn briefly to Uganda. The Ugandan Government have apparently failed,</p>
<ul><a name="08051564000541"></a>&#147;to report to the UN imports of weapons and ammunition from Croatia and Slovakia worth over US$1 million in 2002 ... Donations of military vehicles from China in 2002 and attempts by the Ugandan government to import more arms from Israel in 2003&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000254"></a>also apparently took place. There is also evidence that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051564000542"></a>&#147;the Ugandan military authorities repeatedly supplied arms, ammunition and military support to armed opposition groups in the eastern DRC&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80515-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08051564000255"></a>I want to quote two more examples. There is evidence that Russian-supplied weapons were deployed in Darfur by the Sudanese Government and there is a wealth of evidence about Myanmar&#151;a country that is facing a tragic situation as regards its own people and the consequence of the monsoon. Many countries have supplied arms to Myanmar: China, Russia, India, Serbia and Ukraine. It is perfectly clear that the Myanmar Government are using these arms to suppress their own people. That is the reason they have them and that is surely a very clear reason why we should not be party to supplying them; no country should. I am not saying that we are supplying them but we should not be part of a world where these things happen.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08051564000256"></a>I am not against arms industries per se, provided that they are responsible and properly controlled for defence, policing, peacekeeping and other legitimate purposes. The important thing is there should be agreed criteria that should be the basis of how an arms trade might operate and therefore prevent the rather nasty examples that I have quoted.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1155"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1155</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80515-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08051564000257"></a>I propose the following suggestions. States should not authorise international transfers of conventional arms or ammunition where they are likely to have one of the following five consequences: first, where they may be used or be likely to be used for gross violations of international human rights law or serious violations of international humanitarian law; secondly, they should not be authorised where they would have an impact that would clearly undermine sustainable development or involve corrupt practices; thirdly, they should not be authorised where they would provoke or exacerbate armed conflict in violation of obligations under the UN charter and existing treaties; fourthly, arms exports should not contribute to an existing pattern of violent crime; and, finally, there should be no risk that these arms exports might be diverted to one or other of the outcomes I have mentioned or indeed for acts of terrorism. Some of the difficulties are that arms sales may be made to a country that seems okay and then they are diverted from that country for other purposes. That involves real seepage and we need pretty tight controls to avoid that.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08051564000258"></a>It is important that any treaty should cover all aspects of international arms transfers, including import, export, transit, transhipment, overseas production and arms-broking activities. It is not good enough for a company owned, say, in a country that is prepared to sign up to a treaty to have an operation in breach of the treaty elsewhere. It has to be pretty tight. The scope of such a treaty should cover all conventional weapons, ammunition, components and, indeed, the technological skills which would assist other countries in making or developing such weapons or ammunition.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08051564000259"></a>It is also important that the treaty should apply not only to Governments but to non-state organisations. Some of the examples that I cited&#151;no doubt there are many others&#151;will reveal that the seepage of arms and ammunition to non-state organisations is a serious cause of many deaths and conflicts. We must be clear that a treaty would be not only between Governments; it would also cover non-state organisations. It is crucial that any treaty should be tight enough to prevent loopholes. I appreciate that it is difficult; there are arms dealers who can evade controls and who know how to work the system, such that Governments have to be particular to catch them. We need a treaty which is not just all right on the face of it but is binding and effective.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08051564000260"></a>In conclusion, I thank the NGOs and others who have been helpful in providing information not only to me but to colleagues. It is perfectly clear that there is an urgent need for an international arms trade treaty which is effectively enforced. I believe that the Government have a key role to play in getting such a treaty agreed by as many countries as possible. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

When I spoke last time about his wonderful suggestion about pardoning people who were in the First World War, I was almost crying&#151;my eyes were welling up&#151;because I was thinking  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1156"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about life and death. That is the subject I shall speak on today, without being in conflict with what the noble Lord has proposed.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08051564000262"></a>If we are talking about defence and the arms trade, ultimately we are talking about human life and human death. It is appropriate that much of this revolves around the subject of the previous debate&#151;food. People fight for food. I was brought up to go back to the past, and I return again to my grandfather, who was the director of restriction of enemy supplies during the First World War. If you are selling arms, where is the enemy? Who is attacking whom, and how long has this been going on? What worries me is that it is not the arms trade that is killing people; it is not the war from without but the war from within. Whether it is a case of one tribe fighting to eliminate another or death by starvation, I do not really know.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08051564000263"></a>When I was a young boy at the end of the war, the one thing I loved more than any other was my sheath knife. I could throw it into the middle of a circle on a soft redwood tree. I loved that knife. I even tried to kill a rabbit once by throwing the knife at it. Naturally, I cut myself many times. This made me go back to the origins of the knife&#151;the knife in the back, the knife which is the origin of almost all wars&#151;to the panga and the machete. I was a great fan of the machete, which was perhaps the most effective weapon that man had ever seen, other than, of course, the khukri of the Gurkhas. When our Armed Forces were trying to take over or extend the empire, and they had just managed to replace their muskets with the bayonet&#151;which came from the French city of Bayonne&#151;they got rid of the club on the base of the musket. They were not using knobkieris any more, or even baseball bats or pickaxe handles. But the Gurkha learnt about the bayonets and, with his khukri, he would advance upon our soldiers, dive down under the bayonet and do them in by taking their limbs off.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08051564000264"></a>This strange weapon, this piece of metal, was responsible for the genocide in Rwanda. Fear, to me, is the greatest enemy of all. I have been to most of the African countries and some others where there have been trouble and conflict and I find that what is feared is not the bullets that come from outside or the RPGs or the mortars, but the man on foot coming in, beating you up, killing or raping your wife and causing damage in that way.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08051564000265"></a>What is the purpose of the arms trade if it is not to defend human life? Perhaps it is related more to conquest, territorial gain or protection. The despotic and non-despotic regimes of the world usually have one thing in common, whether they are imperial or colonial&#151;they do not have that many deaths. The deaths seem to occur when the stability of the regime breaks up. If that regime is dictatorial, as has been the case in many countries, where the enemy or the opponents are wiped out, it often goes back to the conflicts before boundaries between tribes were clearly defined. There was the phrase, &#147;The host took the field and there were no survivors&#148;. Naturally, you would kill every man over the age of 15 and under 60, but you would take the tribe into your own and increase your strength.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08051564000266"></a>I find it extremely sad that we have not bothered to estimate the number of deaths that are taking place.  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1157"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1157</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, pointed to the arms problem regarding Zimbabwe. Is it not terrifying that the leader of a former Commonwealth country can, when a democratic situation has arisen, threaten to send in a form of unarmed brigade to frighten people at the polls? That ability to frighten may help to destroy a form of democracy.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08051564000267"></a>I spent a lot of time in eastern and central Europe and should like for a moment to dwell on one of my favourite countries, Albania, whose alphabet has 50 per cent more letters than ours and whose people are highly intelligent. I was asked to go there&#151;I always get a bum steer but I became very fond of it. When I arrived I was put in a government villa and slept in a bed where a rather strange looking lady wearing one laddered stocking and a sock on the other foot showed me, with pride, that I was sleeping in the bed of Enver Hoxha. That was where the bullet had gone through and that was the very sheet upon which he had slept.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08051564000268"></a>Yet, during the war, the godfather of the noble Lord, Lord Astor, was actually in Albania protecting Enver Hoxha and blowing up bridges. There is another interesting thing about the Albanians, which is possibly why they were so active in the arms trade. In order to remain united, they had to create fear of the regime. That is normal policy in any form of government&#151;to be frightened of the Prime Minister or the president. That has never happened in this country. But then you have to create fear of an enemy which will unite the country. With Albania, the enemy was the United States of America. To defend themselves from the United States of America, they had 600,000 bunkers scattered throughout Albania in vineyards and everywhere else, looking rather like large Daleks from &#147;Doctor Who&#148;. In the front there was a slit which was pointed always to the direction from which the Americans would invade. Every one of these 600,000 bunkers had issued a Kalashnikov to the responsible head man. Kalashnikovs were made in China and many of them did not work but no Albanian had any ammunition. So when things became peaceful, Albania had the world market in Kalashnikovs, which is one of the reasons why the Albanian ex-arms are still there.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08051564000269"></a>I move on to the Soviet Union and most of the Islamic countries whose names end in &#147;-tan&#148;. They have had struggles and strife controlling problems that arise, and you effectively end up with revolution. That usually manifests itself initially with a revolt and the killing of people. I refer to the CMEA states and their external relationships. I will use Angola as an example because I was an economic advisor to that country. When I was in Cuba I asked the Cubans why they had armed forces in Angola, paid by the Soviet Union. They said it was part of a sugar deal of some form or another, with much interchange.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08051564000270"></a>My worry is that this proposal of restricting arms sales is not going to do anything to save lives. Moving round this world, we find that strange bit of metal: the parang from Malaya, the bolo, even the jitte&#151;the Japanese metal club with which you could beat people over the head&#151;the assegai, which I think was originally a Berber tool, and the shaka of the Zulus. These ancient tools cause deaths&#151;or murder, if so you call it&#151;and there is nothing one can do about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08051564000271"></a>Jamaica is one of my favourite countries. I was conceived on a beach there and we were its economic advisers. I was given a machete and told what I should do with the handle. As I wrapped the cord round it&#151;the cord should be plaited from a particular type of palm leaf&#151;I was told to put the hair of one of my family within it, because when you go out to fight, you fight for your family first, and then for your country. I have said before&#151;it is one of my favourite stories&#151;that they opened a wonderful restaurant just after the troubles there, where the cooks and chefs were given all the latest equipment but they used their machetes to turn the eggs over and to whip everything up. At the end of the evening, the senior man was the one who, the night before, had thrown his machete nearest the centre of the dartboard.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08051564000272"></a>These old tools are worrying. If we look at the deaths that are caused worldwide, the majority by far&#151;I estimate about 80 per cent&#151;are from within. Then we look at ourselves, with the latest armaments and kit that the world has ever created, but we are unable to subjugate a group of people who sometimes have nothing more with which to arm themselves than home-made explosives. We should look to that great man Mr Molotov and the Molotov cocktail, which has many different components in different countries. A Molotov cocktail costs approximately 60p&#151;prices vary from &#163;1.50 down to 45p. It can take out a tank or a personnel carrier. It has been used by the Finns to defend themselves against the Russians, and by the Japanese; it has been used the world over.</p>

<a name="80515-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08051564000273"></a>We have always had that strange word &#147;resistance&#148;. Is it armed conflict when you are resisting an enemy, wherever he might be? Look at the resistance in the last war, where even undoing the bolts on a railway line was, you could say, an act of aggression, in relation to which hostages were taken and killed. I am not sure of the answer; in my own mind I am confused by all this. I support what the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, is proposing, and I know what the noble Lord, Lord Judd, is likely to say after me. We should think seriously about why people are killed and what they are killed with. I do not believe that the maximum level of deaths is caused by armed conflict from without.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08051564000274"></a>I am not saying that, had we not gone into Iraq or Afghanistan, lives would have been saved&#151;of course not. Ultimately the one thing one wants in life is a stable regime. There are really only two countries in Europe and the world that are prepared to lose lives in fighting&#151;France and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom Commonwealth countries contain 1.9 billion people in 54 countries. The French and ourselves have 15,000 troops working abroad but we have forgotten about them. A lot more could be done if, instead of pushing hard with the UN for treaties of this sort, there were bilateral discussions with those who may formerly have been imperial or colonial countries, or with the Soviet Union. All of us want stability in all countries. The biggest enemy of all is the enemy from within.</p>

I warmly congratulate my noble friend Lord Dubs on having achieved this debate. He has brought great diligence and commitment to this area, particularly in the context of the Oslo process. He brings to that work&#151;I hope he will forgive my reminding the House&#151;his personal family history, which must have shaped him considerably in his concern, and his practical experience as a former director of the Refugee Council.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08051564000276"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, always brings an original and challenging approach to these kinds of deliberation. As ever, I was interested by his speech. I will take what he said as an opportunity to acquaint the House with an experience of mine at the time I was director of Oxfam. It was in the late 1980s, in that strife-riven&#151;even then&#151;country of Sudan. I was down in Juba, in south Sudan. Our field director was a courageous man, the sort of member of staff who would be where the bullets were flying. He said to me, &#147;Come on, Frank. I want to take you out early tomorrow morning to see something&#148;. I thought, &#147;All right&#148;. We rose before dawn and, going through the defence arrangements for Juba, picked our way to a cattle camp.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08051564000277"></a>It was a wonderful, almost biblical scene. In the faint light that was developing, these distinguished men&#151;women were not so evident&#151;were moving gently and gracefully about, dressed in a kind of woad, with the cattle moving and lowing. I was caught up by the romance of this in the early morning. Then my colleague pointed round the perimeter of the camp, and there were the AK47s hanging up around the perimeter.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08051564000278"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, is absolutely right to draw our attention to the machete and the improvised weapon&#151;even the making of guns of a primitive kind. We shall never have stability and peace simply by an arms trade treaty. Of course governance, human rights, education, culture and value systems are all relevant. Yet I believe, with all my experience, that an arms trade treaty is a priority in the road to progress.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08051564000279"></a>We live in a volatile, unpredictable and dangerous world. Yet still, extraordinarily, the prevailing culture seems to be that arms are an acceptable part of export drives, to be encouraged in all sorts of ways unless there is an overriding specific need not to do so. By contrast, sanity demands an approach that sees arms as, by definition, lethal, maiming, destructive and potentially economically ruinous. Too easily, they can also reach the hands of criminals, terrorists and those who perpetrate state terrorism. Surely sanity demands that arms should never be exported unless there is an overriding specific reason for doing so, to ensure security and stability, and even then only with the strictest enforceable conditions and close monitoring.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08051564000280"></a>Similarly, the economic and employment rationalisations are repeatedly overplayed. Objective, reliable studies have repeatedly demonstrated that the validity of such arguments is highly questionable. If the rigours of the market, so generally applauded, had been applied to much of the arms industry, much of it would never have survived. The hidden subsidies, not to mention the corrosively corrupting dangers, can be immense. The opportunity costs are considerable, not least in the deployment of technological research and expertise. By contrast, if the same resources had been

There has been a lamentable absence of tough long-term analysis and strategy.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08051564000281"></a>The contradictions can be bizarre. I remember, in my own ministerial days, being appalled by the legal arguments put forward by some that our Memorandum of Understanding with Chile on arms supplies meant that we could not cut off the continued supply of spare parts after the coup against Allende and the arrival of the cruel regime which followed.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08051564000282"></a>Our present Government are to be congratulated on many of the initiatives on the arms trade which they have already taken. They were pioneers of the European Union code of conduct which, with its limitations, provides a base on which to build. They have been leaders in the drive for an international arms trade treaty. To be fully effective, it is essential for all of us to support them in strengthening the consistency of their own performance&#151;the need to be able to say, &#147;Do as we do&#148;, rather than simply, &#147;Do as we say&#148;. It is commendable that the Government have made improvements in transparency by disclosing the end-uses of certain equipment, particularly where that is for a humanitarian end-use such as mine clearance or for peacekeeping activities.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08051564000283"></a>However, the Government&#146;s arms exporting reports still do not allow for meaningful scrutiny of their declared commitment not to send arms to destinations where they could be used for human rights abuses. There should be a far more coherent explanation of their export licensing decisions to countries listed as of major concern in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's own human rights report. It seems that, in 2007, the Government issued export licences to 18 of the top 21 countries identified in that report as major countries of concern for human rights abuses. Afghanistan, China, Colombia, Israel, Iraq, Russia, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were among those. Equipment covered by the licences included armoured vehicles, pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, components for combat helicopters, components for air-to-surface missiles, body armour, riot control agents and military communications systems. Therefore, I ask my noble friend, when replying, to deal with how all that can be reconciled if the Government&#146;s stand on the arms trade treaty is to have full credibility.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08051564000284"></a>By the same token, does my noble friend agree that the welcome leading support of the Government for the Oslo process on cluster weapons, with the final treaty negotiations taking place shortly in Dublin, and on which my noble friend Lord Dubs has been doing so much committed and valuable work, is undermined by their insistence on exemptions designed to retain the cluster weapons held in UK stocks?</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08051564000285"></a>I make these points in support of those within the Government who are determined to make policy on this front effective and not open to the charge of inconsistency or of tokenism. As we come to a crucial stage in the arms trade treaty negotiations, I ask my noble friend, when he replies, to be certain to answer the following questions. Do the Government agree that the treaty must be comprehensive, applying to all conventional arms, means of transport, spare parts, ordnance and ammunition; that it must be robust,  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1161"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>effective and properly enforceable with convincing arrangements for implementation; that it must be rooted in international law; that it must enshrine the core principles of international human rights, humanitarian law, all other relevant non-proliferation norms and standards, and sustainable development; that it must cover all aspects of international arms transfers, including import, export, transit, transport, overseas production and arms brokering, wherever it takes place&#151;points very well emphasised by my noble friend in opening the debate&#151;and that it will allow for the responsible production and transfer of weapons where that is specifically essential for legitimate defence, policy, peacekeeping and other legitimate purposes, with the emphasis on essential and legitimate?</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08051564000286"></a>The Government deserve warm support in reasoning with the United States Administration, and with any contenders to be the future Administration in the United States, that this treaty is indispensable and vital to the cause of security. They, likewise, deserve full support for engaging with other states which remain unconvinced and which could block progress&#151;Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Egypt and, inexplicably, South Africa are prominent examples. At the same time, supporters in the south, such as Kenya, Nigeria, Liberia, Ghana and Tanzania, should be given all possible encouragement in their support for the treaty.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08051564000287"></a>Recently, events in Zimbabwe, Burma and China have added to the all-too-long list of places across the world which emphasise the urgency of delivering a tough treaty. As my noble friend said, the will of 153 states across the international community must not be thwarted. A dynamic contribution, based on consistency, by the UK Government will remain vital and that should run throughout government at all levels, in all departments, from the most senior to the more modest. It must continue to include the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08051564000288"></a>On average, 1,000 people die every day as the result of armed violence. Thousands more are injured, maimed, tortured, displaced from their homes, prevented from making a living, or bereaved. Humanity can wait no longer. The present situation is, quite simply, intolerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08051564000290"></a>It is a pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Judd, many of whose arguments I have enjoyed over the years. For those of us who were discussing the millennium development goals two weeks ago, this treaty is a sine qua non. All states have the inherent right to self-defence under the UN charter, but armed conflict is the constant enemy of development. It costs Africa alone about $18 billion a year, which is about as much as it has received annually in aid in the past 15 years.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08051564000291"></a>As some of us said two weeks ago, we cannot begin to achieve the millennium development goals on poverty reduction, health, education and the environment unless more urgent efforts are made on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation. Nevertheless, I hesitated to join this debate, because arms control is one of those subjects where high-flown phrases of intent disguise the reality of failure and incapacity on the ground.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08051564000292"></a>We would all&#151;or nearly all of us would&#151;like to see a treaty, but when and how? The Government already say in their submission that there is no universally effective way of preventing an illegal arms trade. Forty states are not party to any regional arrangements that regulate weapons. Until now, there has not even been a list of the world&#146;s conventional arms agreements. The Government say that a treaty will take some years to become a reality, but they are referring only to the negotiations behind closed doors. What about the treaty&#146;s implementation by the member states? It may work in Europe, in parts of Latin America and even in India, but in countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Somalia it will take decades.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08051564000293"></a>Yet it is the conflict countries that are causing the problem and are least likely to co-operate, because they have been so incapable of controlling their own regions and ethnic minorities. Who can blame some of them? They have vast territories to control. The very existence of their states is in question and their ability to set up any systems at all is therefore up in the air.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08051564000294"></a>Last night, I watched an excellent short film, made by Channel 4, about the Janjaweed in Darfur. It showed how the various militia change sides and how easily small arms are traded and captured. In this case, the arms were rifles supplied to Khartoum by China, which is a member of the GGE, the committee working on this treaty. In such a vast region with many divided loyalties&#151;Somalia is another such country&#151;discussions at Westminster seem a bit academic.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08051564000295"></a>Of course, if hostilities end, we can do a certain amount internationally or through the UN, as we are in Afghanistan and southern Sudan, to disarm the militia, to train national armies and to create zones in which development can take place to a limited degree. We are slowly building the capacity of government departments to back up these strategies. However, these will remain limited operations. We have to accept that states, whatever they believe when they sign treaties, may sign them as half-states or quarter-states, which are legitimate perhaps at the UN but lack the confidence of an entire nation. We in the West are always recommending these provisions and formulating the phrases of disarmament from the relative luxury of unified states.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08051564000296"></a>This is where I and, I am sure, many of us have some misgivings about the effectiveness of this treaty, important as it is in the UN agenda and in the armoury of international development. Pursuing non-state organisations, for example, seems quite impracticable. One does not want a convention that is unenforceable and ineffective, as my noble friend Lord Hannay  said last week. Without monitoring and proper implementation, it is only a theoretical arms control

I feel the frustrations of people on the ground who desperately need good governance and conflict resolution, both of which would have to be in place long before they could ever hope for an amnesty even on small arms.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08051564000297"></a>I acknowledge the pioneering work of NGOs and others that has already gone into this treaty. I accept that, if the treaty can be confined to small arms and light weapons, it may be possible to achieve its objectives in some regions. Other, more limited agreements, some of which have been mentioned, on landmines and cluster munitions have successfully passed into law.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08051564000298"></a>I come to the area where we can make a difference: keeping our side of the bargain and controlling our own arms exports. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, reminded us that we continue to export strategic goods to 18 countries of concern. I hope that the Minister will comment on that. I have briefly studied the Government&#146;s response last November to the Quadripartite Committee on strategic export controls and was glad to see it confirm that states must,</p>
<ul><a name="08051564000543"></a>&#147;subscribe to the highest standards&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000512"></a>in their efforts to tackle bribery and corruption in arms transfers. That is of course true. However, as the public have learnt from the aborted BAE investigations, the highest standards must apply to both sides of the bargain. Even the commendable efforts of the Woolf committee, which has recommended to that company new ethical standards that would make offset contracts subject to the process of due diligence, have not been enough to uncover the whole truth about that programme. The 1997 OECD convention on combating bribery has had considerable effect, as will the new UN Convention against Corruption, in the pursuit of some of the worst offenders, at least within larger corporations, even if it cannot catch the minnows.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08051564000299"></a>Stronger emphasis on conflict prevention will also assist in the process of arms control and disarmament. I was glad to see reference in the latest FCO human rights report to the need to address tensions arising from social exclusion and human rights abuse, which were described earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon. There have been notable successes recently in countries such as Uganda and Sierra Leone, as well as in Burundi, where the new UN Peacebuilding Commission has been working. That commission needs much more support.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08051564000300"></a>Nepal is another example of a country where swords are turning into ploughshares, or machetes into kitchen equipment, whichever way one looks at it. A fragile conflict state has apparently been transformed into one emerging from civil war towards a reasonable level of governance and stability. I am glad to say that the UK, as I have seen for myself, has been an active player in this process. Elsewhere, DfID has provided expertise on a range of subjects, such as children in armed conflict. The FCO supports the fostering of civil society as a means of bringing Governments to account. In all those countries, we must acknowledge the critical and indispensable role of non-governmental organisations, as we do of Governments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08051564000301"></a>There are some signs of hope in a globe apparently torn by conflict on all four continents. We must pray&#151;I think that that is the right word&#151;that the arms trade

I congratulate him also on his other work in this field. Despite its brevity, this has been an interesting debate because of the divergent opinions expressed and the thoughtful nature of the contributions.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08051564000303"></a>Efforts to establish an international arms trade treaty are an example of how a few enlightened individuals, together with and followed by a large number of NGOs, can hope to influence world events. Simultaneously, they are an example of the difficulties and frustrations of reaching concrete and tangible outcomes. Of those individuals who have been involved, I mention especially Dr Oscar Arias, the former President of Costa Rica, which is a country famous for not having an army. He won the Nobel Prize for his efforts to stem the tide of civil war in central America. We can claim a piece of him, because he studied for some time at the London School of Economics&#151;like most people of eminence in the world, I have to say. He also got a PhD at the University of Essex, hence his title. He has had an enormous personal impact on the evolution of thinking about the possibility of the treaty.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08051564000304"></a>As someone who is deeply immersed in writing a book about climate change and energy security, I see interesting similarities between attempts to establish international agreements on climate change post-Kyoto and post-Bali and attempts to establish an arms trade treaty. In both cases, many nations are joining in with the best of intentions; in both cases, a few key actors are not signing up or are actively seeking to exploit others with their own interests in mind. In the mean time, the phenomenon that is supposed to be addressed by these two sets of international negotiations goes on relatively unchecked. Noble Lords will probably have seen in the newspapers a couple of days ago reports of the recent studies from the observatory in Hawaii, which suggest that world emissions are rising much more quickly than we thought and already are not far short of a dangerous level.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08051564000305"></a>In the case of small arms and light weapons, exports to countries have continued and have grown in number over the past few years, including to countries that are known to have committed serious human rights violations. This is part of a general swelling of the world arms trade. The proportion of countries with significant arms industries has doubled since the early 1990s. The current volume of the global arms trade is estimated at a value of $1.1 trillion, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Of course, the proposed arms trade treaty would cover only a proportion of the arms trade. Some people have, not without some accuracy, called small arms the real weapons of mass destruction. Far more people have died from small weapons in recent years than from the larger ones of so-called mass destruction.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08051564000306"></a>It is helpful that there is something close to a world consensus on the desirability of an arms trade treaty. As all noble Lords know, in October 2006 the UN  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1165"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1165</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>voted to start the process towards an arms trade treaty by a vote of 139 to one&#151;and everyone will know who the one was&#151;with 24 abstentions. As other noble Lords have said, the EU has played a strong part in this process and has produced a series of documents on what a treaty might look like and the obligations that might be within it. We owe a vote of thanks to our Government for their efforts in promoting the treaty.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08051564000307"></a>However, critics have had a field day with the attempt to establish an arms trade treaty. A prominent American political writer says that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051564000544"></a>&#147;a meaningful arms trade treaty is a pipe dream&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000513"></a>He says that it is just,</p>
<ul><a name="08051564000545"></a>&#147;another hollow UN treaty that makes promises that it can&#146;t deliver&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000514"></a>Critics have raised the same point as the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, did&#151;that death occurs in wars and that it is not weapons, as such, that kill people. However, I think that there are clear limits to that kind of argument, which is used domestically in the United States, for example, to argue that everyone is safer if they have a gun in their house because they can protect themselves. It is important that the world should try to reach agreement on an arms trade treaty.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08051564000308"></a>I have four questions for the Minister, which follow on from what the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, said about the reality behind the possibility of a treaty. First, how would the Government see the process of reconciling the divergent interests involved? As with Kyoto and post-Kyoto, when a lot of nations are trying to reach agreement, if they manage to do so it tends to be at a very low level&#151;and anyone who is outside can exploit the rest. How can those things be avoided when there are clear divergences of interest between countries? For example, some of the developing countries feel that an arms trade treaty might discriminate against them in much the same way as they feel that attempts to control nuclear weapons have done. The states that have nuclear weapons keep them and try to prevent other states from acquiring them. There is a morass of different interests involved and I should like to find out how the Government think that they could be reconciled, with a strong statement of the kind that noble Lords have rightly been calling for.</p>

<a name="80515-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08051564000309"></a>Secondly, the United States might refuse to sign up, even if a Democrat presidency succeeds the current one. Again, I should like to hear the Minister&#146;s view on this. At least some writers on foreign policy have argued that in the short term it might be a good thing if the United States did not sign up because some countries, as mentioned in my first question, might see American leadership in this area as an attempt to dominate the world arms trade and substantiate its own position of dominance in it. At some point, the United States has to sign up if the treaty is to be effective, but there could be a case for saying that it should join in later, as it has done with other treaties in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08051564000310"></a>Thirdly, will Russia ever sign up? Russia is one of the main exporters of arms and many of those arms get to countries with noxious regimes. There are two reasons why Russia stands in a specific position in relation to the world armaments industry, which might  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1166"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>lead it to find it difficult to be involved in the process. First, the armaments industry is one of the only industries in Russia that is competitive on a world level and in which the country can sell successfully across the world. Russia has put a lot of money into its armaments industry and armaments exports. Secondly, Russia, at present anyway&#151;and this is likely to continue under the new leadership of Mr Medvedev&#151;is not closely aligned with a multilateral view of the world and still takes a view of international relations that puts states and their interests first. That might make Russia an awkward partner in such international legislation.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08051564000311"></a>However, I should like to end on a more idealistic note, because I hope that this is an area in world society in which idealism and realism can coincide. Oscar Arias, who was one of the initiators of the idea of a world arms trade treaty, said in 2007 that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051564000546"></a>&#147;all of us should be proud of this process, proud of how far we have come, but it is time to move forward from principles to practice ... It is time not just for declarations but also for treaties; not just for politics but also for law&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000515"></a>So here is an easy one in conclusion for the Minister: will he endorse those sentiments and find it possible to set out a position that would allow us in a world society to reconcile necessary idealism with on-the-ground realism in the construction of a treaty?</p>

Of course, that is not unique to this issue; we pass laws in this House against drug crime which do not eliminate such crime but help to control it. In an international market in which, increasingly, brokers selling second-hand arms are playing a major role, the effort to control the international arms market is going to be a very long-term one. But an arms trade treaty that provides additional mechanisms for control, ideally for monitoring and reporting and that provides a global framework for tighter regional frameworks&#151;and I hope that the Minister will tell us a little about whether we can work into an arms trade treaty the strong objective of trying to reduce the level of arms traded&#151;would be a useful step forward.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08051564000313"></a>As a number of noble Lords have already said, this process cannot be the north telling the south what to do, for many reasons. We need to engage the countries of the south as major purchasers and, increasingly, as competitive suppliers. There are many obstacles to this; we all know from our own country the arguments about employment and exports. When I was standing in a constituency in Yorkshire, I was staggered to discover how many small businesses in Shipley were subcontractors to the Vickers tank factory in Leeds and therefore did not want me to say anything about the British Army not needing another 1,000 tanks. The same is true of the aircraft industry. It is interesting that under the Thatcher Government we were supposed to abandon an industrial strategy, which was not a good thing, but we still have a defence industrial strategy, because that is an exceptional area kept out   


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1167"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from the free market. If Britain wants to reduce its arms sales, there are clear implications for the future of our defence industrial strategy.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08051564000314"></a>The arguments for employment and exports are even stronger in some other countries. The noble Lord, Lord Giddens, mentioned Russia. I recall going to a conference in Ukraine shortly after Ukraine became independent, and a great deal of time was spent by our Ukrainian opposite number saying, &#147;Tell us how we can sell anything which comes out of our defence industry&#148;. It was almost the only viable industry that it had. It asked whether it could put up for satellites for us, convert military aircraft into long-range transport aircraft or whatever, because it was desperate to keep people in business.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08051564000315"></a>New producers complicate the matter even further. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, said that he was surprised at the South African attitude. I was in South Africa two years ago and happened to talk to someone who worked in the South African arms industry. He told me about the difficulties that it had in finding export markets and how much tighter the competition from India and Israel was getting. Brazil is also a new supplier. China, as we have heard, is a major new supplier. This is much more complex than it used to be and there are markets out there and countries desperate to find foreign exchange by supplying them.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08051564000316"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, remarked on the broad problem of what a weapon is. We have all struggled with the question of dual use. The forces from Darfur that reached the outskirts of Khartoum the other day arrived in Toyota Land Cruisers and Land Rovers. That is how they got across Kordofan. Those are clearly dual-use weapons. We export a lot of Land Rovers from Britain. That is part of the shady area that we are in. Helicopters are very important to international aid, but of course they are very much dual-purpose. The machetes that were used in Sierra Leone as well as in Rwanda were used to frighten and wound people, but the AK47s did more damage and killed more people.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08051564000317"></a>We face the increasing problem that arms are getting smaller. Tanks and fighter aircraft cannot be hidden, but unmanned aerial vehicles can much more easily be hidden and smuggled. There are in the world a large number of shoulder-held ground-to-air missiles left carelessly behind by the Americans from the support for Afghans fighting the Soviet Union. Again, they are relatively easy to smuggle. Some major problems are getting more difficult as arms get smaller&#151;not to mention explosives. I have just been reading the chapter in Misha Glenny&#146;s new book <I>McMafia</I> in which he talks about the Bombay/Mumbai explosions some years ago in which the Pakistani intelligence services provided small amounts of very effective explosives to criminal gangs working for terrorist associates to operate in Mumbai. We have a set of markets in which states are players, but there are all sorts of terrorist, non-state, criminal and other actors. It makes things extraordinarily difficult.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08051564000318"></a>There is a large second-hand trade with surpluses dashing around the world and with brokers and entrepreneurs everywhere. In the Gulf states, Viktor Bout made Dubai one of his major centres. Brokers  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1168"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>occasionally use offshore financial centres under British sovereignty&#151;there have been one of two cases in the Channel Islands, as the Minister will know&#151;and Switzerland.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08051564000319"></a>Then we have the problem of the United States itself, which has been remarkably careless in providing large quantities of arms to conflicts elsewhere in the Balkans and in Afghanistan and then leaving them behind to be traded elsewhere. If any noble Lords have seen &#147;Charlie Wilson's War&#148;, they will have a sense of how careless the United States was in providing weapons to the Afghan resistance. We also know that the freedom of the American market provides a fair amount of leakage elsewhere. We are told that criminal gangs in the Caribbean get their heavy weapons privately within the United States. After all, you can purchase fairly heavy assault weapons in various American states if you know how to do it, and then smuggle them out of the country. There is a huge problem of internal conflict, arms and criminal smuggling of arms as well as trade between states.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08051564000320"></a>What can Britain do and what are Britain's responsibilities? Clearly, we should tighten our own controls further to make sure that we have greater transparency about our arms exports. I am glad to see that the Government have taken some steps in that direction and reduced what used to be the almost automatic export subsidies for arms transfers. We would like to see more reporting to Parliament. Indeed, a working group from my party recommended that all significant arms sales should be overseen by a parliamentary committee. It seems to us that there are questions about a new defence industrial strategy based on the assumption that we will maintain a major domestic industry by selling abroad. After all, that is what took us down the road to the Al Yamamah contract, keeping the British aircraft industry going by selling an enormous amount of weapons to Saudi Arabia under circumstances which we all know were rather dubious in terms of how much money went where in commissions&#151;some of which flowed back into Britain through some British universities, although I think not yet the LSE.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08051564000321"></a>The UK certainly needs to ensure that none of our offshore financial centres are involved in the financing of arms sales or arms brokers. As a member of the European Union, we should be working as far as possible to strengthen a common EU position and to make sure that those negotiating with the European Union and those wishing to become closer associates of the European Union also raise their standards. Croatia has been mentioned. It is negotiating to become a member of the European Union. What is it still doing in the arms trade in such a dubious fashion? We have some influence over Switzerland in the same way and perhaps also Ukraine.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08051564000322"></a>Lastly, the British Government and others need to work to tackle the surplus of arms in circulation&#151;above all small arms and the illegal networks that trade them. The arms trade treaty would be a useful contribution to a major problem, but we should have no illusions that it would solve this very complex and partly criminal activity.</p>

He gave an impressive overview of some of the problems of the arms trade, with examples of the different countries responsible for some of the worst cases of irresponsible arms exports and human rights violations.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08051564000324"></a>This issue is a good example of persistence paying off. Without the efforts of Amnesty International, Oxfam, and others such as Alex Vines at Chatham House, the issue of controlling the trade in small arms and light weapons would not have gained the public awareness and sympathy that it now has; nor without their dedicated lobbying would the draft Bill have got as far as it has.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08051564000325"></a>I am very happy that the UK has not been backward in its support for this treaty. Our representatives at the United Nations have been at the forefront of measures to promote it, and, just as important, our defence industry operates to some of the highest standards in the world. We should be proud of the UK's efforts to reduce the illegal arms trade and the horrors to which it contributes. I congratulate the Government on their contribution to progress on such a treaty.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08051564000326"></a>However, as the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said, progress has been very slow. The issue has been on and off the table since 1995. We have now reached a point where a group of government experts has been appointed and is sitting as we speak in one of the three sessions planned for this year. What indication can the Minister give the House of how long it can be expected to take for the process to be completed?</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08051564000327"></a>There are other problems ahead apart from the interminable workings of international bodies. Despite the enormous support for the resolution in both July and December 2006, there was the notable opposition of the United States and, as the noble Lord said, 24 abstentions. These included both China and Russia, which are themselves heavily involved in the international arms trade at all levels. It is clear that persuading these countries to make a positive contribution is necessary for the success of the treaty. As we are all aware, China was the source of the shipment of ammunition and rocket-propelled grenades to Zimbabwe last month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08051564000328"></a>The intentions of a treaty are only as effective as the subsequent actions of its signatories. Without the active support of these countries, little can be done to mitigate the death and destruction that follow from the indiscriminate and criminal use of light weapons. Does the Minister have any confidence of being able to change the abstaining countries&#146; minds? We can hope that the support given by other countries will exert some pressure, but our examples of how to maintain a successful defence industry that still meets higher standards will be the key to reassuring them that the treaty will not harm the legitimate defence industry or the responsible export of munitions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08051564000329"></a>I also hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that the Government will not support any suggestions that the treaty should be watered down to make it more attractive to these reluctant states.

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08051564000330"></a>Another concern that I believe we all appreciate is the question of enforcement. How do the Government expect the treaty to be policed? It is of course the illegal trade in small arms and light weaponry that leads to the most harm around the world. We cannot rely on dock workers to hold up every suspect shipment en route to unstable countries. How do the Government intend to target the non-signatory countries and organisations that actively and knowingly participate in the illegal arms trade? Who will take responsibility for identifying and prosecuting those breaking the treaty&#146;s provisions? And how will the Government stop the costs and burdens of enforcement from falling primarily on those states that already run their arms industries responsibly?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08051564000331"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, that this has been an interesting debate. I listened carefully to&#151;and, as always, was enormously impressed by&#151;the words of my noble friend Lord Selsdon, who made the point that it is not just heavy weapons that are a threat but often the knife, the machete and the kukri that kill people.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08051564000332"></a>I am pleased with and proud of what this county has done so far to promote the treaty. I am hopeful that we will eventually achieve success with a comprehensive, robust, fair and effectively implemented treaty. I therefore encourage the Government to continue their efforts towards that goal, and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in answer to the questions that I and other noble Lords have raised.</p>

Before I address the points that have been raised, I remind noble Lords that I was Minister for Defence Procurement from 2001 to 2005 with responsibility for defence exports and that later on, while out of government, I worked for a time in the defence industry.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08051564000334"></a>As my noble friend made clear, the debate could not be more timely. As we speak, the second in a series of three UN group of government experts meetings is under way in New York to discuss issues of direct relevance to those discussed in this House today. We are pleased to have been at the very forefront, as the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, reminded us, of initiating this UN process towards an ATT in 2006, pleased to be working closely with our partners in the NGO community and with industry to take that process forward, and pleased to remain fully engaged internationally in strong support of the United Nations process towards an arms trade treaty. Together we have achieved success in taking the process forward towards a treaty. It has not always been easy to convince sceptics, but I believe that our innovative co-operation is beginning to yield results.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08051564000335"></a>I remind the House that this country, along with six others, introduced a resolution into the United Nations in December 2006 calling for work towards an arms  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1171"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>trade treaty. One hundred and fifty-three countries voted in favour of the resolution, 24 abstained and only one voted against. In 2007, as part of the first phase of the UN process authorised by that resolution, an unprecedented number of countries submitted their views on an arms trade treaty to the Secretary-General. More than 100 submissions have now been made, giving views on the treaty. The norm is fewer than 20.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08051564000336"></a>The second phase of work arising from the resolution began in February this year, with a meeting of a group of government experts from 28 countries, selected by the United Nations Secretary-General to consider the feasibility, the scope and the draft parameters of such a treaty. There will be three meetings of the group during 2008, the second of which is under way while the third session will be in July this year. The experts include representatives from countries that voted for this process, from those countries that abstained and from the United States, which voted against it. The debate will therefore cover the full spectrum of views on a treaty, and I suggest to the House that that is a good thing.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08051564000337"></a>Our disarmament ambassador from Geneva, John Duncan, leads our team. We will of course press for high standards and appropriate coverage to make a treaty effective, but this series of meetings is considering only the mandate given it by the Secretary-General on the basis of the agreed resolution, so we will also be listening carefully to the views of others with a view to building consensus for the chair to report back to the Secretary-General at the end of the summer based on sound expert advice.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08051564000338"></a>My noble friend Lord Judd said that this was a high priority matter, and we agree; such a treaty is a high priority for the Government. However, we will not settle for anything less than a robust treaty. What do I mean by that? I mean a treaty that is effective in preventing the irresponsible trade in arms, which is the source of much of the weaponry that finds its way into the illicit market and which is used in attempts to undermine democracy, human rights and development. We want a treaty that has globally agreed high standards against which states assess whether to authorise arms exports. That includes assessment against high standards of human rights, international humanitarian law and taking into account the impact an arms export might have on sustainable development or conflict. There is widespread international support for such a treaty, both among states and in civil society. However, some states have reservations and many questions that I have been asked relate to those states. These reservations include whether a treaty will raise standards or simply legitimise lower standards. There is also the question of whether we can achieve the same ends by strengthening existing mechanisms.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08051564000339"></a>The Government&#146;s view is that these concerns are legitimate and must be explored if we want to see an effective treaty. However, there can be no question of agreeing a weak treaty: we would not legitimise lower standards. As we see it, a treaty of this kind is fundamentally new ground. It is the first time that the international community is taking forward this level of debate about global standards for arms export controls. The aim is to plug the gaps and inconsistencies  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1172"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that exist between the patchwork of regional and national arms export control arrangements.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08051564000340"></a>An arms trade treaty would not affect domestic legislation on arms ownership. Nor would it affect a state&#146;s inherent right to purchase arms for self-defence. The treaty would establish common standards that each country would use to assess arms exports. With common standards, there would be a greater consistency of approach and more objectivity in assessing arms export licences. This would create a more certain environment in which legitimate and responsible arms trading would become more straightforward and international collaboration between defence industries on investment, production and the chain of supply would become more attractive.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08051564000341"></a>We are committed to moving forward quickly within the UN, so that a robust and effective treaty can be achieved as soon as possible. However, it is important, if we are to be successful, that we take full account of the views of our international partners. We have to listen to their views on what they need from an arms trade treaty and we need their help in making sure that a treaty is as effective as possible in addressing the irresponsible trade in conventional arms. This will take time, but it is better to invest time now in achieving a robust and workable treaty that states will want to implement, than to rush ahead and not take into account the needs of those countries that will be affected.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08051564000342"></a>In achieving the high standards that I have referred to, we need to balance a number of issues. We need to ensure that the legitimate and inherent defence needs of individual countries are respected. The task of protecting society is complex. Defence and security capacity underpins the ability to protect civilian life and to maintain democracy and development. We need to be sure that the steps that we want to take to protect human rights, security and development with an arms trade treaty do not have unintended consequences. The UN consultative process will help to identify these issues and will inform further debate. For example, if we claimed that no defence exports at all were legitimate&#151;the British Government never make that claim&#151;we would never get a treaty signed at all.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08051564000343"></a>Despite the complexities of these issues, I hope that our message remains clear. We want an arms trade treaty that will be effective in preventing irresponsible arms trading and transfers. We want this because it will help to prevent weapons getting to terrorists, insurgents and armed groups that threaten human life and the values that we hold dear of democracy, freedom and humanity. Those are fundamental rights not just for us, but for all members of our global society. We want this treaty because we believe that it will help to take guns out of the hands, for example, of those who target our troops when they defend those fundamental rights in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="80515-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08051564000344"></a>I was asked a number of questions. Some I have answered in my speech, but let me be more specific. My noble friend Lord Dubs made the point that time is of the essence&#151;we must not take too long over this. He has heard me say that, for the treaty to work effectively, it must be agreed by as many countries as possible, and must cover agreed parameters. The noble

I make two points: that the process is on its way; and, very importantly, that support has been overwhelming.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80515-0010.htm"/>


<a name="80515-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08051564000345"></a>I was asked about ammunition parts and dual-use items. This is an area where there is a legitimate range of views. Our aim is to secure a treaty that will reduce the suffering of those affected by prolonged conflict or by the tyranny of human rights abusers. Ammunition parts, technology to produce armaments and related dual-use items in the wrong hands can and do contribute to that suffering. We therefore believe that dual-use items and ammunition parts should be controlled as part of the treaty. We acknowledge, again, that this will need careful handling to prevent unintended consequences that impact on legitimate development or trade.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08051564000346"></a>My noble friend Lord Judd asked me six questions and was kind enough to give me advance notice of them. I say, in short, that the answer to all his questions is &#147;yes&#148;&#151;we agree with what he put forward. He also referred, as did the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, to the issue of UK defence exports to human rights abusers. We believe that we ourselves should uphold the highest standards. The suggestion has been made that, when dealing with countries of concern, we should go for a presumption of refusal in all cases. I remind the House that all export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria, taking account of the circumstances prevailing at the time and other announced government policies. Those criteria clearly set out our commitment to take account of the risk that exports might be used for either internal repression or external aggression. We assess exports on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the nature of the equipment and the country for which it is destined. When assessing licences, we look closely at all the specific evidence relating to each individual export application, including the circumstances at the time that the application was made. Where there is a case to embargo a country because of its human rights record, we act, and I give as examples Zimbabwe and Burma.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08051564000347"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, and my noble friend Lord Dubs asked about ammunition and dual use, and I think that I have already replied to their point. Such a treaty needs to be comprehensive, covering dual-use items, ammunition and parts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08051564000348"></a>My noble friend Lord Giddens asked a number of important questions and I start with the one about the United States. Both we and the United States, together with a large number of other countries, have the common aim of seeking to prevent the irresponsible proliferation of conventional weapons. The United States is participating in the UN meetings and its views will be taken very much into account, along with the views of others. The US is particularly concerned, first, that this may be an attempt to legitimise low standards and, secondly, that it may introduce domestic gun ownership controls. We share US concerns about the first point and we would not sign up to a weak  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1174"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>treaty. On domestic gun controls, the treaty that we are proposing concerns exports and does not cover national policy. We are working with the United States to ensure that it recognises that its concerns on the second point are unfounded.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08051564000349"></a>Russia is a sceptic, and I was asked by my noble friend how we can bring it on board. The countries that abstained include China, India, Pakistan and Russia. Obviously, it is right that their views are taken into account and that they are part of the process, rather than left outside the tent, in taking forward expert discussions on the feasibility, scope and draft parameters of such a treaty. I shall not pretend for a moment that it will be easy to satisfy every country, but it is vital that we do everything that we can. That is why the current process is designed in the way that it is.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08051564000350"></a>My noble friend asked how we can avoid the lowest common denominator. If we secure a treaty that is too weak to have any real impact, it will not have been worth the candle. We need a strong agreement that will make a real difference to the lives of those who are impacted. As a country, we will not agree a weak treaty or one that does not support the legitimate trade in defence goods. Our best hope is the inclusive and ongoing consultative United Nations process, which we believe should be able to do the trick in addressing concerns without producing a weak treaty that is not worth the paper on which it is written. I have already told noble Lords about our next steps.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08051564000351"></a>I take on board the terms &#147;idealism&#148; and &#147;realism&#148; used by my noble friend Lord Giddens in quoting an expert. This is not a bad example of where the idealistic and the realistic can, if approached properly, both be realised. We work closely with our partners, NGOs, industry and our international colleagues, and we value their advice and support. We think that we have achieved significant progress in working towards a treaty at the United Nations since we started on it in December 2006. We look forward to continuing this success by taking the UN process further forward towards the conclusion of a robust arms trade treaty that has a significant and lasting impact in preventing irresponsible trade in conventional arms. We know that it will not be easy but it must be worth the effort.</p>

I would say, by way of encouragement, that the treaty against antipersonnel landmines&#151;the Ottawa treaty&#151;has been pretty effective, even though the United States has not signed it because it is not using such weapons. There will be more authority in having a robust treaty with one or two signatories not there than in making the treaty weak in

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08051564000358"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall also speak to the Gambling (Geographical Distribution of Large and Small Casinos Premises Licences) Order.<I></I>The Categories of Casino Regulations define the large and small categories of casinos by reference to the minimum and maximum gambling area each type of casino must offer. A casino will be a large casino if the combined floor area of those parts of the casino used for providing gambling is not less than 1,500 square metres but does not exceed 3,500 square metres. A casino will be a small casino if the combined floor area of those parts of the casino used for providing gambling is not less than 500 square metres but does not exceed 1,500 square metres.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08051564000359"></a>The principal purpose behind establishing new minimum and maximum size criteria for the new casinos is ultimately to prevent a proliferation of small casinos. Separately, the new casinos are required by mandatory premises licence conditions, approved by the House last year, to set aside minimum non-gambling areas where customers can take a break from gambling. These regulations will not apply to casinos previously licensed under the Gaming Act 1968. Many existing casinos will be below the minimum size for a large or small casino under the Gambling Act 2005. Existing casinos licensed under the 1968 Act, regardless of their size, are subject to special transitional arrangements under which they have been granted a converted casino premises licence. This will enable existing casinos to continue to trade with their current gaming entitlements. The operators of existing casinos will, of course, be free to bid for the new casino licences permitted by the Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08051564000360"></a>The geographical distribution of casinos order specifies the 16 authority areas where the eight large and eight small casinos permitted by the Gambling Act are to be located. The 16 licensing authority areas are those that were originally recommended by the independent Casino Advisory Panel, chaired by the late Professor Stephen Crow. They were included in the first geographical distribution order, which this House rejected in March 2007. Despite that rejection, which, as the House will recall, centred on the location of the single regional

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08051564000361"></a>In the rejection of the order last year, the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, adopted by this House called on the Government to incorporate the 16 areas in a fresh order, which is precisely what we are doing today. We continue to believe that the Casino Advisory Panel did a good job and that, in recommending the 16 areas, the panel exactly met its remit. The areas represented provide a good spread and different types of location, from large urban areas to town centres and seaside resorts. That is what we set out to achieve in our December 2004 national policy statement on casinos. When the time comes to carry out an assessment of the social and economic impact of the 16 new casinos, the areas will provide a good test in a broad range of different locations.</p>

My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport wrote to my noble friend to explain why we did not agree with the committee&#146;s conclusion. The committee was kind enough to publish a copy of the Secretary of State&#146;s letter in its 15th report of the current Session. It may be helpful if I deal with the two principal concerns that the committee raised.

The Government maintain that this is to confuse the overarching objectives of the Gambling Act with the rather narrower objectives of this order. The main objectives of the Gambling Act are to prevent crime and to protect children and vulnerable people from harm. We are proud that the Act placed these protections at the heart of the system of regulation of gambling in this country for the first time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08051564000364"></a>We are in no way abdicating our responsibility to prioritise the minimisation of harm. Those protections are being put in place under the Gambling Act, but that is not the purpose of this order. It fulfils the narrower purpose of identifying the areas that will best facilitate a proper assessment of the social impact of the new casinos, so that the Government and, of course, Parliament can make future decisions about casino policy on a fully informed basis.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08051564000365"></a>Secondly, the committee was concerned about the traceability of the impact of the new casinos in different areas. It cites in particular the difficulty of tracing impacts in seaside resorts, ports, areas with existing casinos or areas with pre-existing regeneration plans. We recognise that this process will be challenging, but these descriptions could apply to many, or perhaps all, local authorities in the country. We are currently drawing  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1177"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1177</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>up the research specification for the first stage of the assessment of the impact of the new casinos and we will certainly wish to take into account the points that the committee raised in this context. However, we maintain that, although assessing the impacts of the casino and disaggregating these from other effects will certainly be challenging, that does not mean that the 16 areas identified in the order will not prove a good and extensive test.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08051564000366"></a>I know that the House places great importance on the question of public consultation in the casino licensing process and on the primacy of local decision-making and local consultation. I reassure the House that those principles are central to our policy. In the Gambling Act we have for the first time given local authorities the power to resolve not to license a new casino in their area. That, of course, includes the authorities included in this order.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08051564000367"></a>Where an authority wishes to license a casino, local people will be consulted at every stage of the licensing process. Authorities must issue a three-year licensing policy, which, among other things, will set out the principles that the authority intends to apply in determining to whom to issue a casino licence. In settling that policy, licensing authorities are required to consult local people. That applies to those local authorities that, thus far, have obviously achieved local support for making their applications.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08051564000368"></a>On receipt of applications for a casino licence, the licensing authorities must consider representations from interested parties, including local people and local businesses, about the applications. Unless local people agree otherwise, they must hold a hearing. Where licensing authorities receive more than one application for a licence, we have required them, through a statutory code of practice, to take account of local views in deciding which benefits they want a casino to provide in their area.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08051564000369"></a>This order, then, does not represent a top-down, one-size-fits-all model. Licensing authorities have the flexibility to decide what is best for their area after consulting local people. That may include specific measures, funded by the casino, to support local efforts to combat problem gambling or crime. Through the Act, we have also provided for authorities to hold operators to commitments that they make during the licensing process. Even after a casino has been licensed, local people may complain to their licensing authority, asking it to review the licence. All those measures are in addition to local people&#146;s input into the planning process. I hope, therefore, that the House will agree that the consultation measures that we have provided are substantial and appropriate.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08051564000370"></a>The order before the House does not, of course, provide for a regional casino. On 26 February this year, I repeated a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, which explained his reasoning for not proceeding with that regional casino. I will not delay the House, or even risk boring your Lordships, by repeating what the Secretary of State said on that occasion, although I was privileged to repeat his Statement. Central to his decision were the concerns expressed in  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1178"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>both Houses of Parliament about the potential negative impact of a regional casino.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08051564000371"></a>The large and small casinos that are the subject of the order will pose a lower risk, but they are still new to the British market. They will be able to offer a larger number of &#163;4,000 jackpot gaming machines than existing casinos and they will be permitted to offer new combinations of gambling. We therefore continue to believe that it is right to take a cautious approach to their introduction and have limited the number of new casinos. We will not consider any further casinos under the Gambling Act until the assessment of the new casinos&#146; impact on problem gambling, to which I have referred, has been completed. We expect that to be no earlier than 2014. Even then, it will ultimately be for Parliament to approve any increase in the number of casinos permitted by the Act.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08051564000372"></a>I know that there is concern about the possible proliferation of existing casinos. I would like to assure the House that that is highly unlikely to happen. When Parliament passed the Gambling Act in April 2005, there were 138 casinos operating. Now, three years on, that figure has increased marginally to 144. That, of course, does not include any of the 16 new casinos that are subject to the instruments that we are discussing.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08051564000373"></a>A number of casino applications are still being processed under the now repealed legislation in the Gaming Act 1968. Those were submitted to the Gambling Commission before the end of April 2006, the date at which we stopped any further applications coming forward. If all those applications were granted and resulted in new casinos opening, that would bring the theoretical maximum of 1968 Act casinos to 216. However, that is most unlikely to happen. Indeed, some of the late applications made under the old legislation have already been rejected and within that 216 are 19 rejected applications with outstanding appeals; that is, they have been rejected but have gone to appeal. The theoretical maximum of 216 is restricted by law to the 54 permitted areas established under the 1968 Act and it is unlikely that the market in those areas will be able to support a significant increase in the number of casinos.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08051564000374"></a>As I said, protecting both the public interest and the vulnerable from harm through gambling is central to the Act. That approach is reflected in the manner of our proceeding with the new casinos in these instruments and, accordingly, I commend them to the House. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08051564000377"></a>In a previous debate, the Minister commented that he did not wish to discuss Treasury matters. Nevertheless, the tax on gambling, as my colleague in another place pointed out, is high. In an industry where the opportunity for wrongdoing is so great, there must be a question over how sensible it is to tax to a level that might create a temptation to cheat. I do not know what that level is, but the Minister might give the matter some thought.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08051564000378"></a>The issue of problem gambling remains cloudy. I have read a great deal on the subject and the things that appear to be lacking are a clear direction and a set of criteria to deal with it. There has been much talk, with many sensible ideas, but there does not seem to be the concentrated focus that will be needed if the figure of 250,000 problem gamblers is not to grow significantly as the number of casinos increases. Her Majesty&#146;s Government talk much about regeneration, but there is a danger that what will actually be achieved is degeneration. Perhaps the Minister will comment on advertising in the United Kingdom by overseas-registered companies that are not subject to British safeguards and regulation. I look forward to hearing what he has to say, but there is no opposition to these instruments.</p>

I suspect that we may have heard some of them before, but I would not wish to predict that, and I hope that the questions I ask the Minister have not already been answered in his introduction. As elsewhere, we are in difficult territory for the Government. I would sum it up by saying, in the words of the old joke about the man who is asked directions, &#147;I wouldn&#146;t start from here, guv&#148;.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08051564000380"></a>All of us in this Chamber are only too well aware of the history of the Government&#146;s supercasino proposals that have led, in the space of three years, for proposals for an unlimited number, then eight, then one and now zero. Over a year ago, the Liberal Democrats succeeded in persuading this House to adopt the proposition that a review of the decision to site a supercasino in east Manchester should be undertaken and that there should be a separate order enabling the eight large and eight small casinos identified by the Casino Advisory Panel, under the late Professor Crow, to go ahead. It is incomprehensible that the Government have delayed for over a year in considering the implications of that vote and coming to a decision. That is dither and delay brought to a fine art.</p>

<a name="80515-0010.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08051564000381"></a>The climate in the casino world has changed dramatically during those 12 months. There have been drastic changes in gaming duty. The abolition of the bottom bands at no notice has forced the casino operators to pay millions more in duty. The Government have decided that so-called Section 21 terminals, which were permitted in the 1968 Act casinos, should be categorised as machines, which has substantially reduced

As a result, a number of casinos are closing, including establishments in Glasgow, Nottingham, Scarborough, Liverpool and Manchester, with many staff redundancies. One key operator, Ladbrokes, has indicated that it will not be applying for new licences.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80515-0011.htm"/>


<a name="80515-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08051564000382"></a>It has also become apparent that a large number of casinos could open in this country under the 1968 legislation. This has gone well beyond the numbers that Ministers originally said would be in existence. The former Minister, the right honourable Member for Sheffield Central, Mr Caborn, said on 11 January 2005, when referring to the total number of casinos that were expected following the 2005 legislation:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="08051564000531"></a>&#147;We can say with certainty that there will be no more than 150 casinos&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Re</I><I>p</I><I>or</I><I>t</I>, Commons Standing Committee B, 11/1/05; col. 718.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000383"></a>I recently asked the Gambling Commission and have been told that there are 144 licensed and operating casinos, including two card clubs, under the 1968 Act, with 46 casinos, including one card club, licensed but not operating. Nineteen applications have been rejected by local licensing authorities but are subject to appeal. Fourteen casino certificates of consent have been granted and are waiting for a hearing by magistrates, including three card clubs, and three casino certificates of consent are pending determination or issue by the Gambling Commission. Ten of this total of 82 are extensions to, or replacements for, existing licences.</p>
<a name="time_25"></a>
<a name="80515-0011.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="08051564000575"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08051564000384"></a>This makes a theoretical maximum of 216, including six card clubs, which is far in excess of the 150 that the former Minister said with certainty were likely to exist, or would exist, in this country. That loophole should have been closed much more quickly than the Government chose to close it. It has now resulted in a potential proliferation of casinos. I heard that the Minister was very optimistic about those casino licences not coming into effect, but that is a very large potential number, and well above the assurance originally given by Ministers. It is extraordinary that we have spent so much time over the past years debating 16 potential new casinos, eight large and eight small, while a vast number of other potential new casinos have not been subject to such debate and scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08051564000385"></a>Apart from this, there is concern about the impact that the 16 new casinos could have on the existing casino estate. It transpires that 10 out of the 16 sites for new large and small casinos are already in permitted areas under the 1968 Act. The draft regulation specifies a new casino for Southampton, but it already has three before we add the extra one, which will be much larger than any of the existing three. Great Yarmouth has three casinos, as does Hull. Leeds already has five casinos, with one application under the 1968 Act, I believe, still pending. Middlesbrough already has three casinos. Solihull has none, but if we look at the wider Birmingham area, there are eight. In relation to smaller casinos, Torbay already has one and Swansea has two, with two additional casinos licensed but not yet open. Luton has three, with one appeal for a licence pending. Wolverhampton has two operating, with an additional  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1181"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1181</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>casino licensed but not yet open. Scarborough has one, plus one that recently closed. In all those cases, as a result of this order, we are proposing to add another casino that could well have an impact on the viability of the existing casinos in those areas.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08051564000386"></a>In the debate on these draft regulations in the other place in March, the Minister, Mr Gerry Sutcliffe, said that he was carefully considering the proposals that he had received from the British Casino Association, with the aim of protecting the viability of the existing casino estate. These relate to the ability of so-called casinos established under the 1968 Act to be able to relocate, subject to the relevant consent from magistrates and local authorities. I have seen copies of some ambivalent correspondence, subsequent to that debate, passing between the BCA and the Minister. What is the position? Is he taking these proposals seriously, and what conclusion has he come to? Is his position, in reality, that he wants the number of casinos to shrink? Is he content for existing casinos to close?</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08051564000387"></a>We then come to another important matter. The existing casino operators are keen for the Government to conduct an immediate review of stakes and prizes for machines, because they also impact on the viability of existing casinos. The Minister, Mr Sutcliffe, was very clear in the other place on 25 March that the review of stakes and prizes would take place shortly, yet nothing at all has happened in the interim. I do not know how quickly the clocks run in Mr Sutcliffe&#146;s household, but they clearly do not keep ordinary hours and minutes as we know them. Perhaps No. 10 has stopped the clock. What is the situation?</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08051564000388"></a>Then there is the question of contributions to the Responsibility in Gambling Trust. On 26 February the Secretary of State, Mr Burnham, expressed concern that a large number of organisations&#151;more than 90 per cent of the operators, it seems&#151;were making no contribution at all. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="08051564000532"></a>&#147;Unless the industry delivers a substantial increase in contributions by the end of this year and makes contributions in a timely fashion, I will seek the approval of the House for a statutory levy, at a rate to be determined&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Re</I><I>p</I><I>or</I><I>t</I>, Commons, 26/2/08; col. 904.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000516"></a>Again, this is relevant to the viability of the existing casino estate and the new casinos coming on line. Will the Minister amplify what the Secretary of State meant by &#147;substantial increase&#148;? What would satisfy him?</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08051564000389"></a>To cap it all, since our debate in March 2007 the Merits Committee has issued another damning report calling into question the procedures that the Casino Advisory Panel adopted in relation to the decision to locate the 16 small and large casinos. It said that the policy objectives of the order may be imperfectly achieved. At this stage it is extremely unclear what the Government&#146;s policy objectives are.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08051564000390"></a>If we were so minded there would be ample reason to throw out these regulations in the same way as the previous ones were. There have been some limited pluses in the interim as Liberal Democrats, and in particular my honourable friend Don Foster, acknowledged in the other place when the order was debated there. There is now greater clarity about consultation. On these Benches we made it very clear,  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1182"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1182</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on a number of occasions, that before an additional large or small casino opens for business in any of the 16 areas there should be maximum opportunity for wide consultation at all stages of the process. That was confirmed by the Secretary of State on 26 February and so those who live close enough to the premises and are likely to be affected by the new casino, or those with business interests that might be affected, will be able to make representations. We welcome that.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08051564000391"></a>The Government have also clarified their approach on changing the age limit for casinos and the time limitation on the so-called ban on 24-hour gambling.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08051564000392"></a>Finally, there is the question of regeneration assistance for both Blackpool and Manchester to make up for the fact that there will be no supercasino to assist in regenerating those cities. Last year the Government set up a Blackpool regeneration task force, and this February in their response announced financial support. How much of this is new money? There are other elements and decisions which Blackpool badly needs to kick-start its regeneration where government help is being sought. What can the Minister say about that?</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08051564000393"></a>We heard in February, likewise, that an ad hoc group was being set up to look at regeneration alternatives for Manchester. The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government made a statement in March which contained a number of welcome ingredients. What will be the continuing status of that group? What additional funding is being levered in by its activities?</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08051564000394"></a>On these Benches we do not intend to divide the House. We advocated the separation of the 16 casinos a year ago and we stick to that position. Of course we are unwilling to delay the hopes and expectations of the locations for small and large casinos any further than they already have been. But there is absolutely no doubt that the Government have made a complete mess of their whole gambling strategy. The least they can do is acknowledge that.</p>

<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="08051564000395"></a><a name="80515-0011.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80515-0011.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08051564000674"></a>The Lord Bishop of Liverpool:</b> My Lords, it is good note in these draft orders and in the report the seriousness with which the Government intend to monitor and review the social and economic impact of large and small casinos. The regulations imposed by the Government have already ensured that the casinos demonstrate a high degree of social responsibility, especially towards those vulnerable to addiction and to the young.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08051564000396"></a>The Government have been sensitive to the public mood in at least deferring the decision on supercasinos until a proper evaluation can be carried out on the impact, especially in areas of high deprivation. Some of the authorities which may issue large casino premises licences include places of multiple deprivation and areas of consolidated poverty such as Kingston-upon-Hull. Before going to Liverpool I was the Bishop of Hull. It is a city for which I continue to have a great deal of affection. If I were still its bishop I would, from a pastoral point of view, express great concern at the prospect of another casino full of 150 machines, some offering the prospect of prize money of &#163;4,000 at the press of a button costing &#163;2 a go. To use the words of the Explanatory Memorandum, such casino gambling in places of poverty,</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08051564000397"></a>I recall an earlier debate which was introduced by a Minister with the words, &#147;The people want to gamble&#148;. That is of course true of some people but differentiating what the people want from what the people need and from what the people ought to have is the high calling and heavy responsibility of those called to govern.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08051564000398"></a>I wish to put down a marker of hope in this debate. If the assessment of the social and economic impact proves that casino gambling is detrimental in areas of deprivation, I hope the Government will act swiftly to remove them from the area and to rule them out of their strategy of regeneration.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08051564000399"></a>We live in a time of unprecedented personal debt&#151;over &#163;1 trillion. Future historians may well say that we made the indebted poor even more vulnerable by putting gambling within easier reach. I know that local authorities have invested considerable time, money and energy into mounting the case for casinos in their areas as part of their strategy for regeneration. I know, too, that they, like the Government, take seriously the need to minimise harm and to protect the vulnerable. I know that some boroughs have engaged local people in local consultation.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08051564000400"></a>However, the earlier debate and consultation and the earlier preparatory work took place in a very different economic climate. We have not only higher degrees of debt but increasing negative equity in the housing market, with more people at risk financially. This sets a rather different mood and a rather different social context for today&#146;s debate. In an earlier debate, my friend the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury voiced his concerns about our social well-being. We on these Benches urge the Government to proceed with caution, with prudence and with a due sense of responsibility for the weaker members of our society.</p>

He reminded us of the social dimension that is contained within not only this order but all the provisions of the Gambling Act. Thanks are also due to my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham for introducing the order. He is getting a rather easier ride with this order than he did in March last year with the order that contained the very controversial proposal for the one regional casino, as well as the 16. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, could have been a little more gracious in acknowledging that the Government have done what he and the majority of this House voted for in that debate last year.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08051564000402"></a>I do not take the view that the implementation of the 2005 Act is going nearly as badly as other noble Lords suggest. The role of regulation and the work of the Gambling Commission have been exemplary so far. They have tackled the task with vigour and, to begin with, with fairly low resources. The indications I get from talking to people in the industry&#151;I have a number of interests which are on the register related to what they do&#151;is that they are tackling it well and that the quality of the regulation is now substantially greater than it was before the Act came in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08051564000403"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howard, was right to refer to some of the problems of he offshore advertising. I have referred in this House on more than one occasion to the difficulties that are caused by the poor standards of regulation in Gibraltar and its reluctance to adopt the same standards as the Gambling Commission and the white-listed authorities. Putting that aside, however, the work on the regulation of online gambling and the other aspects of the industry are working well.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08051564000404"></a>I do not underestimate the scale of problem gambling. The prevalent study indicated to the surprise of many that it had not grown markedly over the past few years. It will be very interesting to see whether those figures are sustained in the next prevalent study after the expansion in gambling can be measured.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08051564000405"></a>I will share with the House details of a visit I paid a couple of weeks ago to Gordon House, the only residential centre for problem gamblers in the West Midlands. The residents of Gordon House are men at probably the very bottom of their lives. I spoke to between a dozen and 15 of them and discussed their problems and addictions. What impressed me was the willingness of the authorities at Gordon House to help these men through their addiction, remove them from gambling altogether and get them back into society. It was also interesting to learn where the men saw the origins of their problem starting. Many first became addicted to gambling in the seaside arcades which they went to as children. I was attracted by the recommendations by the Budd committee which effectively proposed the elimination of gambling by children. I think we are the only country in Europe that allows youngsters to go into arcades and spend money. They are not spending money on the same scale as people do in the adult arcades, but there is considerable evidence that problem gambling starts in childhood and then continues.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08051564000406"></a>By far the worst manifestations of the problems of the residents of Gordon House lay in the fixed-odds betting machines; almost without exception, they admitted that they had become addicted to them. I hope very much that my noble friend will be able to say something about the Government review of the FOBTs, which have effectively created electronic casinos in so many betting shops.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08051564000407"></a>On the casino order, I and a number of colleagues who I can see in the Chamber were members of a joint scrutiny committee. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, is right that the original proposition was for a free market, which was then slimmed down to eight plus eight plus eight, and then, in the dying days of the previous Session, the eight became one. It was the view of all the members of the joint scrutiny committee that if there were to be only one, the logical and best location for it would be Blackpool. When we visited Blackpool, we were impressed by the strength of support that we found among the local community, the local council and businesses. The only exceptions were a self-seeking organisation that already runs a gambling operation on the seafront which the noble Lord,  Lord McNally, knows very well, and, I am afraid,  one Liberal Democrat councillor who was fighting a  lone crusade.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1185"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80515-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08051564000408"></a>The joint scrutiny committee took the view that Blackpool had argued the case and had thought through very carefully the way in which regeneration of that very depressed town centre and the surrounding area could be assisted&#151;not created&#151;by the establishment of a regional casino or a resort casino, as we originally called it. That was supported by the evidence from Professor Peter Collins; there was also evidence from Australia that the one place where you avoid having large casinos with attractive machines is in deprived urban areas. It is much better to have an area to which people have to travel as a day trip or for a weekend holiday, such as a seaside resort, not in a city centre. So it was with utter astonishment that I read the report of Professor Crow&#146;s inquiry, which turned down Blackpool and went instead for east Manchester. It seemed almost that he had turned the argument of the joint scrutiny committee completely on its head. He argued that a resort should not be chosen as it would not be possible to measure the social impact because the people going there would be visitors. Those are exactly the sort of whom that one would want in order to avoid the social problems. A consequence was the report of the Merits Committee, to which other speakers have referred, which contributed to the defeat of the order that we debated in this House in March last year.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08051564000409"></a>As is well known, I was one of those who voted against the order with 12 of my noble friends. I have to say that I have not lost a moment&#146;s sleep since. The judgment that we exercised on that day was vindicated very quickly by the announcement by the new Prime Minister that the plans for the regional casino would, first, be put on ice and then, latterly, were killed altogether.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08051564000410"></a>The outcome is the order before us. I still regret that Blackpool is not being given the opportunity to demonstrate whether regeneration can flow from the activity that a regional casino can create. It is unfortunate that the local authority is not one of those named in the order; perhaps it was short-sightedness on its part not&#151;as a sort of each-way bet&#151;to apply for one of the 16 as well. I am sure the noble Lord, Lord McNally, will say have more to say about this, but I hope my noble friend is able to say more about the package of regeneration which is in prospect for Blackpool. A number of promises have been made to that town and it is important that they are fulfilled.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08051564000411"></a>If there is a decline in interest in the number of large and small casinos under this order, the Government could also give an undertaking that, if a local authority does not want to take one of these, an authority such as Blackpool should be able to come forward and take their place. I suspect that may be difficult; perhaps my noble friend can clarify that situation.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08051564000412"></a>I certainly do not intend to vote against the order. It would be extraordinarily perverse of me to do so, having voted the way that I did in March last year. I wish this order well but hope that my noble friend will take on board some of the concerns expressed from all parts of the House.</p>

<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1186"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Advisory Panel did a good job. As the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, indicated, for many of us it was a bizarre outcome&#151;almost as bizarre for the Ministers who opened the envelope as for the rest of us. As the noble Lord pointed out, this process was looked at not by just one committee but three: the Royal Commission, the Joint Committee of both Houses and by Casino Advisory Panel. As the noble Lord indicated, there was much conflicting evidence against what that  panel did.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08051564000414"></a>Taking the lead from the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, who analysed very well how the Government have handled this, we will not divide the House. I assure the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool that this is not because, on the last occasion, I had the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury here on our side. I do not count replacing Canterbury with Liverpool as any kind of demotion, but we are not going to divide this evening.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08051564000415"></a>I remain convinced that PhDs will be earned by studying this process as a way not to legislate. Frankly, it has been a shambles&#151;I will turn to that in a moment. I want to make two points. First, the Government have a moral duty to Blackpool. Had Blackpool been allowed to do what it requested eight years ago, and had tested the idea of a resort casino as a means of regeneration for a seaside resort, we would now be able to see the first outcomes of such a pilot project. Instead, Blackpool is faced with real problems. As the Government&#146;s own regeneration taskforce said,</p>
<ul><a name="08051564000548"></a>&#147;Blackpool is in urgent need of comprehensive regeneration&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80515-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08051564000416"></a>The town has not sat quiet, waiting for something to happen. The taskforce has put forward a five-point plan for regeneration, but requires help and support from the Government. I will not delay the House by going into detail on the five-point plan but I want to highlight the idea of upgrading Blackpool and Fylde Further Education College, in co-operation with Lancaster University, into a university of the leisure industries. It makes a perfect fit for Blackpool and has no better endorsement than the Prime Minister himself. When he mentioned that he was no longer enthused by the idea of supercasinos, he referred to higher and further education as possible alternatives in a place such as Blackpool. I hope that the Government look seriously at that.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08051564000417"></a>I hope the Minister has in his brief some indication of when Blackpool can expect action, not just words, on some of the proposals that have been put forward; for example, we are waiting for a decision on whether the theatre museum can be moved from the V&amp;A, so that the funding can help to connect the Blackpool Tower and Winter Gardens complex with the seafront development. Those practical decisions need government action.</p>

<a name="80515-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08051564000418"></a>Secondly, there is this order. In the previous debate, I made a guess, not with a great deal of expertise, that we would end up with about 300 casinos. That provoked the noble Lord, Lord Steinberg, from these Benches&#151;he knows a thing or two about casinos&#151;to see me afterwards and say, &#147;No, you are completely wrong. I shall tell you why: casino operators do not operate casinos where they will not work and there are not 300 places in the country where they will work. I shall tell you  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1187"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>something else: one of the results of this flawed legislation is that the 16 places, which are to have these new casinos inflicted on them, are the wrong places&#148;. He mentioned two areas where he did not think there was a chance in hell of any respectable casino company wanting to operate. I checked with the noble Lord, Lord Steinberg, who unfortunately is absent&#151;he had to be in Belfast today&#151;and I believe that I fairly reflect his view that not all 16 may be taken up.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80515-0012.htm"/>


<a name="80515-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08051564000419"></a>That prompts the question raised by my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones and the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner; that is, that if all 16 are not taken up, is there enough flexibility in this legislation, or can the Government use enough common sense, to reallocate those licences to areas that come forward? Secondly, as my noble friend asked, what is the scope for the Government responding with flexibility to the requests by the British Casino Association that, where there is a willing transfer of licences, 1968 licences could be transferred from one area to another?</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08051564000420"></a>I believe that some of the benefits, which would have come from a resort casino, could still be won by Blackpool, by attracting willing casino investors who would operate not just a stand-alone casino operation, as they would in many of the towns that are mentioned, but a resort casino, which, as I have seen operating in other parts of the world, would operate as the nucleus of an entertainment centre, a retail centre, a leisure centre and a restaurant centre. That is why there was such a strong argument for resort casinos. If we could have some action on those requests for regeneration and flexibility in licensing policy, Blackpool would be on the way to getting the help that it deserves.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08051564000421"></a>In a previous debate, the Minister suggested that there was a difference of opinion between me and the two Members of Parliament for Blackpool. Perhaps I can put on record that I strongly support and admire the way in which Joan Humble and Gordon Marsden have fought for their constituencies. I pay tribute to their courage and determination&#151;I know how government Whips operate at the other end of the building&#151;in serving the best interests of the town.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08051564000422"></a>Of course, there are problems with problem gambling. However, I am worried that this is a typical piece of legislation which has been drawn up by civil servants and Ministers who operate in a world a million miles away from the reality of casinos and how they operate. Most people&#146;s only idea of a casino is seeing George Raft in an ancient B movie. As a result, this House and the other place have nodded through relaxations of our gambling law which need closely to be studied. As I said in the previous debate, you can drive through some of the poorest parts of our towns and cities, and pass betting shops that are now open until 9.30 pm and contain four gaming machines. They are there not to collect money for betting on horses, but because they take money out of the poorest areas of the country. They pose a far greater threat of problem gambling than the well regulated, closely watched ambience in which casinos operate.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08051564000423"></a>I hope that we put these matters in proper perspective. One hundred years ago, Blackpool had the imagination and vision to establish the most successful seaside resort in Europe. It now needs a little help from its friends and it can do so again.</p>

It is so nice to see him at the Dispatch Box with a proper brief. If noble Lords throw their minds back to the previous occasion when we threw out these instruments, they will remember that he had to work off a letter, most of which we had all seen before the House sat, and cobble together a deal to try to salvage the Government&#146;s casino policy.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08051564000425"></a>It gives me great pleasure to be able to say that, for the first time in my parliamentary career, I completely agree with everything that the two speakers from the Liberal Democrat Benches said. That is an unusual comment from an old Tory dog like me. When I came into the House, I thought that the debate would take about five minutes as I had forgotten your Lordships&#146; capacity to dig up and chew an old bone. As the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, pointed out, this is a classic example of a policy of the Government being in complete tatters: this is the end of the Government&#146;s casino policy. If noble Lords take the trouble to look at the instruments in detail, they will see that they are confirmed by Section 175(4) of the Gambling Act, which carefully lists the one regional and the eight-and-eight casinos. That one regional casino, which, as noble Lords have said, was originally the flagship of the Government&#146; policy, no longer exists. What is left is a rump which, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, quite rightly told the House, has been immensely damaging to Blackpool. I hold no brief for Blackpool, but I remember visiting it as a member of the scrutiny committee, as did the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner. I hold no brief to condemn Manchester for its bid. But they have both been treated appallingly by this Government. They were encouraged to bid for the regional casinos. As the noble Lord, Lord McNally, pointed out, in being rejected for the one regional casino, they have had no ability to bid for either the eight or the eight. So they have been doubly damned for doing an extremely good job&#151;which is what happens in practically every area of this Government&#146;s policy. It is pretty unpleasant and unsatisfactory.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08051564000426"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, there has already been a significant growth in the number of casinos under 1968 Act. He gave quite a lot of figures; I am sure that they are very accurate and better than mine&#151;I had worked out that it had been about a 30 per cent increase. One should put that in the context of what the Minister said in opening the debate. One of the primary purposes of the Act was to prevent the &#147;proliferation of small casinos&#148;&#151;the Minister used those words&#151;but that is precisely what we are seeing. It is therefore a complete and utter failure of government policy.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08051564000427"></a>We passed the Gambling Act in 2005. Here we are implementing it three years later, or trying to implement it in a rather shambolic way. However, since 2005, the economy has turned significantly. Quite a few casinos have closed because the economic climate has changed. The smoking ban has led to a reduction in income of between 10 and 15 per cent. These are difficult times  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1189"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for any industry without it having a Government climbing all over it at the same time.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08051564000428"></a>I, too, draw your Lordships&#146; attention and the Minister&#146;s attention to the debate in the House of Commons on 25 March. My honourable friend Mr Malcolm Moss and Mr Don Foster from the Liberal Democrats both pushed the Minister, Mr Gerry Sutcliffe, very hard. It is clear from reading the debate&#151;and I commend it to the House&#151;that the Minister appeared to give an undertaking to work with the British Casino Association on its proposals to correct this. I hope that in winding up the noble Lord, Lord Davies, will confirm to the House that the Minister is going to do that. We have heard from all sides of the House&#151;from this side, from the Liberal Democrats, from the government Benches and from the spiritual Benches&#151;that this is a muddle, and a muddle of the Government&#146;s making. They have an obligation to go a bit further to sort it out, which means talking to the industry that they have damaged.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="08051564000429"></a>The Gambling Act 2005 is now a fact&#151;we have got it. The noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, to whose judgment I bow, talked about the quality of regulations. There is no doubt that we have quality in our regulations. But I ask your Lordships to think back to the rich origins of this policy, in Sir Alan Budd&#146;s report. He made it perfectly clear that we had, at that time, an extremely well regulated industry in this country. We still have one&#151;the quality is there, but, my God, the quantity is there too. The amount of regulation that we have! The old Gaming Board did a very good job with 46 employees; I wonder how good a job the current Gambling Commission is doing with 200 or 250 employees. And at what cost! Who is paying for it? The industry is getting the same quality of regulation but at what an increase in cost. The consultation is now out from the commission on those costs, which are considerable. The industry is hurting from that, and I hope that the Government will take that into account.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="08051564000430"></a>While we are here, we may as well talk about the other primary purpose of this legislation, which was to regulate the most dangerous part of gambling, about which we knew little at that stage&#151;internet gambling. The right reverend Prelate talked about the social damage that can be done when gambling gets out of hand. There is no more difficult area to regulate than internet gambling, and one of the singular purposes of this Act was to do that. However, thanks to old &#147;Prudence&#148;, our current Prime Minister, racking the tax rate up, not one single company has come from offshore to onshore to be regulated. That is another complete area of failure in this Act&#151;a policy failure almost without parallel.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="08051564000431"></a>Again, we need to think about this in the context of what is going on at the moment. We have witnessed in the past 18 months a very significant collapse in the bingo industry, for a variety of reasons&#151;one of which is smoking and one of which is the way in which the Government have treated slot machines. It is an important industry in lots of ways, especially social ways. A lot of old people spend their afternoons there, which they will not do any more because a lot of the clubs are closing. A lot of them have closed and more will close.  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1190"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1190</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Some of your Lordships may not like the slot machine industry in pubs, but slot machines paid the rent&#151;and one reason why pubs are closing at the rate of 25 a week is because of the way in which the Government have handled slot machines. They need to look at that.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08051564000432"></a>So we should not look only at casinos in this debate. We should look at these instruments as part of an entire policy&#151;and one that is in complete tatters. It is another example of poor old Britain with a third world regulation system. That is pretty embarrassing for all of us&#151;a major industry so damaged by this Government&#146;s policy. We cannot do anything about that today, but we can help casinos. The Minister has the opportunity in winding up the debate to put at rest some of the concerns raised on all sides of the House today. I hope that he will do that.</p>

He remarked that Luton had three casinos. In 1968, when there was legislation on casinos, I was the Member of Parliament for Luton, at which time we had one casino&#151;which was called, rather grandly, Caesars Palace. I think that that was perhaps overdoing it, but I used to go there on a Friday night, though to the cabaret, not the casino. I can say that because I am not really a gambling man. My parents were great race goers and would go to the races throughout the Scottish circuit, to half a dozen or so races. When I became a teenager and likely to follow my father in his footsteps he said, &#147;Look Willie, don&#146;t go to the races&#148;. I said, &#147;Why not, you go?&#148; He said, &#147;You may have noticed that it&#146;s the bookie&#146;s wife who has the fur coat, and not your mother&#148;. So I am a reformed non-gambler. I buy a lottery ticket now and again in the hope of being able to join the opposition Benches, but that is another matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08051564000434"></a>When the 1968 legislation was going through Parliament, the proprietor of Caesars Palace&#151;who was not a Roman&#151;came to me for assistance. He explained all the good things that his casino did. It was rather like drawing in the argument&#151;quite a relevant one&#151;about regeneration. Regeneration had not been invented in 1968, but he would have used it had it been so. Casinos did good work for old age pensioners and that kind of thing. His name was Ivor. I said, &#147;Look here, Ivor. I'm on your side. The vast majority of my constituents in Luton like gambling and they like going to casinos. This is an enjoyment of theirs with which we should not interfere&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08051564000435"></a>Caesars Palace was at that time threatened with the hatchet. As noble Lords will remember, because of threats from the Malta Mafia who were thought to be overwhelming the casino and gambling operations in this country, the number of casinos was to be reduced. I managed to persuade Jim Callaghan, who was the Home Secretary and who I knew quite well at the time&#151;my old friend the noble Lord, Lord McNally, did too. He was persuaded that good work should be allowed to continue&#151;not the good work of quasi-regeneration, but of allowing my constituents the enjoyment they wished for, which was to gamble and have a lot of fun. The British people have been doing that since time immemorial. Why should they not?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08051564000436"></a>The gambling business has been tightly regulated. The noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, drew attention to the small group who suffer from gambling, but the great majority do not. It is a public enjoyment that should be allowed to be publicly enjoyed. The less regulation there is the better. I think that about many other aspects of our society as well, but let us not get into that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08051564000437"></a>I make only one further observation, which is irrelevant and nobody should really listen to it. The Minister will recall the late John Maynard Keynes. Does it rhyme with cleans or canes?</p>

Anyway, he described the Stock Exchange as a casino, and he was right. I know that I am a little wide of the regulations, but describing the Stock Exchange as a casino affects the entire finance industry where people bet on things. It is now described as betting on things, but it did not used to be. Would it not be more sensible to apply casino-type regulations to the Stock Exchange and the finance industry than to casinos and gambling?</p>

I often wonder at the consequences of massive investment in the west coast main line. I wish to make a brief contribution on behalf of the city of Manchester, because if an overwhelming case has been made for Blackpool, the case for Manchester is absolutely overwhelming.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08051564000441"></a>The right to license a regional casino was the subject of one of the most intensive national competitions for many years. The recommendation that Manchester should be awarded the right to license a casino followed an independent review, which was fully endorsed by the Government. All the bidders for the regional casino licence promoted their proposals on the basis of the significant economic benefit that would be generated by the proposals. Manchester indicated that the total employment benefit would be between 2,700 and 3,500 jobs, with the vast majority being made available to local people. This level of economic impact was also validated through the independent process.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08051564000442"></a>The decision to change policy where the regional casino is concerned has been, to say the very least, a major disappointment in the city of Manchester. Two issues have caused particular concern. First, the report produced by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, which is often quoted by Ministers as the reason why the regional casino will not go ahead, did not consider the specific impacts of a regional casino in Manchester. It also did not conclude that other means of regeneration would be a better way of meeting economic and social need. Most of the evidence base quoted in that report was available to the Government and others before the Gambling Act was enacted. In my view the report does not provide any justification for the regional casino decision.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1192"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1192</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80515-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="08051564000443"></a>Secondly, it has also been stated that the regional casino decision is what Parliament called for in March 2007. In my view, that is not the case. The Commons agreed the recommendations and, while by a small margin the Lords did not, the resolution that was passed criticised the terms of reference of the Casino Advisory Panel and its concerns applied with equal force to the large and small casinos, given that the same terms of reference applied to all the casinos.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="08051564000444"></a>The House of Lords Merits Committee drew the particular attention of the House to the grounds on which it may imperfectly achieve its policy objectives. The reason for the report is that the Merits Committee was concerned in 2007 about the process for arriving at a recommendation in relation to all 17 authorities, and no new process was conducted to arrive at this list of 16 authorities. The report draws special attention to two factors in particular: whether the Casino Advisory Panel&#146;s interpretation of its terms of reference and the list of authorities it recommended as a result sufficiently reflected the 2005 Act licensing objectives, and the fact that the locations chosen in the 2008 order may not necessarily provide the,</p>
<ul><a name="08051564000549"></a>&#147;best test of social impact&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051564000517"></a>The House of Lords demanded a review of the process, not the abandonment of a regional casino. That review should apply to all casinos, large and small, as well as the regional casino, and we have heard supporting comments for that today. Not to do so would be to say that large and small casinos are acceptable but regional casinos are not, without any evidence to support that position. I hope the Minister will reflect on that in his closing statement.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="08051564000445"></a>The Government have endorsed legislation to implement small and large casinos and a regional casino. However, they are trying to pick and choose which parts of the legislation they are willing to implement. For the people of Manchester, that is not acceptable. As a result, Manchester is being denied the opportunity to create up to 3,500 jobs for some of the most deprived communities in England. We have always accepted that if the regional casino was to be dropped, there was an obligation on the Government to put back the jobs they had taken away. As we have heard, a ministerial task force is in place to work with the city council to evaluate the opportunities, but it must come forward quickly with concrete proposals for investment and the jobs that go with it as a matter of urgency.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="08051564000446"></a>If the case has been made for Blackpool, as I understand it has, then it equally applies to Manchester, particularly because Manchester actually won the competition to have a regional casino. If the Government do not follow that route, they will be reneging on their commitment to the people of Manchester. I assure the Minister that unless the task force comes forward with proposals in the near future, this matter will not be left but will be vigorously pursued in both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08051564000448"></a>If I may take a subjective view, I was on the Front Bench, now ably replaced by my noble friend, who has spoken so well today, I was on the Joint Committee, and I have done a bit of gambling in my life. I have rather grown out of it now. It is more a young person&#146;s affair. I think that you can grow out of it, as long as you do not go completely bankrupt. On a sad note, two days ago I went to the funeral of a friend who had committed suicide. Gambling was a large component of his despair. It was compounded by drink and matrimonial problems, but gambling was definitely an important part of that tragedy.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08051564000449"></a>Gambling has always been with me. When I was a boy at school, I had a penchant for gambling. That continued to my boarding school days, where I enjoyed the only profitable time in my gambling career, as the school bookmaker. In those days, it was a risky path, because public policy&#151;this is very much relevant to what is before us today&#151;came from the Victorian period and probably before, and decreed that gambling was a fact of life, but one that had to be watched carefully and indeed discouraged. That was public policy and it has now completely changed without anybody realising.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="08051564000450"></a>One piece of evidence for that is that gambling is now controlled by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, rather than by the Home Office. When the department took on the weighty role of deciding what to do with gambling, it had to get some ideas. One idea was that gambling should be looked at in a modern way, because new Labour has always told us how modern it is&#151;we have a somewhat jaundiced view of that now. We were told that gambling was a pleasant recreational activity; that a few people got damaged, but not very many; and that a committee under Sir Alan Budd would be given the task of guiding us forward.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="08051564000451"></a>Sir Alan Budd, without knowing a great deal about gambling, I gather, had the very good idea that what we should do, if we were going to encourage gambling, was at least get some regeneration out of it. One problem of the Government&#146;s abject failure on this gambling legislation is that they have not managed to get precision on any idea. I could go through a list of aspects of the legislation where there is no precision, but I will take just two that struck me, and which have been mentioned today in the House.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08051564000452"></a>One concerns harm to the vulnerable and the young. The young are particularly vulnerable. I have mentioned this outside the Chamber to the Minister and he listened very attentively. It has always been the Government&#146;s contention that statistics show that the incidence of gambling harm in this country is one of the lowest in Europe. I asked him how they knew that. They know that because they have looked at some statistics. However, my friend who committed suicide was not a statistic&#151;he had a gambling problem. By &#147;problem&#148;, I mean that you conceal things from your family, you spend money that you do not have and you lie to people&#151;all aspects of addiction. Most people&#146;s gambling problems are not recorded. I reckon that in this country we have a serious problem with the young and gambling. This can be seen in betting shops with what are actually gaming machines. They are called

What a British thing that is&#151;to disguise a gaming machine with a completely unintelligible term. They are gaming machines.</p>

<a name="80515-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08051564000453"></a>There is so much to tempt young people. As was mentioned by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool, we are now reaching the stage where people&#151;particularly those on low incomes&#151;will have to budget very carefully for their normal costs. They will not have a surplus with which to gamble. The problem is that once you gamble and lose, you get caught up in a terrible vortex&#151;I know; I have been through it. The Government have not been precise about that. I would not go so far as to say that they have tried to deceive anyone; I just think that they have been gullible. The worst legislation is that which goes on to the statute book as a result of the Government being gullible and uninformed, and I am afraid that that is the case with this measure.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80515-0013.htm"/>


<a name="80515-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08051564000454"></a>The other aspect of the legislation that I want to mention is the lack of precision in relation to regeneration. Sir Alan Budd thought that regeneration would come about in seaside resorts as a result of them having casinos. However, with plenty of flexibility and so on, the change was made from seaside resort casinos to regional casinos. The idea of going for a weekend with a limited amount of money to a casino in a resort was swept aside, and the principle of not having gambling where people would come upon it accidentally on the street seems to have been forgotten. That was a major principle when we started our work in the scrutiny committee, and at the time it was agreed by the committee and the Government.</p>

<a name="80515-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08051564000455"></a>I agree with the noble Lord who said that the list of casinos is now very strange, although I shall limit my remarks to Torbay. I was brought up around Torbay. People used to call it the English Riviera. Torquay was built, like Rome, on seven hills. It was covered with trees and developed in the Napoleonic period as a naval station, but it is now one of the most depressed resorts in England. I do not know any resort that has deteriorated so much. Because of the seasonal aspect of life there, many people who run boarding houses and hotels are very short of money during the winter, and a lot of people who do occasional work for them lead a very low quality of life. What are they going to do in a casino in Torbay? I agree with the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Steinberg, a point to which my noble friend Lord McNally referred. I would not be at all surprised if that was one of the casinos that the noble Lord said he would not bother to operate&#151;at least, I hope that he does not.</p>

<a name="80515-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="08051564000456"></a>There is no regeneration to be had from gambling. Can anyone tell me where there has been any such regeneration, other than from an Indian casino in the United States? There is a special tax regime in the US, for reasons that I shall not go into now. The benefits do not filter down. In any case, the Government were unable to define regeneration. Even the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister did not seem to have any idea when it gave evidence to the committee, and local authorities did not know either. American companies, which know a thing or two about this subject, said that we would not get any regeneration out of gambling. They said, &#147;Forget about gambling. Go for entertainment

<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="08051564000459"></a>I have never gambled and I loathe gambling. When I was chairman of the planning committee in the city of Leeds many years ago, throughout the duration of my office I never gave approval for any gambling outlet.

<a name="80515-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="08051564000460"></a>On the question of regional casinos&#151;in a sense, the dog that does not bark today but has barked although it is not here&#151;I feel that Manchester was very shabbily treated, in part by your Lordships&#146; House. It was this House which effectively spelled doom for Manchester, not because of the desire not to have one in Manchester but rather the desire to push the case for Blackpool and so on. That is not a good way to take decisions. Rather than get on our high horse and blame the Government, we should examine our own selves on occasions. I hope Manchester is able to come back at some point.</p>

<a name="80515-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="08051564000461"></a>A great deal has been said about destination gambling and regeneration. I firmly believe that gambling, as part of a major entertainment industry, is entirely capable, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said eloquently, of providing the basis for a major entertainment centre that includes cinemas and concert halls, with retail and restaurants and so on to support it. Your Lordships&#146; Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, while quoting other research and by implication supporting that research, itself seemed to be very confused on the whole question of the best location for casinos. The idea that casinos should not be in urban areas&#151;one could almost draw that conclusion&#151;seems absolute madness. Blackpool would be an urban area in any case, and Manchester and Leeds certainly are. Whether they should be in a city centre or outside depends entirely on the nature of the urban area. To have a prescriptive view, as your Lordships&#146; Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee almost appeared to, seems inappropriate. The committee twice referred to the fact that the large casino in Leeds would be in the city centre. That decision has not been made and the city council asked me to bring that to the attention of the House. Whether or not the casino is in the city centre seems to me to be entirely a question of what is an appropriate location to have genuinely regenerative and developmental effects. That should be the criterion, not sitting in committees arguing about the fine points of different principles to apply.</p>

I regret that Manchester has been badly let down and I hope that it is able to come forward again.

I had an appointment at 3.15 pm today of a long-standing nature in relation to Northern Ireland which I was unable to break. Therefore, what I have learnt about the debate, I have learnt in the relatively short time that I have been in the House since I arrived, but because of history, I would be sorry not to make a small contribution to this debate. I see a number of former colleagues in the House from the pre-legislative scrutiny committee. When we assembled, I can recall feeling, in a spirit of all honesty, that I ought to declare an interest as the holder of a telephone account with Ladbrokes, and I do so again today. It is an account which I use only for the Grand National and the Derby and an occasional political bet. In the aftermath of our pre-legislative scrutiny committee report, the <I>Daily Mail </I>made me out, on the strength of this account, to be some form of gambling degenerate. All is fair in love and war and you take these things in your stride.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="08051564000464"></a>My own involvement in the story goes back nearly 50 years, when my late noble kinsman was Home Secretary and felt that it would be desirable to have the opportunity to make a disguised visit to Soho. He was taken around for about a hour by an inspector from the Saville Row police station, seeing all aspects of Soho life. At the end, my late noble kinsman said to the inspector, &#147;It did not seem to me that we were recognised anywhere. The only place I thought that we were recognised was that shiny cellar, where it seemed a game&#151;whatever was being played&#151;had a strong resemblance to gambling&#148;. The inspector said, &#147;I feared, Home Secretary, that you would notice that. We think it is probably gambling, too, but the game is so complicated that we are absolutely convinced that we would not be able to explain it to a metropolitan magistrate. Since money is only changing hands within the Chinese community, we think it is all right to turn a blind eye to it, particularly as it is below ground&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="08051564000465"></a>As I say, I have lived with the narrative of these dramas for a long time. I fast-forward to my 24 years as Member of Parliament of the two Cities, which obviously included Soho. In the constituency, 4,500 were then employed in the gambling industry. That would make it a major constituency employer in most constituencies; in the two Cities, it is 0.6 per cent of the total employed population and therefore very much a case of business as usual. Nevertheless, it has given me an insight, through my constituents, into the industry.</p>

That was at exactly the moment that the larger-scale ambitions of the Government for the gambling industry were emerging. It looked as though the Methodist elements of the Labour Party&#146;s history were becoming a little diluted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="08051564000468"></a>The pre-legislative scrutiny committee was then set up. One of the immense pleasures of serving on it was the company of a number of people in this House, including the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, who we were able to cross-examine as a Minister within the procedure. The confusion and discontinuity to which I was referring were further compounded at that stage by the fact that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister had clearly not got its planning policy together in conjunction with the work we were doing. That of course produced the unique precedent that we actually had to sit again once it had got its policy together, after we had initially reported.</p>

<a name="80515-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="08051564000469"></a>On the past 10 years&#151;obviously not on the circumstances that led up to 1968 and the decisions taken then&#151;all I can say is that the discontinuity and the fact that decisions have been reversed and there have been changes of policy may all have been for the good, but have actually imposed considerable strain on the gambling industry because of the uncertainty with which it has had to live.</p>

<a name="80515-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="08051564000470"></a>My one plea to the Government, in the decisions taken from now on, is to have sensitivity and, indeed, charity toward the industry given its experience.</p>

<a name="80515-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="08051564000471"></a>Obviously, I share the response to Blackpool; equally, I can understand the problems in Manchester but other places around the country have been the victims, too, of this uncertainty. May the Government bear that in mind, so that we can have a happy end to this story rather than one that has not been altogether tidy along the way?</p>

I am not quite sure where the theme is, particularly when I hear it suggested around the House that all sorts of noble Lords who usually disagree with each other are agreeing on points today. Those points all seemed fairly narrow at that stage; they do not lead up to a general theme to which I can so readily reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="08051564000473"></a>If I may, I will concentrate on responding to the discrete points that have been made, and through that I hope to portray a thread of consistency on the Government&#146;s position. After all, I have already outlined that in my opening statement and do not have a great deal to add to how I began the debate on the virtues of that position. The criticisms that have been voiced do not lead to a conclusion in any way, shape or form, so this regulation and the order ought to be supported.</p>

<a name="80515-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="08051564000474"></a>I agree, of course, with what the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, indicated a moment ago; it was reflected in the debate that the issues regarding gambling are complex and challenging. He was, after all, buttressed by my noble friend Lord Woolmer indicating some fluctuations over the years among certain local authorities. That was one consistent theme; while it is all right for noble Lords to say, &#147;Well, it&#146;s absolutely clear what the nation wants&#148;, in rather a negative stance on some of these issues, that is not the voice of the people as represented by their local authorities. Where do your Lordships think that the applications have come from, if not from a succession of local authorities representing their people?</p>

<a name="80515-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="08051564000475"></a>It is important to respond to that aspect of the disappointed position on Blackpool that the noble Lords, Lord McNally and Lord Clement-Jones, reflected. My noble friend Lord Bradley also indicated that Manchester was disappointed with the decision. Let us get one thing clear: the legislation only allows for one regional casino, so there is no compromise suggesting that the Government could think about it and produce two answers to which should be chosen. It could not, for the legislation binds us to one.</p>

<a name="80515-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="08051564000476"></a>Did this Labour Administration only ever want one regional casino? No; we had proposed more than one, but in the famous wash-up period prior to the 2005 general election it will be recalled that the Conservative Opposition insisted on there being only one. Let me be clear; if it is suggested that the Government lacked a policy in this area, there are a number of significant constraints in the legislation creating our difficulties.</p>

<a name="80515-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="08051564000477"></a>I am not going to discriminate between the rival claims of Manchester and Blackpool. Talk about going over the old bones that the noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, referred to! That would be something to chew. I agree that it is important that Manchester put forward its case to obtain the regional casino and that Blackpool was unable to sustain its case, even though we all knew it had advantages in its need for regeneration and its strategy to address it. On both those cases, I am in agreement. So are Ministers who count more than I do in the Administration, and they are determined to ensure that Blackpool gets the resources it needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="08051564000478"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McNally, presented the issues in this House, but he was kind enough to pay tribute to my honourable friends in the other place, the elected representatives for Blackpool, who argued their case with the greatest force. Their arguments need to be met, and we need to make progress on that. Likewise, my noble friend Lord Bradley is scarcely alone as Members in the other place are determined that Manchester should not be disadvantaged by this decision,  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1199"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column 1199</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>although in one obvious sense it is because it won the position and a decision by Parliament took that opportunity away. I am not going over the debate that led to that decision, save to say that when the noble Lord, Lord McNally, says that there is a congruence of opinion with regard to the order&#151; there certainly was one in the voting Lobby&#151;he is a sophisticated enough politician to know that people can arrive in the voting Lobby through different motivations. Although I listened to his arguments with the greatest care, as I always do, when he says that he won over the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury, I do not think that that was the case. The most reverend Primate had a clear set of principles against the casino strategy and did not think it would promote regeneration. He did not think it would promote regeneration in Blackpool either. The idea that the noble Lord, Lord McNally, won over to that Lobby such a significant Member of the House is wrong.</p>

<a name="80515-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="08051564000479"></a>Let us come to the detail of the decision. The noble Lord, Lord Howard, emphasised that there are two classes of casinos to which different considerations obtain. That is so. That is the fact of the legislation. There are 144 casinos under the 1968 Act and 16 under these orders. We have been able to modernise the position as far as the orders relating to the 2005 legislation are concerned, but the other casinos exist under the 1968 Act, and there is bound to be a difference in approach to the two classes of casino. He also suggested that the level of taxation on gambling is too high and warned us of the consequences. Of course the industry protests that the tax is too high. Is there any industry or individual that does not protest that taxation is too high? Any industry will do so in every forum. It is clear that when opportunities provide themselves the industry responds and seeks to be creative.</p>

<a name="80515-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="08051564000480"></a>I recognise the point about bingo. Ministers are in discussion with interests concerned with bingo because it is having difficulties. The noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, identified that issue. The Government are not are not going to resile on the ban on smoking in public places. If an unintended consequence of that is that people who used to go to bingo and enjoyed the smoke-laden atmosphere are now not able to do so and go with less frequency, the Government are going to regret the consequences for bingo, but will not resile from the legislation for obvious reasons. We recognise that there is a drop in bingo attendance and want to look at aspects of that.</p>

<a name="80515-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="08051564000481"></a>I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that the total increase in casino numbers under the gaming Act is a marginal increase at this time. He is right that in the most extreme case there could be 216 casinos in that category. I indicated that in my opening statement. The numbers will be nothing like that. Again, I emphasise that local authorities have to agree to these proposals. If local people decide that a casino is a good business for their area&#151;and certainly as far as the 16 are concerned it is quite clear that they do, which is why they went through the long process of application&#151;noble Lords must have reservations about the extent to which we can be critical of a process in which local decision-taking is of crucial significance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="08051564000482"></a>I was grateful to my noble friend Lord Faulkner of Worcester for clearly indicating that with this order the Government are fulfilling exactly the decision that this House took when it rejected the order, and based that almost overwhelmingly on the issue of the regional casino and the difficulties that noble Lords identified with that position. The House will recall that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, proposed an amendment to the effect that we should proceed with the other 16. That is exactly what we are doing. I give way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="08051564000487"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, indicated that he thought the Government needed to talk to the British Casino Association because there are outstanding difficulties. I assure the House that we recognise that fact. We are continuing discussions. There are a number of issues on which we need to make progress. I assure the noble Lord that Ministers are in regular contact with the British Casino Association. The noble Lord also raised the thorny issue of regulating internet gambling. It is difficult. After all, we all recognise anything to do with regulation of the internet as a challenge to all societies when the internet provides for the development of activities about which there may be strong reservations. I indicate to the noble Lord that only three internet gambler organisations have permission to advertise in the United Kingdom. We are able to regulate advertising. The advertising that appears indicates that those bodies meet certain criteria. However, I recognise the warning signs that he has given with regard to internet gambling and I have referred to his points about the bingo industry.</p>

We should not underestimate the extent to which many of our fellow citizens are

<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="08051564000489"></a>I have mentioned that my noble friends Lord Bradley and Lord Woolmer both thought that Manchester had been treated badly. There has been a consequence to that decision to which I give an assurance that the Government will respond. That is why we have established the working group. I do not know the site as well as my noble friend, who was a representative for central Manchester for so long, but east Manchester is an area which needs significant regeneration and huge resources and it is important that the Government give support to Manchester in its rightful ambitions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="08051564000490"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, suggested that regeneration was scarcely the theme of casinos. If that was so, local authorities would not have applied for casinos. I went to several presentations in the company of representatives of local authorities, one or two of which eventually made the list. Many fell by the wayside. There were more than 100 applications, as I recall&#151;I am speaking from memory&#151;and the local authorities would grill experts on the gambling industry and economists about the potential regeneration opportunities. They carried out that exercise with the full responsibility of being elected councillors and they reached their conclusion that their bids were right for local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="08051564000491"></a>I reiterate the fact that much sporadic criticism has been made of the Government&#146;s position with regard to this order. The House knows that this is not the order the Government first presented and will recall the occasion when the original order was rejected. The Government are responding to the proper applications of 16 local authorities to present their cases for casinos in their areas for the benefits they have identified. We are responding to that with this order. The Government are also placing an emphasis on the other issue before us today and are determined that the Gambling Commission and the legislation should protect the vulnerable. Problem gambling is showing no significant increase since the passing of the Gambling Act. Indeed, it looks as though there is a marginal improvement among young people. I am well aware that I am basing such propositions on limited evidence over a short period of time, and therefore cannot be held to them to any great extent, but I emphasise that the Government are concerned that gambling should be carried out responsibly and within a framework where opportunities occur for mature people&#151;not children&#151;to enjoy themselves while at the same time safeguarding those whose interests need to be safeguarded.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000010"></a>The noble Lord said: For some four or five years, I have sought by way of parliamentary Question, both Written and Oral, to urge the Government to do something to stop the appalling trade in the transport of animals over long distances prior to being slaughtered.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000011"></a>I very much welcome this relatively new procedure which enables one to go into rather more detail than was previously the case. It is timely to raise the matter at this stage because although the existing European Council Regulation 1/2005 has been in operation for only a comparatively short time, and is not expected to be reviewed by the European Commission until 2011, I understand that the Commission has decided to bring the review forward to 2009 and that preparation is being made for that in 2008. Therefore, it is timely to suggest to the Government that they should make strong representations in order to, if not stop this trade&#151;which would be the ideal situation&#151;to regulate it far more effectively. I gather that it involves about 100,000 horses a year, of which about 84 per cent are shipped to Italy from Poland, Spain, eastern Europe and elsewhere. I hope that the Government will try to improve the regulation of the trade. My noble friend Lady Trumpington has rightly described it as disgusting and I think that the British electorate as a whole would agree with that.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000012"></a>Various charities are concerned about this, particularly the International League for the Protection of Horses, which was recently rebranded as World Horse Welfare, although it has retained its slogan seeking to promote a world where horses are used but never abused. That charity has made a large number of representations and is very active in this field. The RSPCA has also made representations to me, although on the more general question of transport of animals by road as opposed specifically to horses. Without being sentimental about this, there is a difference between animals generally and horses in this context. Whether a horse is used for work, recreation or to enter competitions, there is generally a relationship between it and the person involved with it. This is recognised in the regulation,

The Government have not been unsympathetic on this matter.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000013"></a>Given the confusion on previous Questions, I stress that I am not concerned about the export of these animals from the UK. I understand from the Government that that is not a problem; it is a question of the transport of these animals within the European Union. The enlargement of the Union has given us rather more facility to seek to do something about this trade. That is a considerable advantage and why I hope the Government will negotiate very strongly on this issue.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000014"></a>There are basically two points on which one hopes the Government will negotiate both with the Commission and the member states that are most involved. The first is enforcement. Although EC Regulation 1/2005, with one or two notable exceptions, is not too bad a document at all, the reality, which has come out very clearly from the investigations carried out by various charitable organisations, is that it is not being enforced and that the conditions remain very dangerous indeed.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000015"></a>In particular, the recent review by the campaign which I have just mentioned suggests that on its visit to the various eastern European countries and to Italy, none of the lorries that it witnessed during the trip was adhering to the European regulations. It consistently observed infringements, such as no partitions, which the document to which I have just referred requires, as well as mixed animals travelling together in conflict with the regulation, which says that small and large animals should not be herded together and that stallions and mares should not be placed together. Nor is the requirement that vets should check on part of the journey being met. The documentation is also faulty. Action clearly needs to be taken if we are to ameliorate this suffering, which, as I said, is on a considerable scale.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000016"></a>There is no limit on the journey time. Lorries can go all the way from Spain, France or Poland right the way down to the heel of Italy without a proper break. There is a requirement that they should take a break every 24 hours. Again, this is supposed to be checked at control points, but the evidence on how these control points are being operated shows that there is grave cause for concern. Something needs to be done, so I ask the Government whether one should rely on charitable organisations to carry out this kind of investigation. What are the Government doing to see whether it is possible to investigate this matter at an official level? In particular, will they urge the Governments concerned to carry out the investigations properly?</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000017"></a>If I understand this document correctly, enforcement of the regulation is the responsibility of the local authorities. That is clearly inappropriate. This is clearly an international trade, so it is more appropriate that the whole thing should be done nationally with a degree of supervision and under international&#151;in other words, European Union&#151;inspection. That is not being done. There is no point having the regulation if the European Union, having produced it, is failing to enforce it. The end of the journey is of particular concern, given that so much of the trade is to Italy, and it is apparent that checks at some of the staging posts after the horse has been travelling for many, many hours are still not being carried out correctly.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC389"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC389</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000018"></a>The second main issue is the need to negotiate on the revised regulation. A series of issues needs attention. First, it is extraordinary that there is no limit on the absolute length of the journey. I understand that an attempt was made to impose such a limit but was rejected by those responsible for drafting the regulation. Will the Government give a clear undertaking that they will press for an absolute limit on the length of journeys? Secondly, although the requirement is that there should be a stop every 24 hours, given the conditions of heat, crowding and so on, that period is far too long before the horses are taken off the truck and rested. We should also insist that inspections should not operate just at a local level.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000019"></a>One may well ask: why is this trade happening at all? As far as one can establish, it is because, if the animal is slaughtered in Italy, it is said to have its origin in Italy. If nothing else, this is a fraud on the Italian consumer of horse meat. It is always difficult to negotiate something sensible on places of origin, but, none the less, if there were proper labelling, the incentive to ship the poor horses across Europe before they were killed would be significantly diminished and the pressure would be for a carcass trade, instead of the trade that we have at the present time.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000020"></a>One is grateful for being provided with an hour&#146;s debate on this, but one is time-limited and I have come to the end of my limit. Finally, the penalties in the current regulation&#151;a &#163;5,000 fine or six months&#146; imprisonment&#151;are totally inadequate. How many of these penalties have been imposed, or are they simply in the regulation as a face-saving device and not operated in practice? I look forward to the reply of the Minister, which I hope will do something to improve the present situation which, as I said earlier, is disgusting.</p>

As he has said, more than 100,000 horses are transported for slaughter into and within the European Union. The majority are destined for slaughterhouses for human food in Italy. A smaller number of horses from Spain go to Italy. As my noble friend said, the conditions of transport are quite appalling. The animals are often old and broken down. They are mixed together with other species; they are crowded together; some collapse, never to get up; and some die on the way. The situation is appalling.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000022"></a>European Union regulations on the welfare of animals in transport, including horses, ponies and donkeys, came into effect in January 2007. But they do not contain any journey times and the member states of the EU have been unable to agree on journey limits. This means that animals can be transported across the whole of the European Union in one journey&#151;for example, from eastern Europe to Italy.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>

It is also a requirement that animals may not resume their journey until they have been inspected by a veterinary surgeon and have been found fit to travel. World Horse Welfare, formerly the International League for the Protection of Horses, has well documented and filmed evidence of regulations being ignored regarding horses transported from eastern Europe.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000024"></a>The European Commission has stated that EC Regulation 1/2005 will be reviewed in 2009 rather than 2011, and that issues such as stocking density, journey times and so on will be addressed. Studies of horse transport published last week in the <I>Veterinary Record</I> reported cortisone mediated stress and significant reductions in immunological parameters in horses undergoing the 24-hour journey by road. The inclusion of a 12-hour stopover for rest and feeding interrupted this immunological decline. Anyone who has seen video footage of horse transport from Eastern Europe cannot but be appalled at the inhumane treatment of these animals. By far the most humane way of shipping horsemeat to Italy is on the hook and not on the hoof.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000025"></a>Other countries are responding to this issue, and I am grateful for information provided by the ILPH which shows that Poland, for example, is responding to this. In 2001, Poland exported 40,000 horses to Italy, but by 2005 the figure had reduced to 31,000. Clearly, Poland is interested in exporting on the hook rather than on the hoof. It may be that other countries could follow Poland, but obviously there is still a long way to go.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000026"></a>The two organisations that are principally concerned with this traffic have been mentioned by my noble friend. They are World Horse Welfare, previously the International League for the Protection of Horses, in which I must declare a past interest as a former member of the council and a trustee, and the Donkey Sanctuary in Sidmouth in Devon. These organisations collaborate closely. World Horse Welfare is largely concerned with the traffic from eastern European states to Italy, while the Donkey Sanctuary is concerned with donkeys being exported not only from eastern European countries such as Romania to Italy for human consumption, but also, I am informed, the trade in donkeys from Bulgaria via Belgium to Northern Ireland. The port authorities in Northern Ireland have stated that in 2006 some 600 donkeys entered Northern Ireland, and that 400 entered in 2007. No data are yet available for the current year. Where they go on to from Northern Ireland is unclear. Some go to Scotland, while some are slaughtered and the meat re-exported to Europe. It is well known that in France and Switzerland, horsemeat is a delicacy. According to Donkey Sanctuary personnel, the conditions under which these animals are transported from Bulgaria to, eventually, Northern Ireland are very poor, so the same problems arise there as we see in horses being moved to Italy.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000027"></a>It is highly likely that much more needs to be uncovered about the transport of horses, donkeys and ponies for meat, including abuses and that there is much we do not know about. We should be grateful to my noble friend Lord Higgins for bringing this situation to the attention of the House, and for his request for action on the part of the Government.</p>

I hope that that will be in order.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000029"></a>I first declare an interest. I have been and still am a small donor to the ILPH, the charity about which my noble friend Lord Higgins spoke. As a child, I was brought up with horses; my mother was previously a riding instructor. I reflect the comments that my colleagues have made and add my abhorrence for this trade. I understand that we no longer export horses to go for human consumption on the continent; I should like that clarified when the Minister responds.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000030"></a>On enforcement, we are talking about 100,000 horses each year. My noble friend suggested that there were not many prosecutions; I should like to know how many there were. I should also like to know how many inspectors there are across Europe to cover the trade. To follow up my noble friend's suggestion that it is a local authority responsibility, are the inspectors there at a national level or are they a local authority responsibility and therefore a local authority appointment? What is the highest penalty allowed to be imposed?</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000031"></a>I have concerns about transporting these horses for miles. Clearly, transporting any animal and then having it killed affects the quality of the meat itself. The stress to the animal before it is killed is something that most of us who have worked with livestock are very well aware of. Nowadays, we have modern refrigeration units in virtually all countries. It seems illogical when reviewing the statutory instrument not to consider whether it is now time that we stopped the practice of transporting these animals miles before they are killed. Has that suggestion been put forward, because if not, it should be?</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000032"></a>I am delighted to see my noble friend Lady Trumpington in her place. We were talking yesterday about the fact that there used to be a practice of bringing horses across the sea from Argentina all the way to Italy. Does that practice still go on and, if so, what is being done about it? Do other horses get shipped across the continent before they then start on their long journeys?</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000033"></a>Finally&#151;I am sorry to be so brief, but I do not want to abuse the Committee's time&#151;although I am sure that the lorry drivers are qualified as lorry drivers, I am concerned that they may not be good stockmen. If you are taking animals on and off, even if it is only at the end of 24 hours, surely there should be some requirement of stock ability in addition to being able to drive the animals across. My understanding is that when Europe originally legislated for a 24-hour journey, it provided for eight hours of travelling, six hours on a vehicle stationary and a further eight hours of travel before a 24-hour lay over, but I understand that that was still on board. Can the Minister confirm that the animals are definitely off board&#151;unloaded&#151;and for how long they are unloaded before they begin that cycle again? What is the time lapse after they are unloaded before they can continue on their journey?</p>

<p><a name="08051565000034"></a>I am hugely grateful to my noble friend Lord Higgins for bringing this important short debate to us this afternoon. I think that all of us in this country find this trade abhorrent, but on the continent it is quite a well-known practice. That does not mean that we should not try to influence colleagues abroad to ensure that, if it has to continue&#151;I hope that it does not&#151;the welfare of animals is the highest priority and legal enforcement is carried out correctly.</p>

He and I have responded to the Minister on occasion about this subject on the Floor of the House. This subject goes back a very long way for me. At the age of eight, I used to sit on our garden wall and watch a horse sale every two weeks. Very often, unbroken ponies were brought straight off the Black Mountains in Talgarth, Wales, where I was brought up. There were teenagers blocking the roads at both ends, catching unbroken horses and demonstrating on them. It was a bit like the Wild West; in fact, it was the Wild West in those days. Horse dealers were there, deals were done on the spot, hands were knocked off to clinch deals, and transport was often by train. I graduated at the age of 10 to the official status of drover in the local market with sheep and cattle. It was part of the university of life as far as I was concerned; I learnt a lot.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000036"></a>The transportation of horses in particular for slaughter has occupied my mind. We have been very much enlightened by the description by other contributors to the debate of EC Regulation 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport. As has been said, that has been updated and a review has been brought forward to 2009. I hope that we will see a great improvement in the way in which that regulation is policed. The United Kingdom has quite a good record in this respect. For example, we have regulations that enable longer journeys to take place across distances within the United Kingdom, such as from the Highlands to further south. We have the eight-hour maximum time for cattle and sheep.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000037"></a>As has been said, enforcement is important. The regulation is much more binding that a directive as far as the European Union is concerned, and the enforcement of regulations is clearly lacking in many EU states. That particularly applies to eastern Europe and Italy, and to some other countries such as Greece. The fact that it is subject to documentation and inspection of vehicles is very good, and that should be done by the European Commission Food and Veterinary Office. It is not clear that that is done very often, and that is a serious loophole as far as the welfare of the animals is concerned. Journey times and space allowance still remain huge problems. As far as I can ascertain from the only information that I can glean about the UK, horses are not exported for slaughter, but approximately 500 horses are exported annually from the UK for breeding purposes. No information on numbers for slaughter is available, and I sometimes wonder, when ponies are worth between &#163;10 and &#163;20, and the passport costs &#163;22, what happens to some of those poor specimens that are sold every autumn.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000038"></a>In 1998, the Polish audit commission criticised irregularities in the transport of animals and insufficient veterinary controls on the export of horses for slaughter to Italy. Comments were made up to 2005. My statistics are not as recent, but apparently Polish exports went down from 80,000 to 40,000 by 2003. It was said earlier that the figure is now down to about 31,000. Of course, it is far more desirable that the meat is exported and not the live animals; that is a far better solution. There is still a problem of increasing live horse exports from Spain to Italy. One problem for the EU to sort out is that animals slaughtered there are recorded as not of Italian origin, but as of the origin of the country from which they come.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000039"></a>Finally, World Horse Welfare reports as of now that there are more than 100,000 horses transported for slaughter into and within the EU, but we should take note of the fact that 84 per cent of those go to Italy. That is a massive majority going there.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000040"></a>There is also the whole issue of EU regulations which state that after travelling for 24 hours, horses going for slaughter must be unloaded and rested. I can only agree with others who have said that 24 hours is far too long a period anyway. World Horse Welfare is of course lobbying for shorter journey limits and slaughtering as close as possible to the premises of origin, preferably in the same country. The RSPCA is conducting campaigns on the same lines. As has already been said, future enforcement should ensure that the regulations are adhered to, and in particular we hope that the amended regulations which should be in place by 2009 will be enforced properly. We hope also that record keeping and the condition of transporters will be regularly inspected to ensure that everything is in order, which clearly is not the case at the present time.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000042"></a>This is a passionate issue. World Horse Welfare, as we must get used to saying, tells us that around 100,000 horses from countries such as Poland&#151;I was interested in what my noble friend Lord Soulsby had to say about the situation in that country&#151;Romania, Spain, Lithuania and Belarus are packed into lorries and trucked thousands of miles in appalling conditions to the abattoirs of Italy where they are slaughtered for meat. It appears that Italy is the principal destination of this trade, but overall some 140,000 horses are imported into the European Union each year. If we have any information, it would be useful to know where these animals come from. My noble friend Lady Byford mentioned Argentina. Are horses coming in from outside the EU, although obviously Belarus is a non-EU country?</p>

<p><a name="08051565000043"></a>Legislation is in place Europe-wide, but horses still suffer as it is not enforced, and in many cases it is clearly ignored. What representations have Her Majesty&#146;s Government made to Italy, which after all is the principal consumer and therefore may be in a position to do something about this trade? In the UK, we have a horses transport order and a licensing system in place. Sport, competition and breeding are all legitimate reasons for transporting live horses. But from the UK, horse movements are monitored and tabulated. In fact, contrary to what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, I have before me statistics to show the number of horses that have been exported for breeding, riding or competition work over the past few years. In the UK, we can be assured that we have considerable control over this. Indeed, we also have a passport system. What is the Minister&#146;s view on continuing with the horse passport laws now that we have further regulation in place? If he is confident that that is being enforced, is there still a need for horse passports? It may be that there is.</p>

<p><a name="08051565000044"></a>The problem is not a question of diet. Distasteful as the eating of horsemeat may be to many of us, we have to accept that different countries have different traditions in these matters. What we eat in this country is abhorrent in others, so that is not the issue. But the welfare of animals in transit is an issue that should concern us. Moreover, there is a difference between farm animals and the particular vulnerability of equines in transit. My noble friend Lord Higgins mentioned the mixing of stallions and mares, and small ponies and large draft horses, which can result in injuries during travel. Perhaps I can add edge to the argument if I quote from a report from Trieste on a research trip carried out by the international league last August. It stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051565000172"></a>&#147;Three loads of horses were at this staging post; one from Poland and two from Romania (one of which arrived during our visit). The staging post was in poor repair. The horses were separated into mixed groups of up to eight&#151;fights broke out regularly due to a generally stressed environment. The Romanian load comprised 26 horses that had travelled for around 18 hours. They were separated into groups of up to eight&#151;some with halters, some without (the majority of those without halters had halters put on for unloading). The horses showed signs of extreme dehydration (concertinaed skin), exhaustion (heads low), fear (some reluctant to unload), bruising (kick and bite marks). There was also a suspected heavily pregnant mare. One particular mare (who was in a compartment with six large working type horses) had collapsed on the lorry due to exhaustion, which was evident when they tried to unload her&#151;it took her 20 minutes to get her to her feet and when she did she was extremely unsteady.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051565000173"></a>Injuries were also obvious on the animals that were in situ when we arrived, including: bite and kick marks; severe dehydration ... facial injuries. Stallions were showing severe signs of stress as they were tethered next to mares. Fights were breaking out regularly&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051565000171"></a>This is not acceptable to us these days.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000045"></a>If the current legislative protection is not enough, we must seek fresh ways of tackling and enforcing action against this abuse on a European-wide basis. All noble Lords have said that modern refrigeration makes live transport unnecessary. The way that many horses are treated is unacceptable.</p>

I agree with him that this is an excellent format for exploring an issue like this. This is the first time that I have spoken within this framework and I realise how much I appreciate the opportunities that this form of debate provides. When one or two of my colleagues asked whether I would need buttressing in this debate by supporting me with their presence, I said that this would be one of the occasions on which I was likely to be in almost complete concord with speeches from the Opposition&#151;Conservative or Liberal Democrat. I am pleased to say that that is exactly how I feel, having heard the speeches.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000047"></a>There is no doubt that what has been expressed today is that great British affinity with and love of horses and the fact that we look upon them as animals to be cherished; but we are aware that different values obtain elsewhere. As the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, indicated in his thoughtful contribution, it is not for us to dictate the mores of other countries and their patterns of consumption, but it is for us to be concerned about animal welfare. That is how all noble Lords have addressed this issue with regard to the problems that arise.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000048"></a>I have difficulty in responding to the mention by the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, of trafficking to Northern Ireland, because I do not have a detailed note. That was the only reference to this issue in relation to the United Kingdom because, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, properly said, we have a rigorous system in this country regarding the transport of horses.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000049"></a>It is true that inspection is carried out by local authorities, but noble Lords will recognise that it is for each member state to abide by the regulation and to bring its practice into consort with the regulation. But inspection is for those members states. I can see the enormous anxiety about how effective local inspection might be in some countries. On the other hand, we must recognise that some countries have extensive land masses, and it may be better that there is some national supervision. Suffice it to say that we are not in a position to say much about that; we are in a position to make all our representations on the effectiveness of the regulation. We are not in much of a position to say how countries enforce them; save that our concern is how effectively they are enforced.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000050"></a>I am not in any way, shape or form seeking to detract from the pressure that is represented by all noble Lords who have spoken so eloquently in this debate about their views, which I entirely share. We are reflecting the fact that other countries approach horses and their transport differently. First, on the extent to which they go for slaughter, Italy is an important destination. It is also the case that such countries look on horse meat as being part of an attractive diet. I remember the first time I went to France, as a hitch-hiking student. We gaily ordered steak at what looked to be an extraordinary bargain price, and it was not until we chewed somewhat ineffectively for 20 minutes on a small slice of the steak that we realised that there was a difference between the definitions of meat in France and in the United Kingdom. One learns from those

I am going back rather a long time when I recall my student days. Horses go for slaughter to Italy because there is a great demand for them to be turned into horse meat.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000051"></a>What can we do about it? The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is right. We want to see an improvement in the regulation. It is good that Europe has brought forward the review of the position to 2009, because it reflects the anxieties that are held not just by us but by many other states, which have the same perspective. I am not suggesting for a moment that we are without friends in these representations. I am indicating what every noble Lord recognises; that we are up against formidable perspectives in some countries about these issues and on the definition of cruelty to animals, particularly horses.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000052"></a>I have nothing to say to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford&#151;who used the gap as we would expect, to speak with great effectiveness&#151;about the Italy/Argentina link. I have no doubt that there is an important supply of horses to Italy. She will recognise that the regulation seems to have a marginal impact on the horses that come in by sea. Even my geography indicates to me that Argentina is some way outside the European Community, so it is not in the framework of the regulation. I bear in mind the point that she made, which is illustrative of the nature of the problem.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000053"></a>The Government&#146;s position is straightforward. We do not think that horses should be transported for slaughter at all. We want to see that stopped. It is better that they are slaughtered relatively near to where they have come from than that they are transported in this iniquitous way. We must recognise that it is an extensive trade. There is no doubt that the enlargement of the Community has extended the trade. We take the view of the welfare organisations that we should, as best as possible, seek to make effective the regulation. Let us be fair to the member states; the regulation has only existed since 2005, so we have only three years of experience. As with any regulation, I do not need to talk too extensively to Members of this Committee about the differential implementation of European regulations across Europe. The British Government scrupulously observe the regulation, and I do not think that there has been any criticism in this debate about what happens in the UK. The task of influencing others is much more difficult. We agree with noble Lords about the weaknesses of the 2005 position, such as the length of time for which horses are in these vehicles without any relief or release from confinement during the journey.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000054"></a>There is an issue about the qualification of drivers&#151;again, we license and therefore have strict controls over this&#151;and the question of the crews who drive these great lorries over vast distances. Indeed, we will make representations to this effect. I emphasise the crews because on the whole in the UK we are used to lorries doing 400 or 500 miles at the very most. One recognises when talking about a trade such as this, however, that the trucks can go for well over a 1,000 miles quite comfortably&#151;or rather very uncomfortably, given the length of time. The qualification, however, is about lorry-driver competence rather than animal welfare and concern. That is a difficult nut for us to crack.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000055"></a>Noble Lords&#151;I am looking particularly at the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor&#151;will recognise that when it comes to transport, we are all too well aware of the difficulties of transport regulation and driver competence. What is being sought here is additional competence in relation to the welfare of animals. We agree with that. We are looking at 2009 and the revision as an opportunity to answer exactly the points that have been emphasised so well here today. We do think that we should have maximum limits on the length of time that horses are kept in vehicles when they travel. We are concerned that the standards in Europe should improve and match our own, so we are concerned about the mix of animals to which the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, referred. It is important that there is effective segregation. The space allowance in the vehicle is crucial to the animal&#146;s comfort.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000056"></a>We are looking to make progress on those matters, but I confess to the Committee this obvious point; nothing has been expressed today about the intent of Her Majesty&#146;s Government, who do nothing else but subscribe entirely. We recognise the representations on welfare, and we also know the obvious interest of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, in this matter. He mentioned five years, but I have no doubt that his interest in this issue goes back further than that, and he has taken this excellent opportunity today to put the Government under pressure. We do not need pressure in terms of our intent. The challenge for us is building up effective alliances to get effective change to the regulation.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000057"></a>As I say, we make due allowance for the fact that the regulation has existed for only three years. Nevertheless, the levels of abuse that have been identified so accurately in all the speeches that have been made today are such that we can substantiate our case for the necessary improvement of the regulation. I give the Committee the obvious assurance that we will make all the representations that we can for change in 2009, but I return to the fundamental point that was generously recognised by such knowledgeable Members on all sides; in talking about the transport of horses, we are also up against a perspective on the value of horses, which in some parts of Europe is somewhat different from the United Kingdom. That is one of the great challenges that we must overcome.</p>

Will he be kind enough to check whether the penalties are actually being imposed in any country, or whether they are totally ineffective? I realise that he will not have the answer now, but it would be really interesting in negotiations, if the penalties have not been imposed at all, to stop this charade.</p>

I apologise for that. The maximum figure is &#163;5,000. I do not have information on the extent to which that is imposed, but I will look into the matter.

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>

<h5><a name="08051565000179"></a>3 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08051565000061"></a><a name="80515-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80515-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08051565000197"></a>Viscount Montgomery of Alamein</b> asked Her Majesty&#146;s Government whether the passenger safety and environmental protection regulations covering tourist ships in Antarctic waters are satisfactory.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000062"></a>The noble Viscount said: As I have no right of reply, perhaps I may say that I am extremely grateful to all noble Lords who are taking part in the debate. I am particularly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, for agreeing to answer the debate on behalf of the Department for Transport, which is what it is really all about.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000063"></a>On 15 January last year, in the short debate on the International Polar Year 2007-08, I drew attention to the increase of shipping during the Antarctic summer tourist season, and the risk of accidents. Sadly, this was all too prescient as within a month, the MS &#147;Nordkapp&#148; ran aground, sustaining a big gash in her bow. But worse was to come. In November last year, the Liberian registered ship &#147;Explorer&#148; hit an iceberg and sank. The crew and passengers were all evacuated to lifeboats, but they were open lifeboats. Very fortunately, the sea was calm and they were all picked up several hours later. If the weather conditions had been less favourable&#151;high seas are quite frequent in that part of the world&#151;they would have survived only a few minutes in the sub-zero water, thereby causing a major marine catastrophe.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000064"></a>So that is what this short debate is all about, and we need to know from the Government what measures are being taken to ensure that there are adequate controls on the number and quality of the tourist ships visiting Antarctica. Obviously, the British Government do not control this matter, but we are important members of the International Maritime Organisation, located in London, and great supporters of the British Antarctic Survey located in Cambridge. The issue was raised by the UK at the Antarctic treaty consultative meeting in Delhi last year, and I hope that it will be raised again at the Kiev meeting in June.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000065"></a>A free, specialised sat-nav service is currently available, which gives high-resolution sea ice and iceberg information. I do not know whether &#147;Explorer&#148; had this system&#151;if it had, of course it would not have sunk. British input is via the British Antarctic Survey, but the funding comes from the European Space Agency. This means that we have to deal with the Brussels bureaucracy, which is complicated and lethargic. Clearly, it would be advantageous if this vital sat-nav service was made mandatory and provided free. Can the Minister press the European Space Agency for this to happen? Clearly, it would be a great advantage.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000066"></a>We also need to be concerned about the large number of British citizens cruising in ever-increasing numbers of ever-larger vessels in a fragile and often hostile area of great natural beauty. This has both  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC399"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC399</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>environmental and safety implications. The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators provides a self-regulating framework and manages the traffic, but I do not think that it has the power to limit the size or numbers of vessels. Is this really adequate in the light of what happened last season?</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000067"></a>Other questions that need to be answered were raised at the last IMO marine environment protection meeting. They include: should ships burning heavy fuel oil be banned? Clearly, it would be very damaging if leaks occurred. Should ships without ice-strengthened hulls be banned? Are crew training standards adequate? Clearly, the UK cannot issue mandatory instructions to foreign-flagged vessels in international waters. The IMO is the only body that can impose international standards covering equipment and procedures. I understand that an IMO sub-committee has been appointed to consider design and equipment in ice-covered waters but that it is not expected to report until some time next year, by which time another Antarctic tourist season will have passed. Can anything be done to speed up these proceedings?</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000068"></a>I appreciate that I have posed a great number of questions for the Minister with whom I discussed this issue in advance, but they are mainly to be followed up by his department, although anything he can say today will be very much appreciated and will help the cause forward.</p>
<h5><a name="08051565000180"></a>3.05 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08051565000069"></a><a name="80515-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80515-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08051565000198"></a>Lord Greenway:</b> I thank my noble friend Lord Montgomery for raising this important topic which has been focused by recent events in the Antarctic, as he said.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000070"></a>In some ways, this is not purely an Antarctic problem. There have been a number of instances up in the Arctic as well, especially in the Spitsbergen area. We do not need to go back to the 1930s when the Germans took an interest in cruising in those waters. Indeed, a large German company lost a ship in the 1930s. Therefore, we are not dealing with anything new here. However, as my noble friend said, the real change is the enormous increase in cruise tourism, certainly within the past 15 or 20 years. I did a cruise up in the Spitsbergen area and I am well aware of the difficulties that can arise for people who are not wary of what might happen. In fact, there was an incident only last year where a small Russian ship got too close to a calving glacier, a large portion came tumbling down and the resulting wave injured a number of passengers on board that vessel.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000071"></a>One of the tour guides on my cruise was a great expert on wildlife and ice and had spent many years down in Antarctica on the &#147;Explorer&#148; under her former name the &#147;Lindblad Explorer&#148;. As he was coming away from Antarctica on a small Russian ship, they came across a single pillar of ice standing up out of the ocean, which I think he said was 300 to 400 feet high. They stood off this ice, luckily not too close, because as they looked at it, the thing collapsed. He had some of the most amazing photographs I have ever seen showing this huge finger of ice crashing down to the sea, causing enormous waves. Even standing  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC400"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC400</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some way off, the ship was rolled severely backwards and forwards by the backwash, so all sorts of hazards can arise.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000072"></a>I wish to comment briefly on environmental issues. Huge concern was expressed in Antarctica in the early days when larger cruise ships started calling there, mainly expressing anxiety that too many people were going ashore. It was thought that they might damage the fragile environment. Measures have been taken to try to limit the number of passengers going ashore at any one time. However, it was pointed out at the time that the damage done by cruise ship passengers was not as great as that done by scientists and researchers who spend years down there, because things do not degrade in those low temperatures and the detritus&#151;if one might call it that&#151;from Captain Scott&#146;s expeditions is still sitting there untouched. Things hang around for a very long time.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000073"></a>My noble friend Lord Montgomery mentioned the recent incidents. There is one other concern with regard to Antarctica, which was brought to light when the captain of the Royal Navy&#146;s ice patrol ship &#147;HMS Endurance&#148; gave a talk to the Parliamentary Maritime Group two or three years ago. He showed us some fascinating underwater pictures taken by the new side-scanning sonar. Developments such as that are making a big difference to what we know about the underwater profile down there. He still thinks that lack of good charting in that part of the world is one of the major risks. No doubt as more and more research ships go down there&#151;I believe that the Norwegians have just ordered a very sophisticated new ship to look at Arctic and Antarctic waters&#151;they will help us to have a lot more knowledge about the seabed configuration.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000074"></a>The cruise ships tend to go to the same anchorages all the time. They tend to get very familiar with them. When the ship is anchored there, they will put down crew in small boats and make their own soundings, so they produce what are termed mug shots, so they are pretty well aware of what goes on where they anchor; it is only when they are transiting towards the open sea that the real danger occurs.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000075"></a>My noble friend Lord Montgomery also mentioned that larger and larger ships are becoming involved. Princess Cruises has sent two 100,000-tonne ships down to Antarctica in the past two or three years. Those ships can carry up to 3,500 passengers and burn heavy fuel, as my noble friend rightly said, whereas smaller ships, such as the one that sank recently, run on diesel oil, which is much thinner. In the case of the &#147;Nordkapp&#148;, the Norwegian ship, where some fuel was spilt when they were shifting it from tank to tank, it evaporated very quickly and no adverse results were found when the area was looked at a little while later.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000076"></a>The other thing that I would say in support of large ships is that, as the Committee may imagine, they cost a huge amount of money, so it is in the cruise company&#146;s interest to ensure that nothing adverse happens to them. Also, because of their size, they are much more compartmented than smaller ships, so hitting a small iceberg would not necessarily have the same effect as what happened to the &#147;Explorer&#148;. As far as I know, that has not really been explained. There was talk of a fist-sized hole, and I am still rather surprised that a  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC401"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC401</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fist-sized hole managed effectively to capsize a ship so quickly, but as she is lying quite a few thousand feet under the sea, I do not suppose that we will ever find out.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000077"></a>Finally, I come to the situation with the International Maritime Organisation, to which, again, my noble friend alluded. The IMO is responsible for international maritime safety regulations, as I am sure that the Minister is only too well aware. I understand that it has undertaken to rewrite, not just amend, the guidelines for operation in the Arctic and Antarctic waters; I should be grateful if the Minister could confirm that. Also, a correspondence group has been set up, with Canada acting as co-ordinator. That group will report in time for the IMO working group discussion early next year. It is hoped that life-saving equipment, search and rescue planning and response and other issues will be fully addressed.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000078"></a>In their own best interests, cruise companies operate within well established safety management systems as required by the IMO. In addition, as we heard, the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators has set up emergency contingency plans and recommendations that include participation in a database that details the position of ships and includes a list of emergency equipment available on board, agreement to assist any other vessel in the event of an emergency and is looking into carrying ice pilots. Another development that cruise companies are actively instigating concerns their planning for going down Antarctic waters. They look at pairing ships so that there is a buddy ship in the area capable of taking off the crew of another craft if there is a major incident. That is a useful step forward.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000079"></a>These developments are usually brought upon us by disasters, but unfortunately one cannot always act as quickly as one would like. Although the machinations of the International Maritime Organisation may seem to be a little slow, I think that that is the correct way of dealing with these matters, and I can only say that I hope that we will not suffer another, and possibly worse, incident in the mean time.</p>

I will keep away from the environmental issues, which are quite serious. Although it is unclear whether the science all points in one direction, we should be very cautious about causing further depredations in the Antarctic area. The need for safety and training has been emphasised. Oddly enough, when I was putting my contribution together, the person who helps me in the Whips&#146; Office said that a friend of theirs was actually on the ship that rescued the people who were cast into the sea when the &#147;Explorer&#148; sank. That incident resulted in a considerable interruption to their cruise as well, in that they were kept in their cabins for three days and all their food was brought to them&#151;presumably so that the two groups of people could be kept apart, I do not know. It is important that people who go into these somewhat uncertain waters are properly trained and that a sufficient number can speak a language

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000081"></a>I was pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, say that the IMO is doing all sorts of things to avoid risks to tourist ships, and I certainly accept that if people are sending large ships to Antarctica, it is in their own interests to ensure that they are properly prepared for anything they might meet. Tourism is increasing in many fragile parts of the world. Something that the IMO and others ought to take up is the fact that as far as possible, they should ensure that they consume their own smoke, that they should not dump waste, and that they do not interfere any more than necessary with the environment. We must not make things worse.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000082"></a>What I would particularly like to hear from the Minister when he winds up the debate is whether the Government have any intention of reducing the personnel strength or the equipment at the disposal of the British Antarctic Survey. The survey makes a valuable contribution to science, one that we would not wish to lose. In fact, it conducts a lot of vital research. I have been reading about some of its work, and while it does not say that this or that will happen, it does say that we should be careful about this or that and stresses the need for the scientific measurement of what is actually going on. There appear to be quite a few possibly alarmist stories, so we need the facts. If, in his summary, the Minister is able to say something about the funding of the British Antarctic Survey, that would help a lot.</p>

Before doing any research, I was quite relaxed about this subject, and I thought that I had a grasp of the issue. I assure noble Lords that I am no longer at all relaxed. This is a new topic for me, but I will be following it up in future months. The noble Viscount has done an excellent job in posing the Question, and I will not repeat all his work. While the environmental concerns must not be ignored&#151;they are real concerns&#151;I will confine my remarks to maritime safety.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000084"></a>In January 1975, the motorship &#147;Lovat&#148; sank in a force 8 to 9 gale. The 13-man crew took to the life raft at 06.30 hours. By 07.45, they had been seen by a cross-channel ferry. By 08.00, they had the first helicopter support on scene, and by 08.30, only two hours later, 10 of the 13 crew members had died from hypothermia or drowning. That happened 29 kilometres south-west of Land&#146;s End.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000085"></a>The reason they died was, despite being commercial seamen, they had not been properly trained and they did not understand the need to conserve body heat, keep the covering of the life raft shut and keep bailing water out. All of that is very difficult to do in a storm. I am not convinced that passengers on cruise ships are anywhere near well enough trained to survive in similar circumstances, let alone far more difficult circumstances in the Southern Ocean or Antarctica. Of course in an evacuation the aim would be to have at least one

Leadership in a survival situation&#151;which is what it would be&#151;is absolutely vital.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000086"></a>If a human is immersed in seawater at anywhere near freezing point, his survival time is measured in minutes. It is minutes in the water, and it is hours in the life raft, unless you have done everything absolutely correctly. Other noble Lords have correctly identified risks arising from the remoteness and the merciless environment. In one of those disasters in the Southern Ocean, you could easily have to wait 24 hours or more for a rescue ship to arrive. There is virtually no chance of a suitable rescue helicopter&#151;there may be a small utility helicopter&#151;being available, because it is far out of range, and the ships in the area would not be equipped to support the helicopters. It would be extremely difficult, slow and distressing to rescue hundreds, or maybe thousands, of passengers directly from the sea to a ship in the Southern Ocean. In a storm, it does not bear thinking about. A significant proportion of cruise passengers are senior citizens, because that is when people can afford to go on a cruise, or they may be other than fully able bodied. Can the Minister say whether it is legal for a cruise company offering an Antarctic cruise to discriminate on the grounds of disability?</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000087"></a>In his reply, the Minister will say that the ships are first class, the crew are specially trained, they have special equipment, they have an Antarctic pilot, and the increase in the number of ships in the area will speed up a rescue if the worst happens. To an extent, all of that is true; but undoubtedly there is an increased risk of this problem occurring.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000088"></a>In his reply, the Minister will tell us that the situation is not out of control and that unreasonable risks are not being taken. He will tell us about the 102 operators in the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, which the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, covered so well in his speech. But not all operators have signed up and the ones who are not signed up will be the ones who are not operating to the highest possible standards. In any case, accidents are notoriously difficult completely to eliminate, no matter how big the ship is. Of course, the Minister will not point out that the IMO has some serious problems. Influence within the IMO lies with Panama, Liberia and the Bahamas, and their interests are not absolutely coincident with ours in this matter. It is well known that it is extremely difficult to get safety changes implemented.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000089"></a>I am concerned that life-saving equipment may not be tested under realistic conditions. How is life-saving equipment&#151;life rafts and lifebelts&#151;being tested? Are we using professional divers in a swimming pool at UK ambient temperatures, rather than using lay people in a defined sea state and temperature? I have been briefed that one&#146;s hands become as lumps of rubber and totally numb after only a few minutes when wet at near-zero or subzero temperatures.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000090"></a>I am not qualified to state the probability of having to disembark a ship in the Atlantic or the Southern Ocean, but in my opinion the risk is increasing. Although the problem may be low risk, the impact of such an incident will be absolutely devastating. The international media will be there immediately. As we know, successful  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC404"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC404</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rescue could be extremely difficult and slow unless we are, as we have been, very lucky with the weather. It could take at least 24 hours to get a suitable rescue ship on the scene, so I hope that the Minister has a media plan for dealing with that, because the UK Government, despite all our capabilities nationally, will be powerless to do anything about it.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000091"></a>What should the Minister do? His problem is that shipping is an international activity, with freedom of the seas an underlying principle. As other noble Lords have pointed out, regulation has to be on an international basis, but the mechanism at the IMO may be flawed. The Minister also knows that national regulation would simply make UK operators uneconomic&#151;a point also made by noble Lords this afternoon. The underlying problem for transport Ministers is how the UN as a whole works. I think that that is slightly above their pay grade but also, I suspect, not a priority for the Prime Minister. My fear is that, one day, it suddenly will be the number one priority for the Prime Minister.</p>

He is very knowledgeable on the subject and has a track record and history of taking legislation through your Lordships' House on issues relating to the Antarctic, and a strong personal interest in issues relating to Antarctic exploration and travel to it. As he reminded us, last year he initiated a debate on the subject&#151;and prescient that debate was. Recent events have made another opportunity to discuss Antarctic matters very timely, with the issue of passenger safety and the need to protect the marine environment coming very much to the fore.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000093"></a>This afternoon, in this very short but important discussion, we have had some valuable and timely additions to contribution of the noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery, particularly from the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, who is a great marine expert and who commands tremendous respect on this subject. I confess that this issue is not one on which I have a ready knowledge, nor can I claim any depth of knowledge, but it has been fascinating to work through the briefing material and talk to officials and the noble Viscount. I have learnt something from this and I am extraordinarily grateful to all who have helped me. I thank all noble Lords who have contributed. I shall try to deal with as many of the points that have been raised as I possibly can. We have the benefit of some time.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000094"></a>The Antarctic is a place of great beauty and wonder&#151;a pristine environment like no other on earth. It is a truism to say that it is an area of global significance due to its profound impact on the world&#146;s climate and ocean systems. With climate change being very much to the fore of our thinking, that significance and its importance are increasing. The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, drew attention to that in his concluding comments. It is not going to be far away from our thinking. The land mass occupies something like a tenth of the overall land mass of the globe and has a profound effect on the environment.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000095"></a>The area is attracting an increasing number of tourists, and a number of noble Lords drew attention  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC405"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC405</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to that. That brings its own set of challenges. The world cruise industry is undergoing a strong renaissance. A record 4 million Europeans took a cruise last year, of which 1.3 million passengers came from the United Kingdom. That shows just how much we love to travel. Compare that with other nation states, and the figures are very different. Perhaps we are a curious nation.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000096"></a>Not long ago I took a taxi to my railway station. I said to the driver that I had not seen him for a while and he told me &#147;I&#146;ve been very busy&#148;. I asked, &#147;Have you been travelling?&#148;. He said, &#147;Yes, I have been travelling and have recently been to the Antarctic&#148;. I would wager that a generation ago, very few taxi drivers would even have contemplated a trip to the Antarctic and certainly they would not have set their meter running to get there. I was struck by that. It is symptomatic of the way that tourism and cruise tourism is developing.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000097"></a>The rate of growth is currently 17 per cent per annum. Cruising is a success story and the United Kingdom industry and our citizens are benefiting significantly from the opportunities afforded by this growth. It is a benign growth but one with challenges. It is benign because it extends and raises our interest levels and awareness of the wider world and globalisation. The Antarctic region is also becoming a destination of choice for many cruise ship operators. Until recently, few people other than scientists and explorers&#151;certainly not taxi drivers&#151;had ever visited Antarctica. In the past few years, however, the region, particularly the Antarctic Peninsula, has become a common destination on many cruise itineraries.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000098"></a>As concerns about climate change increase, the growth in the number of people seeing for themselves this vital region of the globe is not altogether a bad thing, given that it helps to spread the knowledge about this area and its contribution as a pivotal component of the earth&#146;s ecosystem. The UK recognises tourism as a legitimate activity under the Antarctic Treaty and we support the self-regulatory framework established by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators. Nevertheless, we are concerned to ensure that there is proper management of the tourism industry in the Antarctic and to set strict environmental guidelines. We are also concerned to ensure that tourism to the Antarctic is carefully planned and monitored to ensure the safety of those involved as well as to minimise the environmental impact of their activities.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000099"></a>The arrival of more cruise ships in Antarctic waters, some of which are very large indeed, poses certain risks, which were demonstrated by the sinking of the MS &#147;Explorer&#148; near the South Shetland Islands last November and referred to by noble Lords this afternoon. Fortunately, that marine casualty did not lead to any loss of life among the 154 passengers and crew on board at the time of the accident, nor did it have a major environmental impact. But there is, of course, no room for complacency, since there were a number of fortunate factors involved in that incident.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000100"></a>Governments are aware of the potential difficulties arising from operating cruise ships in Antarctic waters, and consideration will be given to how we can learn  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC406"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC406</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from the lessons of the MS &#147;Explorer&#148; when the results of the accident investigation are known. As noble Lords have rightly said, this is a matter for the International Maritime Organisation to take the lead on in due course. The Antarctic treaty parties have asked the IMO to consider guidelines for Antarctic shipping, which would be based on the existing Arctic Shipping Guidelines. The current guidelines include provisions on ship suitability and emergency equipment, to take up the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee. That has to include a requirement that all lifeboats carried by polar class ships should be of the fully enclosed type, to provide adequate shelter from the environment. The United Kingdom has been pressing for the guidelines to also apply to the Antarctic, and the IMO has indicated its intention to consider amending the current Arctic guidelines for use in both Arctic and Antarctic waters.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000101"></a>Safeguards are already in place. The Antarctic treaty&#146;s protocol on environmental protection of 1991, which has been implemented domestically through the Antarctic Act 1994, requires all activities in Antarctica to be planned to minimise the environmental impact. In addition, the UK has also implemented an agreement of the Antarctic treaty parties in 2004 that all tourism activities in that region must be able to demonstrate self-sufficient search-and-rescue and contingency plans.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000102"></a>All treaty-flagged or registered vessels entering Antarctica must have either a permit or licence to do so from one of the contracting parties to the Antarctic treaty. The United Kingdom is one of those parties, and the FCO issues permits, under the Antarctic Act 1994, following a checklist of relevant requirements. In addition, only ships carrying fewer than 500 passengers are allowed to disembark their passengers on Antarctica.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000103"></a>Hydrographic survey work and chart production also make an essential contribution to maritime safety. The United Kingdom continues to make a significant contribution, and the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office, supported by HMS &#147;Endurance&#148;, is the most active player in the production of Antarctic hydrographic charts.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000104"></a>Most vessels visiting the Antarctic region are not UK-registered, and therefore we have no statutory obligation to them. There are also a number of UK-based operators which operate ships in the area but choose to register their vessels outside the UK. Whatever the registration of the vessel concerned, they are good ship owners with a strong safety culture behind them. Corporate social responsibility is also a key component in improving the social, economic and environmental standards of shipping. That means doing more than the bare minimum needed to comply with legal requirements. After all, better crew standards lead to safer ships, safer ships lead to fewer accidents, and fewer accidents mean less cost and less damage to the environment.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000105"></a>The requirements for ships operating in Antarctica are underpinned by the Safety of Life at Sea Convention&#151;or SOLAS, as it is more commonly called&#151;the International Safety Management Code and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC407"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC407</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from Ships, which is commonly known as MARPOL. They are global safety requirements which are kept under constant review.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000106"></a>The stringent SOLAS requirements require the subdivision of passenger ships into watertight compartments, bilge-pumping arrangements and stability requirements to enable the ship to withstand significant accident damage. As I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, knows better than I, the degree of subdivision varies with the ship's length. Therefore, in this instance we can be enthusiastic about larger ships. There are also requirements covering machinery and electrical installations to ensure that services which are essential for the safety of the ship, passengers and crew are maintained under various emergency conditions.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000107"></a>SOLAS also details requirements for life-saving appliances such as lifeboats, rescue boats and lifejackets according to the type of ship. These provisions are supplemented by the International Life-Saving Appliance Code which provides specific technical requirements for life-saving appliances.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000108"></a>The International Safety Management Code also requires, for example, that ship operators have procedures to ensure the safe operation of ships and protection of the environment in compliance with relevant international legislation and to have procedures to respond to emergency situations.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000109"></a>Noble Lords mentioned that the increase in the number of vessels operating in Antarctica poses a risk to the marine environment. Safety and protecting the marine environment go hand in hand. By enhancing the safety of the passengers and crew, the marine environment is also being protected. Governments recognise, however, the need to protect the marine environment in such an important region. Ships operating in Antarctica must also comply with the relevant provisions of MARPOL. This is the main international instrument aimed at preventing ship-source pollution. The seas and coasts of Antarctica benefit, like all other seas and coasts around the world, from the protection afforded by the MARPOL provisions, and as Antarctica is designated as a special area for the purposes of the MARPOL provisions regulating discharges of oil, noxious liquid substances and garbage, the relevant standards are even more stringent for ships operating in these waters.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000110"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, said, passenger ships mainly use heavy grade oil for their propulsion. However, heavy grade oil is a highly polluting substance and can pose severe problems when spilled in icy conditions. Noble Lords will no doubt be pleased to learn that in response to the increasing number of passenger ships entering Antarctic waters and in recognition of the threat which heavy grade oil poses to the pristine Antarctic environment, work has been initiated in the IMO to develop a measure which will very substantially restrict the use and carriage of heavy grade oil in the Antarctic region.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000111"></a>The IMO&#146;s Sub-Committee on Bulk Liquids and Gases discussed the issue in some detail when it met in February 2008, and it is expected that this subject will be a high priority work programme at future sessions of the sub-committee. But ships can damage the environment in other ways which are much less obvious  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC408"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC408</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>than a heavy oil spill. The United Kingdom is leading the development of the interim Ballast Water Regional Management Plan for Antarctica so as to meet the requirements of Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, which deals with the conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora, and requires precautions to be taken to prevent the introduction of non-native species to the Antarctic treaty area, such as the marine organisms that may be found in the ballast water taken on board vessels to ensure stability. Such non-native species may cause serious ecological impacts if let out of a vessel with the discharge of ballast water into a different environment.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000112"></a>Of course, we need to ensure that both these environmental protection initiatives achieve their objectives. This brings me to the provisions of Annex VI of the 1991 Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty. This annex concerns the setting up of a liability regime for environmental emergencies which will impose strict liability for the costs of environmental damage following an accident in Antarctica. The liability regime will be covered by a system of compulsory insurance and the establishment of a fund to provide compensation. At present, only two of the 28 states required for entry into force have ratified the annex. While this is disappointing, the United Kingdom Government are keen to progress our ratification of the annex and we fully intend to introduce the necessary legislative proposal as soon as parliamentary time permits.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000113"></a>The measures in place are satisfactory to help ensure maritime safety and protect the environment, but we are not complacent, which is why we continue to play a leading role in seeking to strengthen the existing international arrangements.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000114"></a>Questions were raised, many of which I think I have probably answered. The noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery, asked how we might control cruise ships. We take the view that a simple ban is not realistic. Such bans would need global rather than individual action, and it is fair to say that there would be little likelihood that all Governments would agree. We think that the best approach is to continue to develop and raise global shipping standards more generally. We as a nation can be proud of the role that we have played, particularly through the IMO in advancing this.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000115"></a>The noble Viscount also talked about the size of vessels entering Antarctic waters. I referred to that. We recognise that the size of vessels entering Antarctic waters needs to be considered some more. Larger vessels, as I pointed out, tend to be newer. They are also built to a higher specification, with superior safety standards as compared with some of the smaller vessels. We must take a balanced view. There are protections through having larger vessels, but the potential for adverse environmental impacts is greater. We therefore need experts to consider this issue carefully and keep it very much under review.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000116"></a>The noble Viscount also referred to sat-nav. We see immediate benefits to this. The IMO is instituting a system of long-range identification and tracking of vessels. This system, coupled with the use of GPS, will assist in the monitoring of vessels in the region. That  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC409"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC409</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is very much to be encouraged, and we as a Government are trying to play our part in moving the IMO along in that general direction.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000117"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greenway, mentioned the rewriting of the Arctic and Antarctic guidelines and the pairing of cruise ships. That is a very important issue. I can confirm simply that the IMO is looking at the existing guidance. We do not quite know what the outcome of those investigations will be, but work is being pursued. The idea of pairing cruise ships to heighten safety is transparently a sensible notion that I understand is under active consideration.</p>

<p><a name="08051565000118"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, talked about training. He drew attention to the tragic incident off Land&#146;s End, and expressed a lack of confidence that training issues were being taken seriously. We do take those issues very seriously. In the guidelines that are issued to those who promulgate cruises in the area, that issue must be addressed by organisers and operators. Specific reference was made to the number of qualified crew, accompanying guides and expedition staff, who must be fully be apprised.</p>

The point is well made about the importance of ensuring that they have knowledge, so it is important to have guides and that some training is undertaken. I am sure that that takes place; part of the preparation plan has to be carefully tailored to that so that those who travel on those cruises are well aware of those issues. It is important that those issues are addressed and not underestimated, so that testing of equipment and passenger participation in understanding the impact that they can have is actively considered.</p>

I think that it was the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, who raised another issue about Antarctic survey work, and I was conscious that I had not answered that point either, so I will compose some correspondence and make sure that we properly research the funding arrangements for both those projects and will of course share that with other noble Lords who have participated.</p>

<p><a name="08051565000124"></a>The information comes late. I can tell noble Lords that the Antarctic survey forms part of the Natural Environmental Research Council work. We recognise the importance of the scientific contribution made by the BAS and the importance of research and associated monitoring continuing. Looking back, the discovery of the ozone hole in 1985 was an important result of its work, which underlines the value of that research work. I understand that the Natural Environmental Research Council is introducing new arrangements for the funding of science as part of its wider science strategy and will monitor the impact of those arrangements for its research centres, including the BAS but, as I say, I am happy to write to noble Lords with any more detail that can be usefully shared by all who have contributed.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000128"></a>The noble Baroness said: The Sainsbury Centre report, <I>Mental Health at Work</I>, was what alerted me to these serious issues and led me to table this Question. I need to declare an interest as an advisor to the trustees of the Sainsbury Centre, but I also have some experience of this, having been the chair of an NHS trust for four years and having seen several of my employees, numbering in the teens, who confessed to me after I had stepped down that they had been mentally ill during the time they were employed by the trust but had felt nervous about confessing to management that that was the case&#151;and this was in an NHS trust where 25 per cent of its functions were dedicated to mental health services. It is that situation which has made me very concerned about these issues.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000129"></a>The Sainsbury Centre report, <I>Developing the Business Case</I>, found that the cost to business of mental ill health at work is &#163;25.9 billion in the UK each year, which is just over &#163;1,000 for every employee in every workplace, and the equivalent of &#163;1.3 billion just in  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC411"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC411</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the NHS, because I suspect that my trust was no by means alone. More than half of that cost is the result of lost productivity in people who turn up for work. The term that is used&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has already told me that he thinks it is a terrible word&#151;is &#147;presenteeism&#148;. It means being present at work but not being of much use.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000130"></a>It has been calculated that sickness absence costs &#163;8.4 billion a year. Around 40 per cent of all sick days are taken for mental health problems, up to a total of some 70 million working days. Reduced productivity amounts to about &#163;15.1 billion and accounts for 1.5 times as many working days lost as sickness absence, but costs more because presenteeism is relatively more common among higher paid workers; lower paid workers are more likely to take time off sick. Staff turnover costs &#163;2.4 billion a year, which represents the costs inherent in replacing around 200,000 employees who leave their jobs because of mental ill health. This is a really huge issue and it is important to recognise that only 15 per cent of these costs are caused by work-related mental distress. Most mental distress arises for other reasons and from other causes; stress and distress are very different things.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000131"></a>I turn again to the horrible word, presenteeism. Employees may take time off from work because of ill health, or they may turn up for work as usual, sometimes because they feel duty bound, sometimes because they are worried about what people will say if they do not, and sometimes because they do not want to admit that they have a mental illness. However, they function at less than full capacity because they are feeing terrible. It is much more difficult to measure presenteeism than it is to calculate straightforward absence from work, but studies have been carried out in the United States, Australia and Canada. The key finding is that presenteeism is a much more important cause of lost output than sickness absence, with some studies suggesting that it is six times as costly as absenteeism. The Sainsbury Centre has taken a rather conservative view of all this because little information is available on what really goes on in the UK. As an estimate, it has chosen to double the cost of absenteeism, but it still means that it is a huge cost. We know perfectly well that mental health matters to every business in Britain. One worker in six experiences depression or anxiety in any one year. If you add in drug and alcohol problems and severe mental illness, this rises to one in five.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000132"></a>We also know that most employers vastly underestimate the importance of mental health. A Shaw Trust survey of senior managers found that half thought that none of their staff would ever have a mental health problem. A report that will come from the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health and the Employers&#146; Forum on Disability fairly shortly will show that most employers think that their workplace has less mental ill health than society as a whole. If they all think that, something very strange is going on. This is a wonderful example of denial that tells us a great deal about stigma and the desire to bury the facts.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000133"></a>This is obviously partly about stigma; people are afraid of telling their employers and colleagues if they are distressed. They are much more likely to come into work when they are unwell with a mental illness or  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC412"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC412</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from mental distress than if they have a physical health problem. However, the figures are likely to be an underestimate, if anything. Large numbers of people who present to their GPs or to occupational health services with medically unexplained physical symptoms may well have mental health problems that neither they nor their GPs recognise.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000134"></a>The report says that employing people with mental health problems is a good thing, not a bad thing. It is impossible anyway to say that one should not employ them, given the prevalence of the distress. We also know that working is good for people with mental illness. A recent Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development survey of employers found that 61 per cent reported a positive experience of employing people with a history of mental health problems, and that only 15 per cent reported a negative experience, which is probably lower than the normal rate of dissatisfaction with new employees in general.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000135"></a>We also know that having a mental illness does not make a person unemployable. The former Norwegian Prime Minister, Kjell Magne Bondevik, served two successful terms, despite having time off with depression. His openness about suffering from depression during his first term did not stop him winning a second term. We also know that employers can cut the cost of mental ill health through good management of their staff. BT has reduced its mental health sickness rate by a third through its Work Fit programme, which offers support to staff experiencing distress. We also know that a few simple and quite inexpensive measures to reduce stress and support people who become unwell can save thousands of pounds in lost output and precious skills.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000136"></a>We also know what the keys to reducing mental distress at work are. First is the recognition that work is good for health. Evidence is clear that being in work makes people healthier, both physically and mentally, and being out of work reduces life expectancy as severely as smoking and obesity&#151;by about 10 years. Preventing work-related mental distress, such as ensuring that staff do not have unrealistic expectations, tackling bullying at work and so on, makes a huge difference. Giving workers greater control over how they work probably makes the biggest difference of all. Raising awareness of the possibility of mental illness among line managers makes a great difference, as does giving them more knowledge about mental health and helping them to respond confidently and in good time to staff who appear to be distressed. Improving access to help also makes a great difference. That is particularly true of speedy access to psychological therapies, especially to CBT, cognitive behavioural therapy. I very much hope that the Minister will be able to give me lots of good news about that. That makes all the difference between staying at work and going off sick and ultimately losing your job. Providing effective rehabilitation for those who need time off work also helps a lot, but you must maintain regular contact during periods of absence. That is crucial to give the person concerned hope and a clear goal for coming back.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000137"></a>Supporting mental well-being is likely to be different in small businesses than in large ones. Big employers have human resources departments and occupational  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC413"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC413</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>health services, and can organise staff training and so on. However, small businesses can do their part and it would be really wonderful if the Government could give a bit of lead on that by encouraging small businesses to allow flexible working and encourage them to keep in touch with staff who are off work to help them to return.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000138"></a>We know a great deal. The real problem is that we do not act on it. That is why this report is so important. I really hope that the Government, and the Minister on behalf of the Government, can do something about what goes on in the public sector. The public sector employs millions of people and it has contracts with businesses that employ millions more. Mental ill health among staff costs the NHS over &#163;1 billion, which is equivalent to a quarter of the entire mental health budget for England. I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, has experienced that as much as I have in the NHS.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000139"></a>It seems to me that public services should be required to demonstrate good practice as employers and in contracts with providers, and that they should be required to support the mental well-being of staff. At the moment, you see them responding less than well when people become unwell. Public services should be doing more to actively seek applications for ordinary jobs at all levels from people who admit to having a mental health problem. I wonder whether the Minister will be able to tell us that the Government will do a little more about that and that they, through the public sector as an employer, will do more to make it possible for people to admit that they have a mental illness, so we have less presenteeism and we can get rid of that horrible word. Can he say whether the Government will ask the public sector to set a lead in its employment practices and contracting practices? That is what has to happen if we want to make a difference to stigma and if we want to reduce the cost of all this.</p>

<p><a name="08051565000140"></a><a name="80515-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80515-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08051565000207"></a>Lord Ramsbotham:</b> I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, for obtaining this debate and for giving us an opportunity to raise a matter that is of considerable concern to many of us who are looking at different aspects, particularly the public service.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000141"></a>I declare an interest as an adviser to the trustees of the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health. My advice is slightly differently pitched from that of the noble Baroness, because recently the Sainsbury centre has deliberately focused on two aspects. The first is the mental health of prisoners, and the second is the problems faced by those with mental health problems obtaining work: two areas that have been neglected for too long. Therefore, I was very glad to see this paper, which is in a way a precursor to the work of the problems of people getting work. Unless things are right for staff, nothing will be right for others. I will concentrate on the Prison Service as an example of a public service in which a great deal more could be done.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000142"></a>It is right to say that there probably is no more stressful job in the United Kingdom than being a prison officer. I remember once watching a sex-offender treatment programme and marvelling at the tutors and what they were having to go through when they  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC414"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC414</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>were role-playing with people who had committed the most awful crimes. They came out of that session literally shaking. One of them said to me that going through that work caused them to think twice when bathing their own children in the evening. That puts tremendous demands on staff; yet there was no proper support mechanism in the Prison Service for looking after those tutors, who were at the leading edge of doing the work of protecting the public on behalf of the community. In a way, the report is a wake-up call to the Prison Service to do a great deal more. We hear quite a lot about absenteeism in the Prison Service, and it varies from prison to prison. The interesting theme to me when inspecting prisons and looking at that was that there was a definite correlation between the management of a prison and absenteeism. It tells you quite a lot that if the management style is not right, people are not going to turn up for work.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000143"></a>There are two workforces in prisons, and prisoners represent a huge mental health problem. There is an Office for National Statistics report that is worth referring to, in addition to those referred to in the Sainsbury centre paper. It was done in October 1998, and it is called <I>Psychiatric Morbidity </I><I>a</I><I>mong</I><I> Prison</I><I>er</I><I>s in England and Wales</I>. It is still the most accurate document available. It shows that 70 per cent of those in prison suffer from some form of identifiable personality disorder. That does mean that they are certifiable, but that something is affecting their proposal. The reason why that is important and should not be lost sight of in this debate is well contained in a paper that I am very glad has been published today by the CBI, <I>Getting Back on the Straight and Narrow</I>. It proposes a better criminal justice system for all and amounts to a critique of a great deal of what the Government have not been doing. It wants them to do the central work that they say should be done&#151;helping offenders to gain work, which is at the heart of the Government&#146;s recent welfare-to-work programmes and helping the hardest-to-reach long-term unemployed, many of whom are ex-offenders.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000144"></a>Unless there are programmes in place to get to the bottom of the mental health problems of those looking for work, you are affecting in many ways the whole of the workforce of the United Kingdom. While it is absolutely right to have the staff right, particularly in prisons, it is worth making certain that the workforce&#151;in this case those seeking work&#151;can be employed. The Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health&#146;s report is extremely timely and the quality of the work that has been done by that centre has struck me ever since I first was in contact with it. I hope that the Minister can tell us that the Government are taking this seriously. This is not only a criticism, it is advice. I particularly like the five &#147;How can savings be delivered?&#148; points&#151;recognition, prevention, awareness training, better access to health and effective rehabilitation&#151;because they can be applied to many other aspects of improving all sorts of things in this country, not least the mental health of our workforce.</p>

I probably should, as always in these situations, declare  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC415"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC415</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an interest as the chair of a mental health trust in East London and more recently as the chair of a mental health initiative for young people, spearheaded by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation and the Mental Health Foundation&#151;which is relevant to this debate.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000146"></a>Our starting point is of course that mental health is a significant issue for every business in Britain. As the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, mentioned, one in six workers will experience depression or anxiety in any year. Yet, as she also mentioned, employers vastly underestimate its importance. Indeed, employers even assume that they do not have anyone at all with a mental health problem. I have to confess that in our trust, although we have encouraged openness on this matter with our staff for some period&#151;certainly since I have been there&#151;we have made slow progress in this area. I will come back to that point later. Such is the stigma of mental illness that, even within a mental health trust, employees will carry on soldiering on and concealing their problems for long periods at considerable cost to the employer in reduced productivity. I am aware that many of our nurses are underperforming quite drastically. If we could get at the mental health issues of those nurses, we may make considerable progress.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000147"></a>Help for employees, and therefore employers, is potentially on the way. That is the good news and I applaud the Government&#146;s commitment to a considerable increase in spending on evidence-based psychological therapies&#151;I emphasise evidence-based&#151;in the most recent Comprehensive Spending Review, building up to &#163;70 million in the third year. However, I also want to draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the significant risk that much of this money may not be spent on these evidence-based therapies. It is important that strategic health authorities, and at the end of the day PCTs, follow the professional guidance issued by the Department of Health to ensure that the money really is used to the best effect. If it is spent on therapies that have been shown to be pretty ineffectual, it would be a terrible waste. Can my noble friend the Minister assure the Committee that his department will do all that it can to ensure that the funds are spent as the Government intended?</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000148"></a>Another important point is the relevance of these evidence-based therapies to the achievement of the Government&#146;s target to reduce the number of people claiming incapacity benefit&#151;or is it employment support allowance now? I am sorry I have slightly lost track of the time frame&#151;by 1 million over 10 years. If this is to be achieved, employers need ready access to evidence-based therapies so that employees suffering from severe distress, depression or anxiety can readily be referred for treatment at an early stage. At the same time employers need to change their internal policies so that anyone going off sick is not left alone on the basis that the manager must not interfere, as this would be harassment, and is followed up by the occupational health people&#151;and, in the case of a smaller employer, somebody within the firm&#151;without delay to identify the problem and, where appropriate, to refer them for evidence-based therapy.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000149"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, mentioned the incredible success of BT. It is phenomenal. BT has reduced its mental health sickness absence by a third  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC416"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC416</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>through its Work Fit programme. Other employers would do extremely well for themselves if they followed BT&#146;s example.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000150"></a>Employment coaches, otherwise known as employment support workers, also need to be available to those at risk of losing their jobs due to mental health problems, but also to ensure that appropriate support is provided to line managers. It is no good supporting just the employee; you must also support managers. Why should they have any experience of these issues? If all these pieces of the jigsaw can be brought together, the benefits to employers, employees and the taxpayer would be extraordinarily significant. We would see a dramatic fall in the number of benefit claimants.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000151"></a>As regards incapacity benefit or employment support claimants, every general practice needs practitioners of evidence-based therapies. Lots of general practitioners have counsellors of one sort or another, who I am sure are very helpful. You can just shift somebody off to see the counsellor rather than the doctor, and that makes sense, but if you really want these people to cease coming to your practice for a while, or, you hope, indefinitely, you have to have a change of mentality. We have to have people in general practice providing therapies that we know will help to cure the person. We know that about 50 per cent of people suffering from depression can be cured through these evidence-based therapies and will remain well for at least two years&#151;if longer studies were done, I think they would show lengthier cures&#151;and that the success rate for those with anxieties is higher still.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000152"></a>A more challenging area for public sector involvement is that of the secondary mental health services. Here the need is for every community team to have an employment coach with the right skills to work with employers. This probably does not mean OTs but rather people used to working with employers who have advertising or PR skills and are helped to understand mental health issues with which they may be less familiar.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80515-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000153"></a>If mental health trusts did this, they would enable people to go through the route of voluntary work within their trust and ultimately perhaps to jobs within it, or indeed elsewhere. Again, this employment support should be linked to the provision of evidence-based therapies. They have to go together. It is no good having one and not the other. In East London we have employment coaches and psychological therapists in all our community teams, but I have to confess that this has happened only within the past 12 months due to a thoroughgoing push from certain people within the trust. Does the Minister know to what extent this is now common practice across all mental health trusts? It is probably unreasonable to ask him that, but it certainly would be very interesting to know because that should be the case.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000154"></a>The Healthcare Commission now has a target for local authorities, through their mental health trusts, to increase the proportion of mental health service users in employment year by year. Although there is no specificity there, the idea that you will be marked &#147;good&#148; only if you increase the proportion each year is pretty promising and a good start. There is good evidence that the initiatives discussed here are the best way to achieve that target.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000155"></a>Again, I recognise that this is somewhat outside the Minister&#146;s remit, but cross-departmental work on these matters will be essential if the target of a 1 million fall in the number of benefit claimants over 10 years is to be achieved. Therefore, what progress has been made with the Department of Health in progressing those agendas?</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000156"></a>I had not planned to mention the role of the foundation trust model in all this, but I think I will. Others may be aware that we now have something called a board of governors or a member&#146;s council elected by our community. We also have thousands of members, many of whom are service users of our trust. We have had to think how to involve our membership. Our trust has come up with precisely the solution that we are talking about today&#151;it seems eminently sensible for every other mental health trust to do the same&#151;the members need to be invited and encouraged to become involved in voluntary work and, ultimately, in employment. We are right at the beginning of this; we became a foundation trust only on 1 November; but we feel that there is a lot of interest in this and it may be something that we need to encourage nationally. It could be quite a significant way forward for people in the secondary sector. I realise that large numbers of people are not in the secondary mental health sector, they are in the primary care sector, but we could really make progress through that foundation trust model that, when we started, we had not thought of as a major issue.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000157"></a>My final point is one that I raised during our debates on the Welfare Reform Bill last year. The Minister may guess what I am going to mention. I hope that his heart will not sink to hear me mention the words &#147;linking rules&#148; again, but the issue remains as pressing as ever. For noble Lords unfamiliar with this territory, the aim of the linking rules is to ensure that anyone on incapacity benefit who finds a job and who, within two years loses the job, can restore those benefits, supposedly without delay&#151;unless things have changed since I was involved in those matters.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000158"></a>I am concerned that in such circumstances, someone still needs to complete a form, and there are inquiries to be made, before benefits are restored. Also, housing benefit is considered quite separately. In reality, those procedures can take weeks, perhaps months, especially for people with mental health problems who are likely to have fallen out of a job because of a recurrence of those problems. They will be lying in bed, they will not be picking up the phone, answering letters, making sure that they are filling in forms or getting someone else to do it for them.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000159"></a>When we last debated these issues, the DWP was considering the possibility of aligning the reclaim process for housing benefit with that for employment support allowances. I have not completely given up hope of further improvements to the linking rules themselves for employment support allowances. It may be reasonable to limit those special provisions to people with mental health problems, because if your mind is working all right, you can probably deal with those matters, even if you have to sit in a wheelchair; but if your mind is not helping you at all, the linking rules do

Has the Minister managed to make any progress since last summer with those matters? I look forward in anticipation to his reply.</p>
<h5><a name="08051565000187"></a>4.28 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08051565000160"></a><a name="80515-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80515-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08051565000209"></a>Baroness Linklater of Butterstone:</b> We must all be grateful both to my noble friend Lady Neuberger for introducing this debate on this very important issue and to the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health for producing its report and highlighting so graphically the real crisis that we are facing in this country; how issues of mental ill health are costing this country dear. Although the noble Baroness's Question focuses on the cost and the need for support to business, there are the other inevitable costs incurred by the range of agencies to pick up the pieces of fragile or broken lives; the human cost to those who are ill, to other individuals, families and communities; and the urgent need for support for them as well.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000161"></a>One of the real ironies is the extent to which mental illness is the object of so much fear, stigma, ignorance and even cruelty when it is such a common feature of our society, and the evidence shows that it is getting worse. With one in four of us experiencing mental ill health at some point in our lives, there will be very few individuals anywhere who do not know directly of someone who has been mentally ill. I declare an interest here. I have a wonderful son who is now 37. He has had severe manic depression since he was 15, a fact which has had a huge impact on all who have had the good luck to know him. Indeed, it has inevitably involved times of great distress, anxiety and, indeed, fear for us all, and which in his case has meant that long-term real employment has not been possible. We are a society that fears any deviation from what is normal, particularly when mental illness and other disabilities significantly affect and damage the normal, strong or the successful in our communities. I believe that we are getting it badly wrong, both materially and morally, where the mentally ill are concerned. The Sainsbury report not only points out graphically the costs of our failure, but also, very usefully, how to begin to deal with the problem.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000162"></a>My noble friend Lady Neuberger has already gone through the detail of the report, and I hope noble Lords will forgive me if I repeat some of it. The cost to business alone of mental illness is vast. The figure of &#163;26 billion annually is hard to get our heads around, unless we think of it as over &#163;1,000 for every single employee, everywhere, each year. Of these employees, the report tells us, at any time one in six will be experiencing a neurotic disorder such as depression, anxiety or stress-related problems. That is different from the group of people who, like my son, suffer from long-term severe mental disorders. The former group is by far the larger and represents the chief concern in the report because people in that group are more able to work and their illness is less likely to be permanent.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000163"></a>We have discussed that ghastly word, presenteeism, which along with absenteeism and high staff turnover, are the main costs. Presenteeism suggests a sort of ghostly figure drifting around the workplace, and I am sure it should not be difficult to find a better word.  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC419"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC419</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Being present but unable to work properly is a reflection of the fear felt by the employee of being mentally ill or being found out because of the stigma the illness generates, and the stigma itself is rooted in fear. Furthermore, most employers hugely underestimate the prevalence of mental illness in their workforce, partly because they are simply unaware of it and partly because, I suspect, they do not want to recognise it. That is fear once again. Yet we all know that work is good for business, good for individual self-confidence and self-esteem, good for health, and of course, as the husband of the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, knows, good for happiness.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000164"></a>Apart from the stark detailed calculations of the cost of mental illness, we see that appropriate, constructive and effective ways of dealing with mental ill health at work is not rocket science and can save thousands in pounds and people. It is crucially to do with the attitude towards staff of managers, which should be free of prejudice. Managers who are properly informed about the nature of mental illness and trained accordingly are able to facilitate early recognition and swift access to appropriate help. As we know, most fear and prejudice is rooted in ignorance. Much stress can be mitigated by having realistic expectations of staff, dealing effectively with bullying in the workplace and giving people more say over how they work&#151;all of which amount to strategies that lead to a positive working environment. Training is important, so that a manager can feel confident about dealing with someone who is showing signs of mental illness that could otherwise be quite threatening. Knowing where to go for the appropriate help is essential. In this way, appropriate and effective interventions, such as CBT&#151;although sometimes I think that can be exaggerated&#151;can prevent the loss of a job or facilitate an early return to work.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000165"></a>Proper support to stay in or return to work can be crucial. It all seems quite obvious, but it is still sadly lacking and is a real challenge to the Government. My experience over the past few years is that it is not the Government who are leading the way here, but the voluntary sector and the world of social enterprise, with the growing and very exciting development of social firms. They are businesses with a moral compass, where not only do the usual criteria apply for any successful business&#151;such as a proper business plan, a healthy profit at the end of the year, top-class service to the customer and a budget showing future growth&#151;but there is an overarching rationale of meeting a particular social need in the people whom it employs and in the service that it gives.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000166"></a>Social firms are by no means exclusive to the mental health field, but they employ, among many others, people with severe and/or enduring mental health problems. They provide a supportive working environment that recognises and responds to the needs of individuals and, where appropriate, challenging environments where people can carry out real work in real businesses. That may be a stage in recovery in the sometimes long journey to sustained, meaningful employment, or perhaps a place where the individual can be sustained and supported over many years.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000167"></a>I declare a second interest, as my daughter is a beneficiary of just such a firm in Scotland, which I commend to the Committee. It is called Forth Sector,  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC420"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC420</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and it is based in Edinburgh. It runs a group of small businesses, including a small guest house where the trainees all have mental health issues of some kind. It is a delightful place, where the highest standards apply, the service is excellent and the occupancy rate is high. I cannot sing its praises highly enough.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000168"></a>The Freud report in 2007 suggested that the true cost to the state of a person on incapacity benefit was around &#163;64,000 a year. The cost of sustaining a person in one of Forth Sector&#146;s social firms is a 10th of that, without including a calculation of the personal, family and social capital that such a placement creates. By trading as they do, not only do social firms provide real work experience, but they effectively substitute for and subsidise the state provision of care. I suggest that the Government take a sustained and real interest in the support and development of this approach and of the work of social firms.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000169"></a>Finally, I quote the example of the National Schizophrenia Fellowship in Scotland, of which I am a patron. It has been supporting people with a range of mental illnesses for years in a variety of areas, including employment. Sometimes clients start by volunteering with a large organisation, such as the National Trust for Scotland, with which there is a long-standing relationship, and sometimes with small businesses. In this and many other ways, its work is invaluable to many people and their families. Typically, it may intervene when a person has become ill and before too long has perhaps lost his home and job, while the employer was simply not aware of illness or the reality of the situation. The outcome of the intervention is a negotiation with the employer and a return to work, home and stability. That is immeasurable. Without NSF, such a person is to be found on the state&#146;s very expensive scrapheap. Its work with young people may involve starting with volunteering, often working alongside them, to experience the working environment, before graduating to real work. That is something that the Government should be encouraging and developing.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051565000170"></a>The marvellous work of such social firms and voluntary organisations is the beacon in what is still a dark world for so many of the mentally ill. Of course the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, is right to challenge the Government to follow their lead, which is now so overdue and so pressing. I sincerely hope that they will take this latest report from the Sainsbury Centre very seriously, for literally none of us can afford to ignore its message any longer.</p>
<h5><a name="08051566000031"></a>4.40 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08051566000003"></a><a name="80515-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80515-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08051566000033"></a>Lord McColl of Dulwich:</b> I, too, would like to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, for initiating this important debate. At the outset I would like to contrast West Africa with this country in several respects. My clinical practice is in West Africa for several months every year with a charity known as Mercy Ships. Many of the patients that my wife and I operate on have been rejected by their fellow countrymen because they are assumed to have some sort of curse. This leads to throwing stones at children with hare lips, cataracts, squints and many other conditions. Women who have been rendered incontinent through disasters in childbirth are completely ostracised by society.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC421"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC421</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000004"></a>Before we adopt too critical an attitude to such behaviour in Africa, it is worth remembering that in this country the all too common attitude towards those with mental ill health can be very strange, to say the least. Even highly intelligent, educated people will use terms like &#147;nutty&#148;, &#147;balmy&#148; and &#147;bananas&#148; to describe those who are mentally ill. The same people would never dream of using such language to describe those with heart failure, pneumonia or cancer. Some have tried to explain this inappropriate behaviour in terms of fear or ignorance of mental illness, or that it acts as a kind of protective carapace. The strange thing is that doctors have also used these derogatory terms, but what is even more surprising is that psychiatrists have done the same. A medical student spent an hour carefully assessing a patient in a psychiatric outpatient clinic and then presented the case history to a distinguished psychiatrist, who started laughing. &#147;What&#146;s the joke?&#148; asked the student. &#147;The joke is that he is a psychopath&#148;, was the reply. &#147;Yes, I know that he is a psychopath&#148;, said the student, &#147;but what is the joke?&#148;. &#147;The joke is that there is nothing we can do for him&#148;. The student thought that the consultant&#146;s response constituted what psychiatrists call incongruity of affect, which is a well known symptom of schizophrenia. That was a few years ago, and hopefully things are improving.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000005"></a>These things are always difficult to judge, but my impression is that there is now less prejudice and ignorance about mental illness, but unfortunately, as has been mentioned already, recent surveys suggest that tolerance towards those with mental health problems is now lower than it was in 1994, which is very discouraging. A survey of members of the Depression Alliance showed that 79 per cent of them were fearful that revealing their condition at work would be damaging. That is a sad state when one bears in mind how common mental illness is in the population as a whole. As the noble Baroness said, one in four in the nation will suffer from mental ill health during their lifetime and at any time one in six workers will be experiencing anxiety, depression or problems related to stress.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000006"></a>Mental ill health is normal in every workplace. We have heard the figures about how much it costs, so I will not repeat them. We have heard the term &#147;presenteeism&#148;, which I do not like at all. I would prefer to use the Latin phrase, labore sed aeger, which means labouring but ill. The Latin word &#147;aeger&#148; covers mental as well as physical ill health. The phrase could be abbreviated to LSA, and would certainly be better than presenteeism.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000007"></a>The figures we have heard are probably underestimates because many people present with medically unexplained physical symptoms that are due to mental health problems. These are not recognised by patients themselves or by their doctors. Indeed, these symptoms can be difficult to diagnose. To make matters worse and even more complex, a patient&#146;s symptoms may be due to mental health problems and concomitant physical disease. It is important to state the obvious that, as has already been said, mental illness does not make a person unemployable. There have been many recent examples of this: one in the form of the Norwegian Prime Minister, Kjell Magne Bondevik. My Norwegian friends in Norway said that people were amazed when he  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC422"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC422</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>admitted publicly his illness and then took six months off, but his openness was so impressive that he was elected for a second term. Such openness is a great inspiration for those with the same condition.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000008"></a>Mental ill health can be cut by the good management of staff, and there are several excellent examples. BT, as has been mentioned, has reduced its mental health sickness absences by one-third through its Work Fit programme. There is also good evidence that being in work keeps people healthier, both physically and mentally. Unemployment reduces life expectancy by 10 years, as the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, pointed out.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000009"></a>Work-related mental stress can be reduced by creating more pleasant working conditions, giving staff more say over how they work, and dealing with bullying. I remember some years ago in a hospital how some secretaries got very angry with the way they were being bullied and mistreated by people who should have known better. I suggested to them that the next time it happened they should just look the guy in the eye and think to themselves, &#147;Poor chap, he&#146;s not having enough roughage in his diet&#148;. The only problem with this was that it would make the secretaries smile, which sometimes inflamed the situation even more.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000010"></a>Managers should be, and are being, trained in how to deal quickly and effectively with these problems and how to get people to take up psychiatric therapies and effective rehabilitation. On the subject of rehabilitation, it is helpful if managers keep in contact with people when they are off sick and help them to return to work earlier.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000011"></a>There is no doubt that this is a very neglected subject due to the lack of public awareness, the persistent stigma of mental illness and a lack of training among management. Much needs to be done. The Department of Health&#146;s commissioning of the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health to tackle stigma and discrimination around mental illness is a welcome development, and I look forward to hearing what more the Minister is going to do.</p>
<h5><a name="08051566000032"></a>4.48 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08051566000012"></a><a name="80515-gc0005.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80515-gc0005.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08051566000034"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> I start by expressing my gratitude to the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, for calling this debate today and to all noble Lords for devoting their time to this very important issue. I fear that 12 minutes is too short to do full justice to the weight of noble Lords&#146; contributions, but I shall try. I am also indebted to the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health for its policy paper on developing the business case and for all its ongoing work on the mental health agenda, particularly in its links with employment.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000013"></a>The Government are committed to ensuring that 2008 marks a step change in the way we approach the health of the working age population and in particular support for people with mental health conditions. It is central to our aspiration of achieving an 80 per cent employment rate that we improve the health of our working age population, reduce sickness absence and drive down the number of people falling out of work and on to welfare benefits. This success will mean healthier and more productive employees and a  stronger economy.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC423"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC423</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000014"></a>We recognise the changing dynamic of British business and the corresponding shift in the nature of ill health and sickness absence for working age people. Mental ill health is now the greatest single cause of sickness absence. As the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, explained, the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health estimates that it accounts for 40 per cent of all sickness absence&#151;some 70 million days a year. The impact on business is more than &#163;25 billion a year, including &#163;15 billion from&#151;I hesitate to say&#151;presenteeism, with employees staying in work but performing below par.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000015"></a>Mental health conditions are also the single biggest cause of people claiming incapacity benefit&#151;a higher figure than the number of people claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance. Dame Carol Black&#146;s recent review of the health of Britain&#146;s working age population rightly drew attention to the challenges. An accompanying report from the Royal College of Psychiatrists highlighted that mental health problems cost the British economy more than &#163;40 billion each year.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000016"></a>The evidence is clear that work is generally good for health, and that is true for mental health as well as physical health. The Government have made considerable progress in working to address those challenges&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, said, it is not rocket science&#151;but we must go further. We must help all employers to manage mental health conditions at work by tackling the stigma associated with mental ill health; and wherever possible prevent such conditions developing in the first place. The noble Lord, Lord McColl, graphically challenged us on some prevailing attitudes and on the prejudices which, sadly, still persist. We must further improve the access to mental health support services for those who develop conditions, helping people to stay in work or to return to work as quickly as possible.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000017"></a>We have been looking at ways to improve the support that is available to employers, both to ensure that they understand what they can do to prevent mental ill health being caused by work and to help them manage staff with mental health conditions, whatever the cause. The Health and Safety Executive developed its excellent management standards for identifying and managing the risks so that work-related stress can be prevented. The HSE is also supporting employers by developing improved information and guidance through its website.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000018"></a>As part of Dame Carol Black&#146;s review, PricewaterhouseCoopers considered the economic case for business investment in wellness. The evidence from 50 employer case studies suggests that the initial programme costs can quickly be translated into financial benefits. PwC is now working on developing a toolkit that will allow employers to quantify the financial benefits of their wellness interventions. We intend to pilot this toolkit in the summer, and we will encourage employers in both the public and private sectors to take part in this pilot and to use the toolkit to move towards reporting on health and well-being in the boardroom.</p>

<p><a name="08051566000019"></a>We have also been looking at de-stigmatising mental health conditions in the workplace. The Department of Health, in partnership with Shift, has taken forward the successful &#147;Action on Stigma&#148; campaign, which tackles the stigma and discrimination that people with  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC424"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC424</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mental health conditions too often face. The early focus has been on the public sector audience, addressing our wish that government&#151;central government departments, executive agencies and NHS trusts&#151;should be an exemplar, as it is absolutely right that they should, but increasingly Shift has been invited to engage with blue chip companies to support business in tackling discrimination and promoting healthy workplaces.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000020"></a>We need to go further in improving the support for those with mental health conditions to help them stay in work or to return to work quickly. Since 1997, the Government have made a record investment in mental health services. Real terms investment in adult mental health services has increased by nearly a third in the past five years alone. We now have over 60 per cent more consultant psychiatrists, 70 per cent more clinical psychologists and at least 20 per cent more mental health nurses than in 1997.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000021"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, said, last October we announced a significant investment to deliver the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme, rising to &#163;173 million in the third year. That will enable the training of more than 3,000 extra therapists to deliver psychological interventions for up to 900,000 more people over those three years. My department is working closely with the Department of Health on this, and we will make sure that it links with our Pathways to Work programme, which is now available across the country. We are providing funding to test private and voluntary sector delivery of employment support within the IAPT programme itself. Employment advisers will help individual customers to remain in, or quickly return to, work, or find jobs that are more suitable for them. As the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, said, we need to go further in improving the integration of health and employment programmes to ensure that those out of work with mental health conditions have the best possible support to consider a return to work and that employers have the appropriate information and support to make the necessary adjustments that can make a return to work possible.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000022"></a>Yesterday&#146;s survey from the CBI illustrated the considerable employer support for the introduction of what Dame Carol Black described as &#147;fit notes&#148;. We have been working with a wide range of stakeholders to create a revised medical certificate that is more positive and supports GPs in providing the best possible advice to their patients. More helpful fitness-for-work advice can also help employers to facilitate an earlier return to work, by switching the focus from what people cannot do to what they can do. We are doing so in replacing incapacity benefit with the employment and support allowance. The Department of Health has already agreed to pilot a fit for work service, as recommended by Dame Carol. The DWP has set up a vocational rehabilitation task force to determine what incentives and disincentives currently exist and how we might better encourage employers to provide such services.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000023"></a>The CBI survey also highlighted the significant challenge that is still facing the public sector in tacking sickness absence. All government departments now report their sickness absence to the Cabinet Office on  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC425"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column GC425</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a quarterly basis, and we are committed to reducing current levels by promoting good health and well-being and by addressing the causes of long-term sickness absence. Good line management and a renewed focus on improving support for those with mental health conditions will be a critical part of that. As several noble Lords have commented, it is absolutely right that the Government take the lead in this area. There are examples of good sickness management practice in some government departments, as well as examples of not so good practice in others, and we have heard some of those this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="08051566000024"></a>To reflect the importance of mental health support for the future health of Britain&#146;s working age population, we have asked Dame Carol Black to support us in producing, for the first time, a co-ordinated, cross-government strategy for mental health and employment. It will build on our current work to address and meet the challenges faced by people with mental health problems, helping to improve their employment chances. Providing improved support to employers, linking mental health and employment programmes, tackling stigma and discrimination and the other issues mentioned today will all be considered as we develop this strategy. Dame Carol has agreed to take the lead on that work, supported by a group of eminent experts from the business, medical and academic worlds, including my noble friend Lord Layard.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000025"></a>The Government are committed to the challenge of reducing the impact of mental health issues on business, reducing sickness absence and improving more generally the health of the working age population. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, referred to the five identified components of an effective work-based programme in the Sainsbury centre report. Across government, work is under way on each of those components. The recognition by employers that work is, on the whole, good for mental and physical health lies at the heart of our health, work and well-being programme. The HSE&#146;s stress management standards address issues of prevention, Shift&#146;s action on stigma, awareness training and improving

The vocational rehabilitation task force helps the focus on effective rehabilitation. There is still much to do, and now is the time to make extra progress. In the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, the word &#147;now&#148; means that it is time to do it.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000026"></a>In the remaining time, I will pick up on the specific questions that were asked. My noble friend Lady Meacher asked about the linking rules again. I will write more fully on that. I am afraid that we are not yet in agreement with her on the issue of not having to have a claim in the system to access that. We are looking at making sure that the claim process and the reclaim process can be as smooth and effective as possible.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000027"></a>On the mental health of the prison population, there has been extra investment each year in mental health in-reach services and additional funding over three years for support in training for prison officers and staff on mental health. The figure is &#163;600,000; the noble Lord may think that it should be more than that, but we are seeking to focus on that.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000028"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, asked what we are doing to encourage employment support workers within psychological therapy services. I touched on that a little, but the IAPT programme is working with the NHS to encourage the provision of employment support workers in IAPT services. The programme is rolling out at present and the first services will come on stream in September 2008. The DWP is also testing the provision of employment support workers in psychological therapy teams.</p>

<a name="80515-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051566000029"></a>I hope that noble Lords will acknowledge that that is some real progress with real opportunities in future on a range of matters on which we now have a real focus. I again thank the noble Baroness for raising this important issue and all noble Lords who have contributed.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08051571000014"></a><a name="80515-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80515-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08051571000075"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08051571000015"></a>On 12 September 2007, I announced my decision that Headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (HQ ARRC) and its intimate supporting elements, 1 Signal Brigade (1 Sig Bde) and 102 Logistic Brigade (102 Log Bde) should all move from Germany to the UK over the period 2009 to 2014 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, cols. 122-24WS). I explained that this decision would need to be confirmed following scrutiny of the detailed plans for the moves and that this work would start with the proposed move of HQ ARRC and its intimate supporting elements from Rhine Garrison in Mnchengladbach to Innsworth in Gloucestershire.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08051571000016"></a>Today I am announcing that the programme team&#146;s detailed plans for the move of HQ ARRC and its intimate supporting elements have been completed and scrutinised and that I have decided that the move to Innsworth will take place in 2010, which fits with the MoD&#146;s current commitments and priorities and means that the site will still be fully revitalised in the near future. The Innsworth site was taken over by the Army on 1 April 2008 and it is being prepared to enable the necessary refurbishment and new-build works to begin. In the mean time, we will maintain all essential services at the site, undertake all necessary works services and work with the local authorities in Gloucestershire to prepare for the arrival of personnel, families and equipment in 2010.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08051571000017"></a>The programme team will continue to consult interested parties, including the trades unions, and, in Germany, we will continue to engage with the relevant authorities and employee representatives at national, regional and local levels.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08051571000018"></a>Our NATO allies have been notified of this decision, including the German Government as host nation<I>.</I></p>

<a name="80515-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08051571000019"></a>As far as the moves of 1 Sig Bde and 102 Log Bde are concerned, I announced on 31 January 2008 that the site occupied by the Defence College of Aeronautical Engineering (DCAE) at Cosford in Shropshire is the MoD&#146;s preferred site for the two brigades (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, cols. 25-26WS). Detailed planning for these moves continues, as well as for a series of other moves within Germany, to determine how best we can provide infrastructure support there once the planned moves to the UK have been completed. Under current assumptions, we envisage restructuring HQ United Kingdom Support Command (Germany) in Rheindahlen, which will result in a smaller support organisation integrated with HQ1 (UK) Armoured Division in Herford and a discrete HQ being established in the UK to ensure necessary infrastructure support to overseas locations. All the moves and changes to

<a name="80515-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08051571000020"></a>As stated in my previous announcement, these moves and the work of the programme team in no way signal a change in either our commitment to the NATO alliance or our overall defence policy, nor do they in any way devalue the continued close bilateral defence relationship between the UK and Germany. Although we may make further modest adjustments to our force levels in Germany, our plan, with the continued agreement of the German Government, remains to base UK forces there in the form of HQ1 (UK) Armoured Division and the majority of its formations and supporting units, some 15,000 service personnel, for many years to come.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08051571000022"></a>The UK will be represented at official level at the fourth meeting of the parties to the UNECE Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (the Espoo convention), to be held in Bucharest, Romania, from 19 to 21 May.</p>

None of the matters to be considered is expected to raise concerns about UK interests. We will support adoption of a work plan that is realistic and properly costed, and will contribute to the agreed costs of the convention.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08051571000024"></a>Parties will be expected to indicate their intention to ratify a protocol to the Espoo convention on strategic environmental assessment (SEA). The UK signed this protocol in 2003 with the intention of ratifying as soon as measures needed for compliance were in place. It is now established that the UK is compliant with no requirement for specific measures and we therefore propose to confirm our intention to ratify the protocol.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08051571000033"></a>XW211 and XW218 were part of a Puma helicopter formation in support of coalition operations. The accident occurred when the lead aircraft, XW211, had landed and its passengers had disembarked. XW218 then tried to land next to XW211 but its main rotor blades hit those of XW211. Sadly, two personnel lost

<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08051571000034"></a>A BOI was convened that same day to establish the circumstances of the loss and to learn lessons from it; a BOI does not seek to apportion blame. The board concluded that the accident was caused by XW218 being positioned too close to XW211. A contributory factor was the difficulty of judging distances accurately to another rotating disc (ie the main rotor blades) at close range.</p>

A copy of the MAAS is also being placed in the Library of the House. As you will appreciate, the safety of our people is a principal consideration and we have therefore removed from the BOI report information that might endanger the security or capability of UK and coalition personnel or be of use to an enemy. We have, however, tried to be as open as possible and have carefully considered the public interest arguments both for and against disclosure of the information in the report.

<a name="80515-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08051571000048"></a>In response to the allegations being made, the then deputy director-general of HM Prison Service commissioned an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the interception, monitoring and retention of communications between Mr Roberts and his solicitor. I also asked for an internal investigation to be undertaken  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS64"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column WS64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by the National Offender Management Service to determine the precise circumstances in which the transcripts of legally privileged conversations had come to be made and passed to the SAA. I am now in a position to inform the House of the findings of the investigations into this issue.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08051571000049"></a>This Statement relates to how transcripts of conversations between Mr Creighton and Mr Roberts came to be included in material prepared for Mr Roberts&#146;s previous parole hearing. In summary, the Prison Service investigation concluded that this occurred because Mr Roberts failed to identify his solicitor&#146;s telephone number to staff at Channings Wood prison, though Mr Roberts, through his solicitor, disputes this finding.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08051571000050"></a>The Prison Rules allow for the interception of communications in prison and for intercepted information to be retained for up to three months and to be disclosed to the police and others when it is necessary and proportionate to do so either on receipt of a lawful application to access the information or by way of lawful voluntary disclosure. Interception is the action that makes the contents of a telephone or mail communication available to a person other than the sender and intended recipient. An operational manager can authorise the interception of communications for reasons such as prison security and control, but there is also a policy that prisons will monitor all the communications of certain prisoners (for example, category A prisoners) who pose the greatest risk to the public and/or security within prisons. Telephone monitoring is the action of listening to recordings of the content of intercepted telephone communications. Prison staff keep a record of which calls have been monitored.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08051571000051"></a>The interception described here is undertaken by the prison authorities under Prison Rules. It does not require authorisation by a Secretary of State under Part I of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA). Nor should it be confused with the directed surveillance class of authorisations under Part II of RIPA, necessary for the conduct of covert eavesdropping in prison visiting rooms, which were the subject of the recent inquiry by the Chief Surveillance Commissioner, Sir Christopher Rose, about which my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department made a Statement on 21 February 2008 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 536). There is no suggestion that any legal visits to Mr Roberts were monitored.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08051571000052"></a>The PIN phone system (so called because prisoners are given a personal identification number (PIN)) intercepts and records all telephone calls that prisoners make, except those identified by the prisoner as legally privileged or otherwise confidential communications (eg with the Samaritans). All intercepted telephone communications are recorded by the PIN system and initially stored on the hard drive of the system before being copied on to either a tape or CD for retention purposes. Only those prisoners who pose the greatest risk have all their communications monitored but all establishments will undertake an element of random monitoring of telephone communications of no more than 5 per cent of calls made on a particular day. Prisoners are made aware during the induction process  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS65"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column WS65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and by notices prominently displayed within the prison that their calls are intercepted, recorded and may be monitored.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08051571000053"></a>The PIN phone system is configured in such a way that it does not intercept communications between a prisoner and their legal representative or other confidential communications provided that these numbers are declared as being confidential. This is what is termed the confidential side of the PIN system&#151;it is not subject to interception. However, in very limited circumstances, for example where a prison governor or law enforcement agency has reasonable cause to believe that a telephone call between a prisoner and his legal adviser is of a criminal nature or would endanger prison security or the safety of others, the governor may authorise the interception, recording and monitoring of such conversations by moving the legal representative&#146;s number from the confidential side of the PIN phone system to the open side, without the prisoner&#146;s knowledge. Such communications will then be intercepted, and a member of staff will listen to them, for such period as is deemed necessary. There was no authorisation to intercept, record and monitor the legal telephone conversations between Mr Harry Roberts and his solicitor, Mr Creighton.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="08051571000054"></a>For the future I have decided that it is more appropriate, given the sensitivity and seriousness of interfering with legal professional privilege, to raise the grade for such interception of communications to the chief operating officer for the National Offender Management Service. We will amend the Prison Rules accordingly.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="08051571000055"></a>The general position is that legal representatives&#146; numbers are included on the confidential side of the PIN system to ensure that calls are not intercepted and recorded, although a log is kept of the date and time of the call. However, it is the responsibility of prisoners to notify the prison authorities of the telephone numbers of their legal representatives, so that such calls are not inadvertently intercepted.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="08051571000056"></a>In the case of Mr Roberts, in the view of the Prison Service, the recording of his telephone conversations with his solicitor occurred because Mr Roberts failed to identify to staff at HMP Channings Wood the telephone number of Mr Creighton of Bhatt Murphy. This was established during the investigation commissioned by the then deputy director-general of HM Prison Service. When the PIN phone system was introduced at HMP Channings Wood in 2002, all prisoners were told that they needed to identify the telephone numbers of their legal representatives by completing a form, so that those numbers could be entered on to the confidential part of the PIN system with calls to those numbers not intercepted. Mr Roberts states that he did identify the relevant number, but there is no evidence that he did so. There is no documentary evidence that he underwent the training to familiarise prisoners with the PIN system on its introduction. However, the Prison Service has confirmed that Mr Roberts would not have received a PIN number or have been able to transfer funds to his PIN phone account had he not undergone the training. In June 2006, a notice was issued to prisoners at Channings Wood reminding them of their obligations under Prison Service Order 4400 to list their legal telephone numbers,  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS66"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column WS66</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to which Mr Roberts did not respond. Consequently, while he was imprisoned at HMP Channings Wood, all his calls to his solicitor were intercepted, recorded and could have been monitored. There is, however, no evidence that Prison Service staff at Channings Wood carried out any monitoring of these communications.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08051571000057"></a>On 8 November 2005, for the purposes of a closed hearing of the Parole Board, my right honourable friend the then Secretary of State for the Home Department was directed by the board to obtain recordings of telephone calls for the period 1 October to 8 November 2005 made by Mr Roberts while he was at HMP Channings Wood, to enable further detailed consideration of his level of risk to specific individuals. This request was for recordings in general. It did not refer to calls with his solicitor, nor was it intended to cover such calls. Mr Roberts was represented at the closed hearing by a specially appointed advocate (SAA).</p>

<a name="80515-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="08051571000058"></a>The lifer section in the National Offender Management Service obtained the recordings without itself listening to, transcribing or reviewing them in any way and sent them to the Treasury Solicitor who was acting for the Secretary of State. Secretarial staff at the Treasury Solicitors then made transcripts of the recordings. Due to the pressure of time in preparing for the parole hearing and the concern of the SAA to have the material as soon as possible, Treasury Counsel and the Treasury Solicitor agreed with the SAA that the transcripts and tapes of the recordings should be provided to the SAA as they became available and before they were reviewed.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="08051571000059"></a>In January 2006, when counsel for the Secretary of State discovered one transcript of a telephone conversation between Mr Roberts and Mr Creighton, she alerted the Treasury Solicitor and the lifer section to the existence of the transcript and advised that the transcript should not be reviewed. On further examination of the transcripts, two other transcripts of telephone conversations between Mr Roberts and Mr Creighton were discovered. All three transcripts were then deleted from the transcripts that the Secretary of State provided to the Parole Board. However, as a result of an oversight, some copies of the transcripts were kept. The prison governor at Channings Wood was not made aware of the existence of this material.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08051571000060"></a>At that time, the SAA was representing Mr Roberts in all matters relating to the closed proceedings and consequently there were no communications between the Treasury Solicitor and Mr Creighton about matters relating to the closed hearing. As a result, a decision was taken by the Treasury Solicitor not to tell Mr Creighton of the existence of the transcripts and tapes. However, the SAA was made aware of the existence of the transcripts; the SAA had the transcripts and tapes and would have been able to raise any concerns on Mr Roberts&#146;s behalf, although he did not in fact do so.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="08051571000061"></a>On 8 January 2008, the Parole Board directed that the SAA send the papers to Mr Creighton for the purposes of a new parole hearing for Mr Roberts. As far as counsel and Treasury Solicitor for the Secretary of State were concerned, the transcripts had been deleted from the Parole Board dossier and so were not part of the evidence for the closed hearing of the  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS67"></a><b>15 May 2008 : Column WS67</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Parole Board and there was no reliance on the transcripts of legally privileged conversations for the purposes of the parole hearing. However, the SAA had both the tapes of the recordings and the undeleted transcripts and these were included in the papers sent to Mr Creighton.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="08051571000062"></a>The Treasury Solicitor and Mr Creighton have exchanged correspondence about this matter. Mr Creighton wrote to the Treasury Solicitor on 29 January. The Treasury Solicitor replied on 28 February. Mr Creighton wrote a further letter on 4 March and the Treasury Solicitor replied on 25 March. Mr Creighton wrote a further letter on 1 April and the Treasury Solicitor replied on 14 May. Mr Creighton, on his client&#146;s behalf, disputes part of the account above. I am, therefore, with his agreement, placing the full correspondence in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08051571000063"></a>I would like to add for completeness that I learnt on 25 February that Derbyshire Constabulary also had in its possession a number of transcripts of legally privileged conversations between Mr Roberts and his legal advisers and that the chief constable had instigated an internal investigation. That investigation has now concluded. The recordings of telephone conversations obtained by Derbyshire Constabulary were as a result of four applications under the Prison Rules to HMP Channings Wood for recordings of Mr Roberts&#146;s conversations, which together covered the period 19 August 2005 to 8 October 2006. The investigation revealed that Derbyshire Constabulary&#146;s remit in this matter extended only to consideration of a possible risk that had arisen to sources of certain information that had been provided to the Parole Board and taking such action as was necessary and proportionate to mitigate that risk. The constabulary was not involved in any decision regarding Mr Roberts&#146;s continued imprisonment. Derbyshire police were properly authorised to access Mr Roberts&#146;s communications under the formal process agreed between HMPS and ACPO. Derbyshire police&#146;s requirements were managed by the police intelligence officer at Channings Wood</p>

<a name="80515-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="08051571000064"></a>The investigation also found that it was only officers at detective constable level in Derbyshire Constabulary who knew of the existence of the legally privileged material. Those officers then failed to inform or seek advice from their senior officers or the force solicitor. The officers involved have since received advice on legal professional privilege and systems within the constabulary have been tightened more generally.</p>

<a name="80515-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="08051571000065"></a>The Chief Constable of Derbyshire has provided assurance that the transcripts held by his constabulary were never used as evidence or intelligence, nor were they disseminated to any senior officer or partner agency. Derbyshire Constabulary reacted promptly, comprehensively and openly once this issue was brought to its attention. Derbyshire Constabulary has given an undertaking not to destroy any material relating to Mr Roberts, but in particular the transcripts of his telephone conversations, including legal conversations without the prior agreement of Mr Creighton and NOMS.</p>

Responses were received from the FRC and the UKHSU. We also consulted regularly during the previous 18 months with the FRC as the regulator and competent authority as concerns farriery.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="08051570000016"></a>The consultation paper made it clear that we were not consulting on the principles underlying directive 2005/36/EC. Its main provisions had already been transposed by the European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007/2781) (&#147;the DIUS regulations&#148;) and came into force on 19 October 2007.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="08051570000018"></a>Concerns were raised during the consultation exercise that the directive's provisions, as concerns the freedom to provide services on a temporary and occasional basis, undermine the standards of farriery in the UK and threaten animal welfare. However, the provisions that determine whether a farrier from another EU member state is eligible to provide temporary services are covered by the DIUS regulations. DIUS consulted with the Farriers Registration Council on these regulations.</p>

<a name="80515w0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a><a name="08051570000019"></a>Regarding the Farriers Qualifications (European Recognition) Regulations, some concern was expressed about the value of registering temporary services providers because it was thought they could escape disciplinary proceedings in this country by returning to their home country or another EU country. However, the directive imposes an obligation on competent authorities to exchange information about disciplinary action taken with each other which provides a safeguard against this. The Farriers Registration Council agreed that registration of temporary providers of farriery was the most appropriate way of managing them.</p>

<a name="80515w0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a><a name="08051570000020"></a>In response to concerns raised, Defra explained that anything that stems from the wording of the directive is not amenable to mitigation, and cannot be changed. We also explained that the UK must transpose the directive in a way which is compatible with principles of EU law as derived from the treaty and case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a><a name="08051570000023"></a>The purpose of directive 2005/36/EC is to make it easier for qualified professionals to practise their professions in European countries other than their own by simplifying the recognition procedures. It is a consolidation of a number of existing directives relating to the recognition of professional qualifications including directive 1999/42/EC which previously dealt with farriers and gave rise to amendments to the Farriers Registration Act under SI 2002/1597.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a><a name="08051570000024"></a>The main provisions of the directive were transposed by the European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007/2781) (&#147;the DIUS regulations&#148;) including provisions concerning farriers, and came into force on 19 October 2007. The DIUS regulations set out the formalities to be followed for access to a wide range of professions in the UK on either a temporary or a permanent basis.</p>

We do not present information covering 40 per cent of median income in our <I>Households Below Average Income</I> series as it is not a sound measure of poverty. This is because households stating the lowest incomes to the Family Resources Survey may not actually have the lowest living standards.

Many of these households having very low incomes would not be considered poor, but genuinely have few sources of income in the short-run.
