<A NAME="10511-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, it may be for the convenience of the House if I explain what will be happening this morning. This House has completed all its substantive business on Bills, but there are three Bills which have still to be considered in another place this morning. It is therefore necessary for us to adjourn and await Messages from the Commons on those three Bills. I am afraid that I do not know how long it will take for the Commons to complete its business and send us the Messages. I understand that it is likely to be something between one and three hours. It would be wrong to make invidious comparisons between the two Houses on the expedition of business.
<P>

<A NAME = "10511-01_para1"></a>I suggest that the House should adjourn during pleasure. We will then watch developments in the Commons carefully and when it becomes clear that the Messages are on their way I shall arrange for a message to be put on the annunciator which will give 10 minutes' notice that this House will reconvene.
<P>

<A NAME = "10511-01_para2"></a>We will then sit to receive the Messages, which I should tell your Lordships will be very brief indeed. It will then be necessary to adjourn again for about 30 minutes to allow the various formalities to be gone through. We will then sit for a third time for the Royal Assent and that will complete our business.
<P>

<A NAME = "10511-01_para3"></a>I hope that your Lordships will find the arrangements acceptable. I beg to move that the House do now adjourn during pleasure until a time to be announced on the annunciator.
<P>

<A NAME = "10511-01_para4"></a>Moved accordingly, and, on Question, Motion agreed to.

<A NAME="10511w01_wqn0"></A><B> Baroness Byford  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:

(d) whether the number of people employed in both their monitoring and policy units has changed since 1997.[HL1530]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="10511w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  (a) Policy includes negotiating, developing and implementing improved rules on welfare during transport in the European Union and in domestic legislation. A dedicated team in Animal Welfare Division is responsible for the monitoring of the operation and enforcementof these rules. They work in close liaison.
<P>

<A NAME = "10511w01_para0"></a>(b) Monitoring of enforcement and compliance is an important part of the Government's twin-track policy of strict enforcement while encouraging the development of improved rules on a EU-wide basis. Monitoring of the rules on welfare during transport is best carried out by the State Veterinary Service and local authorities, which have the day to day responsibility for enforcement. The operations team in Animal Welfare Division maintains the database on transporter authorisations, checks that all new routes can comply with the law and arranges non-discriminatory checks on animals in co-operation with other member states.
<P>

<A NAME = "10511w01_para1"></a>(c) Animal Welfare Division is responsible for animal welfare on farm, during transport, at markets and at slaughter. There are currently 34.6 staff employed on policy duties in these areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "10511w01_para2"></a>(d) The number of staff in Animal Welfare Division has increased by 4.6 persons to 42.6 since 1997; six are employed on operational duties related to animal welfare during transport. An Enforcement Liaison Officer has been appointed to develop day to day working relations between the department and local authorities, which have primary responsibility for enforcement.

<A NAME="10511w01_wqn2"></A><B> Baroness Byford  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether animals on foot and mouth contiguous farms are automatically blood tested; and how many of these contiguous farms were found to be developing the disease.[HL1979]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   As the Government's slaughter policy on contiguous premises does not depend on the identification of infection on these premises, susceptible animals on such farms are not automatically tested for foot and mouth disease.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w01_wqn3"></A><B> Baroness Byford  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How they reconcile the statement by Baroness Hayman on 3 May (H.L. Deb., col. 1957) that "there is no longer any backlog of animals awaiting disposal anywhere in Great Britain" with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food daily situation report on the 4 May which stated that as of 19.00 on the 3 May there were some 38,000 animals awaiting disposal.[HL2126]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   Reports from the Regional Operations Centres at 19.00 on 3 May indicated that some 13,110 carcasses were awaiting disposal. However, due to the time lag between disposal and the information being reported and entered onto the Ministry database, the number of carcasses centrally recorded as awaiting disposal at 19.00 on 3 May was 38,000.

<P>
<A NAME="10511w01_wqn4"></A><B> Baroness Byford  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Further to the statement by Baroness Hayman on 3 May (H.L. Deb., col. 1957) that "there are small numbers of animals awaiting slaughter", whether they consider the figure of 112,000 animals awaiting slaughter, given in the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food daily situation report of 4 May represents a "small number".[HL2127]

However, due to the time lag between slaughter and the information being reported and entered onto the Ministry database, the number of animals centrally recorded as awaiting slaughter at 19.00 on 3 May was 112,000.

<P>
<A NAME="10511w01_wqn5"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How they gauge the relative susceptibility of different animal species to type O foot and mouth disease.[HL1633]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hayman:  </B>  We refer the noble Lord to the reply given to him on 3 May, (H.L. Deb., col. WA 317).
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w01_wqn6"></A><B> Lord Glentoran  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the various types of compensation to farmers for foot and mouth disease in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be the same as in England.[HL1638]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman:  </B>  Compensation for all animals slaughtered as a result of the foot and mouth disease outbreak is paid at the full market value of the animal immediately before slaughter; this is the case in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Standard tariffs of compensation were introduced in GB to speed up the payments of compensation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10511w01_para3"></a>The Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme (LWDS) is available to farmers whose animals face welfare difficulties as a result of movement restrictions. Animals taken under this scheme do not qualify for compensation. Instead a standard rate of payment is made to farmers to help resolve an identified welfare problem. These payments, which vary by species and type of animal, are not a reflection of the commercial or market value of the animal. The scheme is operated by the Intervention Board on behalf of the Ministry, throughout GB. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for Northern Ireland ran a limited pig welfare disposal scheme, under which payments were the same as those for pigs slaughtered under the LWDS. LWDS payments have been set at revised levels for animals collected as of 30 April.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w01_wqn7"></A><B> The Countess of Mar  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Why, early in March, scientists at Pirbright refused the offer of the United States Department of Agriculture to supply field-testing kits based on the amplification of foot and mouth virus RNA by a real-time polymerase chain reaction; and whether they will reconsider their decision.[HL1682]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hayman:  </B>  At no time did Pirbright scientists refuse the offer of field-testing kits. The original request was in fact made for Pirbright to provide the opportunity for field trials of unvalidated technology. Because of the huge pressure of diagnostic work at that time, Pirbright scientists were unable to carry out the comparative testing with the USA <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>equipment which would have been required to validate the test, necessary before using on UK farms. An offer was made for one scientist from the USA to bring the equipment to Pirbright to carry out some comparative testing, but this was not taken up.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w01_wqn8"></A><B> The Countess of Mar  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is the position of farmers who against current Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food advice turn their cattle out to grass because they have exhausted their supplies of fodder and bedding and are unable to purchase further supplies, if those cattle succumb to foot and mouth disease.[HL1683]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hayman:  </B>  This issue raises a number of complex legal issues and any instances of these sort will be considered on a case by case basis.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w01_wqn9"></A><B> Lord Inglewood  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What has been the average time in Cumbria between notification and veterinary confirmation, veterinary confirmation and slaughter, and slaughter and disposal in each of the weeks of the current foot and mouth crisis.[HL1699]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hayman:  </B>  Information on average times during the early stages of the crisis is still being compiled and validated. This is particularly true of the times from report to confirmation. The key information for fighting the disease is the time from report to slaughter. The table below details the requested statistics (in hours).

Although at present there is no explicit 24-hour carcass disposal policy, carcasses are disposed of as rapidly as possible, subject to the availability of disposal methods. Indeed disposal has become continually more rapid throughout the outbreak.<P>

<P>
<UL>What were the serology results in the foot and mouth outbreaks in Welshpool Market.[HL1826]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   To provide a summary of the serology results for animals that passed through Welshpool Market, we would need to check individual tracing records held at a number of different Animal Health Offices. This could only be achieved at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<UL>What fresh advice, if any, was given by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food officials or veterinarians to the Royal Parks Agency about the risk of foot and mouth disease to deer in London's Royal Parks in the fortnight before the parks were re-opened on the 11 April.[HL1922]

<A NAME="10511w02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   Most dealings with Royal Parks are a matter for my right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Mr Chris Smith). However on 9 April 2001 the Ministry published on its website (http://www.maff.gov.uk/) Veterinary Risk Assessment No. 9 entitled What is the risk of causing new outbreaks of FMD if deer parks are open to the public.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w02_wqn4"></A><B> Lord Inglewood </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is the basis of valuation used by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when, as part of subsequent disinfection of a farm infected with foot and mouth disease, they order buildings or fixtures to be removed or modified; and what is its legal basis; and[HL1997]
<P>
What form of appeal there is when the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food orders the removal or modification of a building as part of the disinfection of a farm infected with foot and mouth; and what are the procedures and legal basis for such an appeal.[HL1998]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   The Ministry bears the costs of the cleansing and disinfecting process. Where repairs are required before satisfactory cleansing and disinfection can be achieved, the costs of these repairs are borne by the farmer.
<P>

<A NAME = "10511w02_para4"></a>The Ministry cannot compel farmers to comply with the requirement to carry out repairs. But if they do not, their premises (or part of their premises) would have to be left under Form A restrictions until the residual virus had died. This could take up to a year or even longer.
<P>

<A NAME = "10511w02_para5"></a>Any farmer who does not wish to carry out repairs to his premises should contact the local divisional veterinary manager.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w02_wqn5"></A><B> Lord Vivian  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Why the latest case of foot and mouth disease at Great Wigborough in Essex, which involved the slaughter of animals, was not included in the list of cases for the period from Friday 27 to Sunday 29 April, reported by constituency under the new daily reporting system announced in Parliament by the Minister of Agriculture on 26 April; and whether they will give full details of this case.[HL2020]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman:  </B>  The case mentioned does not appear on the list of confirmed cases published in the MAFF foot and mouth website. Our policy, based on legal advice, is to release details of infected premises as this information is necessary for the control of foot and mouth. For reasons of data protection and confidentiality we only release information on other premises affected by the outbreak to organisations that require it for the purpose of safeguarding public health and for co-ordinating rural recovery programmes, unless the individual concerned has given written consent.

<P>
<UL>When they will make arrangements for the virological scientist, Colin G Fink, to be supplied with fixed (non infectious) virus or extracted nucleic acid (RNA) from the foot and mouth virus currently causing the infection so that he may develop a rapid specific viral assay, following the requests made and apparent agreement to do so given by Lindsay Harris of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Dr Paul Kitching, Head of the Exotic Disease Reference Laboratory at Pirbright in meetings held on 24 April.[HL2145]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hayman:  </B>  This subject is a complex matter, dealing with a major notifiable disease which spreads rapidly. The request referred to raises important issues of biosecurity and disease control and is under discussion. No agreement to this request was given or implied by any civil servant of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The official in question offered to put Colin G Fink in contact with the relevant experts, which was done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   The Ministry has been contracted partners with New Zealand to the EpiMAN project since 1996. EpiMAN is a decision support system which combines epidemiological knowledge of foot and mouth disease with computer information processing techniques. An updated version of the system was obtained and installed on Monday 26 February 2001. This system has been developed over a number of years using the experience from previous outbreaks. Therefore no further evaluation was required.

<P>
<A NAME="10511w02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   The Government and, in Scotland, the Scottish Executive will work to identify ways of assisting the recovery of the farming sector. Particular attention will be given to those areas where the incidence of foot and mouth disease has been highest, namely Cumbria (681 cases*), Dumfries and Galloway (173* cases) and Devon (163 cases*).

<P>
<UL>With regard to the foot and mouth outbreak, how they reconcile the phrase used by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on 26 April "as the disease is brought under control" with his remark on 13 March on BBC Radio 4, "I am certain that we have it under control".[HL1944]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   From the outset we have had a range of control measures in place. That these have been effective in controlling the disease is shown by the rapid decline in the number of confirmed cases.

<A NAME="10511w03_wqn1"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>

<P>
Further to the Written Answer by Baroness Hayman on 2 May (WA 270), whether there is an increased risk of disease or pollutants being spread by the burning of sprayed as opposed to unsprayed stock.[HL2091]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   Carcasses are sprayed with an approved disinfectant before burning, which destroys any virus on the outside of the animal and so reduces the risk of any infection spreading at this stage. This is an established policy, contained in the standing instructions to the field State Veterinary Service. The procedure of spraying carcasses has not been specifically publicised to farmers. Disinfection of carcasses is the responsibility of my department. The procedure is supervised at all times by an appropriate person.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10511w03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   The addition of quicklime to carcasses is an historical practice and was done for the purpose of killing organisms such as anthrax spores. It is not necessary in this situation, as the foot and mouth virus is killed by the natural decomposition process. No recent research into the effects of lime on carcasses has been undertaken.
