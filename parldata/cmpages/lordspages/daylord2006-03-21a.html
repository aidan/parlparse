<a name="60321-01_star0"></a><h3 align=center>Energy: Future Marine Energy</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What is their response to the report from the Carbon Trust, <i>Future Marine Energy.</i>
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My Lords, the Carbon Trust&#039;s Future Marine Energy report provides a useful vision of the potential for marine renewables. The Government also recognise this potential and, since 1999, have committed more than &#163;75 million to support the development of these technologies. That includes &#163;42 million under the DTI&#039;s wave and tidal stream energy demonstration scheme, which will support a number of multi-device, grid-connected pre-commercial demonstrations. The demonstration scheme will allow industry to show that the vision can become a reality.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. He is right to say that the vision needs to become a reality. However, does he accept some of the conclusions in the report about economies of scale and the importance of the commercial orders now coming in? What are the Government doing to encourage the UK to place orders such as the one that Portugal placed last week for a wave power generator that was developed in Scotland? Can the Minister reassure me that we will not develop all these technologies only to lose to the rest of the world the ability to generate energy from them?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, an element of economy of scale is involved, but we need to be careful when we are talking about technologies such as tidal lagoons, which is a reasonably mature technology. As for orders, it is correct that the Portuguese Government have a long association with wave energy. They have an interesting thing&#151;a feed-in tariff, which is 23 euro cents or about 15p per kilowatt hour. That is how the Portuguese Government are supporting that technology. It is interesting: using the Portuguese tariff will mean that it will take approximately twice as long to break even as a similar project under the DTI&#039;s marine renewables deployment fund. Our scheme is a good way of achieving the same end.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree with another of the recommendations in the Carbon Trust&#039;s report that,
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_130"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 130</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;Developing a clear long-term policy framework of support&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>would be most important for tidal and wave technologies, as it would provide &quot;greater investment certainty&quot;? Does he further agree that that would be important for all forms of energy generation? Is the energy review likely to provide some information on that?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, I agree. We have such a scheme in place; that is what the renewable obligation is about. It is important that we have stability on that scheme.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Redesdale: </b>   My Lords, how seriously are the Government taking marine energy? In their own consultation document, <i>Our Energy Challenge</i>:<i> Securing clean, affordable energy for the long-term, </i>I could not find one mention of marine-generated electricity. If that is the case, that is an indication that the Government are not even contemplating seriously the inclusion of marine-generated electricity in the future.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, as I said, since 1999 we have committed more than &#163;75 million to support the technologies. For a technology at this stage of development and with the current costs, that seems to be a suitable investment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Platt of Writtle: </b>   My Lords, we had a presentation in the House about a lagoon off Swansea that did not interfere with navigation. Is that going ahead?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, there is a proposal by a company called Tidal Electric Limited for a Swansea Bay tidal lagoon, which was put forward as part of a demonstration of new technologies. In fact it was turned down because it is in fact a very traditional and mature technology, and there is nothing very innovative about it. The company is now trying to get finance for it on a private basis.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   My Lords, is it the Civil Aviation Authority that gives these directions? I have a reason for asking that is not wholly related to this Question.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord&#039;s question relates to the next Question.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Ezra: </b>   My Lords, can the noble Lord explain why if tidal lagoon technology is a mature technology it should nevertheless not be supported by the Government as being a renewable technology? After all, wind power is a mature technology, and it is strongly supported by the Government.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, the point that I was making was that there are two different things here. We have a demonstration project that we give money for, when new technology is demonstrated. If <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_131"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 131</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the company built the tidal lagoon and it was producing electricity, that would be supported under the renewables obligation in the same way as wind is.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew12"></a><b> Viscount Tenby: </b>   My Lords, is any research being carried out into the question of whether the Severn tidal bore could be harnessed in any way? If not, why not?
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, the Severn barrage project has been looked at a number of times. It is an enormously expensive scheme and, as of this moment, the economics of it do not look very desirable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Anderson of Swansea: </b>   My Lords, the objection in the past given to the Swansea lagoon project was that of cost. Now the Minister says that it is an outdated technology. Have the Government changed their position?
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, I did not say that it was an outdated technology. It is a perfectly good, mature technology, which is well understood, and there is no need for it to be supported by funds for developing new technologies. That is the point that I was making. If the figures are as the proposers of the scheme suggest&#151;we will produce a report that will look at the costs that they produce&#151;they should be able to get private finance for it. In combination with the renewables obligation, that should make it a perfectly good project financially.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   My Lords, the Severn barrage costings, as I understand it, were largely undertaken when the price of oil was still down at $20 a barrel. What impact has the rise in oil prices had on the relative cost of energy from that project?
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, obviously, every time that oil or gas prices go up, that will help the economics of it. I have not seen any calculation done recently, in the light of current figures, but no doubt those who are keen on the scheme will soon produce new figures to show that it really after all is a good expenditure of &#163;14 billion.

<a name="60321-01_star1"></a><h3 align=center>Aviation: Diversion of Stricken Aircraft</h3>
<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="60321-01_time0"></a><h5>2.43 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Whether the provisions for directing stricken aircraft to diversion airports are satisfactory.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the commander of an aircraft is responsible for the safety of that aircraft. Consequently, responsibility for determining what represents a suitable diversion airport rests with the commander. Each emergency incident is unique. It is not feasible to issue prescriptive guidance to air traffic controllers on handling emergency situations. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_132"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 132</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Civil Aviation Authority guidance is regularly reviewed; the next modification will be promulgated on 28 April following the diversion of an aircraft&#151;call-sign Evergreen 1435&#151;into Heathrow.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60321-01_spnew19"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his Answer. However, is he aware that in the past five years 39 aircraft such as airliners have declared emergencies&#151;technical not medical emergencies&#151;and have either landed at Heathrow or been diverted to Heathrow or Gatwick? Is it right that stricken aircraft that are probably in immediate danger should let down over densely populated areas such as the centre of London? In particular, the aircraft to which the Minister referred, the Evergreen, let down over the centre of London, having diverted to Heathrow. That aircraft had one engine shut off and three spooling down. Such aircraft in imminent danger should surely go to diversionary airfields. What diversionary airfields will be made available for the safety of the centre of London and other such urban centres?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60321-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the Evergreen commander demanded that the aircraft should put down at Heathrow, and he is the final arbiter of the airport designated because he alone can judge how serious the emergency is in his aircraft. The CAA is advising air traffic controllers that, where they can, they should communicate to commanders that the airfields to which they should go are those that involve the least risk, but the final decision is with the aircraft commander.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Trumpington: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that I speak as a past chairman of the Air Transport Users Council? As such, I commend what he said. Stricken aircraft, to use my noble friend&#039;s words, must go to the nearest airfield where they can land safely for themselves, their passengers and anyone on the ground. Is the number of near misses still published every year? That is well worth having a look at.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the number of near misses is identified in publications so that the accuracy can be presented in those terms. There are often rather melodramatic stories about how close aircraft get to each other that, when investigated, prove not to be a real emergency. This was a real emergency; the commander was above Heathrow and said that he intended the aircraft to set down at that airport. The air traffic controllers are obliged to comply.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, as the president of the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), I can say that the Minister&#039;s Answer has the entire approval of the union. The decision should always be left to the pilot. Any other solution is not worthy of contemplation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, pilots are on flight plans where they might not know the available options, and air traffic controllers have been advised <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_133"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 133</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that, where they are in a position to communicate a choice of airfields that could be used in an emergency, the aircraft should be diverted to the one that will cause the fewest potential problems on the ground. But the ultimate position is for the commander of the aircraft to take.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   My Lords, I apologise for asking the right question at entirely the wrong time.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I was grateful for the forewarning of the question and feel utterly capable of answering it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   My Lords, I understand that the aircraft concerned in the accident that gave rise to the Question was coming in over the Thames estuary and heading for central London. From its location, it clearly could have landed in Manston, which is in east Kent. So far as the Minister is aware, was any attempt made to advise the aircraft captain of that possibility?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the aircraft was at 36,000 feet, and therefore had a range of options. But the pilot could see an airfield down below and said, &quot;I can see through clear cloud that the visibility at that airport is excellent&quot;. When it was communicated to him that it was London Heathrow, he still decided to take that option.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the air traffic controller guidance states that it is desirable that aircraft should not be routed over densely populated areas in emergencies? Is he aware also that the Air Accidents Investigation Branch asks whether sufficient guidance is provided on the avoidance of built-up areas when vectoring aircraft in an emergency?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the Civil Aviation Authority and the whole aviation industry have learnt lessons from Evergreen 1435. The fresh advice emphasises that, where air traffic controllers can influence the commander of the aircraft, he should certainly, where it is possible, be diverted to the airport of least risk. On that occasion, the aircraft commander was insistent. The air traffic controllers complied and brought him down safely.

<a name="60321-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>Whether they propose to cancel all of the debt incurred by Nigeria.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the 20 October 2005 Paris Club agreement with Nigeria represents the largest debt relief package ever in sub-Saharan Africa. Creditors will cancel 60 per cent of Nigeria&#039;s &#163;17 billion debt. The UK alone will <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_134"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 134</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

cancel &#163;2.8 billion. Nigeria will use part of its oil windfall to pay the remaining debt. It would be illegal for ECGD to go beyond the Paris Club agreement and cancel debt for development reasons.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. We have a one-off golden opportunity to cancel the repayment of Nigeria&#039;s debt and to bring hope to many millions of people. With the Nigerian elections due next March, do the Government envisage, once those elections are seen to be free and fair, the money being made available then? In a <i>Guardian</i> article of 11 January, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there must be,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;full debt relief for not 38 but all the world&#039;s poorest countries&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>Do Her Majesty&#039;s Government agree with that statement?
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, there has been a misunderstanding about the technicalities. The ECGD is not able to write off the balance of the debt under its constitution under the Export and Investment Guarantees Act 1991. Furthermore, there has been no windfall to the UK Government. In technical terms, this is a balance sheet item. If the UK Government were to grant further relief, they would either increase public expenditure or have to shift resources from existing programmes, particularly of DfID. That would be inappropriate, given Nigeria&#039;s relative position.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Rawlings: </b>   My Lords, despite the Paris Club agreement that the Minister mentioned, can Her Majesty&#039;s Government justify debt relief as being the most effective way of helping Nigeria, which is probably potentially one of the richest countries in Africa, but sadly is unstable, riddled with corruption, with criminal networks stealing an estimated 300,000 barrels of oil daily, and with unrest between violent Islamist and domestic rebels growing? Have Her Majesty&#039;s Government had any discussions with China, whose Foreign Minister recently said of its new involvement with the Nigerian regime, &quot;We try to separate politics from business&quot;?
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the Paris Club agreement arose from an initiative by the Government of Nigeria, given the windfall that they have received from oil revenues. The Paris Club creditors took the overall view that it was a reasonable deal for them and a good deal for Nigeria, coupled, as it should be, with making sure that the savings that Nigeria makes&#151;something like &#163;1 billion a year&#151;are recycled to make sure that more youngsters enter education and that more teachers are available locally. Nigeria is a very poor country, and it has about a quarter of the population of Africa. It is entirely right that we participated. At the Government&#039;s request, we led the way in creating the agreement.
</p>

<a name="60321-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Foulkes of Cumnock: </b>   My Lords, may I encourage my noble friend to ignore the negative <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 135</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

comments coming from the other side of the House? Will he confirm that it is because of the initiative of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for International Development that all the debt cancellation deals right around the world are taking place? Will he also confirm that because of the debt deal in Nigeria, $1 million at least is being freed up and that that is going to poverty reduction? My estimate is that about three and a half million people&#151;young children&#151;will go to school in Nigeria as a result of that. That is something that we should be proud of.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="60321-02_spnew17"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, yes, I agree with my noble friend. He is right. I think that some three and a half million children will be given the chance of an education as a result of this. The UK Government have led the way through the Gleneagles summit agreement to cancel up to $55 billion of debts owed to the IMF, the World Bank and the African Development Bank. Along the way, DfID itself has committed &#163;1.1 billion in bilateral assistance to Africa for 2005&#150;06 and twice that amount of aid through multilateral institutions. It is also working hard to make a success of the Doha round. That is quite apart from the work that is being done on the IFF for Immunisation programme and the IFF arrangement itself. The Government should justifiably be proud of their record in this area.

Have the British Government discovered the location of the moneys that the Abacha regime squirreled out of Nigeria and into British banks and whether they have returned them to Nigeria?

The right reverend Prelate is right about the initiative that has been taken by the current Government of Nigeria. I think that they were described by the IMF as having one of the best finance teams in Africa. They have worked on a home-grown reform programme with countrywide consultations on content called the national economic empowerment and development strategy. Things are changing. The original debt was created under trading arrangements, and the ECGD, the creditor, was involved obviously because it had to meet guarantees to people undertaking trade with Nigeria.

has had a facility to retire early represented by what we call the 85-year rule. We believe that that is age discrimination, which causes the problem.
</p>

<a name="60321-03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>The other difference is that the LGPS is a funded pension scheme with a different financing arrangement. Because other public sector schemes are pay-as-you-go, they can manage short-, medium- and long-term costs in a different way, so the protections must be different. I assure the noble Baroness that we are clear about what we want to see in pensions&#151;good public sector pensions for everyone, no matter where they work.
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="60321-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Marsh: </b>   My Lords, I should declare an interest having once been involved with a public sector company. Does the Minister not agree that the less that politicians get involved with industrial relations, the better it is for those who have to manage the company?
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="60321-03_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, I completely agree with the noble Lord. The role of the tripartite committee is precisely to stand apart while facilitating discussion. The ODPM and Government are not the employers. We want to see a reformed scheme that will bring better benefits while removing the age discriminatory element that also discriminates against women. The noble Lord is absolutely right: it is up to the trades unions and the employers to negotiate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="60321-03_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Lockwood: </b>   My Lords, would my noble friend not agree that the 85-year rule is not only discriminatory on grounds of age but also against women, given their broken employment pattern? Is that an issue that the Government might raise in their discussions with the LGA?
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="60321-03_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   Yes, my Lords, that point is important. The fact is that it is an old pension scheme. Its roots are in a time when the majority of local government employees were men. Indeed, up until the 1970s, when the scheme was last reviewed, 75 per cent were men. The workforce is different now; women are the majority, and a majority are part-time.
</p>

<a name="60321-03_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>The slightly complicated 85-year rule essentially means that people can work the same number of years, but if their ages differ some will retire on a fully funded pension&#151;if they have achieved 85 years&#151;while others with exactly the same length of service will achieve a less well funded pension. Because women cannot build up those commitments in the workplace, they are almost bound to be disadvantaged by that. Indeed, 25 per cent of people in the local government pension scheme do not benefit at all from the 85-year rule.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="60321-03_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, would the Minister agree that this scheme is meant to be fully funded but at present it is funded only to the tune of 73 per cent? Would she also agree that there is a shortfall of &#163;32 billion in the scheme, which represents more than <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_138"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 138</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&#163;1,400 per household in the country? Does she have any knowledge of how the scheme is expected to come back into full balance?
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="60321-03_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, I believe that the noble Baroness is correct and, if I am wrong, I will write to her in detail. She will know that we have made it clear twice that the costs of revocation would not fall either to the council tax payer or the central taxpayer; neither would the costs of a reformed scheme be borne by taxpayers, because we could not agree to changes that added to a rise in the cost of council tax.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="60321-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   My Lords, I should remind the House that I am a local district councillor. Is the Minister aware that many of us have considerable sympathy with the employees and are in a difficult position, as local employers, in coping with the situation? Are the Government aware that the unions are talking of a second round of strikes, possibly on 3 and 4 May, coinciding with the local elections? What advice do the Government plan to give to local authorities and returning officers if that happens?
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="60321-03_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, of course a strike ballot is a matter for the trades unions. Likewise, any strikes in the public service, especially those that affect vulnerable people, are of concern to us all. We very much hope that the trades unions will consider and reconsider, because, through the tripartite committee, we are working hard to bring the parties together to reach an understanding on how to move forward to a better pension scheme that does away with an age-discriminatory element, as we are required to do under our obligations to Europe. We hope that we can continue those discussions.
</p>

<a name="60321-03_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>We are sorry that the trades unions have pre-empted the decision; but we will go on talking, and we will certainly bear in mind the need to give local authorities advice and support. Any contingency planning is a matter for them in the first instance.

<a name="60321-04_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville) </b>  moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>Page 24, line 6, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_0"></a><br>
&quot;(2B)   For the purposes of subsection (2A)(e), the business practices which the OFT may consider to be deceitful or oppressive or otherwise unfair or improper include practices in the carrying on of a consumer credit business that appear to the OFT to involve irresponsible lending.&quot;&quot;

<p><a name="st_56"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, last week I tabled an amendment to Clause 29. At the same time I wrote to those noble Lords who had participated in our debates on this issue, explaining why I had done this.
</p>

<a name="60321-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>In Grand Committee and on Report noble Lords expressed their concerns about irresponsible lending practices. I have considered their contributions on this issue carefully and have some sympathy for the positions they have expressed and thought hard about how we could respond. I believe that the wording of Clause 29 would allow the OFT to take account of irresponsible lending practices. We now feel, in the light of noble Lords&#039; contributions, that there is merit in making the ability of the OFT to do this explicit on the face of the legislation.
</p>

<a name="60321-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>I turn to the form of the amendment: rather than introducing a duty on lenders, the most appropriate means of addressing irresponsible lending practices is in the context of the OFT&#039;s powers to monitor and enforce the fitness of licence holders. With this amendment, the OFT, which is best placed to monitor changing practices in a dynamic market, will be able to provide guidance to licence holders on lending practices which, on the basis of the OFT&#039;s knowledge and experience of the market, are likely to be regarded by it as irresponsible lending practices.
</p>

<a name="60321-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>The OFT would do that through its fitness guidance. That approach will allow the OFT to provide business with an indication of what types of things are considered to be irresponsible lending practices. Businesses would therefore have some guidance of the types of conduct that they should avoid, while not being discouraged from seeking out new ways of addressing customer demand. This would be backed by the sanction available to the OFT of reviewing a lender&#039;s fitness to hold a licence if the lender engages in such practices.
</p>

<a name="60321-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>In taking this route, the Government have been mindful of existing OFT regulatory practice. For example, the OFT has published guidance on certain kinds of irresponsible lending practices that it is likely to regard as unfair or improper, most notably in its non-status lending guidelines, which are available from the OFT website.
</p>

<a name="60321-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has expressed some concern to me about the ambit of the term &quot;lending&quot; and that it might not embrace some forms of lending such as hire purchase. I reassure your Lordships&#039; House, as I have already reassured her, that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_140"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 140</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&quot;lending&quot; in this context should have its natural, ordinary meaning, in that it connotes the existence of a lender-borrower relationship, and we consider that that natural meaning would include the granting of credit in all its forms.
</p>

<a name="60321-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>In tabling this amendment I recognise the contribution of noble Lords on both sides of the House in seeking a clear recognition in the Bill of the importance of discouraging irresponsible lending practices. The amendment does that in a way that accommodates the desire of those noble Lords on the opposition Benches to make clear the OFT&#039;s power to provide business with some greater indication of irresponsible lending practices that should be avoided.
</p>

<a name="60321-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>The amendment does not&#151;as has been suggested in the press&#151;increase the powers of the OFT. It simply makes it clear that the OFT, in exercising its powers, may have regard to irresponsible lending practices in determining fitness to hold a licence under the Act. The Government have listened to noble Lords&#039; concerns and amended the Bill. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="60321-04_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   My Lords, at Second Reading I commented on a deficiency in the Bill, which did not impose any degree of responsibility at all on creditors to ensure that the debtor had the ability to meet the obligation that he was taking on. In Committee I introduced an amendment which provided for the creditor to make inquiries which were not onerous in nature. We could not vote on it in Committee and, because of the circumstances of your Lordships&#039; House on Report, I was not able to test the opinion of the House then.
</p>

<a name="60321-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>I had brought my amendment back, intending to move it and expecting to vote on it today, but in the interval the Minister has offered a compromise in the form of his amendment. I am extremely grateful that he is offering something, although this compromise is slightly more onerous than my much more modest one would have been. However, on the basis that we are at Third Reading and want to get something, I intend to accept his amendment from our side.
</p>

<a name="60321-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>This whole matter deals with what the amendment calls irresponsible lending. I do not wish to be churlish, but I wrote to the Minister because, in my view, the amendment did not deal with irresponsible granting of credit&#151;one of the problems where we had so many terrible horror stories of people getting all these credit cards and really getting themselves into trouble. Nevertheless, the Minister wrote to me and has said in the House today that he thinks it does. He quoted from all the different dictionaries about the meaning of the word and I accept what he says. We just hope that this is not a problem that will come back to haunt us when yet another tragic case appears.
</p>

<a name="60321-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>I hope that what the Minister has said the situation is, it will turn out to be. I also hope that the OFT will, by its power of regulation of the credit licences, be able <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_141"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 141</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to protect the vulnerable and&#151;yes, indeed&#151;the sometimes foolish and profligate people. I do not intend to oppose this amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="60321-04_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   My Lords, from these Benches, we too welcome this amendment. At Second Reading and the various stages of this Bill, we have had a number of debates on the inter-relationship between a right or an obligation to lend responsibly, the powers of the OFT and what should be in the Bill. What the Government have come forward with is a compromise between the various views that have been expressed and I welcome the fact that they have been prepared to do that.
</p>

<a name="60321-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>There still remains a concern in two areas. First, there is undoubtedly concern among the providers of credit that the lack of definition on the face of the Bill as to what constitutes responsible lending will enable the OFT to define its own powers and then enforce them without consultation. That is one reason why a number of us have argued that there should be more definition in the Bill because, once it leaves your Lordships&#039; House, we are completely in the hands of the OFT in relation to the definitions of its powers and irresponsible lending. When the Minister replies, I would welcome a comment from him on whether he has any information on the consultation processes that the OFT will go through in guiding the industry towards avoiding unnecessary mistakes by providers of credit.
</p>

<a name="60321-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>That leads to the second area, which touches on the industry&#039;s concerns that the timetable published by the Minister&#039;s department contains a number of areas of secondary legislation, guidance and consultation. Will the Government bear in mind that instituting the necessary systems&#151;particularly IT systems&#151;to reflect the change in the law will often take, say, 18 months from regulatory certainty to full implementation? In their timetable for this, will the Government, first, press the OFT to take that into account, and, secondly, take it into account themselves?
</p>

<a name="60321-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Having said that, we obviously welcome the amendment as progress. It has been a pleasurable Bill in which to participate, as the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, will undoubtedly agree. It is always a pleasure to do business with the noble Baroness, particularly when the Minister can compromise with her.

<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="60321-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   My Lords, one of the principal tasks of the Office of Fair Trading under the Consumer Credit Act is determining whether someone is fit to hold a consumer credit licence. Evidence that an applicant has engaged in deceitful, oppressive, unfair or improper business practices is one factor that may indicate unfitness to hold such a licence, as set out in Clause 29. The amendment would spell out clearly that irresponsible lending is included in that criterion of unfitness.
</p>

<a name="60321-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>I welcome the amendment because irresponsible lending is a very serious mischief engaged in by some in the consumer credit industry. Lending to those who <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_142"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 142</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

are already overcommitted with debt is irresponsible. I trust that this new provision will incentivise lenders and potential lenders to take a good deal of care in checking out the borrower&#039;s means to repay and the extent to which repayment may be inhibited by the obligations that the borrower has to other lenders. I very much welcome the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="60321-05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Borrie for his comments. We gave a great deal of thought to his intervention on this matter during the debate because he has so much experience in this area.
</p>

<a name="60321-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>Clause 42 covers the question of consultation on guidance. There is a specific requirement for the OFT to consult whomever it thinks necessary, and its record of doing so is very good. When we come to Amendment No. 3, we will debate whether it should be left to the OFT to do that or whether we want to see some political interference in the process. We think that the OFT is a very good body for doing that. We will, as always, urge the OFT to look far ahead in a thorough way with regard to systems and implementation.
</p>

<a name="60321-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<p><a name="st_61"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>After Clause 37, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_1"></a><br>
&quot;OFT&#039;S GENERAL DUTIES

<br>
      After section 1 of the 1974 Act insert&#151;


<br>
      &quot;OFT&#039;s general duties


<br>
(1)   In discharging its functions under this Act to regulate the conduct of licences, the OFT must, so far as is reasonably possible, act in a way&#151;


<br>
(a)   which is compatible with the regulatory objectives; and


<br>
(b)   which the OFT considers most appropriate for the purpose of meeting those objectives.


<br>
(2)   The regulatory objectives are&#151;


<br>
(a)   the protection of consumers;


<br>
(b)   the promotion of an efficient and innovative consumer credit industry; and


<br>
(c)   maintaining a competitive market in consumer credit.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_62"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I apologise for labouring the point on this amendment, but as your Lordships will remember, we withdrew it on Report, reserving our right to bring it back. Our purpose in retabling it is that we felt it should be made clear on the face of the Bill that the OFT&#039;s regulatory objectives should very clearly include a balance between consumer protection, the promotion of an efficient and innovative consumer credit industry and the maintenance of a competitive market. At this stage, I reiterate my declaration of an interest as set out in the Register of Lords&#039; Interests.
</p>

<a name="60321-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Since Report stage I have written to the Minister and I have received a very helpful response on this and on the subsequent amendment. I understand that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_143"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 143</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

those letters are available in the Library. I hope he will agree with me that it will be useful to have the debate on the record and that he will forgive me if I go over the points. I should also explain that, as a result of that correspondence, we have removed what were subsection (2)(d) and subsection (3) from the amendment that was tabled on Report. They dealt with avoiding unnecessary and disproportionate burdens on business. We dropped them on the ground that Clauses 19 and 20 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill would give statutory effect to the commitment of the OFT, currently contained in the voluntary Cabinet Office enforcement concordat, to act proportionately and to minimise the costs of compliance for business by ensuring that any action it requires is proportionate to the risks.
</p>

<a name="60321-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>However, as an overall point on the amendment, as your Lordships are aware, we on these Benches remain concerned at the extent of the powers of the OFT and this amendment seeks to achieve a balanced approach. In his letter in response to mine, the Minister sought to emphasise a difference between the FSA and the OFT by saying that the FSA has extensive rule-making powers and by contrasting that with the way in which consumer credit is handled. Yet the practical effect of the Bill is to vest huge powers in the hands of the OFT. All the detailed guidance that the OFT will produce will, in reality, be rules for want of another name. It is true that guidance is, formally, no more than that and that it is for the courts to decide matters of law. But local enforcement authorities will treat such guidance as definitive; many, particularly small, businesses will regard it as authoritative; and only the brave, the foolhardy and the rich will challenge it in the courts.
</p>

<a name="60321-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Similarly, the OFT&#039;s new licensing powers are extensive and we feel need to be the subject of effective parliamentary scrutiny. We see a conflict between arguing, on the one hand, that a key element of the Bill involves giving the regulator more power to regulate the market, yet, on the other, saying that the powers are not so great as to warrant proper democratic accountability. We feel we need a framework, some parameters within which those rules or guidance are to be set. So the specific objectives contained in the amendment are consumer protection, the promotion of an efficient and innovative consumer credit industry and the maintenance of a competitive market.
</p>

<a name="60321-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>On consumer protection, the Minister said in his letter to me that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;the whole purpose of the Consumer Credit Act (and the Bill when finalised) in relation to the OFT is to protect consumers&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>He went on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;I am not sure what else you think the OFT should be doing, or would do if there were a specific objective about consumer protection&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>I hope noble Lords will forgive my naivety, but just because something is obvious does not appear to prevent the Government stating it. For example, it did not prevent the Government tabling the amendment that we have just dealt with on Clause 29, despite as the Minister said in a separate letter on that subject to several noble Lords, including my noble friend <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_144"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 144</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lady Miller of Hendon, the fact that he thought the previous wording already allowed the OFT to take account of irresponsible lending practices where it thinks it relevant.
</p>

<a name="60321-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>In relation to the maintenance of a competitive market and the promotion of an efficient and innovative consumer credit industry, the Minister said in his letter to me that the OFT&#039;s published goal is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;to make markets work well for consumers. Markets work well when there is vigorous competition between fair-dealing businesses. When markets work well, good businesses flourish&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>While we may agree with that, nevertheless it sounds like a mission statement. I hope your Lordships will forgive me when I voice scepticism of mission statements which often seem to be pure marketing speak. Since that mission statement&#151;if that is what it is&#151;is written by the OFT, presumably it can be rewritten at any time to suit the OFT&#039;s purposes. So it is a long way short of a requirement placed on it by legislation.
</p>

<a name="60321-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>This Bill, when enacted, ought to be, so far as reasonably possible, future proof, so the intentions of Parliament should be set out on its face. In his letter the Minister said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;we would not wish to create a situation where the OFT might grant a licence to a less &#039;fit&#039; person because it might be desirable to have more of a certain type of business in the market&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>That is a reasonable point, but it ought to be the regulator&#039;s job to take difficult decisions. Our point is that we need to require the OFT to take a balanced approach and that there needs to be a benchmark against which to demonstrate that that has been achieved. The amendment would make the OFT more accountable and enable Parliament to assess its performance. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="60321-05_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   My Lords, I support the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley. A thread runs through what those of us who are generally in support of the Bill have been trying to say. It runs through our comments on a number of Bills that emanate from the Department of Trade and Industry. We believe that we must, wherever possible, retain the right to parliamentary scrutiny of the proposals, the regulations and the actions of non-elected bodies. The Minister earlier gave the game away, because he said that surely it was better for the OFT to be making decisions on the matter rather than the Government.
</p>

<a name="60321-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>I entirely agree with him: no one on these Benches or indeed the Conservative Benches is suggesting that it would be better for the Government to make decisions. We are suggesting that we need to have proper parliamentary scrutiny and that legislation that emanates from the Department of Trade and Industry should be in such a form that there can be proper democratic scrutiny of regulations in both Houses of Parliament. That is the point we are trying to achieve and there is a consistency and a thread through the amendments that we and the Conservative Opposition have proposed to try to achieve that. I agree that if there was a choice between the Government and the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="60321-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   My Lords, on the face of it this seems an unobjectionable, harmless, even useful amendment, but when we look at the three regulatory objectives as described in the amendment, the first one, the protection of consumers, is to my mind a statement of the obvious. The OFT has been operating the Consumer Credit Act for more than 30 years. No one has suggested that it has had some different kind of objective from the one set forth there&#151;the protection of the consumer. Let me take the third regulatory objective set out: maintaining a competitive market in consumer credit. That sits well enough with the Office of Fair Trading&#039;s various and in recent years increasing powers to promote competition and handle monopolies, restrictive practices and anti-competitive practices of all kinds. It hardly needs a specific reference in this legislation in view of that.
</p>

<a name="60321-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>The second regulatory objective that the amendment desires to set out is the promotion of an efficient and innovative consumer credit industry. I am not sure how anybody can pursue that unless it is backed up by some kind of detailed provision in the legislation, which it is not. I am not sure that alongside the protection of consumers, which the noble Lord has admitted is the real primary objective, it is feasible to start thinking that the Office of Fair Trading has all the time to be concerned with whether we have any efficient industry and trying to promote innovative kinds of consumer credit giving. I do not see that as part of the objectives of the OFT and I therefore ask noble Lords to oppose the amendment.

<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60321-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Freeman: </b>   My Lords, I cannot agree with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. I strongly support the amendment moved in a reasonable fashion by my noble friend Lord De Mauley, but this House should not be mislead by the reasonableness of his argument to think that the amendment is not going to be pressed. I believe that it should be, and I shall explain why. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, argued that Amendment No. 2 is, in part, a statement of the obvious. Therefore, he can surely have no objection to it. In relation to subsection (2)(b) of the new clause, the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, and, perhaps, of the Minister is that there is no clear definition. The Minister argued that the word &quot;irresponsible&quot; would be covered by guidance and guidance could cover subsection (2)(b).
</p>

<a name="60321-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>This House should look at whether, on balance, this amendment is helpful. It is helpful in a deregulatory sense for three reasons. First, it is clear&#151;clearer than the references in the two earlier pieces of legislation put together. Indeed, it is not an exact replication in terms of earlier legislation. Secondly, it is balanced. Here I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, because the amendment balances the need to protect the consumer. My noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon has consistently said throughout the proceedings on the Bill that we on these Benches support clear, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_146"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 146</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

sensible, practical protection for the consumer. But one must also remember the suppliers; that is, the industry. It is important that legislation strikes a balance. Finally, the language of the amendment emphasises the importance of light regulation. I hope that the House will accept the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60321-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, spoke about the guidance. I am unpersuaded that the argument advanced on Report was erroneous. It was that Parliament is not seeking to interfere with the decisions of the OFT. All that Parliament is asking is that the Minister should approve the issuance of the guidance and therefore be answerable. That is a clear, sensible, parliamentary procedure and principle, and I hope that this House will accept it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="60321-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I thank noble Lords who have participated in this debate. I know that concerns have been expressed about the way in which the OFT might discharge its duties under the legislation and that the noble Lord, Lord de Mauley, has had an exchange of correspondence with my noble friend Lord Sainsbury. That correspondence has been placed in the Library of the House. I am aware that this exchange will be reiterating stated positions, but it is important that we get them on the record. I am sorry that our response is likely to disappoint the noble Lord.
</p>

<a name="60321-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>I will address the arguments set out in the letter from my noble friend Lord Sainsbury and emphasise, for the benefit of noble Lords, why this amendment is unnecessary. The concept that the noble Lord has placed at the centre of the amendment, that of general duties for the OFT, seems to be drawn from Section 2 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which sets out the regulatory objectives of the Financial Services Authority. That suggests&#151;it was indicated in the way the amendment was moved&#151;that the noble Lord considers that the two bodies share a common regulatory outlook and approach in addition to having similar functions. They do not.
</p>

<a name="60321-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Parliament, through the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and the Enterprise Act 2002, has deliberately and clearly made the OFT and FSA very different organisations in terms of structural organisation, function and regulatory approach. The FSA has extensive rule-making powers, which are not subject to parliamentary oversight. The only requirement is that FSA must immediately provide the Treasury with a copy of the rules once made.
</p>

<a name="60321-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>That approach is very different from the way in which consumer credit is handled under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and in this Bill. Detailed rules relating to consumer credit are made by secondary legislation, which, as the noble Lord knows, is subject to parliamentary scrutiny. All that the OFT can do is provide guidance about the manner in which it will administer its functions under the Act. In that sense, OFT guidance defines the ability of the OFT to act in certain circumstances. Where we believe that the OFT&#039;s powers could impose burdens on business, such as in setting fees and penalties, the OFT is required to gain the approval of both DTI and Treasury <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_147"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 147</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Ministers, who are answerable to Parliament for their decisions, before publication, which again is not necessary in the case of the FSA. The OFT&#039;s functions under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, both as it is now and as extended by the Bill, generally relate to the licensing of businesses as being fit to engage in a licensable activity under the Act.
</p>

<a name="60321-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>There are, however, various other pieces of legislation&#151;the main ones are the Enterprise Act 2002, the Competition Act 1998 and the Consumer Credit Act 1974&#151;through which the OFT enforces both consumer and competition legislation as well as undertaking various market initiatives. The OFT&#039;s task is to pull all its roles, which are set out in that legislation, into a coherent whole, and its published goal is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;to make markets work well for consumers. Markets work well when there is vigorous competition . . . When markets work well, good businesses flourish&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>The FSA&#039;s regulatory objectives go well beyond licensing and embrace the conduct of regulated businesses in accordance with certain principles defined by the FSA after proper consultation. Moreover, Parliament has determined that this broader role should be qualified by reference to certain general objectives in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. I therefore do not believe that the FSA&#039;s regulatory objectives, with specific reference to consumer credit, provide a precedent for the OFT&#039;s activities under this Act, and I hope that this summary of the difference between the two helps to support my resistance to the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60321-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>I shall now discuss the individual elements of the noble Lord&#039;s amendment, the first of which is consumer protection. The whole purpose of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and this Bill is to ensure that the OFT protects consumers. The preamble to the 1974 Act states this, and it is the purpose behind the bulk of the provisions of the Act and the Bill. The licensing system is ultimately there to protect consumers by ensuring that a licensee is fit, both before a licence is granted and throughout the lifetime of the licence. Other new powers in the Bill are also designed as consumer protection measures; my noble friend Lord Borrie made that point with some force. I listened carefully to the noble Lord, but it is still not clear to me what else he thinks the OFT should be doing or would do differently, or what else it should be expected to do if a specific objective on consumer protection were added to the Bill. We have not heard anything about that.
</p>

<a name="60321-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>The second element of the noble Lord&#039;s amendment relates to the maintenance of a competitive market and the promotion of an efficient and innovative consumer credit industry. As I have already said, the OFT&#039;s specific role in consumer credit is primarily limited to licensing, which is a consumer protection measure. We do not believe that the fitness test is broad enough to accommodate considerations of the level of competition in the market or in a market sector, or the promotion of an efficient and innovative industry. Nor do we believe that it would be appropriate in this <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_148"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 148</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

context. Indeed, we believe that it could even be positively harmful in some circumstances. For instance, we would not want to create a situation&#151;one might call it a balance&#151;where the OFT might grant a licence to a less fit person because it might be desirable to have more of a certain type of business in the market. Nor would we want competition issues to be a factor in applying requirements because the Consumer Credit Act 1974 is not the appropriate way in which to deal with such issues.
</p>

<a name="60321-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>As I have already mentioned, the OFT already has powers under the Enterprise Act 2002 and the Competition Act 1998 to deal with anti-competitive behaviour across all sectors. It does not need additional requirements linked specifically to its functions under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. In fact, it is clear that the OFT already considers competition issues in the consumer credit market as part of its wider role. In fairly recent times, the OFT has referred both the store card and the home credit markets to the Competition Commission, as well as considering the sale of payment protection insurance. I still believe that what is already set out in the Bill is more than sufficient a safeguard, given that the OFT is also subject to the usual range of accountability measures&#151;a point which the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, stressed&#151;such as NAO scrutiny and appearances before House Committees.
</p>

<a name="60321-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>OFT decisions can also be subject to judicial review. In previous debates, the noble Lord has suggested that this should be used only as a last resort, and I agree. However, the fact remains that the sanction is there and could be used if necessary.

</p>

<a name="60321-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>To conclude, the amendment is unnecessary and could cause problems because the duties for which it provides are of a general nature. If noble Lords believe such duties are necessary, they may feel that they should be contained in the Enterprise Act, which deals with the OFT as a whole. It is not appropriate, in our view, that such general duties should be included in legislation that deals with only one part of the OFT&#039;s responsibilities. The point on competition is particularly inappropriate because the OFT&#039;s duties under the Consumer Credit Act are primarily to do with licensing, and it should not apply competition criteria to individual licensing decisions. This does not, of course, prevent the OFT applying its powers under the Enterprise Act and Competition Act to the consumer credit market generally.
</p>

<a name="60321-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>I hope this explanation will allow the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

However, I am afraid we are still apart. There is a simple difference of opinion which can be distilled down to the fact that we believe the OFT&#039;s powers are extended by the Bill and that there needs to be a balanced framework within which those powers are exercised, and the Government disagree. In those circumstances, I think it is appropriate to test the opinion of the House.

<br>
No guidance is to be published under the 1974 Act without the approval of the Secretary of State.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_69"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment would require that no guidance was to be published under the 1974 Act without the approval of the Secretary of State. In his letter to me, which is available in the Library, the Minister said that the OFT and the DTI work closely and that the OFT already consults the DTI on all such matters, as a matter of course, even where it is not a legislative requirement. That is very helpful, and if he can confirm that for the record, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment. I beg to move.

<a name="60321-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   My Lords, I should like to make the point that a number of us have been making at every stage of the Bill. The amendment is not in my name, but I well understand the intention of the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley; it reflects the point that we have made consistently about wanting proper parliamentary scrutiny. It is a very simple point. The Government do not agree with it. I do not think this will be pushed to a vote, but I should like my view to go on the record.

<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="60321-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   My Lords, I was going to make a lengthy speech proclaiming the need for the independence of the OFT, without political interference. It is obviously unnecessary for me to say all that now, and I am delighted with what the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, has said.

<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="60321-08_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. This is an important Bill for the welfare of children in our country, which I believe will be welcomed in all parts of the House. It is the first legislation dedicated exclusively to childcare and the early years&#151;bringing services for young children and their families into the mainstream of the modern welfare state. It flows from the Government&#039;s commitment to improving the life chances of all children and their families; to tackling poverty and disadvantage at their cause; and thereby to the promotion of social mobility.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Early education and childcare have the unique potential to help meet all three of these goals&#151;improving the welfare of children, tackling poverty and accelerating social mobility. Significant progress has already been made. Since 1997, we have made free nursery places universally available for three and four year-olds. Virtually all four year-olds and 96 per cent of three year-olds now take up these free nursery places. We have established 700 Sure Start children&#039;s centres, providing integrated childcare, early learning, health and social services in deprived communities. We have also enabled a huge expansion of childcare to take place&#151;600,000 extra places since 1997&#151;and we have transformed support for parents of younger children, through the childcare element of the working tax credit benefiting 337,000 families, and through both a substantial increase in paid maternity leave from 18 to 26 weeks and the first ever paid paternity leave for fathers.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Look at this picture as a whole and we are witnessing the creation of a new and large sector of the welfare state, as important for the future of Britain and the welfare of its people as the education and national health services we have come to take for granted. Seventeen billion pounds has been spent on under-fives since 1997 and there is much more to come. The Bill creates the essential framework for government to complete the creation of the national under-fives services, and by government I mean central government and local government working together in partnership with the private and voluntary sectors.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>I hardly need explain to your Lordships why this new framework is so important. Without high-quality childcare and early childhood services, children from low-income families will lose out twice. First, they are more likely to live in poverty if their parents are not working and earning. Secondly, they will not be benefiting from the pre-school experience which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_153"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 153</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

better-off children gain as a matter of course&#151;meeting other children, broadening their horizons and helping their cognitive development.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>The research is clear that the early years of a child&#039;s life are its most formative. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reported in December last year, from a study of a cohort of children from 1958, that starting education before the compulsory school starting age of five can yield benefits in cognitive tests such as reading and maths at age seven, and this effect remains significant up to the age of 16. The IFS concluded that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;Controlling for a particularly rich set of child, parental, family and neighbourhood characteristics, we find some positive and long-lasting effects from early education&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>The Effective Provision of Pre-school Education project, reporting in 2004, similarly concluded that for those children who attend pre-school for two years, cognitive development at the age of five is four to six months more advanced than for those who have not attended at all. For those who start at the age of two, cognitive development at the age of five can be as much as 10 months more advanced. The EPPE project concluded:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;Pre-school experience, compared to none, enhances&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>all-round development in children, and that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;Disadvantaged children . . . benefit significantly from good quality pre-school experiences, especially&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>where they are with,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;a mixture of children from different social backgrounds&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>The inspection evidence is also positive. In March 2005, 99 per cent of registered settings had received either a &quot;satisfactory&quot; or a &quot;good&quot; rating from Ofsted. Since then, Ofsted has added an additional category of &quot;outstanding&quot; to distinguish and recognise those providers performing especially well. Ofsted reported further last August on good practice in childcare and nursery education and gave a strongly encouraging picture of the breadth of excellent provision across the country.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>We now need to take that progress further, which is what the Bill does. In Part 1, the Bill empowers local authorities to be strategic leaders for under-fives and childcare provision in their localities&#151;commissioning, facilitating and planning provision; and championing the rights and needs of parents and children. Equally important, in Clauses 49 and 50 in Part 3 and Chapter 2 in Part 3, is the new and enhanced regime for regulation and inspection which will, we intend, give the same quality and focus to the early years that we have brought to schools over the past decade through Ofsted.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>In fulfilling their new duties, we expect local authorities to develop early childhood services in partnership with their NHS colleagues in primary care trusts and Jobcentre Plus. Much good work is already under way in these areas. Sure Start local programmes and now children&#039;s centres are providing crucial services that integrate for the first time the support that children under five and their families may need. We have invested heavily in this area and will continue to do so to ensure that by 2010 there is a children&#039;s centre for every community, and 3,500 nationwide. I have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_154"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 154</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

written to noble Lords to elaborate on the arrangements for the rollout of those 3,500 centres, setting out important contexts for this Bill.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>The Bill provides not only a framework for under-five services, but key objectives for these services. Clause 1 requires local authorities to improve the outcomes of all children in their area and to reduce the division between those with the poorest outcomes and the rest. The Government believe, and propose in this Bill, that we should use this unique opportunity of developing under-five services to reduce the inequalities that persist between those from the poorest backgrounds and the mainstream of society. The Bill sets out an expectation that local authorities will encourage all children to reach their full potential and, in particular, concentrate on progressing more rapidly those most disadvantaged. In the words of Clause 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;An English local authority must . . . improve the well-being of young children in their area, and . . . reduce inequalities between young children in their area in relation to . . . physical and mental health and emotional well-being . . . protection from harm and neglect . . . education, training and recreation . . . the contribution made by them to society&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>and,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;social and economic well-being&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Clause 1 encapsulates the philosophy of Sure Start, which we wish to extend. The Government welcome the early findings from the national evaluation of Sure Start last year, including the issues that it highlighted, which gave us the opportunity to reflect on what works and to modify our policies and practice in line with the emerging evidence. We have since issued guidance for children&#039;s centres, which address many of the issues raised in the report, including the need to improve outreach to the most disadvantaged families.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>The provision of sufficient childcare is a key feature of the Bill. If parents are to be able to balance work and family life, they need to have access to affordable and flexible childcare. Clause 6 requires local authorities to secure sufficient childcare for working parents in partnership with private, voluntary and independent sector providers. For most parents, most of the time, childcare requirements are met by informal arrangements&#151;not least by grandparents and other relatives&#151;together with existing patterns of nurseries and childminders.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>This Bill will support parents by enhancing the range of choices available to them, requiring local authorities to plan for childcare to take account of a proper local analysis of what parents use and need in their localities. However, we recognise that there are two groups that may require extra assistance, so we have included two specific references in the Bill in respect of those on low incomes and of disabled children. Clause 6 specifically requires local authorities to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;have regard to the needs of parents in their area for . . . the provision of childcare in respect of which the child care element of working tax credit is payable, and . . . the provision of childcare which is suitable for disabled . . . children&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-08_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>Let me say a word more about disabled children, who are, rightly, of great concern to the House. Disabled children and young people currently face <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_155"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 155</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

multiple barriers that make it more difficult for them to achieve the same outcomes as their peers. Twenty-nine per cent of families with disabled children live in poverty, mainly because their parents are unable to access childcare that meets their often complex and highly demanding needs. By putting the needs of disabled children in the Bill, we are making it clear that local authorities must work with providers, parents and disabled children themselves to develop provision that better meets their needs, and thereby help to reduce poverty in these families.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>To reflect the fact that some disabled young people develop at a different pace to their peers, the Bill extends the duty on local authorities to secure sufficient childcare for disabled children from the age of 14 to the age of 16. Those extra two years reflect the fact that there may be a need for childcare for longer to provide parents with the support they need, and to give disabled children the opportunity to continue to access provision after the school day.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a> I know some of your Lordships wish us to go further still and extend that duty beyond the age of 16. We will debate this issue fully, and, as I have already indicated to the noble Lord, Lord Rix, the Minister for Children and I will be very glad to discuss it with him and any other noble Lords who wish to join us. But there are two issues I should point out at the outset&#151;not only the cost implications, but the fact that the Bill is concerned with childcare. Provision suitable or essential for young adults with additional needs, including disabled young adults, is a priority that is being addressed by other support systems, including the disability living allowance, the independent living fund, direct payments and the new individual budget pilots that build on Mencap&#039;s In Control projects, all of which allow families to purchase the support that best meets their needs. The Government are fully committed to improving the life chances of disabled children, and I will be glad to set out fully the range of initiatives under way when we discuss this issue specifically.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>I want to refer particularly to young looked-after children, who are, rightly, another prime concern of your Lordships. We have come a  long way in raising the profile of looked-after children since the launch of Quality Protects in 1998. The Children Act 2004 placed a new duty on local authorities to promote the educational achievements of looked-after children. That duty applies to all such children regardless of their age. Children&#039;s centres, and the new duty to improve outcomes in this Bill, will make a further significant contribution. Under Clause 3, local authorities will have to ensure that they are proactive in providing for those from the most disadvantaged and vulnerable backgrounds, who will include looked-after children and their carers. Local authorities must also ensure that the information and advice that they provide to parents is accessible to such carers.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>Part 2 empowers and requires local authorities in Wales to secure sufficient childcare and provide information to parents. These provisions broadly follow the English provisions in Part 1. The Welsh <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_156"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 156</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Assembly Government are committed to the same goals as the Department for Education and Skills for England in empowering local authorities and ensuring that parents have a choice and the information necessary to balance their working and family lives.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>As I have mentioned, Part 3 brings together the existing regulatory regimes for childcare and early education in a coherent way in conjunction with Clauses 49 and 50 in Part 3, which provide for inspection of such provision. Part 4 contains important measures on the provision of information and data. To achieve the key objectives of the Bill in improving the outcomes of children, we need to enhance the quality and accuracy of  information about children&#039;s experiences of early-years provision. Clause 99 allows for  the collection of individual child-level information to become standard across all local authorities in England, with equivalent provision for Wales in Clause 101, to improve the accuracy of  the funding allocation  for the free entitlement for three and four year-olds  and support  the delivery  of other services. That data will be particularly important in underpinning the extended right to free universal provision for three and four year-olds enshrined in Clause 7, which we intend to extend from the existing 12 and a half hours a week to 15 hours a week for all parents.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>In the final part of my speech I shall highlight two other key related issues: the new early years foundation stage framework we are introducing for all young children; and the quality of the workforce essential to delivering it. The purpose of the early years foundation stage is to promote the five <i>Every Child Matters</i> outcomes for all children. Clauses 39 to 48 in Part 3 set out requirements for the new early years foundation stage, comprising &quot;learning and development requirements&quot; and &quot;welfare requirements&quot;. Those two elements are equally important. Between them they will set out what providers must do to ensure that children are well cared-for and able to develop appropriately for their age. The Effective Provision of Pre-school Education evidence tells us that integrated education and childcare deliver the best outcomes for children, particularly those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. The EYFS will bring together the existing separate arrangements for care and education and build on the well received foundation stage and the <i>Birth to Three Matters</i> framework.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>The early years foundation stage is intended to ensure quality provision. No matter what provision parents may choose, they need to know that their child will benefit from a good-quality experience. The purpose is not formal teaching or tests, but provision that is play-based and focused around the needs of the individual child.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>Alongside these statutory reforms, we are taking significant steps to improve the quality of the early years workforce, which will be key to the successful delivery of the early years foundation stage. An essential part of the 10-year childcare strategy is the transformation fund. Amounting to &#163;125 million a year between 2006 and 2008, it will improve quality without providers passing the costs on to parents. The <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_157"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 157</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

funding will enable local authorities to increase the number of private, voluntary and independent settings that employ staff qualified to level 3 and level 6. We are aiming to have a cadre of early years professionals, qualified to graduate level, in every full-day setting by 2015.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>I shall say a word about safeguarding. The main changes that we will promote in this area are set out in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, which is now published and will be debated at Second Reading soon. However, Ofsted registration of childcare providers, as set out under this Bill, will also ensure that checks have been carried out on the suitability of those employed in registered settings.
</p>

<a name="60321-08_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>I have set out the philosophy, objectives and main provisions of the Bill. I look forward to the contributions of noble Lords in all parts of the House as we debate it further in Committee. Our aims are simple: to give every child in this country the best possible start in life from the moment of their birth; and to give parents all the assistance that we can in that vital task, consistent with their own parental responsibility. These objectives are critical to the health and well-being of a modern society. I commend the Bill to the House.

<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="60321-09_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for such a clear and wholehearted introduction. No one could disagree with the principle behind this Bill: to give children the very best start in life should be at the heart of any civilized and caring society. Like many organisations, we welcome the broad thrust of the Bill and support it, but we also share a number of their concerns.
</p>

<a name="60321-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>I declare a number of interests. I am a governor and director of a school which has an 84-place private nursery and provides after-school and holiday care. I am also a former director of Bolton Lads & Girls Club, which was a pioneer in after-school clubs. I have recently become a patron of OXPIP, the Oxford Parent-Infant Project, which is a registered charity working with families who are struggling to cope with the emotional demands of their baby and helping them to form secure attachments. That is an area in which I know the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, has considerable interest.
</p>

<a name="60321-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>The outcome we all want to secure with this Bill is to help parents establish and maintain those loving bonds to ensure that children develop in safe and stimulating environments and are bought up in loving homes. Acknowledging that patterns of life have changed out of all recognition and that the pressures on modern families are very different from those which we might all remember is a part of that.
</p>

<a name="60321-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>Today, only one out of 10 workers works a standard nine-to-five, 40-hour week, and the number of women in work has risen steadily from 43 per cent in 1983 to 53 per cent in 2004. A quarter of all families <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_158"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 158</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

are lone-parent families, and of the other three quarters that are couple-households, both parents work in the majority of them.
</p>

<a name="60321-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Families survive&#151;in fact, they thrive&#151;because of a whole host of arrangements that would have been unimaginable 20 or 30 years ago. For that reason, it is more important than ever for us to develop policies that recognise the way people live their lives today and that are flexible and responsive enough to meet their complex needs. That is why we must ensure that government policy is joined up, and works for families as a package across the whole of government. Along with a number of your Lordships I have also been involved in the Work and Families Bill. Here we have just discussed at length work/life balance and the benefits and success of flexible working, where many employers and companies are ahead of legislation in offering working styles that allow parents a chance not only to provide for their families but to spend time with their families.
</p>

<a name="60321-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>When the Childcare Bill was debated in another place my right honourable friend Theresa May expressed surprise that the issues of work and families and childcare were being discussed in two separate Bills and reflected that it would have made more sense to debate them together to ensure joined-up legislation to address the issues that families face. I agree with her. Each of these issues has a significant impact on the other and on the lives of families across Britain. Indeed we must also consider the read-across to the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill which the Minister mentioned and is starting in your Lordships&#039; House next week. As I have said on many occasions in numerous debates, the safety of a child, especially a vulnerable child, is of the utmost importance. However, there is a fine line between protecting our children and stifling normal life and activity. This is an area we will want to discuss at length in the Bill and also in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill.
</p>

<a name="60321-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>In the introduction to the 2004 document <i>Choice for Parents, the best start for children: a ten year strategy for childcare</i>, the Government say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;Parents are the best judges of their family&#039;s needs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>I could not agree more. It is parents who know what is best for their children, not Ministers and not civil servants. It is parents who should be in control of their childcare choices. We have to trust parents to make the right decision, yet I am afraid that, despite the rhetoric, trusting parents is something that this Government sometimes find hard to do.
</p>

<a name="60321-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>Parents do not want to be told what type of childcare they should have. Mothers do not want to be told by government that the best thing to do is to race back to work as soon as their baby is born. Nor do they want to be told to stay at home indefinitely producing more and more children. They want to decide. Our role as politicians is to support the choices they make. As everyone&#039;s aspirations are different, those choices will vary dramatically from family to family. Childcare should be as varied as the families it serves, and because of the different needs and decisions of families a &quot;one size fits all&quot; policy will not work. Yet that is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_159"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 159</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

what we are in danger of seeing from this Government&#151;a desire to force children into the form of childcare that Government think is preferable, rather than widening the choices available to parents.

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>The Government say they want local authorities to work with existing providers, and yet the facts are that for every two childcare places that the Government have opened since 1997 another has closed somewhere else. Rather than complement and add to existing childcare provision, state-funded Sure Start is all too often forcing independent providers to close their doors, unable to compete with well-funded schemes.
</p>

<a name="60321-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>We are supportive of Sure Start and applaud much of what it has achieved, but Sure Start does not suit the needs of all parents. Government provision is leading to the closure of private and voluntary-sector childcare services that offer smaller groups and more flexible care. In January 2004, a survey of private and voluntary-sector nurseries showed an occupancy level of 85 per cent, which has now fallen to 75 per cent. In order to be viable, childcare organisations need an occupancy rate of at least 80 per cent. In case anyone thinks I am special pleading on behalf of the nursery I am involved with, I should say that our nursery is full and there is a waiting list for every place.
</p>

<a name="60321-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>One of the areas where the private and voluntary sector is particularly struggling is after-school clubs. The introduction of extended schools has had a particular impact here, and yet when my noble friend Lady Shephard of Northwold first introduced after-school clubs, as well as providing much-needed childcare, she was also keen to promote small and social enterprise.
</p>

<a name="60321-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>I recognise that Sure Start has helped to provide children&#039;s centres in some of our most deprived areas, but it currently focuses only on the most deprived fifth of wards. Yet, government figures show that 46 per cent of the most deprived children do not live in those wards. Too many parents who could benefit from Sure Start or a similar project are denied it&#151;often because, by not working with the private sector, Government are not making the best use of resources. The voluntary sector and private companies should be helped to increase the variety and quality of choice available. I hope Ministers will realise that only by working with them, rather than by competing against them, can we ensure that the government resources put into childcare deliver value for money.
</p>

<a name="60321-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>This Bill seeks to reduce inequalities between children, which raises some fundamental questions. During its passage through another place there were long, spirited and principled debates about what exactly reducing inequalities means and what that entails. How will that be measured and by what means will it be delivered? We on the Conservative Benches are in no doubt that the best way of helping our most disadvantaged, vulnerable children is to raise the standard for all children. I really look forward to the debates that we shall have on that issue in further stages of the Bill.

</p>

<a name="60321-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>Since all the research shows it, there can be no doubt that good early attachment is the best possible start in life that a child can be given. We were very pleased, then, to welcome extended maternity leave in the Work and Families Bill. We also support the choice that many families make&#151;most families, indeed&#151;in using informal childcare through grandparents, other members of the family or friends. Yet we also recognise that there are undoubted benefits to formal early years care, the most important being the building of confidence and social skills. Those are particularly significant for the most vulnerable families and children. The chance to release the pressures of bringing up children who are going through the terrible twos could be a lifeline for many such families. Therefore, what assessment have the Government made of the needs of children whose parents are not working?
</p>

<a name="60321-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>I know that in his speech the noble Lord, Lord Rix, will raise, with his usual passion and conviction, the crucial issue of childcare for families of children with mental and physical disabilities. I recently visited Hurdles, a charity in the north-west that supports such families. I simply cannot explain to your Lordships what a humbling experience it was. I met parents of children with a whole range of disabilities; truly, amazing people. The chairman, Geraldine Greene, said to me, &quot;Trish, in an imperfect world we&#039;re not looking for perfect solutions, simply the support and help to do the best we can for our broken children&quot;. We share the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Rix, regarding the cut-off point for childcare being at 16 for children with disabilities and will want to look at that in more detail in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60321-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>I want to raise two further points. First, we remain concerned about the Government&#039;s intentions for a foundation stage from 0 to 3 years, where Ofsted inspectors will check that children are developing according to the government programme. It is vital that all Ofsted inspectors in that area are not only properly trained in early years development but understand their surroundings. We discussed this at length in passing the Education Act 2005, but my fears were recently confirmed by the story of a nursery where the inspector noted that the children did not seem to be making use of the materials put out for them. The nursery owners pointed out that this may have had something to do with a pin-stripe suited gentleman&#151;a stranger&#151;sitting and observing the children at the end of the table where they were expected to play.
</p>

<a name="60321-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>However, our main concern in this area is about the word &quot;taught&quot;. So far, Ministers have failed to convince us that that will not mean ever younger children being forced into academic activities&#151;and, as a result, missing out on natural development through play and taking risks. Deborah Lawson, the section committee chairman for PANN, the Professional Association of Nursery Nurses, has warned that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;It is important to find the right balance and not have unrealistic expectations of what young children can achieve . . . Prescriptive formal education can be too much . . . for children under five&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60321-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>Margaret Morrissey of the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations said on BBC News last November that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;We are now in danger of taking away children&#039;s childhood when they leave the maternity ward. From the minute you are born and your parents go back to work, as the Government have encouraged them to do, you are going to be ruled by the Department for Education&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>Finally, with many of us currently receiving our council tax demands and looking forward to local elections in May, it would be remiss of me not to raise the genuine concerns of local authorities across the country. The Bill places a new duty on them to secure, and I quote from the Explanatory Notes,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;as far as is reasonably practicable, sufficient childcare to meet the requirements of parents . . . who require childcare in order to work or to undertake training&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>Surely Ministers do not believe that we can expect local authorities to take on these new obligations without that having an impact on their budgets. The Local Government Association estimates that meeting the requirements in the Bill will require additional investment of &#163;200 million in the next two years, over and above existing resources. It would be unacceptable to expect council tax payers across the country to foot the bill for this key government policy. I hope that the Minister will explain how these obligations on local councils are to be paid for.
</p>

<a name="60321-09_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>My party is happy to work constructively with the Government to improve the Bill. We recognise that for many families the decision about whether to go out to work is not one of choice, but necessity. For many families, childcare is the most important issue. If their childcare does not work, their lives simply do not work.

<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="60321-10_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   My Lords, I, too, welcome the Bill as a step in the right direction for young children and their parents, especially in its aim of reducing inequality, and I thank the Minister for his clear explanation of its contents. So let me get straight into the nitty-gritty of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>We on these Benches come at this issue, not from the point of view of working parents, but from the perspective of the child and its welfare. I accept that parents living in poverty is not a good thing for any child; so the objective of reducing economic inequality is welcomed. However, we need to strike a balance between measures that appear to encourage mothers to return to work when their children are very small and the real need to provide enough high-quality childcare where and when it is needed. The emphasis on working parents worries me, too. I want parents to have a real choice, not a situation that is forced upon them by financial expediency; and here I refer to some of the debates we have been having on the Work and Families Bill in the Moses Room about the levels of maternity benefit.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>If a mother chooses to return to work as soon as she can after the birth of her child, we need to support her choice for the sake of her child with the best quality affordable childcare we can manage. If she chooses to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_162"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 162</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

stay at home and look after her child herself, we need to support that choice, too, with the best possible financial benefits we can manage plus high-quality, occasional childcare to help the child develop its social skills and also support and know-how in parenting for all parents. That is the ideal world as far as I am concerned.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>So, how does the Bill measure up in relation to that ideal, given that maternity benefit is well beyond its scope? It is moving in the right direction, but I have some serious concerns about how it will operate. First of all, good childcare does not and should not come cheap; and this Bill is meant to be revenue-neutral. There is no additional money above that which the Government have already announced for the sector. I pay tribute to what the Government have done up to now for the early years sector&#151;as was listed by the Minister. They are well-meaning and well-advised to do so, given the findings of the EPPE study, to which the Minister referred, about the benefits to a child&#039;s development of good quality early years education. There are also long-term benefits in early identification of problems so that the right sort of intervention can be arranged.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>However, the Government seem to think that the integration of services will itself generate enough savings to fund all the new duties that the Bill is putting on local authorities. I do not believe that this can be done and, given that the money for early years is not ring-fenced, I wonder how the Government intend to ensure that local authorities are adequately resourced to carry out all these new tasks to a high standard. Only last week I had a meeting with a range of professionals working in the field and they do not believe that it can be done.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>My second main concern is how the new arrangements will contribute to the provision of high quality and not just Ofsted&#039;s minimum standards. I hope that, although some later years providers will not have to register compulsorily, we will develop a culture in which they will actually want to register, as a mark of the quality of the care they provide. I am a little concerned that the whole area of registration and having two registers, with some people on both of them, will prove confusing&#151;both for parents and providers alike. Perhaps the Minister could give us an idea of the level of fees which providers will have to pay in order to register.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>I am concerned about the part of the Bill which allows the Secretary of State to exempt certain providers from the need to register; for example, cr&#232;ches which take children for less than two hours. Although it is often said that children are not there for long and the parents are usually nearby, I believe that some children are put in these cr&#232;ches regularly, and the parents are not always easily accessible. How will the Government ensure their quality if they are not required to register? We need absolute clarity about the circumstances under which the Secretary of State will authorise exemptions, especially since there will be no parliamentary scrutiny of it.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_163"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 163</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60321-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>In relation to quality, there is an enormous task to do regarding the standards and qualifications of the early years workforce. Buildings and equipment, including an outdoor play area, are important. But it is the people that matter more than anything else. According to the Explanatory Notes, the local authorities are being given a duty regularly to assess demand for and availability of local childcare provision and to support local childcare providers with information, advice and training. How can they do this without adequate funding? The transformation fund provides only &#163;500 per worker for two years. This is not enough to secure the training needed when we are starting from such a low base. This is an area of notoriously low pay, which encourages a high turnover of staff. This is not good for the children in their care. If we are to up-skill the workforce, they will want to be paid more for their qualifications and we will have to face this while still making childcare affordable.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>If childcare is to be affordable for the parents we cannot expect private providers to pay for all the necessary training themselves, since they will only pass on the cost to parents, especially if their occupancy rate is below 80 per cent. Neither must we just think about nurseries and playgroups. Childminders in England, like those in Wales, should have to undergo at least a pre-registration training course so that we can be sure they have reached a minimum standard, particularly in the area of child safeguarding. We need to ensure that all those caring for children undertake an approved course on child safeguarding, but where will the money come from?
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>Inspection regimes are important levers to improve quality and early years is no exception. However, it is vital that the standards against which inspection is done are sufficiently high and that the inspectors themselves have the right training, qualifications and experience to understand what they are seeing. I thoroughly agree with what the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said on that point. We do not want situations such as the one she described and like the one I heard about recently, where an inspector criticised a nursery setting for not using worksheets for the children.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>I welcome the new clauses added to the Bill in another place to make regulations disqualifying from registration people who have been banned from working in schools on grounds of ill-health such as alcohol or drug misuse and also those who have been convicted or cautioned of a prescribed offence. Can the Minister tell us a bit more about what is included in these prescribed offences? However, while I generally welcome these measures, I have a concern about what they will mean for very young offenders. A &quot;caution&quot; is defined in the Bill as including a reprimand or warning under Section 65 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which applies to children between the ages of 10 and 17. Does that mean that if a child of that age commits a prescribed offence and gets a warning, he or she will never be able to work with young children or vulnerable adults when they grow up? If so, we need to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_164"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 164</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

think again about this. Something done by a child before his moral personality is fully formed should not prescribe his future career in that way.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>One of the Bill&#039;s main and laudable aims is to reduce inequalities among children so that they all have the best possible start in life, no matter what their parents do. This raises issues, in particular, about children with disabilities, ethnic minorities and other groups, about whom I will say more later. The Bill puts a duty on local authorities to ensure that enough childcare is provided in their area, but it also gives them a duty to reduce inequalities. So is it just about numbers or is it about quality and the appropriateness of childcare for individual children?
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said and as other noble Lords will undoubtedly know, there is a lot of concern among the lobby groups that represent disabled children about whether the Bill will make the difference that is needed. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that disabled children are special and need special help so that they can develop to the maximum possible extent and be socially integrated.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>We all know that there is not enough care of the right quality for disabled children. Eighty-four per cent of their mothers are not in paid work as against 39 per cent of mothers of fully able children of the same age. Caring for young children with disabilities requires special training, and we have heard, in particular, from TreeHouse, the National Autistic Society and Mencap, among others, about the needs of the children they represent. I will be either tabling or supporting amendments to ensure that these children are properly catered for. The words &quot;appropriate assistance&quot; for such families have a very particular meaning and we must take account of that.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>There are also issues relating to the inequalities suffered by ethnic minority groups, such as travelling people, black and Asian people, refugees, asylum seekers and those without English as their mother tongue. Although assessment and monitoring already takes place under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, and soon there will be monitoring in relation to disability and gender, we need to be certain that not just future but existing provision is monitored to ensure that there is no discrimination. This needs to be done by people who really understand the issues. Not least is the need to be sensitive and to make provision for the cultural heritage of children in early years settings. Children will never be truly comfortable if no one understands their background and culture. This is a matter to which local authorities will have to pay attention.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>We also need to make certain that through outreach local authorities ensure that all services are accessible to all communities that need them. That will be a challenging task for the extended Children Information Services. I hope that it will also tell parents about the range of financial assistance available to them to help with the high cost of childcare, particularly here in the capital. Much more than just childcare tax credit is available out there and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_165"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 165</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

people need to know about it. I give credit to the Government for the help that has been made available, but, as usual, it is not enough.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>As noble Lords will have heard from what I have just said, the duty to improve outcomes for all children will be a complex process. It is not a matter for which it is appropriate to set national targets. However, it is perfectly appropriate to monitor the performance of local authorities, and if additional measures are needed to do that, so be it. However, I am a bit doubtful about whether anything more is necessary beyond Ofsted, the Commission for Social Care Inspection, the new joint area reviews and the race, disability and gender monitoring, to which I have already referred. Perhaps the Minister will consider that point.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I now turn to the subject of the child, who has been at the centre of all I have said. We are aiming to improve the situation for each child in relation to the five outcomes of the <i>Every Child Matters</i> agenda, but it is hard to see how the Bill addresses &quot;children making a positive contribution&quot;. Children are notably absent from the list of those that local authorities should consult under Clauses 3(4) and 11(6). The Minister has told me that that is because it is all about planning and co-ordination, where facilities should be placed and how the various agencies should work together. But it is hard for me to agree that a Bill that makes such far-reaching provision for children should not include somewhere the need to consult them, especially when the clauses to which I have referred contain the magic words &quot;all reasonable steps&quot;. I shall be looking for an appropriate way to correct that as the Bill progresses through your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>The other big issue relating to the nature of children themselves is the Early Years Foundation Stage, introduced in Clauses 39 to 48. That framework, which brings together earlier frameworks, is generally to be welcomed and has been so by most professionals, despite the best endeavours of the tabloid newspapers which have referred erroneously to a curriculum for babies. I am sure that the Government intend no such thing. However, although I would disagree with the terminology of the tabloids, I also disagree with the terminology of the Bill. Tone of voice is important if one is to communicate what one really wants to happen. Young children learn by being supported to play and to explore the world around them, making sense of it and expressing their understanding and feelings about it.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>Article 31 of the UN convention is particularly relevant, as it provides that children have the right to rest and leisure and to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to their age. Therefore, those principles need to be better reflected in the wording of the Bill; for example, a child should learn through play rather than being taught, as in Clause 41(2)(b), and should be assessed by observation rather than being tested, as in Clause 41(2)(c). I shall be tabling amendments containing what I and most professionals in the area believe to be more appropriate wording.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_166"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 166</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60321-10_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>I have mentioned exemptions before and here is another place where they give me cause for concern. Clause 46(2) allows providers to exempt particular children, presumably disabled children, from the EYFS framework. I believe that that may infringe their rights under Articles 23 and 29 of the convention. We should be ambitious for all children, while accepting that some of them will not be able to do some things as well as others, but that should not prevent them from being included in the ambitions that we have for all children.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>Next, I echo the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, on sustainability of nursery places and how local authorities will work with all providers in their areas to provide a healthy mixed economy of provision. I was horrified to learn that between 1990 and 2003, 626,000 new places were created of which almost half were lost by becoming unviable and closing down. What a lot of wasted expertise. We must ensure that the development of children&#039;s centres, the rollout of Sure Start and the creation of more extended schools do not result in reduced choice for parents because private and voluntary sector providers close down. Local authorities need to adopt best practice, which I know exists in places, and to work in partnership with their local providers to ensure that there is not a proliferation of new places where others of the appropriate type and quality already exist.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>The word &quot;appropriate&quot; is very important. It appears in Clause 8(3)(b) in relation to whether local authorities can provide maintained-sector childcare in their areas. They cannot do so if someone else is willing to provide it, unless it is &quot;appropriate&quot; for the local authority to do so. As the Bill progresses, I shall explore what the Government mean by that word, what standards will apply and what safeguards will be in place.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>The fact that schools that provide childcare are exempt from certain parts of the Bill is a matter that we shall want to explore. What is to prevent the new independent, but state-funded trust schools or academies acting independently of a local authority&#039;s planning system and providing childcare, completely upsetting the balance of the local mixed economy? What is to stop them providing it at any price? It could possibly become a loss leader to encourage parents to send their children to the school. What would that do to the equilibrium of the local market and all the hard work done by the local authority? The ability of the local authority to plan provision sensibly should not be fettered. It is particularly important in rural areas such as parts of Wales&#151;which is also covered by some clauses of the Bill&#151;where distances to travel to suitable provision can be very great.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>Finally, there are questions to be asked about the child&#039;s right to privacy and how that relates to the data collection measures in the Bill. The measures are very wide-ranging and I wonder whether any of this will duplicate Section 12 of the Children Act 2004; for example Section 12(4)(b): the information about the child&#039;s education. The Government say that these data are needed for two reasons: first, to allow funding to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_167"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 167</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

follow the child and, secondly, to allow local authorities to prove they are carrying out their new duties.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>The child&#039;s right to privacy must be properly balanced by the Government&#039;s perfectly proper right to have appropriate information by which to monitor the effects of policy and I am concerned to get that balance right. As things stand, Clauses 99 to 101 seem to me like a sledgehammer to crack a nut, despite the ban on publishing names. Who will be prescribed to collect and share the data; and what data will be permitted to be collected? I expect all this, like so much in the Bill, will be prescribed in regulations, a matter about which my honourable friend Annette Brooke complained bitterly in another place. However, perhaps the Minister can enlighten us, since we cannot properly scrutinise the Bill unless we have this information.
</p>

<a name="60321-10_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>I close by promising the Minister that we on these Benches look forward to scrutinising the Bill with great care and vigour, extracting a lot more information from him over the coming weeks and, I hope, sending it back to another place considerably improved in the interests of all our children and their families.

<a name="60321-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rix: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest as president of the Royal Mencap Society. I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate, in which I want to highlight one issue in particular; namely, the care provided for disabled young people over 16 and their families. I am delighted that the Minister has indicated his willingness to discuss the matter fully some time after Second Reading. I was also delighted to hear the support voiced by the noble Baronesses, Lady Morris of Bolton and Lady Walmsley.
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>All parents should be able to access the childcare they need in order to work and provide for their families. That is the governing principle of the Bill and I am sure it is welcomed on all sides of this House. I am sure also that we welcome the fact that the Bill recognises and accommodates the need of some parents to access childcare for longer than others. While most children will be sufficiently independent by their early teens to look after themselves outside school hours and to manage without formal childcare, most disabled children will not. That, I am sure, is the logic of the distinction the Bill makes between disabled and non-disabled children.
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>As your Lordships will be aware, the Bill gives local authorities a duty to secure sufficient childcare for non-disabled children up to the age of 14, and for disabled children up to the age of 16. The principle is therefore made clear: disabled children need childcare for longer than non-disabled children. But the question arises: why 16? In other legislation designed to help parents to work, the parents of disabled children are supported up to the age of 18. The Employment Relations Act 1999 gives parents of disabled children up to the age of 18 the right to up <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_168"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 168</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to 18 weeks&#039; parental leave, to be used flexibly throughout the child&#039;s life whenever it is most needed, from birth to 18 years. And the Employment Act 2002 gives parents of disabled children up to the age of 18 the right to request flexible working hours to meet their care needs. Why 18? Because families with disabled children still need that support up to the age of 18. Why have a different age limit in the Childcare Bill?
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>Consistency in legislation is generally sensible, but it is not only for the sake of consistency that the Childcare Bill should secure care for the families of disabled children up to the age of 18 rather than 16. Disabled young people aged 17 and 18 are too old to access most childcare and too young to access adult services which are in any case not set up to meet the needs of working families. They fall into what we might call the &quot;care gap&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>We know that that care gap exists for disabled children as young as 12, but the problem gets more acute as they get older. The Sure Start survey in 2003 found that there were major gaps in childcare provision for the families of disabled children aged 14 and older. Many of them were directed towards leisure centre activities that were wholly inadequate for their needs, being insufficiently staffed to cope with disabled children and with sessions which did not fit in with the timetables of working parents. According to Contact a Family&#039;s 2002 survey, <i>Everybody Here</i>, 70 per cent of disabled children aged 12 to 19 cannot attend a club because the facilities are not suitable for them.
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>The care gap makes life difficult for the families of older disabled children in general, but the parents of young people with profound and multiple disabilities have the greatest difficulty finding any kind of childcare. Only in exceptional cases are they able to work when their children get older. They cannot use the informal out-of-school services used by non-disabled young people of their age because the staffing is insufficient. Most childminders will not take them on. Where are they supposed to go, or, to put it another way, where are their parents supposed to go?
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>In many cases, their parents admit defeat. They give up their paid jobs, and devote themselves to caring for their children full-time. We know that 84 per cent of mothers of disabled children are out of work, compared to 39 per cent of mothers of non-disabled children. We know that 55 per cent of families with disabled children are living in or at the margins of poverty and, indeed, that if the Government had only paid more attention to their needs, they might not have missed their target for cutting child poverty. Providing such families with childcare will help, but why stop that help when the child reaches 16?
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>Take the case of a mother known to Mencap in Wakefield, whose 17 year-old son has a learning disability. She used to work, but had to give up when her son left school. He attends a day centre until 3 pm every day, but there is no wraparound care available from 3 pm to 6 pm, or during the holidays, to allow her to continue to work. She would like to work again, but <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_169"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 169</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

it is impossible for her to do so without the support of a reliable childcare service. So she loses the ability to provide for her family, she loses the ability to do a job she enjoys and for which she is valued, and the country loses her contribution as a worker and&#151;the Government should take note&#151;as a taxpayer. Her work as a full-time carer is invaluable, but it is unpaid work that she does through necessity. Yes, she does it through love, but not through choice.
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>So why not raise the age limit for local authorities to secure sufficient childcare for disabled children from 16 to 18? In a debate in another place the Minister, Beverley Hughes, said that 17 and 18 year-olds might not want to be regarded as needing childcare. Well, maybe not, but for many disabled young people, the service they need at 17 is exactly the same as the service they needed at 14 and 15 and 16. In any case, very few people who provide childcare services, or who use childcare services, call it childcare. Take Dwaine, a 17 year-old young man with a severe learning disability who is fortunate enough to be cared for by a childminder after school five days a week, supported by the local Mencap-run childminding network, while his mother works for Bromley Council. Dwaine never calls it childcare. He refers to his childminder as &quot;my mate&quot;. But he can call her whatever he likes: the point is that his mother is able to work, and he has somewhere safe and worthwhile to go while she does so. It would be a great shame if, for want of a name, the opportunity was lost for more families like Dwaine&#039;s to get the care they need. The Bill presents a perfect opportunity to provide that care and to close the care gap that opens up when a disabled child reaches 16. It presents a perfect opportunity to help families to work and to help families with disabled children to get out of poverty. It presents a perfect opportunity to harmonise childcare legislation with other laws that provide support to working families with disabled children. All in all, it presents an opportunity not to be missed, and I hope the Minister will agree that the Bill should cover disabled children up to the age of 18. I shall certainly move an amendment to that effect at a later stage, unless the Minister and the Government decide to pre-empt me. Given the Minister&#039;s opening speech, I am sure they will give my heartfelt pleas every sympathetic consideration.

<a name="60321-11_spnew1"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Chelmsford: </b>   My Lords, I, too, declare an interest in that, as a bishop, I oversee rather a lot of services for children, families and schools in the diocese. Sitting on these Benches, one is not always excited by the legislation that we get involved in, but I must tell the Minister that I am really quite excited by the possibilities presented by the Bill. It seems that, in this Bill, Parliament is doing what it is best fitted to do&#151;namely, to improve the lives of a large number of people who need our support and help.
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>Parents have always sought help and support in the nurture and development of their children. One only has to think of schools, nannies, nurseries, grandparents, childminders, babysitters, voluntary <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_170"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 170</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

societies, parents and toddlers&#039; groups, uniformed organisations and so on&#151;the list is enormous. Spreading out from these networks is a responsibility on the whole of our society to ensure the best support that we can achieve for parents in the care of their children. As the chairman of Christian Aid, I know all too well how disastrous it is for children when the structures of support and nurture collapse through poverty, oppression and disease. One only has to visit other parts of our world to see how important such structures are.
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>I was especially pleased to find that the Bill places on local authorities a duty to reduce inequalities in this field. Let us not be deceived into thinking, however, that passing this Bill will achieve greater equality of opportunity and experience. Travel with me across the diocese of Chelmsford. Day one is spent in Thurrock, which I visited around the previous general election, passing through a community without a single sign of a general election taking place or of any interest in it. You wonder how parents of children in some of the poorest, most deprived and forgotten communities in our country survive. On day two, I am on the M11 corridor, where the houses get bigger every week and where you visit schools, churches and communities and find flourishing children with plenty surrounding them and plenty of support. On day three, I am in the borough of Newham, which is reputed to be one of the most multicultural boroughs in Europe; it certainly has one of the lowest age ranges in Europe. It has Sikhs, Buddhists, Muslims, Jewish people, Christians of all shapes and sizes, and people of no faith from hundreds of different cultural backgrounds. That is the diversity that we are dealing with, so equality, as the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, quite rightly said, should be central to any debate on the Bill. I would add to that by stressing the importance of improving everyone&#039;s opportunity and by saying that the Bill must focus provision on the poorest and most vulnerable.
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>Secondly, I want to comment on the process of working in partnerships, to which the Bill seems strongly committed. Words on paper need to lead to commitments to action. In Essex we are becoming used to public language. For example, we now talk about &quot;sustainable communities&quot; as Essex goes through one of the largest developments in our country at this time. I can tell your Lordships that those on the housing estates that are going up will want to know what the Government meant by that phrase as frequently only housing is built. So when we talk about &quot;partnerships&quot;, what is the content? How will it work? I have been a bishop for more than 11 years and every time governments and local authorities talk about working in partnership I get excited about it, wake up and ask what will happen&#151;and often it is not a great deal. Do we not need some structures to enable these partnerships to take place?
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Churches of all sizes and shapes are present in every local community. I have visited Sure Start projects in church buildings, Home-Start projects and a whole variety of services to children and parents. Churches represent volunteers, many of whom are sustaining <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_171"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 171</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

these projects, and Churches also represent an understanding and experience of their local communities, along with their partners in the other faith communities, which we need to draw into this framework. So I hope that we will have some kind of commissioning framework which will make this possible.
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>I wish to suggest three themes. First, parents and parenting, which are pivotal to a child&#039;s development. We all know that children suffer through poor parenting and that poverty and disadvantage undermine that task even more so. What do the Government propose to do, following this Bill, to ensure that households that most need support receive it in this field? I was pleased to see the provisions with regard to disability and I am sure that we shall debate the kind of issues brought before us today by the noble Lord, Lord Rix. It is good to see such provisions in the Bill, which will give us an opportunity to see how far we can go.
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>Secondly, I support the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, in regard to development. I have chosen the word &quot;development&quot;&#151;not &quot;education&quot;&#151;because the comments that have been made about play, nurture and whole development need to be understood in this context. I am delighted that we will be registering people and services and to see the word &quot;training&quot; in the Bill. What will be the content? What standards have we in mind; what expectations? How are we going to fill the word out so that we can offer to parents a real guarantee of excellence in these services?
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>My third theme relates to social skills or socialisation. One of the things that can be achieved through the provision of childcare services is the development of children&#039;s social skills, including enabling children to relate across the diversity of our social life today, with children from different cultural and religious backgrounds and children with different life and social experiences. These are important ways in which at an early stage we can make provision.
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>My final question is a practical one which has already been raised: who is going to pay for all of this? I hope that Her Majesty&#039;s Government do not think that we can achieve what the Bill is all about without investment and fresh resources for agencies and people who are committed to improving the life of children in our communities.
</p>

<a name="60321-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>These are important matters. If, as many of us believe, children are close to the heart of God, they should be close to the task of government and of this House. I often think that we spend time on legislation to little effect. Today we have the opportunity to begin something useful, morally defensible and of help to our society. I hope the Bill receives a fair wind.

<a name="60321-12_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Howarth of Breckland </b>  : My Lords, as the Minister said in his introduction, parents face difficult choices in our competitive society. Whether you are a single mother or father, struggling to care for your child <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_172"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 172</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and remain independent, or a two-parent working family trying to give your children a good start, or another type of carer, how do you give your child that good start? Most parents and carers want the best for their children. When they hand them over to the care of others, they want to be sure that they have chosen well. But how much choice do they really have? The question of choice is one we should dwell on.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>Day nurseries or day centres are often parents&#039; most popular choice of childcare, providing as they do care and learning for hundreds of thousands of children under five. How easy is it, if you are poor or vulnerable, or find it difficult to make contact, to actually achieve a place? I speak from personal experience of working with young women who often simply cannot get into the system because of their very serious difficulties. I know there are still those who would have parents&#151;usually mothers&#151;stay at home, but the world has moved on. The social benefits of work and the economics of family life mean that most people must look elsewhere to ensure much of the daily care of their young children. This is why I welcome the aspiration of the Bill, even if I have concerns about its implementation and spread.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>There are significant questions to be asked of a Bill with such vision, set out so eloquently and with such enthusiasm by the Minister. It reflects the Government&#039;s concern to provide accessible, affordable and flexible childcare, as outlined in the 10-year strategy. It seeks to ensure that from 2008 local authorities will be required to secure &quot;sufficient&quot;&#151;whatever that means&#151;childcare places within their area by facilitating and managing the provision. There is no doubt that for many this has been an aspiration for decades. What has prevented these ambitions being realised are the same factors that will dog the Government&#039;s attempt to reach their goal, unless addressed at an early stage.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>Perhaps I may put some questions to the Minister. Under the financial cost heading the Explanatory Notes state:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;The proposed duties on local authorities in England will be financed within the resources which have already been made available to them for childcare and early childhood services&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>They continue:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;The Bill will have comparatively little effect on public services manpower&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>What do those statements mean? As an aside, given that childcare staff are mainly women, would it not be more progressive to refer in documentation to &quot;the workforce&quot;? I thought &quot;manpower&quot; went out of the window long ago. There is little doubt that meeting the requirements of the Bill in the spirit in which it is written will need both highly trained, valued and well-paid workers, and considerable resources. I simply emphasise what others have already said.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>The third key to success is management of the programme. I worked in local government for many years. I have great admiration for all that local authorities achieve, but I have some concerns about the way some are taking this issue forward. In developing the childcare market, the Government <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_173"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 173</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

appear to have an enthusiasm for a mixed economy, building on the sound foundation created by private, voluntary and independent nurseries. In Clause 8(3) the Bill specifies that the local authority may not provide childcare unless it is satisfied that there is no other person willing to do so. Research by the National Day Nurseries Association reveals a mixed picture of the ways local authorities are already expanding their own daycare services. There is a real question as to whether provision has increased or simply that ideology and the label of &quot;provider&quot; have changed. I will not repeat the figures already given by the noble Baronesses.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>I understand that the current plan is to roll out some 3,500 new family centres across the country in three waves. Will these be new provision, or will they simply replace existing places? I have been long enough in the service to remember that when the original Sure Start programme was put in place, many well run, much loved local family centres lost their funding and closed. And what happened to playgroups when schools started having under-fives provision?
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>A recent Written Answer about the opening and closing of places shows a huge turnover. Apart from the loss of value for money through poor sustainability, high turnover means a lack of consistent care and of development of workers, which cannot be in the best interests of our children. I understand that the National Audit Office will publish a report in the autumn looking at some of the issues. Will the Minister expand on how the Government see local authorities developing their role, not principally as direct providers, but as commissioners and overseers of the programme? Will the Audit Commission report provide a clear evidential base which will be used by the Government to ensure the proper development of an integrated and well managed mixed service?
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>I turn to my concerns about commissioning. This has been a real problem for much of the private, voluntary and independent sectors across the whole of childcare provision. The Bill could provide an opportunity to improve commissioning practice. Of course there are model commissioners, but much of the sector experiences unequal treatment when tendering for contracts. The Minister for children has introduced a commissioning framework in other childcare services, and although the Bill sets a general framework, the National Day Nurseries Association believes that draft guidance is needed urgently, as a good few local authorities have not followed existing recommended practice.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>Legislation might also allow for penalties on local authorities neglecting partnership opportunities in the interests of increasing provision rather than replacing one set of places with another. What PVI providers require is a level playing field which is transparent and frees up time from interminable contract meetings and complex bureaucratic procedures, which get nowhere and simply put money in the pockets of lawyers. In addition, many local authorities do not allow other providers at the tendering table when they are tendering. This seems extraordinarily unequal.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_174"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 174</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60321-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>On the topic of a level playing field, why is provision in local schools outside the local framework outlined in Clause 8? If the local authority is seen as the strategic leader and commissioner of childcare rather than the provider, why is it excluded from making a judgment about childcare provided in schools? That simply increases the inequalities between local providers. My particular concern, with which the Minister is all too familiar, is that this again sets schools apart from the main thrust of local planning&#151;education knows best again and is set apart. This will not allay the fears of all of us who believe that the education takeover will lose the focus on the whole child, despite the assurances in the Bill, and on safeguarding, leaving only its learning.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>The Local Government Association has similar fears. To that is added the concern that setting targets centrally will not improve outcomes or a holistic approach to outcomes. Will the Minister concede that there is a real danger of targets hampering the delivery of child-centred, personalised services? Is it really appropriate to measure whether a four year-old is making &quot;a positive contribution&quot;? Can we not let children be children for just a few short years? That does not mean that we should not consult them. I have considerable experience of working with very small children and finding out what they think, but you do not do it by measuring what kind of contribution they are making.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>Time does not permit me to raise the issues of the speed of change, the importance of a well trained, remunerated and valued workforce and the plans that one has for them, or how this all fits into the <i>Every Child Matters</i> agenda. No doubt we will return to these issues during the passage of the Bill. But to quote Naomi Eisenstadt talking about the whole children&#039;s programme:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;Creating the conditions for improvement and change across this huge agenda depends on the stability of its parts, it is not rocket science, it is far more difficult than that&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>I would simply add that the Bill is a significant and important part and we have a duty to ensure that it is stable and the best that it can be for the future of our children.

<a name="60321-12_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   My Lords, I like to think of the Government&#039;s Childcare Bill as one of two twin Work and Families Bills, both of which, along with many of your Lordships, I largely support. Both Bills are part of the Government&#039;s welcome, ambitious and farsighted 10-year strategy, as set out in the 2004 report, <i>Choice for parents, the best start for children</i>. The Government deserve congratulations and they certainly get mine.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>The Bill will undoubtedly be a big help to families by giving parents access to the childcare services that they need and allowing them to balance more easily the demands of both their careers and families. As others have said, the Bill&#039;s provisions rightly target for extra help those working families with multiple needs and those with disabled children. That list, over time, needs extending, as there are many vulnerable children in non-working households. But there are some real <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_175"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 175</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

concerns about what is proposed, not least, as we have already heard, about the role of local authorities and how they will exercise their proposed new duties to secure rather than provide themselves sufficient childcare for their areas.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>Your Lordships will have noted the considerable anxiety throughout the voluntary and private childcare sector about its future within this structure. There is good reason for that. We owe a tremendous vote of thanks to the voluntary and private sector for its determined, sustained and, in the end, widespread pioneering efforts, from the end of World War II onwards in providing an increasingly flexible range of childcare. For that reason, we should pay particular attention to its concerns about the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>After World War II, the UK government, decided to close what had, up to then, been almost universal childcare provision, made available so that mothers could play their full role in munitions factories and elsewhere in support of the war effort. But in contrast with what happened after World War I, women were no longer content just to return to their domestic roles. The push for equal opportunities in employment and in pay had begun in earnest and with it an inevitably growing demand for reliable childcare places.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>For a mother such as myself, involved in the late 1950s in the playgroup that our own children attended and as the author of a pamphlet on this subject entitled <i>Under Five</i>, the inadequacy of provision was all too clear. So too was the lack of financial support from most local authorities for those attempting to start voluntary groups. The great pioneering champion was the Pre-school Playgroups Association with the amazing network of grass-root playgroups that it built up nationwide. By involving and training mothers in running those playgroups, those mothers gained the confidence that was invaluable to them and their children later in their lives.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>The vigorous campaigning of the PPA and others eventually worked. The Department of Education and Science Circular 8/60, which had prevented local authorities opening any new nursery facilities of their own, was finally withdrawn. The name of the Secretary of State for Education and Science who deserves full credit for that action was none other than Margaret Thatcher. It is certainly time that the less than flattering one-liner that remains attached to her tenure at the DES is replaced with the recognition of that considerable achievement.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>What already exists in childcare is one example of the blueprint that this Government are determined to bring to areas where those most in need of the services have repeatedly been let down. In education, the National Health Service and indeed in the management of offenders, the rescue plan is roughly the same: to bring in extra financial help and expertise from the private and voluntary sector and let competition, privatisation or contestability&#151;depending on your political interpretation of those words&#151;have its way. There are certainly problems with this radical solution, but with childcare, where <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 176</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

private and voluntary initiatives&#151;PVIs&#151;have been and remain major players, there is a real opportunity for the Government to demonstrate the kind of partnership that works. Certainly we should be encouraged by the Bill&#039;s apparent enthusiasm for the mixed economy and for partnership between local authorities and private and voluntary providers. Clearly, it makes, as other noble Lords have said, no sense whatever for the state to reproduce what is already working well in the private and voluntary sector. However, the fears that have been expressed by leading childcare charities, such as the National Day Nurseries Association, the Pre-School Learning Alliance, and others, and which I certainly share, are that the legislation as drafted may not be anything like robust enough in a number of areas to guarantee the survival of, and future prospects for, this vibrant mixed economy in childcare.

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>An example quoted is that of children&#039;s centres. There is clearly merit in the notion of integrating children and family services through Sure Start centres, but it is worrying that a proportion of local authorities seem to do nothing to involve existing daycare providers in developing children&#039;s centres. The experience of day nurseries offers an insight into some of the problems. In some cases, these centres are emerging either adjacent or very close to an established day nursery, but they are not involving that day nursery in the children&#039;s centre being set up. This is particularly worrying since Ofsted had rated 99 per cent of day nurseries as either good or satisfactory. As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, and other noble Lords have said, in some instances day nursery occupancy levels have dropped below a sustainable level. If this situation persists, we shall not only lose that investment in quality childcare providers, but parents will no longer enjoy that wide range of choice that is so important.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>One must hope that the Bill will curb this trend, but how can we be sure that by then the level of duplication will not have forced many private and voluntary providers to pack up shop? That would certainly not help to enhance the volume and diversity of childcare. I acknowledge that the Minister&#039;s department has published guidance advising local authorities on how to team up with the private and voluntary sector but, so far as I am aware, these recommendations are not mandatory. How many local authorities are listening and should not far more be doing so?
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>I have taken rather a lot of time over the concerns of PVIs because of the very special history of childcare development in the UK. I really hope that the Government will be prepared to think of far more convincing ways to reassure that sector that it will be an equal and valued partner in this vital area.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>The quality of what is being provided and the right balance to be achieved in the early years foundation stage have been mentioned, and I very much support what has been said. There will clearly be many opportunities to look at these in detail in Committee. But I want to touch briefly on other concerns. The Bill places special emphasis on assisting parents in work or training who are eligible for the working tax credit&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_177"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 177</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as well as parents of disabled children. Both of those things are good, but we must not forget those other families on low income who are not eligible for the WTC. Only 337,000 families benefit from the childcare element in the WTC. Families that are eligible for working tax credit are not necessarily the poorest families. The Bill does not take into account parents who do not work at all because they cannot afford both to work and to pay for childcare. So those families will still be stuck in a cycle of deprivation, something which we must address. Perhaps the Minister will give this point some attention when he replies.
</p>

<a name="60321-12_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>Last but not least, as other noble Lords have stressed, there is the question of funding for the considerable role local authorities are being asked to play. This is a good Bill, which I warmly welcome, but I hope the Minister can reassure the House that local authorities really will be provided with the necessary funds to achieve the objectives that we all share.

<a name="60321-13_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Listowel:</b>  My Lords, it is a great privilege to follow my noble friend Lady Howe. I second what she says, and what other Peers have said about the opening and closures of provision and how this will impact on the parents, the staff and particularly on the children. It is clear in the research that having a number of different placements for a child tends to be disruptive for them, so it is also detrimental from their point of view. I also strongly support what my noble friend Lady Howarth said about the need for expertise in local authorities and careful commissioning, and how one will ensure adequate expertise at a senior level in local authorities so that those making decisions about childcare recognise that good quality childcare may be costly, but is a necessity. I would be grateful for some response from the Minister to that question.
</p>

<a name="60321-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>My noble friend Lord Northbourne is sadly unable to attend this Second Reading. He has two longstanding prior commitments this afternoon. As your Lordships will be aware, there was somewhat shorter notice for this Second Reading than is customary. I will mention a concern of his that he would like to bring up in Committee with regard to kinship care. This Bill could do much to enhance the quality and availability of professional childcare, but does little to support the largest and most popular source of childcare in the country, which is kinship care&#151;that is to say, care by grandparents or other members of the child&#039;s family. Kinship carers also need support. Any significant reduction in the current level of kinship care would place an impossible strain on the human resources likely to be available to provide quality professional care.
</p>

<a name="60321-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>Kinship care is the first choice of most parents and part of the culture and tradition of many of our ethnic minority populations. There is a strong case for doing more to encourage and support kinship carers, especially those who are prepared to undertake any training that may be necessary to support their practical experience and to ensure the quality of the care they give. I know the Minister referred to kinship <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_178"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 178</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

care in his opening remarks, and other Peers have referred to it as well. I also thank the Minister for the clarity of his presentation of the Bill. I note in particular what he said about the education of young looked-after children, and I look forward to hearing more on that in later stages of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60321-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>I applaud the Government&#039;s intention to reduce the number of children living in poverty, provide them with opportunities to associate with other children and benefit from that association early on prior to school, and enable more parents to enter work. I thank the Minister for the letter he kindly wrote to me recently about the issue in the Work and Families Bill on maternal leave. I warmly welcome the important step forward the Government are taking in increasing paid maternal leave to nine months, and then, at some time to come, to 12 months. That is a step in the right direction of permitting parents choice.
</p>

<a name="60321-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>I recognise the benefit of this Bill to the status of those who provide childcare. This is the first piece of legislation in their area, and we all recognise the low status they often feel they have. It should enable more parents to enjoy the satisfaction if they choose to work, and the sense of well-being they experience needs to be considered in the light of the isolation they can feel at home bringing up a young child.
</p>

<a name="60321-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>I cannot wholeheartedly welcome this Bill, however, particularly the crux of it&#151;the duty of local authorities to provide sufficient access for parents to childcare. This will inevitably increase the supply of childcare. I am sure that your Lordships are aware that capacity in this area is of a low level. The good-quality childcare which the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, emphasised, and which is essential for providing the outcomes that are described in the EPPE research to which the Minister referred, is not widely available. If we press on the accelerator now, might that not depress still further the quality of childcare currently provided? That is very much my concern.
</p>

<a name="60321-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a> Perhaps the Minister will say that improvements in inspection will help to allay my concern, but I understand that inspections take place about once every three years&#151;perhaps I might check that with him&#151;and that they last for perhaps for a morning. They may be brief and not so helpful an indicator; nor will they assist the setting to improve. The quality assurance programmes may be better. They take more time to interview the staff and observe practice, and take a portfolio from the staff of the work that goes on in the setting. However, the one programme of which I am aware takes place only once every three years. That a review of a new portfolio is sent through once every year is welcome, but that is still not enough. That does not give me the confidence that a sufficient lever exists to improve quality.
</p>

<a name="60321-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a> The Government are hoping to introduce a great many more teachers or pedagogues&#151;people with high professional qualifications&#151;into these settings. I can see considerable benefit in that policy, and it is already working in some settings. However, I recall the report of the noble Lord, Lord Warner, <i>Choosing with Care</i>, from 1992. It looked at the selection of staff in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_179"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 179</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

children&#039;s homes and strongly recommended that consultants should work with those staff to push up the quality. I heard about three years ago that that recommendation largely failed to take because the poorly paid and trained staff in children&#039;s homes would often feel some resentment at an outsider coming in and telling them what to do.
</p>

<a name="60321-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>I know from my own experience that this can be an issue. I recall working in a hostel some time ago and saying to one of the members of staff that a table in the dining room which had been wobbling for three months&#151;there were only two tables there&#151;really needed to be replaced. She replaced the table promptly, but we did not speak after that. Working in a hostel is a difficult job in a difficult environment. A few weeks later, the manager said that two of her staff had gone home in tears because of the pressure and the environment. One has to be modest about what one thinks one can achieve in terms of improving quality. People who do not have training and education behind them, are poorly paid and have low status are not very amenable to being told how to improve their practice. It is a good deal more difficult to do than one might imagine.
</p>

<a name="60321-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a> Why is quality of care lacking? First, there is a chronic shortage of supervisors for this work. Secondly, as I have said, the pay is poor. Thirdly, the transformation fund, while welcome, is but a small sum given the challenge. Rates of staff turnover are in the region of 30 to 40 per cent&#151;perhaps the Minister will provide me with a more accurate figure in his response. All the time, new and unqualified staff are coming into settings, which is disastrous for the relationships between staff and children. The providers of care to whom I have spoken recognise the staff problem. Academics emphasise that it will be several years before we can rely on good quality in this area.
</p>

<a name="60321-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a> I have observed practice in nursery settings; for example, in a nursery in a difficult area of north London. The Government are seeking to benefit the most disadvantaged children. I applaud their desire to do this and to take them out of poverty, but if the provision in these settings is of a poor quality, the children who will be most harmed are those who are most vulnerable. I was observing a group of three or four year-olds with one childcare assistant in the nursery concerned. Three boys were playing at putting a steel ball into a tower and letting it fall. One of them kept on stealing the turn of the others. The child care assistant was not intervening and looking very much overwhelmed. Another member of staff told me that the mother of one of the children in the nursery was a heroin addict. The staff member said that something more should be done for the child, but that the mother was clever enough not to reach the extreme point where the child would be removed from her. It is such difficult work and it is so poorly supported.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 180</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60321-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a> I welcome so much of what the Government have done in the <i>Birth to Three Matters</i> guidance, which, as other Peers have said, is very welcome. A recent edition of <i>Nursery World</i> refers to it emphasising the following:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;&#039;A relationship with a key person at home and in the setting is essential to young children&#039;s well-being&#039; and &#039;Caring adults count more than resources and equipment&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>That is absolutely right. I welcome that. The article continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;Young children never show that they feel &#039;too attached&#039;; I hear this worrying phrase sometimes from practitioners or team leaders. Many babies and under-threes now spend many hours in out-of-home care. For their emotional health, they must be allowed to become close to their non-family carers. If very young children are blocked from developing a bond of affection, then they will remain ill at ease and fail to benefit from the play experiences and resources on offer, however well organised&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, for her reference to my interest in this area. I cannot emphasise enough how crucial it is that the sound emotional bond between carer and child is established at an early stage. All the things that we want to see later on stem from that sound start.
</p>

<a name="60321-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>I do not wish to take too much of your Lordships&#039; time. I am sorry to be so slow this afternoon. Why is it so important that social workers are well trained and well supervised? It is important to support them in this difficult work but it is also crucial that, when people intervene in families&#039; lives and have so much power to do harm and to do good, they have the capacity to do so. It is extremely alluring for those who are involved with families to go beyond their power and to do more harm than good. The noble Lord, Lord Hurd, is present. I give the example of a statesman in a first-world country looking at the developing world. He must think carefully about his true capacity before he becomes involved in a chaotic, developing-world country and about the consequences of imprudent interventions.
</p>

<a name="60321-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>I respect the ambitions of the Government and remember the low point from which we started. When Margaret Hodge was the Children&#039;s Minister, she emphasised that we were 20 years behind our neighbours in this area. If consistent exposure to poor quality of childcare&#151;even if it makes a child&#039;s experience less good than it was previously&#151;spread through 100,000 children, it could make a significant difference. I ask the Minister to pause for thought. If he can provide any information that might reassure me, or any information on the progress of the Children&#039;s Workforce Development Council, that would be welcome. Perhaps some of its early recommendations could be added to the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60321-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The success of every child in this country is more vital now than it has ever been, with the current birth rate and an ageing population. I absolutely laud the Government&#039;s intentions. However, I beg your Lordships to take full account of the workforce issues. I leave those thoughts with the Minister. I also apologise for speaking at such length.

<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="60321-14_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Massey of Darwen: </b>   My Lords, this is a welcome Bill which complements the 10-year strategy for childcare, the Children Act and other strategies put forward for children. It again reflects the Government&#039;s emphasis on the welfare of children. The duties on local authorities also extend the existing children&#039;s information service as outlined in the schools White Paper <i>Higher Standards, Better Schools for All</i>.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>The All-Party Group on Children&#151;I declare an interest as its chair&#151;has held two meetings on the Bill, one with the Minister with responsibility for children, Beverley Hughes, at which many noble Lords present today were also present. I shall put forward some of the issues raised by those meetings. I am grateful to numerous groups that have sent briefings on the Bill, including the Early Years Forum, Mencap, the LGA, the Pre-school Learning Alliance, the National Day Nurseries Association, Working Families and the Tree House. My comments, like some of the comments of other noble Lords, will touch on many of the issues that they have raised. However, I shall draw in particular on the child impact assessment on the Bill carried out by the National Children&#039;s Bureau and the Children&#039;s Rights Alliance, funded by the Nuffield Foundation. I want also to raise an issue of my own, which is how grandparents and their status fit into all of that.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>In the All-Party Group on Children meeting with Beverley Hughes, she emphasised that the Bill would be the legislative basis for the childcare strategy and <i>Every Child Matters</i> programme. As the Minister has said today, it will be part of the drive to transform the life chances of those who are disadvantaged. Research shows time and again that lack of material, emotional and intellectual support and stimulus for children in the early years can lead to serious disadvantage and lack of aspiration in later years. It is therefore vitally important to strive to get early years provision right. That is what we are trying to do.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>In that meeting with the Minister for Children, some of the issues raised were about provision for disabled children, sustainability and affordability for parents, workforce training, childcare for working parents, the implications of the early years foundation stage and the relationship between the private and voluntary sectors. Many of those issues have already been raised by other noble Lords. I shall therefore turn to the concerns expressed in the child impact assessment. I should say first that the process of child impact assessment involves the analysis of proposed legislation to determine its likely effect on children and young people. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child underlines its considerations. I shall address four issues which are brought up by the child impact assessment on this Bill: involving the child, working and non-working parents, registration disqualification, and the early years foundation stage.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>The first is the contribution of children to society, one of the outcomes of <i>Every Child Matters</i> which has already been referred to by the noble Baroness, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_182"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 182</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lady Walmsley. In the Bill at the moment, children are absent from the list of those to be consulted by local authorities under Clause 3, on how the co-ordination of services in a particular area happens. Under Clause 11, local authorities have a duty to undertake a &quot;childcare assessment&quot; of the sufficiency of childcare in their local area and must consult with groups of persons prescribed. Again, that does not include the voice of the child.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>I turn next to working parents. Clause 6 places a duty on local authorities to secure sufficient childcare for working parents. This clause may be detrimental to children in households where parents choose to stay at home. Children benefit from interaction with other children, and parents may also benefit from a break from caring. Others have addressed the issue on disability, the noble Lord, Lord Rix, in particular. Suffice it to say on disability that the child impact assessment to which I referred earlier considers that the rights of disabled children may be infringed under certain articles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>I have a query about registration and disqualification of those caring for children. The Secretary of State may provide exemptions from the requirement to register for early years childminders, early years providers, later years childminders for children under eight and other later years providers for children under eight. Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child says that states parties must ensure that the institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care and protection of children shall conform with the standards established by competent authorities, particularly in the area of safety, health, and the number and suitability of staff, as well as competent supervision. Cr&#232;ches are already exempt from registration under the Bill. I feel there is a loophole here in that the Secretary of State&#039;s powers to exempt certain groups of childcarers could endanger the children involved.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>I turn now to my question on grandparents, a matter on which the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, touched. Where exactly do grandparents fit into childcare? Some grandparents, with great hardship, are caring for their grandchildren single-handed&#151;for example, if their own child is using drugs or in prison or dead. That is not informal care; it is a job. These grandparents have a very indistinct profile and little financial help although they save the state a great deal of money. What is their status?
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>I move now to the early years foundation stage, again referred to by others. Clauses 39 to 48 bring together the current <i>Birth to Three Matters</i> framework, the curriculum guidance for the foundation stage and the national day care and childminding standards for under-eights. Article 29 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that the aim of education is to develop the child&#039;s personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential. I welcome that emphasis. A child who has been brought up in a stimulating environment has enormous advantages in later years. Structure is essential for this, in whatever <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_183"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 183</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

setting. It has been known for children to be left sitting or lying down with no stimulus or left to run around in a chaotic fashion. Children need a variety of learning through play such as art, books, water play, clay and physical challenge. Those activities should be offered to children as part of all good early years provision, and children learn thereby about choice. I am avoiding the word &quot;taught&quot;, as I think the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, would, as it may encourage the idea of too much formality too soon. Children should be offered a choice of structured play from which they learn, and information is needed on this provision. I am aware that this was discussed on Report in another place but I am still unclear about the detail of what and how.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>The Early Childhood Forum welcomes the Bill as the first piece of government legislation to focus solely on very young children and on childcare. Its concerns are reflected in some of my previous comments and in the comments of others, but in particular the forum points out that a continuous quality improvement mechanism should be provided. Workforce development, the introduction of the early years foundation stage and new regulations and inspections must be supported by such a continuous quality improvement mechanism, and developments should be linked together to achieve high-quality services for children. How will that be guaranteed?
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>All of this Bill interests me. I have had time to focus on only a few areas that I think can be further refined. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response and to our deliberation on the Bill in this House.

</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="60321-14_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, we now begin the process of winding up this debate, which has been an interesting and good one. Its spirit was captured by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, when she said that we welcome the aspirations of this Bill; to make accessible, affordable and flexible childcare available for every child and parent who wants it.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>This is one of two related Bills currently before your Lordships&#039; House. The Work and Families Bill is concerned with making it easier for parents to take time off from work and spend it with their families. Meanwhile, this Bill is primarily concerned with providing that accessible, affordable and flexible childcare in terms of both its educative quality and, in a substantial underlying theme, enabling parents to go back to work. It is part of the child poverty campaign because those who can go back to work tend to have better incomes. It also provides respite care&#151;not least, for the disabled. We shall pick up on that later.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>The Government&#039;s proposals, under their<i> Choice for Parents, The Best Start for Children: A ten year strategy, </i>are ambitious indeed. The Minister referred to some of them in opening this debate, but it is worth pondering on this; for the 2.9 million children under five in this country, we currently have 600 Sure Start centres. The aim is that by 2008, or in two years, we shall have 2,500 and that by 2010 we shall have 3,500. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_184"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 184</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

In addition, the Government are committed to providing free pre-school education for three to four year-olds&#151;or the early years foundation stage, if you prefer, for three to five year-olds&#151;on a part-time basis. That is currently for 12 and a half hours for the 38 weeks of school terms; but next year, in 2007, that is to increase to 15 hours a week, with the long-term aim of being able to provide 20 hours a week for three to five year-olds whose parents want to participate in it.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>It is thus an extremely ambitious strategy with which many of us concur, while having some reservations about it. Those reservations have come very much to the fore during this debate. Above all, perhaps, there is that reservation which the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, picked up: that we are trying to run before we can walk, and perhaps concentrating too much on quantity and not enough on quality.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>We started from a very low base among European countries in 1997. Then, we had possibly the lowest provision of childcare and are now trying to reach the Scandinavian levels&#151;a splendid ambition, yet there are, as I say, reservations. First and foremost, in what has emerged from this debate regards resources. It is really rather extraordinary to note in the Bill the provisions on what local authorities are required to provide, and yet to read in its Explanatory Notes that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;The proposed duties on local authorities in England will be financed within the resources which have already been made available to them for childcare and early childhood services&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>We know that the Sure Start budget is due to grow to &#163;1.7 billion by 2008, when we are to have 2,500 such centres. That is a considerable amount of money, although perhaps not just for Sure Start. The Explanatory Notes suggest that by 2007&#150;08 there will be funding of something like &#163;1.7 billion for Sure Start and similar educational programmes. We should however bear in mind those 2.9 million children; &#163;1.7 billion is only slightly over &#163;500 per child, so it has to go a long way.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>One key issue here is clearly that of staffing and staff training. My noble friend Lady Walmsley noted the transformation fund and the funding allocated to it for training staff. Currently, many have a level 1 nursery nurse qualification; they need to move upwards to something well above that. We still have a long way to go to reach the Danish requirement of being a graduate to be involved in childcare. Here, we are looking at rather less than &#163;500 per person for training over the next three years. So, it is an ambitious programme and I do not know that we will be able to fulfil it with those resources. Perhaps the Minister can give us some reassurances on that issue.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>Second among the issues that have come up in our discussion is the question: who benefits? Clause 6 puts the duty firmly on the local authority,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;to secure sufficient childcare for working parents&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>That picks up on the Government&#039;s commitment and priority of ensuring that childcare is available to parents so that if they wish to work they can. Yet there has been, throughout our debate, a feeling that it needs to be available to those parents who are not working <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_185"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 185</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for one reason or another. We have talked at considerable length about those parents with children who have disabilities&#151;84 per cent of whom are at home because the burden of childcare is so huge.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>There are parents who choose to stay at home to look after their children. We all have sympathy with that, knowing that the bonding between mother and child is extremely important, particularly in early years. In addition, we should recognise that the poorest parents are often those who are not in work but on benefit. Given that the Government have also put on local authorities the duty to &quot;reduce inequalities&quot;&#151;it is bang in front of us, in Clause 1&#151;it seems slightly strange that we have to provide a sufficiency of childcare facilities for working parents yet, if we are to reduce the inequalities, it is often the parents who are not in work who need that help. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford raised that point. What we really need to see, in assessing childcare needs, is that local authorities must take account not just of parents who are working or studying but also those who are not in work.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>A third issue that pervaded our discussions was that of quality as well as quantity. Within the Bill, quality assurance comes in Part 3 via regulation, registration and inspection. The clear message is: quality is important. Yet there is considerable variation in quality. That, again, was brought up by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, who talked of variations between the quality of different local authorities&#039; provision and how some adhered to current regulations on recommended practice, yet some did not adhere at all. The noble Baroness said how necessary it was to have a commissioning framework, so that we can lay down the standards required of local authorities. Here again the problem comes back to the quality of the workforce. There seems to be a gap in linkage between the workforce strategy and the 10-year strategy. I do not understand why the Government have withdrawn from the Investors in Children programme, for example. It is vital that continuous professional workforce development is written into the programme, not one-off training. There is an enormous backlog that needs to be thought about and addressed.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>The fourth issue that has cropped up, mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, is the voice of the child. The Bill puts emphasis on the five outcomes within the context of the Children Act. I remember that during our debates on that Act we talked at considerable length about those outcomes being the result of a lengthy survey of what children wanted. Yet, in developing this strategy, the voice of the child seems strangely absent. In Clause 3, for example, a duty is placed on the local authority to secure an integrated strategy and to involve in its development,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;parents and prospective parents . . . early years providers . . . and . . . other persons engaged in activities which may improve the well-being of children in their area&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-14_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>But there is no mention of the children themselves.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>Again, in Clause 11, local authorities are to undertake,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;assessments of the sufficiency of the provision of childcare&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_186"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 186</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60321-14_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>Clause 11(6) states that local authorities must,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;consult such persons . . . as may be prescribed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-14_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>But local authorities must take account of the views and experiences of young children. One of the features of the Children Act, in relation to that survey, was that it showed that even young children of 3, 4 and 5 years old had views that were worth taking into account. They may express them in different ways, but they had voices which should be heard. That is even more important in this provision for extended schooling for 5 to 8 year-olds. Please let the voice of the child be recognised in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>The fifth issue that many noble Lords have mentioned is in the final part of the Bill regarding learning and development. Most people welcome the integration of provision for the 0 to 5 year-olds and the foundation stage at school. It makes a lot of sense to look at the development of that learning process. But how much should they be taught? There is an awful phrase in Clause 41(2)(b), which refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;the matters, skills and processes which are required to be taught to young children&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-14_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>They learn through play, and we shall be bringing forward amendments to that, which will have much support in the House.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>My noble friend Lady Walmsley and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, mentioned the need for inspectors in this sector to be aware of what is required. Both of the stories that we heard about inspectors in the foundation stages did not reflect well on those inspectors. It is vital that such people recognise the need to ask: what are the ambitions at those stages and what do we want to do?
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Finally, there is the question of regulations. This Bill, like so many that we consider these days, leaves much to regulations that shall be laid down by the Government&#151;not least in relation to the final clauses, Clauses 99 to 101, which were added to the Bill only on Report in the other place. They require local authorities to provide detailed information about the range of provision in their areas. But because the regulations have not been published, it is unclear precisely what data will be required, who will collect it, who will store it and who will use it. Can the Minister say whether we are likely to see any of those regulations before we complete our consideration of the Bill? How far will the regulations regarding information relate to last night&#039;s debate on the information sharing index? Every child will have a unique number and be listed under that by its name, age, sex, parents, address and so on. There will be much overlap in the information that will have to be collected.
</p>

<a name="60321-14_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>In conclusion, there is much in the Bill and in the Government&#039;s ambitions that we on these Benches support. The issues that have been raised in this debate are to some extent niggles, but reflect bigger issues of principle and we shall debate them. On the whole, we share the Government&#039;s view on the need for comprehensive and integrated provision and, in some sense, we congratulate them on the degree to which they have begun to roll out such provision. But there <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_187"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 187</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

are caveats. Quality is important; listening to children and young people is important. Whereas the Bill sums up the term &quot;nanny state&quot;, it is also important that its provisions are not too &quot;top down&quot; and are a little more &quot;bottom up&quot;.

<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="60321-15_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Seccombe: </b>   My Lords, as I expected of a debate on this subject, it has been erudite, passionate and well-informed. I, too, thank the Minister for his clear and heartfelt introduction. As my noble friend Lady Morris has already explained, we broadly welcome and support the aims of the Bill, which has been described as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;the most important early years development in recent years&quot; .</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>We on these Benches recognise the important role that childcare plays in Britain&#039;s future, as indeed do all your Lordships who have taken the time to speak today. We have continually supported the principle set out in the Green Paper <i>Every Child Matters</i>, reiterated in the 10-year children&#039;s strategy, that we want to give,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;every child the best start in life&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>Indeed it is with that aim in mind that we have concerns following the Bill&#039;s progress in another place.
</p>

<a name="60321-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>We have witnessed increasing costs of childcare in this country with concern. A recent Daycare Trust survey stated that the cost of a typical full-time nursery place has outstripped inflation by nearly 20 per cent in the past 5 years. This makes our nursery care among the most costly in Europe. Earlier this month the Government disappointingly missed their first target to end child poverty by some 300,000 children. At the same time, the predicament of the modern family is often particularly difficult, as was highlighted by my noble friend in her speech. Many of the details have already been raised in discussions on the Children and Adoption Bill and the Work and Families Bill.
</p>

<a name="60321-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>Sure Start, which has made a difference for many parents in focusing on 20 per cent of the most deprived wards, has a problem, as the Government&#039;s own figures show; but as my noble friend pointed out, 46 per cent of the most deprived children do not live in those wards. It is no surprise, although disappointing, that eight out of 10 parents say they are under strain&#151;although I have to say that when my children were small I could have said the same. It is clear that while the will is there, there is still much to be done in the complex situation surrounding the nurture and well-being of children and their families today.
</p>

<a name="60321-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>It is vital that we provide more people with the chance and choice to access affordable quality childcare. Childcare plays just as important a role for families where parents are non-working as well as for those who are&#151;particularly where disability is an issue. It enables young children to meet other children, make friends, and so socially to develop&#151;as well as providing parents with the much-needed breathing that is essential for their own well-being, and often providing much-needed finance for the family coffers.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_188"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 188</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60321-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>Happy parents help to produce happy children, and we should not forget that stability and continuity of care are most important for both parents and children&#151;as the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, pointed out. We are concerned that in some areas new government funded places could adversely affect private providers. We want to see a mixed economy in childcare where the Government proposals work with the private and voluntary sector, not against it. Childcare needs to be sustainable and flexible.
</p>

<a name="60321-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>As my noble friend Lady Morris has already said, quality needs to be central to the Bill, and we must improve the results for those who need and deserve our support. In the other place, the Government set great store by phrases about reducing inequalities. That is why providers of childcare must be well trained, using a universal accredited system. As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and other noble Lords have said, it is clear that your Lordships share the Early Childhood Forums&#039; concerns surrounding the quality, suitability and reliability of care for vulnerable children&#039;s groups such as travellers, refugees, asylum seekers, looked-after children and the disabled.
</p>

<a name="60321-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rix, highlighted the challenges, as well as the joys, that caring for a disabled child can bring. Families of disabled children are often among the poorest and face the greatest costs&#151;on average three times as much as raising a non-disabled child. We will be looking at these issues in detail in Committee, including the age range to which childcare is provided for children with mental disabilities, an issue of concern to Mencap.
</p>

<a name="60321-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>My noble friend Lady Morris and the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, both stressed that one of the most important parts of the Bill concerns that little word &quot;taught&quot;. We broadly welcome the early years foundation stage. However, as many of your Lordships have pointed out, young children learn so much more when they are supported in playing and exploring the world around them&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said. Indeed, each child&#039;s development is different and can depend on the degree of bonding and affection that they have in the first years of life. This is a principle that we will discuss in detail in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60321-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>I am sure the Minister is aware of the concerns that the Government&#039;s approach could lead to what has been termed &quot;schoolification&quot;. It is clear that the success of this Bill will rely enormously on how local authorities embrace, interpret and enact its provisions which, as many of your Lordships have pointed out, bring no additional resources with them; a serious matter that will need to be addressed. There are concerns regarding targets that the local government authorities may have to meet the need for cross-border co-ordination and information on specialised services as well as how the public/private partnerships will work from the outset to create flexible, working childcare services. We will be seeking clarification on the issues of regulation, registration and inspection when we discuss Part 3 of the Bill, especially regarding exemptions.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_189"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 189</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60321-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>The success of the Bill will depend also on the success of action across various government departments and their legislation. I have already mentioned three other Bills that impact on children. The Minister has pointed out that we are due to start deliberations on the safeguarding of vulnerable groups on 28 March, next week. The role this House plays in this respect is one we do well. We on these Benches welcome measures to protect our children, particularly vulnerable children. Although, as my noble friend said, there is a fine balance between protection and stifling normal life. We will wish to look at the details of the new clauses introduced by the Government during the last stage in another place. Much of the detail has been left to regulation and the National Children&#039;s Bureau is among those who have expressed concerns over how the Her Majesty&#039;s Government will measure well-being and equality.
</p>

<a name="60321-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>It is important to place the issues raised within the context of broad support for the aims behind this Bill. But as always the devil is in the detail, and it is our job to ensure that this legislation will work when put into practice and will improve the quality of life for children in those crucial early years; I would like to thank all the organisations which have sent us such excellent briefing.
</p>

<a name="60321-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>We look forward to working with the Minister to improve the Bill, so enabling our children to have the very best possible start in life, a wish obviously very dear to everyone who has spoken.

<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="60321-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, we have had an excellent debate. Indeed, it has never been my lot since becoming a Minister in this House to participate in a debate where the Government have been so warmly supported from all sides. Something must be going wrong and I shall suddenly wake up from the dream and find myself in the middle of the <i>Daily Mail</i>. No doubt in that unfortunate eventuality, the support of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford, whose excitement&#151;the word he used&#151;at the prospect of the Bill may save me from some of the worst consequences.
</p>

<a name="60321-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>I was particularly grateful for the historical perspective of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, who proved the adage that there is no such thing as a new idea in this world. Of course the concept of substantial and near-universal childcare is one that dates back to the Second World War. I am glad to tell your Lordships that it has not taken such a drastic turn of events to produce the extension that took place in the 1940s. There were other, worthwhile features of social organisation, including identity cards, which the Government are also seeking a return to and which, on that same question, may garner more widespread support in your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="60321-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>I have noticed that the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, who I am getting to know well during our debates on matters to do with children, where we share a substantial interest, is good at creating an air of great dissention, when in fact there is agreement on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_190"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 190</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the underlying principles. Although we are largely at one on these issues, she did her best to try and create an air of great dissention by proclaiming the importance of ensuring that nothing in the Bill would force parents to choose particular types of care that were not appropriate to their own circumstances. She said that we should value the role of the voluntary and private sector and mentioned a whole set of similar propositions with which I wholly agree. I should stress to your Lordships that there is nothing in this Bill which will oblige any parent to choose any particular type of childcare that is not appropriate. Indeed we praise&#151;

<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="60321-16_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   My Lords, I hope that the Minister does not mind giving way. Parents can choose only if that provision is available and it cannot be available if it is driven out of the market. That was the point I was making.
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="60321-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is quite right, but the number of childcare places has doubled since 1997 and the vast majority of those places are in the private and voluntary sectors. It is simply not the case that there has been some nationalisation of childcare in the way that has been suggested. We are at one on this; we want to see a thriving market in childcare in which the private and voluntary sectors play a substantial role. They do so and I pay tribute to the role of the Churches and the faith communities in this area too. They all play an important role. We see local authorities as having a duty to secure provision, but the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, was not too enamoured of that. She did not like the idea that the role of local authorities might have too light a touch. These provisions exist precisely to ensure that the private and voluntary sectors are empowered.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>I came under great criticism from&#151;I like to call her my noble friend&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, for proclaiming the importance of schools in this respect. I am unashamed in proclaiming the importance of schools; we undervalue the role that schools can play in our society. It is precisely because we want schools to regard engagement with parents&#151;including the provision of childcare&#151;as an important part of their functions, to see that they better engage with parents, that we have included the provisions in Clause 8(4). These ensure that the provision of childcare,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;by the governing body of a maintained school&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>is not covered by the provisions of the preceding subsection which leave the local authority as a provider where there is not a sufficient market for it.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, who I know is not enamoured of our trust schools, or academies, or independently managed schools, is deeply worried that schools might go too far, and become too enthusiastic in providing childcare for their parents. I think the phrase &quot;loss leading&quot; came into her remarks. I tried to get my mind around this concept of loss leading. To my mind, we should support anything a school does which promotes the active engagement of its parents in something as worthwhile for them as providing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_191"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 191</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

appropriate childcare. I am looking forward to debating this matter in Committee, but at the moment I cannot envisage the circumstances in which the state would be in the business of seeking to ban schools&#151;that is what it would come down to&#151;from providing legitimate childcare. I think that we will be conducting a friendly debate on this issue.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>I shall put my starting proposition on the table: I think it is thoroughly good and worth while for state schools to provide childcare which ensures that the needs of parents are met. Many of the parents who will take most advantage of this are precisely the non-working and poor parents whom we have been talking about. I look forward to discussions about local market distortions in that, although I do not think that such distortions would affect parents. We are talking about childcare that is convenient to parents and which parents wish to use. In my experience as a parent, there is nothing more convenient than childcare being provided at a school which, in all likelihood, is attended by other children in the family. In that way, parents can build their childcare arrangements around the wider education provision that they make for their children.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>I can see that in Committee we shall have huge debates, which I shall not address now, on the word &quot;taught&quot;. I remember once listening to a sermon in which not a bishop but a more lowly cleric said, &quot;When I use the word &#039;man&#039;, I embrace all women&quot;. When we use the word &quot;taught&quot;, we embrace everything that has been described as play, social interaction and child development. I know that long extracts from the<i> Oxford English Dictionary</i> have been read out in another place. I am sure that we will revisit them in your Lordships&#039; House, together with many other interpretations of the word &quot;taught&quot;, but I do not think that we are far apart on this issue. However, I wholeheartedly withdraw the word &quot;manpower&quot;. Before the amendments appear in the Marshalled List, I withdraw that word entirely. I replace it with the word &quot;workforce&quot; with immediate effect so that we do not have to go in that direction.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>I shall seek to meet as many as possible on the specific points raised. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, was concerned that at the moment Sure Start is focused on the most deprived areas. As she rightly said, there are very many poor parents and needy children in areas that do not fall within the most deprived wards in the country. I think that the noble Baroness will accept that we were right to start in those areas, because there were no, or very few, children&#039;s centres before we began the programme of establishing them.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>Until this year, children&#039;s centres have indeed been established where the need has been greatest, with local authorities focusing on children living in wards that are among the most disadvantaged. However, from this year onwards, we will be focusing more on developing children&#039;s centres beyond the less advantaged areas. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, rightly said that the establishment of 3,500 such centres is an ambitious objective&#151;and it is&#151;but, to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_192"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 192</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

give some idea of relative scale, we have 20,000 primary schools in this country. If we are to move anywhere close to the situation that exists in some European countries that have better provision in this area, I believe that in due course we will need to go substantially beyond the figure of 3,500, as we will wish to see children&#039;s centres in every community where there is parental demand for them.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>A moment or two ago, I touched on the subject of market diversity and private and voluntary providers. We see the role of the voluntary and private sectors as being immensely important. The provisions of the Bill underpin that importance. Under Clause 3(4), local authorities are under a duty to encourage the involvement of private and voluntary sector providers of early education and childcare in the planning and delivery of integrated early childhood services aimed at improving outcomes for under-fives. Under the childcare duty in Clause 8(3), to which I referred a moment ago in the context of schools, local authorities can provide childcare themselves only if no other provider is willing to do so. We put in the subsequent provision because we wish to preserve the position of schools.

</p>

<a name="60321-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>The role of the private and voluntary sectors, which includes social enterprise organisations of the kind that the noble Baroness is engaged in, is of great importance. A recent survey shows that 58 per cent of childcare in children&#039;s centres&#151;that is, in the new forms of provision that we have been putting in place&#151;is provided by the private and voluntary sectors. But we agree that we must continue to ensure that there is a diverse mix of provision under the Bill. We are amending the Sure Start grant memorandum so that from April this year there will be a requirement for local authorities to consult, and consider using, the private and voluntary sectors as they develop children&#039;s centres. I hope that that will further underpin our commitment in this area.

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>That ties in directly to the withdrawal of childcare places, about which much was made, but I stress that this is in the context of a doubling in the overall number of childcare places since 1997. In any rapidly expanding and competitive market of the kind that we have seen in childcare, one would expect to see some closures. I am not myself in the state socialist mould of provision that says that we should guarantee all existing provision and not allow the market to operate. There is an important role for the market in responding to parental demand.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>Closure rates have stayed lower than at any time since June 2003. Since March last year, both total closures and the closure rates of childcare places have fallen in each quarter. The closure rate fell from 17 per cent in March last year to 12.8 per cent in December last year&#151;a decrease of one quarter. Comparing December 2004 with December 2005, closure rates fell by more than 3.6 per cent. The total number of closures in the year to December 2005 was 158,343&#151;down from 200,770 in March 2005. So we are seeing a substantial reduction in both the closure rates and the number of closures, and all those figures are from Ofsted.

<a name="60321-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>The growth that we have seen has been predominantly in full daycare provision, where the number of places has increased from 284,000 to 553,000, of which 83 per cent are in the private or voluntary sectors. So the state is not crowding out the private and voluntary sectors; on the contrary, the private and voluntary sectors are the dominant players in the provision of childcare, and that is as we would wish to see it.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, and many other noble Lords asked what assessment would be made of the needs of non-working parents, who have a vital set of needs that we must recognise. I stress that the needs of non-working parents will be assessed in exactly the same way as those of working parents. The local authority will have to take account of the needs of non-working parents in securing sufficient provision for working parents in the area. As the House will know, the Government already provide 12.5 hours a week of free early years provision for all three and four year-olds, irrespective of the employment status of their parents. That will rise to 15 hours a week by 2010, with the aim of it increasing to 20 hours a week in the long term. We are very mindful of the needs of non-working parents as well as those of working parents.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>Virtually every speaker in the debate raised the issue of resources. The noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, said that there would be no additional resources, but that is not the case. Substantial additional resources will be going into the system over the next few years, and the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, gave the figures. We said in the Explanatory Notes that the resources available would be those that had been announced. Alas, there was not, and never is, a pot of gold that we can magic up outside the resources that have already been announced within the Comprehensive Spending Review. But the additional resources that have already been announced are indeed substantial. Between 2004&#150;05 and 2007&#150;08, total expenditure in this area will increase from &#163;958 million to &#163;1.8 billion&#151;a 55 per cent increase&#151;and a total of &#163;4.4 billion will be available in 2007&#150;08, when the funding for the free early education offer is taken into account.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>In addition, there is the extension of the 12.5 hours a week of free provision for three and four year-olds from 33 to 38 weeks across all settings, which takes place from this April. That will cost an extra &#163;82 million, which my department is making available through the dedicated schools grants, so local authorities will be reimbursed for that. In addition to the global total for under-fives and the funding for the additional weeks of free places, there is also the &#163;2 million a day childcare element of the working tax credit which now flows through the system directly to parents. That makes childcare more affordable for the least well-off and, of course, does a great deal to stimulate demand and choice.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>Last year we had already increased tax credit levels and we plan to increase them again this year, so that the maximum proportion of childcare costs that can be claimed back will rise from 70 per cent to 80 per cent, so meeting the concerns of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, about affordable child care. We are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_194"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 194</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

putting a very significant additional resource into the system so that childcare is affordable and so that there is provision at local authority level to develop children&#039;s centres and to make the other childcare placements to which we have referred.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>In addition to all that, under the Bill, where they are providers of childcare themselves, local authorities will also be able to recover costs by charging. We think that is an entirely proper activity, not least so that there are not the distortions of the kind that would occur if local authorities were seeking to subsidise unduly. Some of the income that they generate from that charging will be available through the working tax credit.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>A whole set of issues was raised on registration, largely by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. I shall try to run through as many as I can. She raised the issue of fees for registration and inspection. She is quite right to say that they will increase by about 30 per cent. We are talking about fees for child minders rising to &#163;14 and &#163;18 to register; and fees for daycare providers rising to &#163;150 to register, as against the ongoing cost of &#163;120 thereafter. Those are still massively subsidised costs. I should give a comparison of the actual costs at the moment. Currently, daycare providers pay &#163;121 to register with Ofsted. At present, the registration actually costs approximately &#163;1,500 to Ofsted to carry out. They then pay &#163;94 annually thereafter and the inspection costs thereafter to Ofsted are about &#163;1,500. So the level of subsidy in the system at the moment is very great and it is similarly large in respect of child minders who currently pay &#163;14 to register with Ofsted and the registration cost is approximately &#163;750 to the state. Although we seek to recover more of the costs and strike a better balance between the interests of the providers and those of the taxpayers, there will still be a very substantial public subsidy.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and my noble friend Lady Massey referred to the exemption of certain categories of providers from registration. I understand that concern and I am sure that we shall debate it more in Committee. Clause 96 defines &quot;early years provision&quot; as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;the provision of childcare for a young child&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-16_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>Early years providers, therefore, include anyone who cares for young children from schools to nurseries and from child minders to babysitters and nannies. That is a very wide spectrum and we believe that it is right that there should be a power to exempt. Otherwise we shall include everyone who provides any form of childcare and I do not believe that your Lordships would wish to have that degree of over-regulation and interference in private family life. I accept that we need to be clearer about how we exercise the power to exempt. I believe that the House would wish us to exercise that power; otherwise we would see a big invasion of private life.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>On quality improvement and ensuring that quality assurance schemes are not simply a once-in-three-years inspection&#151;a point raised by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel&#151;we agree that quality improvement schemes have an important complementary role to play. We are supporting the National Children&#039;s Bureau in establishing the feasibility for a sector-led <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_195"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 195</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

benchmarking scheme for quality assurance schemes and I shall happily give the noble Earl more information on that point.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, raised another regulatory issue about cr&#232;ches. Cr&#232;ches, of course, offer a different type of service compared with other types of provider, caring for children for short periods only or on an irregular basis. Again, we do not wish to over-regulate that kind of provision. However, it is the nature of the setting and not its name that will determine its regulation, so it will not be possible for people simply to claim to be running cr&#232;ches and therefore to evade proper regulation.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>The noble Baroness also quite rightly referred to the importance of BME groups which need to be treated sensitively and that childcare should be available to meet their needs. We entirely agree with the noble Baroness about the refugee and traveller communities. Last week, I met the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, to discuss precisely those communities and the very big challenge of meeting their proper engagement in the school system. I entirely agree that the same issues apply in relation to under-fives provision. The noble Baroness mentioned existing provisions in the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, which already provides the legislation required to ensure that racial discrimination is eliminated and that equality of opportunity and good relations are provided. Statutory guidance to support this Bill will reinforce those duties.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said that there is a lot of guidance and regulation in the Bill&#151;I accept that there is&#151;and she asked whether we could make more detail available. We issued quite a number of policy papers in key areas covered by regulations in the other place. I shall make those available to noble Lords before we go into Committee. As we proceed through the Committee stage, we shall make more information available.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>I shall deal briefly with two final, important issues: first, the issue of listening to children and whether such a matter should be on the face of the Bill. We see the input of children and the views that they express as of immense importance in developing local children&#039;s services, including childcare and early education. I have given a great boost to the role of schools councils in relation to primary schools and the very important work that they can do to give children a voice. I believe that we can do more for the under-fives area too. I entirely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, when she said that four and five year-olds are quite capable of expressing views about the nature of provision and what is happening to them.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>The latest children&#039;s centre practice guidance states that local authorities,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;must consult with parents and children about what is offered and how&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-16_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>It provides examples of how that should take place and the practice elements of the statutory guidance on outcomes will reinforce that. My right honourable friend the Minister for Children gave a commitment in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_196"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 196</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

another place that we will require local authorities, by means of regulations, to take account of the views of children. She said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;We agree that early childhood services will be effective only if they engage not only parents, but children who use them. I am committed to that, and so are the Government. That includes listening to the views of children under five years old who use the service&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee D, 8/12/05; col. 83.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-16_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>In Committee, I shall be more than happy to consider whether we should take that further. Our commitment in this area is very strong indeed.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, mentioned cautions and convictions which are difficult and complex in relation to young people and which risk excluding them from the children&#039;s workforce for life. I take that issue very seriously and it may be better if I deal with it next week on the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, but I do note the point.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>In conclusion, I shall deal with the early years foundation stage. Leaving aside the issue of precisely which word we use to describe the activities to be undertaken in respect of that, I believe that we would all agree that the importance of the state setting out learning and development goals is worth while if it is conducted sensitively and in close co-operation with best professional practice in that area. We are talking about an early years foundation stage which is very far from being about formal education and formal teaching. The early years foundation stage will continue to promote, as <i>Birth to Three Matters</i> and the foundation stage successfully already do, the kinds of activities and experiences that all good parents already undertake as a matter of course with their children and that they would want and expect to see in any good childcare setting. For example, practitioners who read and speak to babies and young children are helping or&#151;if I can use the word&#151;teaching children early speech and language development. That activity also supports or teaches social development. Those are precisely the kind of activities that we would all wish to see underpinned through the EYFS.
</p>

<a name="60321-16_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>In another place, my right honourable friend published <i>Early Years Foundation Stage:</i> <i>Direction of Travel Paper</i>, which sets out these issues. I shall circulate it to noble Lords and I believe that your Lordships will be able to see that there is no insidious plot by the education department to nationalise or in any way to force feed children the early stages of the literacy strategy, as might be feared. In that paper, my right honourable friend said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;Our aim is that the early years foundation stage should replicate the things which good parents do as a matter of course with their children and which they would therefore expect to see in a good childcare setting&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-16_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>That sums up our whole intention in the Bill which is to see that things happen in communities that good parents do as a matter of course with their children and that they would therefore expect to see in any good childcare setting. I have always regarded a fundamental principle for change and reform in this area to be that what a good parent would wish for their children, so the state should wish for children at large. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_197"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 197</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

That is a principle that goes back to Tawney, as expressed in those terms. It is a principle that underpins all that we are seeking to do in the Bill.

&quot;(   )   The value of loans made under subsection (1) must not exceed the value of grants made under that subsection.&quot;

<p><a name="st_93"></a>The noble Lord said: From these Benches we welcome the new power to make loans afforded to the Big Lottery Fund in Clause 14. Loans can be an important part of the sustainable funding mix for voluntary and community sector organisations, for example, by allowing organisations to buy a building that they can then hire out to generate revenue. The recent report from the Home Office-backed futurebuilders fund demonstrates that there is an appetite for loan finance among voluntary and community organisations. An organisation of which I am chairman is taking advantage of a futurebuilders <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_198"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 198</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

fund loan in that way; I declare an interest in that respect. The report shows that more than 70 per cent of the investees&#151;those to whom futurebuilders loans money&#151;had never taken on loan finance before.
</p>

<a name="60321-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>However, one of the key strengths of the National Lottery during the past 11 years has been its role as a large grant-maker. It has provided different types of grants to meet the diverse needs of the voluntary and community sector and made a difference to communities across the United Kingdom. That is increasingly important at a time when most government funding for the sector is through public service contracts and when contributions from the public are declining. The amendment would ensure that the Big Lottery Fund remains primarily a grant-maker, albeit with the power to make loans where appropriate. I beg to move.
</p>

<a name="60321-17_spnew4"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   Will the Big Lottery Fund have different criteria as a basis for awarding loans rather than grants?

</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="60321-17_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am grateful to both noble Lords who have spoken in this short debate. Of course I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that the key strength of the lottery is that it is a large grant-maker and that is to be its role. It will be useful for the fund to have the flexibility to provide funding in different and innovative ways responding to individual needs and circumstances. The other statutory lottery distributors, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Olympic lottery distributor, already have the power to make loans; and the powers of bodies established as companies or under Royal Charter&#151;which includes the other lottery distributors&#151;also normally include a power to make loans. The provisions in the Bill bring the Big Lottery Fund into line.
<a name="time_18"></a>
<a name="60321-17_time1"></a><h5>6.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60321-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>We do not expect loan-making to be a major function of the Big Lottery Fund; that is not its purpose. There is certainly no intention to turn it from a grant-making body into a loan company. That is not the fund&#039;s intention either. Its focus is much more on ensuring lottery money is spent, rather than getting it back in again via loans. However, the flexibility to make loans, where appropriate, could be helpful in some circumstances. The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, asked me for examples: loans could be a way to help the social enterprise sector become sustainable by levering in other sources of finance that guarantee sustainability. Small local loans to communities could enable a higher level of finance to be attracted, enabling important regeneration work to be carried out as a result.
</p>

<a name="60321-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>In that sense, the concept of the loan is as a pump-primer and initiator that gets such enterprises into a position where they can attract the larger loans that they need more appropriately from sources other than <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_199"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 199</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the lottery. The Big Lottery Fund has given a clear assurance that it will offer loans only where it adds value and supports the sector applying. I emphasise that it certainly will not offer loans instead of grants. Any necessary guidance about the circumstances in which the fund may lend money and the conditions it will be required to observe will be included in its financial directions, as is the case with other NDPBs including the other lottery distributors.
</p>

<a name="60321-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>For the reasons I have given, we are not convinced of the need to provide restrictions on the face of the Bill, which the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, intends with his amendment. I hope that he will see that what is proposed is entirely reasonable and feel able to regard his amendment as a necessary probe that can now safely be withdrawn.

<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="60321-17_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   I thank the Minister for his response and for clarifying the Government&#039;s intentions. As he said, the Big Lottery Fund has given the assurances that he mentioned, which are helpful. It is helpful to have the assurances about the Government&#039;s intentions in that respect. I took particular note of his statement that the key strength of the lottery is as a large grant-maker and that will not alter. I agree with him that loans are a useful way of financing organisations in certain circumstances, particularly when it may lever in other finances, and that the other distributors have such power to make loans. It is effectively a question of proportionality. I do not believe that there is much between us in that respect. It may be a big issue at the end of the day as to whether it should be enshrined in the Bill, but for the present I am content with the Minister&#039;s assurances.

</p>

<a name="60321-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>Amendment No. 22 is concerned with the Secretary of State&#039;s order-making power in new Section 36B(3), which is inserted by Clause 14. That power allows her to limit the amounts or proportions of money that the Big Lottery Fund may spend on different types of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_200"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 200</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

prescribed expenditure. Amendment No. 22 would remove the Secretary of State&#039;s power to specify maximum and minimum amounts.
</p>

<a name="60321-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>To reply to the amendment, it is necessary to explain why this order-making power is necessary. The noble Lord will recall from when we discussed Clause 7 that the new good cause is extremely broad, as we recognised. We need to be able to set out, at the highest level, the types of expenditure on which the Big Lottery Fund should focus. Clause 7 allows us to do that.
</p>

<a name="60321-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>The order-making power in Clause 14, which would in practice be exercised at the same time as that in Clause 7, allows us to limit the amounts or proportions of money that the Big Lottery Fund may distribute on the different types of prescribed expenditure. Without this power the fund could, in theory, spend all its money on one type of prescribed expenditure&#151;for example, transformational grants. We do not, of course, expect it to do that, and it would be unreasonable for it to do so. In practice, the power in this clause will be used in only a small number of cases, where it is particularly important to specify the levels of funding. The Secretary of State plans to use this power to specify the maximum amount of money that the fund should spend on transformational grants and the minimum amount it should spend on the Awards for All scheme. Our intention is clearly set out in the illustrative order that we have made available to the House and which we propose to introduce after Royal Assent.
</p>

<a name="60321-17_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>The amounts specified were proposed by the Big Lottery Fund, not by the Government. This power is about providing assurance to the public, not dictating to the fund how to spend its money. The fund has asked us to take this power. I can say quite categorically that we do not intend to specify amounts or proportions of money in relation to the three main funding themes. Since any orders made under these powers will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, they will be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny. I hope I have reassured the noble Lord about the purposes behind the maximum and minimum levels that we are seeking. This power was suggested by the Big Lottery Fund. It will be used very sparingly indeed and, whenever it is deployed, it will be subject to Parliament&#039;s consent under affirmative orders. I hope that that clarifies the issue for the noble Lord.

<a name="60321-18_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   The Minister referred to &quot;transformational grants&quot;. Can he translate that phrase from lottery-speak into English and tell me what a transformational grant is?
</p>




<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="60321-18_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   We are dealing with different areas of Big Lottery Fund expenditure. Where the lottery is giving resources to specific projects, we need the minimum. We are not dictating to the Big Lottery Fund how to spend its money, but we need to make sure that a minimum amount will be spent on the Awards for All scheme. That is where the minimum applies. To guarantee the minimum, it is right that we should seek to put a maximum on the big area of expenditure&#151;the transformational grants <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 201</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

expenditure. If not, we cannot offer the guarantee for the Awards for All scheme, which is the more limited aspect of the lottery operation but is, nevertheless, one that we need. I tried to emphasise to the noble Lord that we are seeking the powers against the background that the Big Lottery Fund itself is content with them and wants to ensure the maximum and minimum, so that we have a maximum for the transformational grants that carry on the Millennium Commission&#039;s work on funding large capital projects.
</p>

<a name="60321-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>The noble Viscount will recognise that there are areas where these big transformational grants and capital projects have brought undoubted benefit to the community. However, I have no doubt that he is likely to cite an instance, perhaps more than one if he is particularly fertile, where a transformational grant&#151;a major grant&#151;has not been wholly successful and was open to criticism. We need the Secretary of State to be able to impose a maximum limit on such grants, otherwise there could be a danger&#151;I think it an unlikely occurrence which is why I expect these powers to be used infrequently&#151;that the glamour of the big projects take a much higher proportion of Big Lottery Fund distribution than is wise. We are seeking to safeguard both areas of lottery expenditure.
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="60321-18_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for his response. I have a slightly better understanding. As there are not very many transformational grants, because there is not a huge number of large projects, it might be useful if before Report the Minister would be kind enough to write to us and let us know what the transformational projects are. That would help us to understand.
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="60321-18_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am, of course, ready to write to the noble Viscount and clarify all the issues.
</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="60321-18_spnew4"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   When the Minister writes to my noble friend, will he be good enough to give an indication of the policy towards maximum and minimum? There is always an interesting question about the gap. In theory, one could put out an order in which the maximum equalled the minimum. I do not suppose that is the intention. However, the point is to ask what this regime is intended to achieve. Is it, in effect, different from the regime that has so far been put in place by policy directions instead of orders?
</p>




<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="60321-18_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The maximum and minimum are not about the same concept. The maximum will control, if control is ever needed, the proportion spent on transformational grants. The minimum is to guarantee that there is sufficient expenditure on the other areas of the Big Lottery Fund&#039;s necessary distribution. It is not maximum and minimum of the same category; they apply to different categories. It is floor in one area and ceiling in the other.

<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="60321-18_spnew7"></a><b> Viscount Astor </b>   moved Amendment No. 23:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>Page 8, line 30, leave out from beginning to end of line 5 on page 9.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>The noble Viscount said: Amendment No. 23 is concerned with co-funding. I recognise that it removes a large block of the Bill, but its purpose is to initiate a debate on the difference between co-funding and joint funding.
</p>

<a name="60321-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>I should say from the start that we support joint funding&#151;we always have&#151;where the lottery matches funds that have been raised by outside fundraising or by people who have contributed to an organisation or a project or who are receiving money from other sources. That is good. The lottery has been most successful when it has enforced joint funding for possible recipients. It gives credibility to a project, which is a good thing. That is not, however, the same as co-funding. This is where we have a concern. By co-funding, I mean that those with funding&#151;whether it is the Government, which I suspect it largely would be, or anyone else&#151;channel that funding through the Big Lottery Fund. The effect is a loss of transparency and accountability, which concerns us, because, as we all heard at earlier stages of the Bill and as the Minister admitted on Second Reading, a government department once made an announcement about a great project that was financed largely by the lottery and tried to claim it as theirs. We do not want any more erosion of the principle of additionality whereby a government department co-funds a small portion of the funding, the Big Lottery Fund co-funds a large portion of the funding, we never know who has done what and everyone tries to claim the project as theirs.
</p>

<a name="60321-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>These are our concerns, which the Minister may be able to address by giving us some reassurance. I recognise that my amendment is a catch-all amendment and may have implications that I have not thought of, but it is a probing amendment designed to get at what the Government think so that they can be clear about our concerns on the difference between co-funding and joint funding. This is important. We think that what is and is not funded by the lottery should be absolutely clear. We are all for joint funding, which is important. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="60321-18_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   I spoke on Second Reading about my concern about the lottery getting involved in spending other people&#039;s money. On the other hand, I understand, as I did then, the considerable expertise that the lottery has as grant makers. My concern then is that many people in the country are not happy about gambling or about accepting the proceeds of gambling, and would prefer to seek grants from organisations that did not get their income from the proceeds of gambling. My concern was therefore that if the Big Lottery Fund is involved in dispensing funds <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_203"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 203</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that are not lottery funds, it must find a way of saying, &quot;These are not lottery funds. Those of you who do not believe in using funds from gambling can apply for these funds and be absolutely clear that this is not lottery money. It is clean money&quot;. This has not popped up in the Bill, and I doubt whether an outfit with a big title like the Big Lottery Fund can actually do what I suggest. Therefore, I am attracted to crossing this out of the Bill, unless someone can find a way of doing it.
</p>

<a name="60321-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>The clause suggests that the Big Lottery Fund should become a laundry for other moneys. There is another point to make here. I have had experience in the past 30 years of being a grant maker, and there are occasions in grant making when you say, &quot;I do not want to be by myself on this. We will fund it if we can get such and such to fund it with us. We might put in 25 per cent&quot;. If the laundry then becomes the umbrella that covers several funds, it is uncertain whether that means that there are fewer doors for applicants to knock on. Bearing in mind that this fund has &#163;600 million plus a year to dispense, do we really need to make provision for it to have more money to dispense? I am therefore now inclined to think that the clause is right and that people who want to give money away but who do not have a grant-making capacity and so do not know how to do it have plenty of places to apply to that dispense money well. They have more options than simply going to the Big Lottery Fund. It would be better if this was omitted, and then it would be absolutely clear that the lottery fund is lottery money and that other money is other money.
</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="60321-18_spnew9"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Shutt of Greetland, asked whether we could find another way of doing this, and doubted whether the clause would work. I shall journey along these lines in support of my noble friend Lord Astor. In this case, I suppose that we are not talking about match funding, as I think he indicated, because the Big Lottery Fund can give a 100 per cent grant and is not required to find the match funding. Reference was also made to expertise in granting funds. Many other institutions do, of course, have great experience of funding, so in leading up to the Minister&#039;s response to this Section 36C discussion, I shall try not to go over any more ground that has already been covered.
</p>

<a name="60321-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>Briefly, the purpose of my amendment is to follow the guidance in the Explanatory Notes that non-lottery funds will be funds from government departments or charitable foundations that wish to make use of the Big Lottery Fund&#039;s infrastructure. My amendment seeks to eliminate the statutory bodies and the private sector, which would, I suppose, also eliminate funds from government departments so that we could focus in Committee on grant-making trusts and the voluntary and community sector. I believe that the definition of the voluntary and community sector, on which the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is working with the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, will turn out to be coterminous with the Treasury&#039;s third sector. Indeed, the NCVO&#039;s summary that,

</p>

<a name="60321-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>may do what needs to be done to stop us agonising over this. Perhaps the Minister will remove any last doubt. His recent letters nearly did the trick. In his letters of 6 and 15 March, he urged us to think about purposes as well as, or was it meant to be instead of, organisations or institutions. The issue here is that purposes and organisations are not alternatives. Purposes provide us with purpose and good cause; organisations&#151;institutions&#151;provide us with cheque signatories and accountability. We need both.
</p>

<a name="60321-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>Many grant-making charities, which I distinguish from delivering charities, are organisations with a distinguished history. Nearly all grant-making charities make grants for health, education and the environment that amount to somewhere between &#163;2 billion and &#163;3 billion a year. What evidence do the Government have that these charities will be attracted to the Big Lottery Fund&#039;s distribution infrastructure?
</p>

<a name="60321-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>Will the proposed new Section 36C help because, although it nods in the direction of limiting the fund&#039;s freedom of action, it nowhere suggests partnership? The Big Lottery Fund will remain in control and the charities will pay their money into the fund, but in successful partnerships it is not always the same person who leads. Thus, what is proposed is not partnership. What confidence, therefore, can we have that proposed new Section 36C will achieve anything which will take proper account of additionality or of the massive experience gained by charitable trusts over many years?
</p>

<a name="60321-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>Most probably, the Minister will give me a lesson in accountability for public money and I could reply with accountability of trustees under charity law, which will get us nowhere. Yet we have PFI schemes, we have academies and the Government support public/private partnerships in both health and education. I therefore urge the Minister to go back to the department and to the Big Lottery Fund, and to think through and bring forward amendments that would achieve a truly joint endeavour between the Big Lottery Fund and charitable trusts. I believe the lottery-playing public would welcome the introduction of a successful distribution infrastructure and the evaluation methodology of grant-giving charities into the affairs of the Big Lottery Fund. The suggested new Section 36C will not achieve this objective. It needs a fresh approach.

<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="60321-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in the debate. These amendments are all concerned with the new arrangements for the Big Lottery Fund to work as an agent distributing money for other public bodies, government or private foundations. The suggestion for this came from the fund itself, which believes that such a provision will make things easier for applicants, particularly those in the voluntary and community sector. The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, invites me into a major debate on its relationship with the voluntary and community sector and we shall spend a fair amount of time today on a number of amendments <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_205"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 205</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on this issue. He will know from my letter that I am concerned to establish&#151;I hope it will be on the record of today&#039;s debate in <i>Hansard</i>&#151;exactly what we intend in these terms, but that is for a later amendment.
</p>

<a name="60321-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>The fund believes that the provision will make it easier for applicants in that sector who would need to apply only once instead of several times for money for the same project. The fund has been approached in the past to use the systems already in place to get things going quickly. For example, before devolution, the old Scottish Office asked the Community Fund to run its then small grants schemes. The Big Lottery Fund has had a number of requests to handle various types of European funding. The Home Office has also made general inquiries as to whether the fund could handle some grant making on behalf of government&#151;for example, some of the current infrastructure funds for the voluntary and community sector. The Carnegie Trust was interested in passing funding for rural projects to the Community Fund for distribution in an agreed scheme with it. Under the existing legislation, neither the Community Fund nor the New Opportunities Fund has power to distribute other people&#039;s money. Therefore, these opportunities to join-up the funding stream for the benefit of applicants were missed.
<a name="time_20"></a>
<a name="60321-19_time0"></a><h5>7.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60321-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, would restrict the value of non-lottery business for the Big Lottery Fund to no more than the value of prescribed expenditure. I do not believe that the new powers need to be prescribed in this way. It would limit the potential to streamline and simplify a range of funding and limit further development, especially in the skills and knowledge which can only be to the benefit of the recipients. Why limit the potential reductions in the cost of distribution and grant management through economies of scale which otherwise would flow?
</p>

<a name="60321-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>We do not expect distributing non-lottery funds to become a major function of the fund&#151;of course not. We all know what the key functions of the fund are and no one wants to see the fund distracted from its main lottery functions. But, in trying to set limits, there is a danger that we may inadvertently prevent the Big Lottery Fund from being able to exploit good opportunities. The fund must have the flexibility to get involved where it thinks it can add value and I hope that noble Lords will recognise the value of the Big Lottery Fund in those terms.
</p>

<a name="60321-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>The same argument applies to the more principled position put forward by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles. I do not see the question of being involved with others as a major activity of the fund. It is not its job to distribute non-lottery money to statutory bodies, but why ban it? Why ban the fund from distributing non-lottery money to profit-making bodies, which might include social enterprises that fit very much into the framework of the work that the Big Lottery Fund is expected to do? We do not believe that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_206"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 206</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the powers to handle non-lottery funds should be removed, but we recognise that they have to be kept in proportion.
</p>

<a name="60321-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>My response to the initial argument of the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, is that this is not about co-funding or joint funding but about allowing the Big Lottery Fund to handle non-lottery funds. Such funds may be distributed entirely separately from any lottery funds. There is no connection with additionality. It is merely a recognition that the Big Lottery Fund, with its resources and expertise, on occasions, can provide helpful streaming possibilities for other funds. It would not be right to restrict this by legislation so that valuable opportunities are missed to the disadvantage of the recipients of Big Lottery Fund money. On that basis, I hope the noble Viscount will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="60321-19_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   The Minister has not responded to my point about the position of principled people who are against receiving money from the proceeds of gambling. How is the Big Lottery Fund to pin a label on itself&#151;outside its front door, on its website or in its literature&#151;which states, &quot;We have other money which is not the proceeds of the lottery. Ye who are principled in the sense of not wanting to use lottery money should knock here&quot;? How is it going to achieve that? I think it is important that that case is clearly made and that people understand that there is other money behind the same door.
</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="60321-19_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The answer is straightforward: those who seek to obtain resources, grants and support from money which does not flow from the Big Lottery Fund will not go to it. If they want support from an organisation such as the Carnegie Trust, they will go to it. All we are indicating is that where the Carnegie Trust can see that the Big Lottery Fund has got a scheme in place for projects which the Carnegie Trust can enhance and which can hit the same objectives that the trust would otherwise deliver through its own resources, its own organisations and its own structure, it can now fund the scheme jointly with the Big Lottery Fund. In those circumstances, the Carnegie Fund might take the decision to use the resources that the Big Lottery Fund can provide, and it would not make sense to shut off the Big Lottery Fund from that.
</p>

<a name="60321-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>I understand the principle behind the noble Lord&#039;s position. Of course it is absolutely right that people should have access to resources from sources other than the Big Lottery Fund&#151;particular those who look upon the Big Lottery Fund as a beneficiary of gambling, to which they object&#151;and they will go to those other sources. The only time the Big Lottery Fund would enter the picture is where other organisations want to facilitate their distribution through the help it can give.

</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="60321-19_spnew3"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   My amendment sought to remove the statutory sector only to focus my part of the discussion on the voluntary and community sector. In principle, I have no objection to other sources of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_207"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 207</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

statutory funding putting their money through the Big Lottery; that seems to me to be a matter for the department and the Big Lottery Fund itself. I was looking for partnership between grant-giving trusts with their own delivery mechanisms and the Big Lottery Fund, in some of which the Big Lottery Fund would accept that it was playing a secondary role. It informs an organisation about what is going on in the outside world if, from time to time, it takes a lead from somebody else and does not always want to lead itself.
</p>

<a name="60321-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>As to the Carnegie Trust, I think I am right in saying that it is very much a research trust, broadly on the lines of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation or one of the other famous research trusts. It does not introduce the issues of delivery and evaluation I had in mind when I looked for a way for the Minister to move towards genuine partnerships between grant-giving trusts&#151;which work in some of the same areas as the Big Lottery Fund&#151;and the Big Lottery Fund, so that they work together. Instead of there being, as I would perceive it, an increasing degree of stand-off between the lottery and the grant-making charities, the two operators within the field would be brought closer together. That is what I was looking for, in order that they could genuinely work together. I do not think this provision achieves that objective, but if the Government do not wish to achieve it my whole argument falls to the ground.
</p>




<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="60321-19_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   Far from it. We seek to ensure that the Big Lottery can play its part in the distribution of resources. The noble Viscount is right, of course. The Carnegie Trust should not underestimate its range or the work that it does. It has been interested, as I indicated, in passing funding for some rural projects to the Community Fund, because the Community Fund has the structures in place. There was no point in the Carnegie Fund duplicating those structures and spending significant resources on distribution, when the distribution mechanisms were there and able to guarantee that resources flowed through. Partnership is certainly within the framework.
</p>

<a name="60321-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>The danger is that the amendments lead to a restriction on the Big Lottery. The Government are not trying to create big powers for the Big Lottery; the Big Lottery itself has sought these opportunities because it can see ways in which it can be cost-effective and serve the community. The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, is absolutely right: a great deal of this relates to the community and voluntary sector, which is the subject of a great many of the amendments we will go on to discuss. We are seeking to enable the Big Lottery to play its proper part in that area.

<a name="60321-20_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   The Big Lottery Fund is a new creation, it is not even on the statute book, and it has ambitions to become even bigger. That is the reality of it. My amendment would not, as the Minister says, restrict or shut out other sources of funding for recipients. Quite the reverse: at the moment the distributing bodies jointly fund many projects. I think <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_208"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 208</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a large majority of projects in, for example, the National Heritage Memorial Fund, have some form of joint funding. It really would not shut that out. This is different because the Government are asking that money be siphoned through the Big Lottery Fund.
</p>

<a name="60321-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>If charities were giving the money I would not be so concerned, because they have a choice. However, the Minister said that it could be government money, citing the example of the Home Office. I am afraid I have a suspicious nature when it comes to dealing with the Treasury. I have been there; I have seen it at work. As soon as I see the concept of government money going through the Big Lottery Fund, immediately alarm bells begin to ring. It could be funded one year, but cut the next, with the lottery then being asked to take up the slack. That is always our concern. The Treasury is always trying to find ways of using the lottery to cut its expenditure.
</p>

<a name="60321-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>I do not think my amendment blocks any form of funding. There may be a compromise and I would have to consider whether it would be on the face of the Bill. The Minister might also consider this. Could we ask the Big Lottery Fund to ensure that, by statute, it accounts for the different sources of funding going through it in its annual report? Apart from money received from the lottery, any money received from government departments or charities should be clearly separate and accounted for, in order that we have clarity and transparency over where the money comes from. I hope the Minister might consider that issue and come back to my noble friend Lord Eccles and myself about whether the Government could do that to help us out.

</p>

<a name="60321-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>The noble Viscount said: Amendment No. 26 is, again, something of a probing amendment, in order to discover just how much power the Big Lottery Fund will have when giving advice about grants and distribution of money to other distributing bodies. The Big Lottery Fund says that this is so that all distributing bodies can co-ordinate on such joint matters as setting up a website. Because the Big Lottery Fund will be the biggest fund, it will naturally take the leading role. This will allow the Big Lottery Fund to provide a one-stop shop for the provision of advice about grant applications. In the other place, during the passage of the Bill, Mr Caborn said:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;New section 36D will allow the Big Lottery Fund to take the role of lead distributor by allowing it to give advice beyond its own functions&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee A, 25/10/05; col. 96.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a> That causes me concern, as the words Mr Caborn sometimes used during the passage of this Bill quite often did. It implies that the Big Lottery Fund has an even greater ambition: to become not only the biggest lottery distributor, but perhaps, over a period of time, the only lottery distributor. That is of concern.

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>What advice will the fund give? Will it give advice about process, about how to apply for lottery funds, or will it go further? Will it advise on individual projects? We do not know. There is a concern here that, in creating what the Big Lottery Fund has called a &quot;one-stop shop,&quot; it could be a barrier between those who wish to apply and the other distributing bodies. We do not want that to happen. I think it is extremely important that the other distributing bodies maintain their identity because they have built up expertise in their area, whether that is sport or heritage. We certainly do not want to lose that. It would be a doubling of resources if suddenly the Big Lottery Fund had its own experts on, for example, sport. We are concerned about this and it would be helpful if the Minister could clarify the situation. I beg to move.

<a name="60321-20_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   I understand that there is a concern here, but not, I would have thought, if the Big Lottery Fund acts properly in distributing money according to the provisions. If someone goes to the wrong lottery, the Big Lottery Fund can tell them which is correct. All it has to do is say, &quot;You have come to the wrong place&quot;. Inviting, making or considering applications is the job of the Big Lottery Fund. The third point concerns the use of money paid; I would have thought that was its role. I am surprised by this, but it will be interesting to see what the Minister has to say. Provided the Big Lottery Fund does this properly and stays within its role, I would have thought that the clause was okay.

</p>

<a name="60321-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>This is about providing advice to people who apply to the lottery for funding. The Big Lottery Fund is the largest distributor and will have the resources to give that advice. It will organise telephone helplines and a lottery funding website. We should not underestimate the difficulties that ordinary people, particularly those running village and community halls, have in knowing how to apply to the lottery and which fund they should approach. This provides the capacity to advise people how best they can help themselves. I cannot see a great deal wrong with that, as the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, so clearly demonstrated.

Will the Minister address that point?

<a name="60321-20_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I was tempted to say that I rather regret that the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, is attacking my right honourable friend behind his back when he is marooned in Melbourne and unable to defend himself, given his other onerous duties at the Commonwealth Games. Fortunately, I am able to defend him.
</p>

<a name="60321-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>This is not about the Big Lottery Fund seeking to take over other distributors&#039; business. It merely indicates to the ordinary member of the public seeking to do well and to access funds from the lottery that the Big Lottery will be able to offer real help, expertise and hard information on behalf of the lottery as a whole. It is not a takeover of distribution and has nothing to do with power; it is to do with information to the wider public.  The noble Viscount&#039;s fears should be allayed by these reassurances.

<a name="60321-20_spnew7"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   I think the Minister got me wrong. I was not attacking his colleague, Mr Caborn&#151;he was coming to my defence in my amendment.

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 211</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

power over distributing bodies. Indeed, they have said that the Big Lottery Fund is no more prescriptive than before because it follows the increased prescription that applies to the New Opportunities Fund. But it is certainly more prescriptive than any of the original distributing bodies. The original distributors, including the Community Fund, have to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;comply with directions on matters to be taken account of&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>when distributing lottery funds and &quot;comply with directions&quot; relating to their management, accounting and delegation of powers. If the Secretary of State said they should consider the relative wealth of the community when making grants, they would have to include this as one of their criteria.
</p>

<a name="60321-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>When the New Opportunities Fund was set up, the level of prescription was increased. It had to &quot;comply with directions&quot; from the Secretary of State on all matters, including the distribution of grants, meaning that the Secretary of State had increased powers and could give any direction he wanted.
</p>

<a name="60321-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>The Minister said on a previous amendment that the Government were going to set things out at the highest level when it came to dealing with the Big Lottery Fund, and I accept his reassurances, but what has happened in the past concerns me. I have a copy of the directions that were given to the New Opportunities Fund, and I am sure that the Minister has a copy too. Those directions go way beyond what one might call the highest level. The section covering young people and sport in schools states in paragraph 4.4:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>&quot;The Fund shall commit a total of &#163;750.75 million to projects falling within this initiative. Within this figure up to &#163;50 million should be committed to building or refurbishing outdoor adventure facilities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>Paragraph 5.2 on opportunities and activities for young people says that the fund shall commit a total of &#163;44 million and describes how that should be allocated. Paragraph 6.3 on the section to reduce the burden of coronary heart disease, stroke and cancer says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;The Fund shall commit a total of &#163;213.5 million to projects falling within this initiative&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>We can see that in the past, the directions have been very prescriptive. They have allocated money and have said what it should be spent on. A list in the directions shows exactly how the money allocated to reducing coronary heart disease should be spent. The directions also cover palliative care and childcare. The directions show that the Government have been exact about what they wanted the New Opportunities Fund to do. When one looks closely at a Written Answer by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, to a Question asked by my noble friend Lord Howe, we see that since 2001 the Big Lottery Fund programme has allocated,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;&#163;125 million to fund 90 additional and replacement laboratories&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 13/3/06; <i>WA 193</i>.]</p>

</p>

<a name="60321-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>In earlier debates, we had a long discussion about whether that should be done because it was additional in areas where there might be no funding for these projects. But some of the areas that have been funded <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 212</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

are rather wealthy in terms of local government expenditure&#151;they are all over England, including Surrey and Sussex and places such as that. When you look at the lists of those waiting for angiograms for coronary heart disease, which are included in the Written Answer, you can see that the waiting lists bear no relation to where the money was spent. It is interesting that the shortest waiting list is in County Durham and Tees Valley&#151;the Prime Minister&#039;s county. I am not sure why that is. The longest is in Surrey and Sussex. What does one learn from that? There is no such thing as the north-south divide when it comes to these things.
</p>

<a name="60321-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>We are concerned about the whole of Clause 14&#151;the directions&#151;because the evidence is there. In the past, the Government have been prescriptive. They are now going to be more prescriptive over a larger sum of money, which gives us concern. It goes back to all the arguments that we had on additionality, which I do not wish to go into this evening because we have had them. However, I want a much clearer understanding from the Government of how they intend to use the power of the directions as set out. The Minister says that they going to be used at the highest level but, frankly, experience has shown that in the past that has not been the case. If the Government have changed their mind, fine, let us hear about that. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response and I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="60321-21_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   When I spoke on the earlier occasion that we met, I made the point that the literature relating to the Big Lottery Fund indicates that the Government want to build on the successes of the Community Fund and the New Opportunities Fund. But as we go on, it is clear that this is a reverse takeover and that they are really moving forward on the New Opportunities Fund. For example, there are no regional committees and so forth, which I spoke about on the last occasion. The Community Fund took account of that and the New Opportunities Fund complied. If the Minister has such tremendous confidence about the tight central control that the Big Lottery Fund is now being pushed into having, this ought not to be the way forward. It really ought to be able to have confidence in its own decision-making procedures and take account of what Ministers have to say from time to time, otherwise it becomes even more of a nationalised industry, which I fear is the way that it is going.

<a name="column_213"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 213</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

directions. Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 are grouped together and I was going to ask the Committee&#039;s permission to treat them separately because Amendment No. 28 is so different from Amendment No. 29 that they do not really fit very accurately into a group. In Amendment No. 29 I am seeking to leave out part of the provision about which my noble friend Lord Astor spoke. In Amendment No. 28, I am talking about publicising and it would not for my purposes matter what was in the provision. Whatever is left in the provision, it needs publicising, so it is rather a different point.
</p>

<a name="60321-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>The second way of going about Section 36E is to leave out subsection (2). The principal concern is the progression, which has been outlined by my noble friend, of directions from the small beginnings of 1993 to the present 37 pages of Big Lottery Fund directions with 160 significant headings and the prescriptive detail which follows each heading.
</p>

<a name="60321-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>It is the Minister&#039;s expressed intention that the Secretary of State changes to a light-touch regime. He has given us that assurance. There are five pages in the circulated illustrative directions document with three themes and four outcomes. The themes are &quot;community learning&quot;, &quot;community safety and cohesion&quot; and &quot;physical and mental well-being&quot;, all of which are well represented on the face of the Bill. These and the four outcomes with their abstract nouns rather than the present programmed sums of money and the prescriptive detail which follows seem to show that directions have run their course. Indeed, earlier on this evening we were told about the intention behind orders in respect of maximum and minimum expenditure sums.
</p>

<a name="60321-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>However, surely the board will not need any more directions. Like squirrels, the members will be able to unearth as much as they will need for years to come from the 37 pages. Those 37 pages arrived after the small beginnings of 1993 with Section 26 using &quot;to take account of&quot; and gathered speed in Section 43 of the 1998 Act, which used &quot;must comply&quot; and the question is, what now? We have the same words and an equivalent very widely drawn power. That is against the background that it is Parliament&#039;s understanding that directions are for administrative reasons not policy matters&#151;as indeed they are in Section 36E (3), (4) and (5).
</p>

<a name="60321-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>What happened between 1998 and today seems to be that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport constructed a new directions doctrine not used elsewhere in government. Is that what the Government have recognised with their proposed light touch? The question remains about what this history has done to Big&#039;s independence and what will happen to its independence in the future. It is clear that the board of Big&#151;a shadowy presence in our debates&#151;does not have a significant degree of independence today. Why is that? We have been told that the board has agreed and agrees to everything&#151;not the usual position of independent boards. How many times has the board disputed draft directions? What has the discussion been about? Did all the members quietly agree to the administrative merger of the three funds? Why indeed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_214"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 214</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

has Big&#039;s board agreed to so low a percentage as 60 per cent to 70 per cent to go to the voluntary and community sector when it did not have a published definition of that sector? Why not 80 per cent to 90 per cent?
</p>

<a name="60321-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>The Minister asserts that 60 per cent to 70 per cent is as much or more than before, but as I know from Written Questions and Answers, he does not have accurate figures&#151;nor, in the case of Big&#039;s grants to registered charities, any figures&#151;to back up his assurances. These questions and their answers, none of them exceptionally contentious, are the stuff of independence. We will most probably be told that all is well and that there is no need for vigorous debate, nor any place for difference of opinion. So much for openness. Behind such an assurance lies the likelihood of a cosy dialogue between DCMS officials and Big&#039;s management, who deal with all these matters. Big&#039;s board members will remember that they must comply, which means that the Secretary of State will get her way, as she always has. Parliament will not know until long afterwards; meanwhile, debate can be diverted into additionality&#151;a classic red herring.
</p>

<a name="60321-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>Nothing that I have seen or heard leads me to believe that Big&#039;s board has, nor has it shown, any degree of independence; nor will the new Section 36E(2) help it to re-emerge. The Secretary of State has gone way beyond the original will of Parliament and has trained Big into compliance. The clause should be left out and directions should revert to administrative matters.

<a name="60321-22_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am very grateful to the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, who has demolished the first amendment, if nothing else. He indicated that of course there must be some directions, which he defined as the administrative directions in new Section 36E. He will recognise that the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, is against directions in his amendment.
</p>

<a name="60321-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>In the first group, there are financial directions, which incorporate financial controls, which apply to all non-departmental public bodies through their financial memoranda and the lottery distributors are being governed in the same way. The purpose behind such directions, which is common to all non-governmental public bodies, is straightforward. We are under an obligation to protect public money by ensuring that distributors comply with basic financial and operational good practice. The requirements placed on the Big Lottery Fund by new Section 36E(3) are exactly the same as those placed on other distributors in Section 26 of the 1993 Act. Nothing has changed&#151;because, of course, they are compliant with the kind of regulations that we need to safeguard public money with regard to all bodies of this kind.
</p>

<a name="60321-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>What kind of requirements beyond that and what other directions does the Secretary of State have? The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, will recognise that we are replacing the 37 pages that we had before with the shorter document of the new illustrative policy directions, which he will have read. What do those directions do? They refer, under general directions, to,
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_215"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 215</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;need to be innovative and to take risks in distributing money . . . balanced with the need to manage risk in a manner commensurate with type of project and applicant . . . The needs of children and young people . . . The need to further the objectives of sustainable development&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>Who could possibly object to a range of directions at that level? It is exactly the level that we debated at Second Reading when I gave assurances and exactly the level that was debated in the other place in Committee and at the other stages when the Bill was discussed in the other place. We said that we were about light touch general directions and not about prescription. In asking the Big Lottery Fund to comply with these directions, we are asking it to comply with the lightest touch, save in those areas in which there is administrative compliance, which we impose on all bodies.
</p>

<a name="60321-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, was quoting to me the old directions. I emphasise to him that we have learnt from that and moved on. The old directions were given to the New Opportunities Fund and the Community Fund, but they will be revoked as soon as we have Royal Assent for this Bill. They will be replaced with these new directions, with their light touch which is definitely required in order that we can guarantee the proper use of public money.
</p>

<a name="60321-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, was good enough to emphasise that he was likely to return to these arguments when he moved to discussing Amendment No. 29. He is probably right in saying that it helps to generalise the debate at this stage to that amendment. All that I can say is that the powers of direction reflect the need to bring together the different regimes of control that existed among the Big Lottery Fund&#039;s predecessors. The Community Fund, like other lottery distributors, had a statutory duty to comply, and that is a real legal obligation that we are translating for the Big Lottery Fund. The Community Fund had to take all the policy directions into account and could decide to ignore a matter only in exceptional circumstances.
</p>

<a name="60321-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>We are in great danger of narrowing this debate down to a point that does not do justice to the issues before us in the Bill. What are being sought here are broad directions&#151;specific directions with which this distributor must comply when it comes to its responsibility for public money. That is exactly the same position as with all other non-departmental public bodies. But on the other side there is a clear realisation that the directions that have been given are of a most general kind. The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, may quote my right honourable friend in another place to me in a moment. All I can say is that this is the argument that he put, which we had at Second Reading, when I emphasised that this is about light touch and broad directions. I have a document that demonstrates that fact.

That, indeed, is progress. He gave me some reassurance that they are going to be less prescriptive than they were in the past. But on these directions, has the department finalised them and do they have any draft directions that we can see during the passage of this Bill? When does he think that they will be published? We are in this extraordinary limbo: the Government have created the Big Lottery Fund and now they are chasing up by statute to put it on a statutory footing.

But I give the noble Viscount the obvious indication that when we issue draft directions, as we have done, that is our best guide to the way in which we intend to act. The noble Viscount can form his arguments against the basis that we have given the maximum amount of information that would be reasonable for the Government to give at this stage, while the Bill proceeds through the House.

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 217</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

this case the Minister circulated the illustrative set we have been talking about, and he has helpfully told us about its status. Normally it is difficult to keep track of directions. Sometimes they are available in timely fashion, sometimes not, hence the need for publicity. The proposal in Section 36E(9) is unsatisfactory. In it, the Big Lottery Fund is bidden to set out directions in its annual report. Its two reports so far were published last December, 21 months after the start of the fund&#039;s accounting period. That does not provide a timely opportunity for anyone, Parliament included, to study the content of directions, and the Bill in front of us does no better.
</p>

<a name="60321-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>Nor does the Government&#039;s approach give any credence to the probability that from time to time the board of Big has expressed reservations or even dissent. If it did not, where was its independence? These matters are complex and, at the least, as we have heard before in Committee, raise agonising questions of additionality. It is this sort of dialogue that needs to be in reports, not a transcription of directions. The Secretary of State should publish within days of signing directions. I beg to move.

<a name="60321-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I assure the noble Viscount that the Secretary of State fully intends to make public any directions for the Big Lottery Fund and has indicated that it should also include them in its annual report. The noble Viscount is right that directions are not subject to parliamentary debate, but one shudders to think of the implications for our legislative load if directions encapsulated in legislation became the subject of debate in the two Houses. It would be an unimaginable burden.
</p>

<a name="60321-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>On the question of the directions not being enough in the annual report, I do not think the noble Viscount can expect to see the pros and cons of the Secretary of State&#039;s debate with the distributor as a to and fro occurs with regard to certain major issues. We have emphasised that a light touch is required here, so it would be about only the broadest of parameters. The noble Viscount is right; debate goes on, we all recognise that. I am not sure that a kind of <i>Hansard</i> of such discussions included in the annual report is quite what he has in mind. I hear what he says. The directions will certainly be there, and therefore the public will know the broad parameters under which the Big Lottery Fund is operating. That is probably about as far as we could be expected to go.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;expenditure for a charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purpose&quot;.</p>

<a name="60321-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>I see the point in my noble friends putting their names to this amendment, because it brings us back to our old friend additionality. The reason for pursuing this amendment is to be absolutely clear that there is a distinction between what is charitable, and done by others, and what is government expenditure, which, for reasons we all understand, can now come under this Bill. The amendment gives the Minister a chance to spell out the additionality issue once more and to be clear about this 30 to 40 per cent and 60 to 70 per cent.
</p>

<a name="60321-23_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>I would not mind pursuing that last point a bit further. There is a big difference between 30 and 40&#151;you add a third. The distinction between 60 and 70 is rather less. People will want to know that it will not just be 39.9 per cent and 60.1 per cent year after year. There needs to be clarity here. This is an opportunity for the Minister to allay some of the concerns that people have, some of whom have contacted us. We share those concerns. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="60321-23_spnew3"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   My amendment is grouped with this one. We support the change that the Government have made to the National Lottery etc. Act in Clause 19.

</p>

<a name="60321-23_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>When I tabled my amendment about political causes, I did not know that funding of political parties would suddenly become such an issue. I hope that the Minister will give me the very simple answer that my amendment is unnecessary because political parties are excluded.
</p>




<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="60321-23_spnew4"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   I shall amplify what has already been said; I hope not to cover the same ground. Clause 19 is all right, provided that we remember one or two things, the first of which is that it was probably unnecessary. I suspect that the lawyers danced on the head of a pin and kept telling the management and boards of the two lottery funds that there were problems with the drafting of the original Bill. However, when I have asked what the problems were and requested one or two examples, none has been provided. Lawyers are extremely good at telling you what you cannot do. My own approach in years past has been to say to them, &quot;Well, I dare say the Bill doesn&#039;t allow me to do that, but who will object and what will their objection be?&quot; You cannot think what objection there would be because what you propose to do is undoubtedly a good thing. That was in the days of the Commonwealth Development Corporation, which, in the early 1990s, still existed by virtue of a Bill drafted in 1948. Life was different then; for example, they said, &quot;We are not sure that you can do mobile telephones&quot;. Well, we did it and nobody objected. I have a feeling that something here has been built up into much more than it really is. We should remember that.
</p>

<a name="60321-23_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>Secondly, as I mentioned, you cannot live on purposes alone; you need institutions as well. &quot;Purposes&quot; is abstract; institutions are accountable. I am sure that the Big Lottery Fund will look very carefully at the institutional arrangements of the body to which it will make grants and then monitor and evaluate the results of that grant, not in terms of a purpose, but of the performance of the grant recipient. Clause 19 does not make a lot of difference and, therefore, one should not go on about it for too long, but it leaves us with things that we need to remember.
</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="60321-23_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   Both amendments are concerned with the definition of &quot;charitable expenditure&quot;, in relation to the new Big Lottery Fund good cause, set out in Clause 19. Clause 19 defines &quot;charitable expenditure&quot; as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a>&quot;expenditure for a charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purpose&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-23_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>This is to be a purpose-based approach. I am grateful to the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, who indicated that he supported the new definition. I am marginally distressed that we are not joined in this matter by the thinkers in the Liberal Democrat Party. I shall seek to emphasise to them why they should join us in supporting this new definition.
</p>

<a name="60321-23_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>The existing definition of &quot;charitable expenditure&quot; in relation to the Community Fund good cause adopts an institution-based approach. That is exactly what the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, would want us to return to.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_220"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 220</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60321-23_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>The new definition has many merits. It is intended to ensure that the focus in future is on projects and outcomes, rather than on institutions and constitutions. The definition is being changed in the light of the practical experience of the Community Fund and with the full support of the Big Lottery Fund Board.
</p>

<a name="60321-23_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>In the past, the Community Fund has been unable to fund some deserving projects simply because the organisation applying for funding has had the wrong kind of constitution. This is not a theoretical problem; it has a real impact on real organisations. Many organisations with good projects to benefit communities have had to be turned down for funding under the current definition. These include numerous small community groups such as credit unions, tenants&#039; and residents&#039; associations, co-operative enterprises, some sports clubs and ex-servicemen&#039;s organisations. They also include some large organisations such as the Social Enterprise Coalition and the Soroptimists.
</p>

<a name="60321-23_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>If the Liberal Democrat Party, in proposing this amendment, is saying that it has none of these institutions&#039; welfare at heart, there will be rejoicing in other parts of the House. The noble Lord should perhaps rethink his amendment on those grounds. The new definition will give the Big Lottery Fund much-needed flexibility to support good projects, even where the applicant is not set up for a charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purpose. As long as the projects are for those purposes, they will in principle be able to be funded. The Big Lottery Fund will no longer have to make complex eligibility judgments as it does now. This will add to the efficiency with which applications are processed and help to reduce costs, adding to the &#163;6 million to &#163;12 million of savings that we expect to be achieved each year as a result of setting up the Big Lottery Fund.
</p>

<a name="60321-23_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>I know that there was some initial uncertainty, particularly among those in the voluntary and community sector, about why Clause 19 needed to be drafted precisely as it has been. We believe that we have allayed those concerns. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations met the Big Lottery Fund, the fund&#039;s lawyers and the Social Enterprise Coalition last month to discuss the reasons behind the change.
</p>

<a name="60321-23_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>We understand that, following that meeting, the NCVO is satisfied that the new definition is practical. It accepts that Clause 19 contains the best form of words to ensure that the Big Lottery Fund can fund the entire third sector, and that a definition of the sector in the Bill would be too restrictive and potentially damaging for it. Decisions on funding will of course be for the Big Lottery Fund.
</p>

<a name="60321-23_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>We have heard a great deal about how the fund should make such decisions independently, without interference from government. I am happy to give the assurance on the record that we have absolutely no intention of interfering and that Clause 19 cannot be used to divert funds to central government; nor&#151;and the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, asked for this reassurance&#151;is it our intention that it should be used <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_221"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 221</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to divert funds to political parties. It is highly unlikely in any case that party-political activity would constitute a charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purpose. Neither the Community Fund nor the New Opportunities Fund has ever funded a political party; why should anyone start doing so now? Funding decisions will be for the Big Lottery Fund, and I emphasise that the Government are outside that framework. I am concerned that we recognise that fact.
</p>

<a name="60321-23_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>In the circumstances, there is no need, in our view, for an amendment to spell out matters any further. I draw the Committee&#039;s attention to the policy direction that we have given to all lottery distributors requiring them to take into account the need to ensure that money is distributed for projects that promote the public good and that are not intended primarily for private gain. I can also give the assurance that the clause will not lead to the voluntary and community sector organisations losing out. As the Committee discussed last week, the Big Lottery Fund has given an undertaking that 60 per cent to 70 per cent of its funding will go directly to voluntary and community sector organisations. That undertaking will operate on an institutional basis. The fund has worked closely with key VCS stakeholders to develop the definition of a voluntary and community sector organisation for the purposes of the undertaking, and I understand that broad agreement has been reached.
</p>

<a name="60321-23_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>A key principle is that it is where the money ends up that is important, so money awarded to a local authority and then distributed to voluntary and community groups will count. However, money awarded to voluntary and community groups and then distributed to a local authority clearly would not. That must be the sensible approach. The fund will continue to work with voluntary and community sector organisations as they develop detailed guidance on this issue.
</p>

<a name="60321-23_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>While we are on the subject of the Big Lottery Fund&#039;s undertaking, I should like to clarify the Government&#039;s position, as I did in a letter last week to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and others who spoke at the Committee&#039;s first sitting. The fund has done everything possible to show that it intends to deliver on its undertaking and to do so in a clear and accountable fashion. We have every confidence that it will do so. I recognise very well the desire for reassurance on that matter, so I am this evening prepared to place on the record that the Government will act as the guarantor of the Big Lottery Fund&#039;s undertaking that 60 per cent to 70 per cent of its funding will go to the voluntary and community sector. We will do everything possible to ensure that the fund delivers on the undertaking and reports on it in a transparent and accessible way.
</p>

<a name="60321-23_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>I return to the amendments&#151;I have not lost sight of that which has promoted this debate. I stress that the important thing is what the lottery money is spent on, not who spends it. Clause 19 will ensure that deserving organisations which have been largely ineligible for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_222"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 222</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

funding can now be considered. In the light of that reply, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

I spoke earlier about the business of having a brief. In my view, the brief was to flush out the business of what I shall call the charitable sector as a whole and alternative government funding. The Minister is absolutely right about the meaning of charitable expenditure. I take the view that, with the assurances, Clause 19 as it stands is bang-on right. What he has said, and what is important, is that any applicant to the Big Lottery Fund can go along and say, &quot;I haven&#039;t had time. I haven&#039;t got my registration. I don&#039;t feel I need a registration. But what I want to do and what I want the money for is so clearly a charitable purpose&quot;. That is what is important and I am delighted that the Minister has said it. I am delighted that the lottery fund will not say, as some charities do, &quot;You are not a registered charity, therefore we cannot entertain you&quot;. Of course they can entertain them but they choose not to. I am delighted that it is clear and on the record that someone with expenditure for a charitable purpose can be within the purview of the Big Lottery Fund. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p>

&quot;DIRECTIONS ON LARGE PROJECTS

<br>
   In section 26 of the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 (c. 39) (directions to distributing bodies) after subsection (4A) insert&#151;


<br>
&quot;(4B)   The Secretary of State shall give directions to distributing bodies that no project may be awarded a grant or loan by the Lottery Distribution Fund that exceeds 25 per cent of the distributing body&#039;s annual budget.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_142"></a>The noble Viscount said: This further probing amendment seeks the Government&#039;s view on large grants, because when one looks at the history of what might be called the mega amounts of money going to individual projects, it is not a terribly happy picture. Some of the others have not been successful and, in some instances, over 25 per cent of the budget of a distributor in any one year has gone to a single project. We think that dangerous and hope that the Government will not encourage that in future. Perhaps the Minister might say something on the Government&#039;s view on that, and whether it will be part of either guidance or directions to the distributing bodies. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="60321-24_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   This amendment would have several undesirable effects. I hope that the noble Viscount will withdraw it after I have explained our intention. It is unnecessary, as the Secretary of State already has powers to issue both policy and financial directions to distributing bodies. Indeed, it would <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_223"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 223</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

significantly add to bureaucracy both for the Government and for distributors&#151;and would be unnecessary bureaucracy at that.
</p>

<a name="60321-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>The nature of the direction-giving function proposed would represent unjustified micromanagement of distributors. Existing policy and financial directions are framed in much more general terms, which I sought to defend in our discussions earlier this evening. It is unnecessary to write such a precise requirement into directions, and inappropriate to write it into the Bill. Distributors already have policy directions which require them to take various matters into account when deciding to whom to distribute lottery proceeds, and for what purpose. It is an important principle that, within those parameters, distributors should decide independently which applications for lottery grant to accept or reject, and a distributor should be free to support a large-scale project if it believes there will be public benefit from it.
</p>

<a name="60321-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>The noble Viscount may have one or more public projects that he would deem less than successful for the public, but, within that framework, if his amendment were carried, developments such as the Eden Project, the Tate Modern or the Millennium Stadium might not have taken place because distributors would have been prevented or discouraged from taking such calculated risks. There is always the risk that a big project might go wrong, but the lottery&#039;s record is good. For example, of the 223 grants made to capital projects by the Millennium Commission, only three have gone into liquidation&#151;a pretty good record.
</p>

<a name="60321-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>The Government would be the first to agree that the lottery is not just about large projects. I understand that the noble Viscount is concerned that there should be due recognition of small being beautiful. From the late 1990s we have encouraged greater emphasis on smaller, community-based projects. That has been reflected in changes to the policy direction issued to distributing bodies. However, this amendment would fetter distributors&#039; discretion&#151;there is no track record to show that it is necessary&#151;and introduce an increased bureaucratic level of interference. It is not justified in being on the record, and I hope that the noble Viscount will feel reassured by that response.

<a name="60321-24_spnew3"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   The Minister wants to proscribe only when he wants to proscribe. He does not want anybody else to proscribe; that is the fact of it. The danger is that, in giving out 50 per cent of the proceeds, the Big Lottery Fund could give a huge grant. Therefore, anything over 25 per cent would be such a vast amount. Quite frankly, I totally discount the Minister&#039;s response about more work, and so on. He should have crossed that out rather quickly and not bothered with it, since it rather demeaned his argument. There will not be, at the end of the day, many of these, and I cannot see the Government encouraging another dome&#151;at least, not if they have any sense.
</p>

<a name="60321-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>There was a glimmer of hope when the Minister said that the Government would encourage smaller projects. If the Big Lottery Fund was tempted to give <br>&nbsp;<br>

up to 25 per cent of its vast amount of money to one project, as has happened in the past, there would be a public outcry. I hope that the Government and the Big Lottery Fund both now recognise that; as they probably do, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="60321-24_spnew4"></a><b> Viscount Astor </b>   moved Amendment No. 58:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a>After Clause 19, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_7"></a><br>
&quot;REPORT OF INTERNATIONAL EXPENDITURE

<br>
   In section 34 of the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 (c. 39) (annual reports by distributing bodies other than Millennium Commission) after subsection (2) insert&#151;


<br>
&quot;(2A)   The report shall set out any awards made during that year for projects outside the United Kingdom.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_146"></a>The noble Viscount said: The amendment concerns expenditure by distributing bodies outside this country. We have always believed that the lottery should be primarily for this country, for British citizens, and projects that affect British citizens wherever they may be. That has largely been the case, but when I looked at what has happened, it proved difficult to work out, because the Community Fund gave large sums of money to international projects. One can look at the fund&#039;s website and discover that some of those donations were made under its international grants programme; but one cannot find many of those because they are defined as being made either under a local authority category or under a different assessment office that has assessed many projects both in this country and abroad&#151;thereby not coming under the international grants programme.
</p>

<a name="60321-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>When I asked the Community Fund and the Big Lottery Fund for exactly what grants they had made, I received conflicting answers. I was concerned at that, because it should be clear and while we support the need for an international programme of grants from the lottery, we would like to know how much has been given.
</p>

<a name="60321-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>The reason for my amendment moves on from that. Considering the powers that the Secretary of State is given in the Bill, Clause 7, for example, regarding National Lottery Distribution Fund apportionment, says nothing about international grants. It mentions Wales, Northern Ireland, health, education and so on, but international grants are not mentioned. I do not know whether the Government will include in directions a sum that should be allocated to international projects. Will the lottery funds consider that they could do that anyway, without directions? Will they receive any guidance on that?
</p>

<a name="60321-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>I understand that the Big Lottery Fund will announce shortly that it will have an international grants programme of up to &#163;60 million, plus &#163;12 million for long-term reconstruction initiatives in areas affected by the tsunami, which we support. But it is not clear whether such sums will be an annual expenditure, or whether that figure will change. What is the Government&#039;s view? They have created the Big Lottery Fund, which will receive 50 per cent of lottery funding and will look to the Government for guidance. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_225"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 225</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

That will include whatever the Minister says in this House. So it would be useful if the Government would say how they envisage the international grants programme working alongside domestic programmes. What emphasis should the Big Lottery Fund place on that and will there be directions? Will the other distributing bodies that, I admit, I have not focussed on, have power to make international grants? Originally, it was the Community Fund that made international grants, but that has been subsumed into the Big Lottery Fund.
</p>

<a name="60321-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>The intention of the amendment is to obtain some clarity. I understand the Government&#039;s thinking, and the Minister should reassure us that when the Big Lottery Fund reports, it must state which geographical areas and what type of projects have received international grants. I beg to move.

<a name="60321-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Joffe: </b>   I declare an interest as the trustee of a number of UK charities operating outside the UK and as a former chair of Oxfam. I support what the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, said about the importance of additionality, and of transparency and accountability. However, I am afraid that I do not understand the reasoning behind this amendment. If the amendment had provided that the report should set out all awards made during the year for all projects, whether in the UK or outside, I might have supported it. But why limit it to &quot;projects outside the United Kingdom&quot;? It is difficult not to draw an inference from this selective amendment, that projects outside the UK are prima facie suspect simply because they are overseas. Is the noble Viscount of the view that overseas development charities are less well managed than charities operating in the UK; and if so, on what evidence does he rely for this view? Over the past 25 years or so, I have had a considerable involvement with quite a range of charities, some operating in this country and others overseas, and have seen nothing to suggest that projects in the UK are better managed or better selected than those outside.
</p>

<a name="60321-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>The lottery&#039;s international programme has built up an excellent reputation over the past 10 years for being an effective funding distributor. Examples are the grants to the charity Impact for a floating hospital in Bangladesh which has already helped to treat more than 115,000 patients. The same charity received funding for a large disability prevention programme, which has already cut maternal and child mortality by more than 28 per cent and 48 per cent respectively in the areas where it has been piloted. Grants to Oxfam have helped improve education for 10,000 children in Zambia and in the arid north east of Brazil will, among other benefits, provide 4,500 water tanks.
</p>

<a name="60321-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>From previous correspondence with BOND, the consortium representing 285 development charities in this country, it appeared that the noble Viscount was concerned about some of the grants that had been made overseas and of which apparently the <i>Daily Mail</i> and a number of other sections of the media had been very critical. Perhaps he has dropped those particular concerns at this stage. As the noble Viscount now nods that he has not, let me touch on them. Some of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_226"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 226</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

grants made have excited the interest of xenophobic subsections of the British press. This is an indictment of the press concerned, rather than the lottery fund or the overseas charities. An example of this unfortunate tendency is the criticism of a grant of &#163;295,000, which was a well-designed development project aimed at promoting secure livelihoods in Peru. A small part of the project, amounting to less than &#163;2,000, concerned the breeding of guinea pigs, which are a staple food in the region and was the basis of much unfounded alarm by the <i>Daily Mail</i> about the entire project. It would be sad if the lottery fund were to be intimidated in its grant-giving by the fear that parts of the media might launch misguided campaigns criticising its carefully considered decisions.
</p>

<a name="60321-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>The noble Viscount asked questions about the programme and the moneys allocated by the Big Lottery Fund in relation to international grants. Its position is made perfectly clear in the briefing that it has produced for this Committee, where it is set out clearly why it wished to support international projects. It undertook public consultation in June 2004, showing a sizeable majority of at least 75 per cent of the public in favour of supporting international programmes. This support and the concern of the public for the developing world is also shown by the Charities Aid Foundation&#039;s latest statistics that overseas causes are in the top three of causes supported by voluntary donations over the past two years, amounting in all to about 13 per cent of individual giving.
</p>

<a name="60321-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>Taking the lower figure of 13 per cent and relating it to the &#163;600 million to be spent annually by the Big Lottery Fund on the voluntary and community sectors, it would seem that the allocation to international grants should be in the order of &#163;78 million each year, rather than the &#163;24 million a year over three years as is presently planned. In practice, therefore, the fund will be spending a little less than one-third of the amount that the public could reasonably expect to be spent on projects outside the UK.
</p>

<a name="60321-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>I think that the noble Viscount asked the Minister about the proposed expenditure on the international programme. Certainly it is clear from the press release put out by the Big Lottery Fund&#039;s board that over the next three years it is intending to spend &#163;60,000 on development and similar projects overseas and &#163;12 million on tsunami-type projects. Will the Government use the powers that they have to instruct the fund&#039;s board to increase its allocation to overseas development charities to an amount proportionate to the support that the public gives to such causes? I suggest that that would be fair and equitable.
</p>

<a name="60321-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>Finally, I was pleased to note that the noble Viscount said that his party supported overseas projects. If the problem is that he cannot find out exactly what overseas projects are supported by the Big Lottery Fund from the information given, it seems to me that all that is required is for the fund to be more careful in producing its reports. Certainly there can be no basis whatever for requiring a report to be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_227"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 227</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

produced for every single overseas project, when there is no such requirement for projects which take place in the United Kingdom.

<a name="60321-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   We are all grateful to hear the words of the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, who has tremendous experience in this area. As we conclude this Committee stage, we are reminded that charity may well begin at home but it does not end there.
</p>

<a name="60321-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>Frankly, I cannot weigh up this amendment. On the one hand, I say to myself that it will do no harm as it is transparent and so on, but, on the other, I ask myself whether it is there to put the board off having an international programme, with the board saying, &quot;Oh, we had better not do these international things. They will have to go in a special place in the annual report and that might upset people&quot;, and so on. In terms of accountability in producing an annual report and accounts, I should have thought that, in any event, if the international programme was of a material size, that would require something to be said about it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="60321-25_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   I tabled this amendment because the information was not in the record of the Community Fund. That is my point. It has nothing to do with whether one is for or against the grant programme; it is simply that one cannot find the information. The noble Lord should not read a whole load of things into the amendment which are not there and which I did not mention when I moved it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="60321-25_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   The noble Viscount mentioned that he wanted something to be put in that was not there. I am saying that I cannot weigh it up. If I was preparing the report and there was a substantial international programme, frankly I would brag about it. I suspect that having an international programme would be popular with the ticket-buyers. Of course, some ticket-buyers would not like it but many would.
</p>

<a name="60321-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>I do not know how prescriptive the Minister would want to be on an annual report but, if the international programme is significant, and a body is spending the kind of money that is to be spent here, I would expect there to be a significant paragraph and indeed financial information to set that out. However, it proves that lottery expenditure is a little like beauty: the benefit of it lies in the mind of the beholder. As we are concluding this stage, I thank the noble Viscount, his noble friends and the Minister for the work that has been done so far. We shall return on another occasion to think on these matters.

<a name="60321-25_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   If the amendment were prompted by the failure of any public body to give the noble Viscount accurate information, I forthwith apologise. I assure him that I shall make good that deficiency. I have a list of figures that goes back over the past decade of the amount spent each year, but for me to read anything into the record might appear a little otiose at this stage. I shall write to the noble <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_228"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column 228</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Viscount, as I can to other Members of the Committee, and share the distribution of these grants over the past decade.
</p>

<a name="60321-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>The lottery was set up primarily to benefit projects within the UK, but when the Community Fund was set up following the National Lottery etc Act in 1993, the then Conservative government decided that the fund should also be able to support UK charities working overseas. They are responsible for the use of this money. All credit to the Government on that occasion for the action that they took and all credit to the charities for the way in which they exploited those opportunities. The noble Lord, Lord Joffe, testified to the excellent effect that they have had on projects abroad. Of course, there have been one or two mishaps; there always are with projects abroad that involve communities that are less developed than our own.
</p>

<a name="60321-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>I can reinforce the point made so ably by the noble Lord, Lord Joffe&#151;I cannot match his eloquence, but I can supplement his figures. In the famous Cusichaca project, where the popular press suggested that a grant of &#163;295,000 had gone to waste among the poorest in Peru, in fact, of the &#163;295,000, &#163;2,000 was spent on the guinea pigs project which failed; the rest went to a community in very great need. That did not detract from that point made by the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, about the distortions that occur in some of the popular press.
</p>

<a name="60321-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>The present funding programme operates at about &#163;20 million a year. I can tell the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, that it is intended that &#163;60 million should be spent over three years and that is the broad basis of the sums. I could go into considerable depth on the figures, but I do not think I need to. The contributors to the debate have reassured the Committee&#151;and through the Committee, the country&#151;that these initiatives are enormously beneficial. Of course, they are backed by a generous-spirited British public. If anyone for one moment suggests that the British public are not generous-spirited with regard to projects abroad, I refer them to the response of the British people to the tsunami disaster not so long ago. That was testimony to the fact that people have a concern for such issues. Such projects are planned in very different terms from responses to disasters, although help was given on that occasion too.
</p>

<a name="60321-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, sought to table a probing amendment. It solicited a magnificent response from all parts of the Committee to which I can add little, but I will add the figures and circulate them to all Members of the Committee.

In addition, on the basis of accuracy I should indicate to the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, that the &#163;60 million is also supplemented by &#163;12 million, which will be available specifically for projects to help communities affected by the tsunami.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_1"></a>
<a name="60321-26_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I hope that this is the equivalent of asking a question on the Motion that the Committee be resumed. We had an announcement yesterday that there are to be government amendments to this Bill, changing proceedings from a standard Moses Room technical debate into something which is politically highly charged. My noble friend Lord Strathclyde has asked whether the Bill is to be recommitted to allow a proper discussion. I suggest that it should be dealt with on the Floor of the House, but certainly the amendments need to be considered in a Committee stage. No answer was given to my noble friend at the time and I would be grateful for a response now saying whether that is what is to be proposed.

<a name="60321-26_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising an important issue. The procedure that I propose to adopt is that we should have our Committee stage on Thursday, which will give us an opportunity to discuss the amendments already before the Committee that raise the whole question of funding issues, enabling us to discuss here in the Moses Room the matters about which noble Lords are very concerned. I then propose to bring forward amendments on Report, but to point out that noble Lords should view that as a Committee procedure; that is, there will be an opportunity on that particular set of amendments&#151;whatever they look like, for I do not yet know&#151;to have a proper and full debate.
</p>

<a name="60321-26_para6"></a>

in time for us to discuss it at Third Reading. We treated that occasion as much more of a debating opportunity in order to allow the issue to be debated properly.
</p>

<a name="60321-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_2"></a>The reason why I seek to propose this procedure on Thursday is that that will ensure that we do not delay the Bill, while enabling us to discuss fully these particular issues.

The relevant amendments that we tabled last week come very close to the end of the Bill. Given that the Government will be producing their amendments on the matter only on Report, it may be necessary to defer the vote until Third Reading.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_4"></a>
<a name="60321-26_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   Subject to our discussions with the usual channels, I would be perfectly happy with that procedure. I would not wish noble Lords to feel that time had prevented them from having the quality and type of debate that they require on these issues. Again, a similar procedure was used in the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill. I say &quot;procedure&quot;, but I just did it&#151;I am not sure that I was following procedure. I am sure that we could have a discussion through the usual channels before Thursday; perhaps on Thursday I could put forward a formal proposition, which I will have discussed with the usual channels beforehand and with which noble Lords will feel comfortable. We have absolutely no desire other than to have a proper debate on these issues, as they are relevant and important to us all. I simply think that we can probably find a way of doing that without disrupting the procedure of this Bill while enabling us to have a good discussion, which will also inform the Government&#039;s ability to bring forward amendments.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_5"></a>
<a name="60321-26_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I just want to be absolutely clear about this. On Thursday, will we or will we not be discussing the Liberal amendments?

<a name="60321-26_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I anticipate that we will be discussing the Liberal amendments as per usual in the Committee process in this Room.

<p><a name="gc_st_10"></a>
<a name="60321-27_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Greaves </b>   moved Amendment No. 61:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_0"></a>Page 11, line 27, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_amdt_0"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   Any elector may at any time make an individual claim to be included in the register of electors or provide any necessary information to the registration officer.

<br>
(   )   In particular, where a form is being provided to one person in a household for the purpose of listing all the persons entitled to be registered at that address, any other person entitled to be registered at that address may separately provide any personal identifier in a manner that remains confidential.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_11"></a>The noble Lord said: After that little bit of excitement, we are back to the grindstone and to ploughing our way through the Bill. We are still on personal identifiers. In moving Amendment No. 61, I shall speak also to the other five amendments in the group in my name. This is a mixed bag of amendments and I wondered whether to degroup them all, but I thought that, even though they are about different things, we might make quicker progress if we deal with them all together. We will see.
</p>

<a name="60321-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_4"></a>Amendment No. 61 goes back to the interesting and, I think, unresolved question of the relationship between household registration and individual registration, particularly when having to provide personal identifiers. The first of my suggested subsections states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_1"></a>&quot;Any elector may at any time make an individual claim to be included in the register of electors&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_5"></a>That is the case as regards the rolling register. However, on the annual canvass and the compilation of the definitive register each year, the registration is by household. The household form goes out and is returned by a person in the household&#151;the occupier, the head of household or whomever. In a traditional household that person may be fairly identifiable as being one or two people, but in houses of multiple occupation and similar places it is not at all clear who that person is. It might be the landlord, if the landlord is on the premises. But, if no person exercises supervisory roles, it might be whoever picks the form up or whoever throws it away. The provision therefore states that an individual has the right to make an individual registration to ensure that he is on the register even if that is at the time of the annual canvass.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60321-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_6"></a>The second provision says that a person has the right, in effect, not to hand over details of his personal identifiers to a person sending in a common registration from a household, particularly in what might be multi-household places&#151;houses in multiple occupation, lots of lodging rooms and so on. People may have very good reasons for not wanting to hand over personal details to the person who just happens to be the person sending the form in. At the moment we are talking about date of birth and a personal signature as the personal identifiers. It could be other things as well. We do not know what other things the Government might bring forward under the provisions for adding further personal identifiers. We understand that at the moment it will not be national insurance numbers.
</p>

<a name="60321-27_spmin0"></a><b>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</b>  I am sorry that we have to interrupt proceedings so early on. A Division is called. We will reassemble at 3.50 pm.
</p>

<a name="60321-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_7"></a>[<i>The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 3.40 to 3.50 pm</i>.]
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_13"></a>
<a name="60321-27_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   The point that I was making was that the act of registering from a household may compromise the confidentiality of the personal identifiers on the part of individuals, when they may wish to keep them confidential. Once personal identifiers are provided, they are to be kept confidential and they cannot be supplied to other people by the registration officer except under special circumstances, which are set out. They are regarded as confidential, yet that confidentiality may be compromised at the beginning.
</p>

<a name="60321-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_8"></a>If a person in a large household, particularly an HMO, has access to signatures, dates of birth and any other identifiers that may be used, and is able to make a record of those before sending them in, that severely compromises the use of those personal identifiers to stop postal voting fraud. It is perfectly easy for them to tick the box on the form saying that those people have applied for a postal vote, to apply for a postal vote on their behalf or even, if postal votes are applied for by the elector concerned, to intercept those postal ballots when they arrive. If people have copies of signatures and know the dates of birth, it would make it very easy for them to turn their HMO into a vote factory. This is an important question about registration under personal identifiers, and the amendment probes how the Government see this operating to maintain confidentiality and security.
</p>

<a name="60321-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_9"></a>Amendment No. 69 is much simpler. It tries to ensure that, instead of just the date of birth, the commonly accepted date of birth could be accepted. A remarkable number of people living in this country who are entitled to vote do not know their actual date of birth because they were born in places where birth certificates and registration as we know them here did not exist, and in some places still do not exist. My wife teaches classes of people from the south Asian subcontinent, a remarkable proportion of whom put their date of birth as 1 January in the nearest year that they can guess they were born in. I want to be clear that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC75"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC75</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

they will not be deprived of a vote because they have a putative date of birth and not necessarily the actual one.
</p>

<a name="60321-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_10"></a>Amendment No. 71 probes what other identifiers, apart from date of birth and signature, the Government are thinking of. It asks why there is specific provision that those other identifiers might be dispensed with. It is really to find out what all this means; it is all a fog to me.
</p>

<a name="60321-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_11"></a>Amendment No. 72 is perhaps more substantively important. At the moment, Clause 14(9) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_2"></a>&quot;A registration officer may disclose the information obtained as mentioned in subsection (8)&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_12"></a>meaning personal identifiers, in various other circumstances. One of those, in paragraph (c), is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_3"></a>&quot;any person exercising functions in relation to the preparation or conduct of legal proceedings under the Representation of the People Acts&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_13"></a>I do not understand what that means. I specifically want to ask whether it applies to people carrying out functions,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_4"></a>&quot;in relation to the preparation or conduct of legal proceedings&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_14"></a>in order to challenge elections. Does it apply only to people acting in an official capacity, or would it apply to a candidate, an agent or person whom they have engaged in order to bring a petition to overturn an election at an election court? If it does, it seems that it drives a cart and horses through confidentiality. If it does not, it is difficult to know how those seeking to prove an election fraudulent can so do if they do not have access to that information. It may be that some sort of privileged access to the information could be arranged on a confidential basis. I do not understand how it would work but, having been involved in looking at fraudulent elections, I know how important it is that signatures, in particular, can be looked at and checked; they are crucial to showing&#151;or suggesting&#151;that an election has not been carried out fairly. This is an important amendment and an important question for the Minister.
</p>

<a name="60321-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_15"></a>Finally, I have an objection to &quot;catch-all&quot; phrases. The fourth category of people who may get this information are, under paragraph (d),


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_5"></a>&quot;such other persons for such other purposes as may be prescribed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_16"></a>Can the Minister at least tell us what sort of &quot;such other persons&quot; and &quot;such other purposes&quot; the Government think could be prescribed to get the detailed confidential information on personal identifiers?
</p>

<a name="60321-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_17"></a>The final amendment in this group, Amendment No. 84, is a bit further along in the Bill and is really a separate issue. It is an attempt to probe, where pilots are put forward by a local authority, what sort of areas might be appropriate for pilots, and whether a local authority that is not an electoral registration authority should be able to put forward a pilot&#151;for example, a county council or, as is suggested, the GLA. Should they be able to put forward a pilot where all the donkey work, administration and difficulties would be carried by, respectively, the district council or a London borough? Some of those district councils or boroughs <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC76"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC76</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

may not feel competent to do it and may have other priorities for elections, such as getting their registers in good order. Is it sensible for a county council, for example, to be able to impose this on a district without the district being willing to do it, or is it the Government&#039;s intention that districts under these circumstances would effectively have a veto? If they do not, it could lead to all sorts of difficulties at local level, with people having pilots which they do not want and cannot do. I beg to move.

<p><a name="gc_st_14"></a>
<a name="60321-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Tyler: </b>   I strongly support Amendment No. 61, moved by my noble friend Lord Greaves. We are now in an important part of the Bill&#151;Part 3&#151;with a set of anti-fraud measures that the public are looking to us to provide, as all Members of the Committee will agree. The integrity and accuracy of the register is obviously absolutely critical to this. It may seem that these reforms to make the registration process more secure and effective are not that urgent. However, I believe that they could be even more urgent than they at first appear. We may be too late for this year&#039;s local authority elections, but who knows what elections may be on the immediate horizon?
<a name="gc_time_0"></a>

</p>

<a name="60321-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_18"></a>I notice, as the Minister may have noticed, that yesterday a Minister from the Department for Constitutional Affairs told the other place:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_6"></a>&quot;As for the reform of the House of Lords, he will wish to know that we look forward to proceeding with change there very speedily indeed&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 20/3/06; col. 27.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_19"></a>The phrase &quot;very speedily indeed&quot; is, perhaps, not one that we usually expect to hear from Ministers but, in the current circumstances, perhaps that is a very heavy hint. Clearly, the Government at last recognise that it is urgent to disentangle membership of this House of Parliament from the honours system. That must mean that at least a majority of Members are elected. The sooner it becomes evident to the public that membership of the legislature must be earned with hundreds of thousands of votes, rather than bought with hundreds of thousands of pounds, the sooner all suspicions of corruption will be dispelled. To speed the process, I invite Ministers to re-examine the draft Second Chamber of Parliament Bill, which I presented last year with the support&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_15"></a>
<a name="60321-28_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I intervene to draw attention to the fact that that is absolutely nothing to do with Amendment No.  61. I understand that we may possibly be wandering down these roads on Thursday, but can we delay that debate until then? The amendment is about whether an individual can have an individual registration when there is a group registration. Carefully, I ask the noble Lord whether he might return to the subject.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_16"></a>
<a name="60321-28_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Tyler: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness. I think that it is extremely important that the register should be as accurate and respected as we can make it for all possible elections in the near future. I am simply <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC77"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC77</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

drawing to the Committee&#039;s attention the fact that such elections may be rather earlier than we anticipated just a few days ago.
</p>

<a name="60321-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_20"></a>As my noble friend said, Amendment No. 61 deals with the important relationship between individual and household registration. The principle of individual rights and responsibilities in our electoral arrangements ever since the Great Reform Bill of 1832 has been critical. In any area of doubt, we have surely long since abolished the concept of household suffrage. Therefore, in principle, the preference must always be given to safeguarding the position of individuals. That is what the amendment is intended to do.
</p>

<a name="60321-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_21"></a>Both proposed new subsections of the amendment are extremely important, but the second is especially important. In addition to the reasons already advanced by my noble friend Lord Greaves, I draw attention to the difficulty that could occur if individuals feel that confidential information, which they are entitled to expect to remain confidential, is provided to a third person. That may discourage individuals from registering to vote. I am sure that the Minister would agree that one of our purposes in the Bill is to try to encourage more people to register. In those circumstances, I strongly support Amendment No. 61 and hope that other Members of the Committee will do so as well.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_17"></a>
<a name="60321-28_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I happily support Amendment No. 61. It is an extremely sensible amendment, especially if we are to continue with household registration. We have already discussed the difficulty of household registration for houses in multiple occupation. I hope that, by the end of our discussion on the Bill, we will have identified a way to deal with individual registration. The amendment would fit usefully with that. I also support Amendment No. 69, because that probably makes sense in terms of how many people now see themselves or hold their information. Within the constraints of preventing fraud, we must make it easy for people to produce their date of birth. I am relatively unconcerned about Amendment No. 72; I am more concerned with Amendments Nos. 71 and 73, which I support.
</p>

<a name="60321-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_22"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will forgive me if I misheard him, but I thought that, in speaking to Amendment No. 84, he was addressing parts and parcels of areas voting. I listened to him carefully, but Amendment No. 84 is about an electoral registration authority. I am not sure that he addressed that. If I was asleep momentarily, I apologise, but I think that he was speaking to a different amendment.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_18"></a>
<a name="60321-28_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I add only that I entirely agree with what has been said by both my noble friends in relation to Amendment No. 61, which seems to me to concern a matter of real importance.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_19"></a>
<a name="60321-28_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   I raise an issue that came up during a conversation the other night at dinner. We were discussing this issue and someone mentioned the fact that the Bill provides that information about one&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC78"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC78</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

personal identifier and date of birth can be checked by the relevant person by applying to the CORE system; they would apply to CORE to see the information that was being held on the central register. Let us suppose that I am a corrupt official working in a post office and I see a chequebook in a pile&#151;we all know what a chequebook in an envelope looks like. I put the chequebook in my pocket, take it home, open it and see, for example, the name David Brown at the bottom of the cheques. Could I then assume the identity of Mr David Brown, apply to CORE for my personal identifier, which had been registered in the national registration system, take the signature, copy it on a cheque, submit it to the bank and make a payment? I need say no more. Is not that an opportunity? I use this amendment to raise the matter because I see that it deals with the issue of what &quot;remains confidential&quot; during the process of registration.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_20"></a>
<a name="60321-28_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am sorry that I was not at dinner with the noble Lord, as we could have discussed the matter. I shall try to deal with that point first. When we discussed how CORE would work we said that the only people who would be entitled to access it would be those entitled to access the electoral register. We discussed the potential that in the future an individual might be able to amend their own details on CORE but that they would have to have some form of PIN or other kind of identifier to allow them to access the system, which would be part of the electoral registration system. We would seek to ensure that what the noble Lord has identified could not happen.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_21"></a>
<a name="60321-28_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   A PIN in itself suggests that there will be another number in circulation in relation to every person who registers nationally, or there would be a publicly available PIN which anyone could use. Therefore, the person who assumed the identity of David Brown might have access to it.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_22"></a>
<a name="60321-28_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I hesitate to have debates about CORE because we can do so on Report. When we discussed this issue previously, we said that there was a possibility that would have to be looked at precisely in the light of what my noble friend is saying&#151;namely, how do you develop a secure system that might enable people to alter their own details in CORE? We talked about bank systems. I used a PIN only as an example. One would have to ensure that it was secure to prevent people from doing what my noble friend described. The provision is but yet a twinkle in our eye in our thinking on CORE, but I felt that it was right to discuss on the first day of Committee the potential and possibilities of CORE. Of course, security would need to be paramount in that regard.
</p>

<a name="60321-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_23"></a>I turn to the amendments. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, for her comments, not because, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, I want to prevent any debate&#151;far from it, which is why I did not intervene. I am very conscious that, as we discussed earlier, noble Lords will want to range widely across a whole raft of issues and to make their points from many different perspectives. However, we would do <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC79"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC79</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

ourselves a greater service if we had a bigger debate on Thursday on the amendments that noble Lords have tabled. Therefore, I hope that the noble Lord will not mind when I say that I support the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, on the way in which we conduct Committee.
</p>

<a name="60321-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_24"></a>Noble Lords from across the Committee have expressed support for Amendment No. 61. We certainly see the benefits of the approach. We are proposing at this stage to test whether there is any problem with this working in practice by incorporating it into other pilot schemes that are part of the Bill. If noble Lords want me to consider the matter further, I am very happy to do so. The Bill&#039;s provisions are wide enough for us to do that, so we will not have to amend the Bill in any way. We agree in principle with the proposal, but, as with anything else, our preference is to test it to make sure that it works properly. I can say that we will incorporate it into the pilots&#151;I hope that that addresses the concerns that the noble Lord has raised.
</p>

<a name="60321-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_25"></a>On Amendment No. 69, which the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, also supported, it is important that the Bill&#039;s provisions do not disfranchise those who do not have a birth certificate, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said. The Bill as it stands does not specify that, for example, a person&#039;s date of birth must match that on their birth certificate&#151;of course, as the noble Lord knows, not all electors will have a birth certificate. The person would be required to state their date of birth and we would expect some kind of evidence, if they did not have a birth certificate, to support the information that they had given. There is no need to amend the Bill. I think that the noble Lord will find that, since 2002, similar provisions have been operating in Northern Ireland very successfully. I think that we have addressed the issue. The legislation does not prevent somebody from using a detail about their date of birth or, as the noble Lord described, from choosing the beginning of a particular year, if they use that more commonly. That, too, will be covered by the Bill. There is no need to amend on that basis.
</p>

<a name="60321-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_26"></a>On Amendment No. 71, we do not have specific identifiers, but in particular circumstances the mother&#039;s maiden name, for example, might be added. We have to have the ability to take that requirement out because not everybody will have that information. The Bill is drafted in this way to ensure that we do not disfranchise people who cannot provide a particular piece of personal identification. We need to be able to add other identifiers where appropriate and to recognise that some of those identifiers may not be available to people. I hope that that addresses the point that the noble Lord raised.
</p>

<a name="60321-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_27"></a>Amendment No. 72 would delete the provision that will enable us to ensure that those undertaking legal proceedings in relation to elections have access to what we think could be important evidence.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60321-29.htm"/>






<p><a name="gc_st_23"></a>
<a name="60321-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I should have explained this. The only reason why the amendment would delete the provision <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC80"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC80</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

was to enable me to probe what the provision actually means. I am not proposing that it be deleted; I am trying to find out what it means.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_24"></a>
<a name="60321-29_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I completely recognise that. I was merely saying that, if it was deleted, something that we think quite important in legal proceedings would be taken away. The noble Lord asked a very good question about those preparing to question the validity of an election. I do not think that that matter is particularly clear, so I will write to him and copy the letter to the Committee after checking legal advice. The noble Lord raises a valid point, for which I am grateful. I do not think that he was suggesting through his amendment that we should not have the ability to do what the provision would allow us to do; I recognise that, as he said, he was probing to ensure that the provision will be used appropriately. I will get him the answer to his question, as I do not have the right legal advice here at the moment to be absolutely clear about it.
</p>

<a name="60321-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_28"></a>Amendment No. 73 would delete the words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_7"></a>&quot;such other persons for such other purposes as may be prescribed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_29"></a>That paragraph would allow us to make specific provision in secondary legislation for circumstances where we think it appropriate to disclose personal identifier information but which are not provided for in paragraphs (a) to (c) of new Section 13E(9). One example would be to deal with a situation where, at the opening of postal ballots, a returning officer decided that a ballot should not be counted perhaps due to a mismatch of personal identifiers on the declaration and on the file. In those circumstances, we think that candidates or agents should be permitted to see the personal identifiers in order to be satisfied that the returning officer&#039;s decision was correct. The provision was considered by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which suggested that it be amended to relate solely to &quot;electoral purposes&quot;. I am certainly looking at making that change, as the committee raises an important point. I hope that that explains the position behind that provision.
</p>

<a name="60321-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_30"></a>On Amendment No. 84, as the noble Baroness said, the electoral registration authority is key. At the moment, we have provision for a county council, a district council, a London borough council or the GLA to make an application. It is quite legitimate to ask why the GLA should be permitted to apply to conduct a registration pilot. We think that you could gain quite a lot from having a pilot spanning an area perhaps as large as the one that the GLA covers to see how the system of personal identifiers would work. I should add that those sorts of pilots are not in our plans. We want to conduct local level pilots to be in a position to decide on national roll-out in 2008. We wanted to take the flexibility in the legislation so that options are available should we decide that it might be better to look across. We would not agree to such a pilot without extensive consultation with whichever authority or authorities were responsible for the registration system in the area. That reflects the importance that we have placed on gaining local <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC81"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC81</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

political support for pilots generally. I hope that that answers what the noble Lord was seeking in his amendment and that he will be happy to withdraw it.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_31"></a>I am grateful for what the Minister said, but I would have liked it to have been stronger. If in a registration authority both the registration officer and the local authority feel strongly that they are not capable of conducting a pilot, and if perhaps two or three London boroughs thought that they could not cope with it, it would be wrong to impose it. Let us take a hypothetical situation where a highly competent authority such as Kensington and Chelsea might say that it could not handle a pilot because it was dealing with HMO problems, getting the register in order, and the millions of languages that the noble Baroness was talking about last week. I notice, for the benefit of the tape, as they say, that the Minister is agreeing with me&#151;

<p><a name="gc_st_26"></a>
<a name="60321-29_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The purpose of the provision was simply to give the flexibility so that, if it was felt important to have a broader pilot, we would not be restricted by not having thought about that and put it in the Bill. I agree wholeheartedly with the noble Lord; we would not seek to impose it. It would defeat the object, in a way.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_32"></a>I was interested in what the Minister said about Amendment No. 73, and I look forward to seeing what amendments she might bring forward on the issue. The amendment relates to the legal question. At the moment, if you go to the town hall and inspect those things that you are allowed to inspect, such as the marked register, you are just going as an ordinary person. It might be that, in relation to something as sensitive as identifiers, those people who had the right to see them, under the limited circumstances of a postal vote count or even a normal election count if questions were raised, would have that right&#151;which does not apply to everyone concerned but would apply perhaps to candidates and agents&#151;only as part of pursuing an inquiry into an election that they thought had been rigged. One way forward might be to look at giving those people those rights, perhaps under some terms of confidentiality such as exist if you go to a count. We need to think about this carefully, so that there is a way through that allows people to investigate potentially fraudulent elections but does not just leave <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC82"></a>

it open to all and sundry to look at these things, which would breach the whole idea of the confidentiality of the identifiers.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_33"></a>I was very happy with the answer on Amendments Nos. 71 and 69. On Amendment No. 61, I was not sure whether the Minister was saying that this would all be determined in the way that the pilots were carried out, or whether she was suggesting that she might be looking at some changes to the Bill. I wonder whether she could answer that.

We want to test this out because without any changes, even those that look simple and straightforward, we need to check that nothing is going to happen that we were not expecting. I was adding that into the pilots as something that we would plan to test out, in the best sense, but we do not need to make any changes to the Bill to do so.

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_8"></a>After Clause 13, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_amdt_1"></a><br>
&quot;PROVISIONAL REGISTRATION

<br>
(1)   This section applies where personal identifiers are required for inclusion on a register.


<br>
(2)   If an application is made for a person to appear on a register which would be accepted but for the failure to provide one or more personal identifiers, that person shall be placed on a provisional register.


<br>
(3)   The ERO shall write to each person on the provisional register and may contact them in any other ways to ask them to provide the personal identifiers that have not been provided.


<br>
(4)   The provisional registers shall be made available to the persons and bodies that are entitled to receive copies of the full register.


<br>
(5)   No person may vote in any election by virtue only of inclusion on the provisional register.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_31"></a>The noble Lord said: This is another important issue of principle, which affects personal identifiers in relation to household registration. It is linked to what we have been talking about, but it is a separate matter. The new clause would introduce provisional registration and probes what would happen under a system of registration which requires personal identifiers. A form could come back from the household canvass with, say, six people on it, but three of those people might not have the full information for personal identifiers. That seems highly likely to happen under the new system, particularly if the form includes electors who are not living at home because they are on holiday, students or whatever. With the best will in the world, people will fill the form in but they will forget that they need to get the extra <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC83"></a>

information and will just send it back. Such a situation is even more likely to arise in the circumstances that we have been talking about in relation to HMOs, where people may well refuse to give that information. Nevertheless, the person sending the form back will feel duty bound to state everyone who lives there, which they have to do by law.
</p>

<a name="60321-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_37"></a>There will be a problem. We do not know how many people will be involved&#151;perhaps 1 per cent, 5 per cent or more in different areas&#151;but there will be a lot who, under the terms of electoral law, will apply to be on the electoral register but will not provide one or more personal identifiers that they should provide. That circumstance should be on public record. These people want to be electors. Political parties, which&#151;we noted last week&#151;were originally set up as registration associations, should be able to go to these people to persuade them to provide the extra information. Even if they do not, there should be a formal system in which these people are written to and contacted, and from whom this information is sought. Otherwise, there will be quite a lot of people who ought to be registered under the system but are not.
</p>

<a name="60321-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_38"></a>There is a problem here, which, in practice, will happen. This is one way to solve it. I am sure that the Government will tell me that this is not the right way and that they have another way to solve it. But something like this needs to happen. The process needs to be formal, or a lot of people will risk not being registered. It is a very important issue. I beg to move.

<a name="60321-30_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I will be brief. We think that the amendment is a good idea. It builds on aspects of Clause 9. We intend to test this as part of the pilot scheme, which the Bill&#039;s existing provisions allow us to do. If the noble Lord feels strongly that this should be in the Bill, I am very happy to consider it before Report.

Given that we may not get many opportunities when the pilot experience is available to us&#151;this might be a classic case&#151;will we have to go back to primary legislation to include something as important as this? This is an important issue and I hope that the Minister will be able to give us guidance.

&quot;(2A)   In relation to England and Wales and Scotland&#151;

<br>
(a)   in respect of any person wishing to be included in an absent voters list, personal identifiers in accordance with subsection (2) must be provided to the registration officer either at registration or subsequently in relation to an absent vote application,


<br>
(b)   in respect of any person wishing to vote in person, personal identifiers in accordance with subsection (2) may be provided to a registration officer, but will not be required to be provided unless the Secretary of State by order so provides.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_37"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 74 to 78. I will split them into two sections: Amendments Nos. 74 to 76, which provide for the introduction of a personal identifier adoption scheme; and Amendments Nos. 77 and 78, which provide for personal identifier individual registration schemes.
</p>

<a name="60321-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_44"></a>Let me explain where I am coming from on all this. I am totally opposed to the pilots; I believe that the Bill is, in the main, unnecessary. However, there is a real problem, repeatedly identified by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, which I accept we have to deal with. My view is that the whole principle of national roll-out is unnecessary, and a burden, nationally, on the elector. That is my starting position.
</p>

<a name="60321-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_45"></a>The pilots set the background to my amendments. I am opposed to them, first, because the Electoral Commission, the Electoral Reform Society, Members of Parliament, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives have all expressed opposition to them. I completely agree with those people, who are a fairly mixed bag&#151;I am part of that bag, by the way. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC85"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC85</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Secondly, voluntary arrangements will attract all the wrong applicants, for the reasons that we set out the other day. Some might seek to manipulate registration downwards, and others might seek to manipulate it up, with a view to impressing whomever they wish. Thirdly, once we get into this pilots rut, national roll-out is inevitable. As I am opposed to national roll-out, I am therefore opposed to the pilots.
</p>

<a name="60321-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_46"></a>I am also concerned about the collapse in the vote. I take as my text the Electoral Commission research report of September 2005, which I hope everyone has read. It sets out the groups that will be penalised under a system of national roll-out: first, deprived groups in areas of deprivation; secondly, people living in metropolitan areas; thirdly, unemployed groups; fourthly, certain housing tenancy groups; and, finally, people who live in houses in multiple occupation. I do not want to read out all these sections, but I hope, just for the record&#151;in case there are people who read our proceedings&#151;that people have read paragraphs 2.34, 2.37, 2.42, 2.44, 2.45, 2.48, 2.51 and 2.54. Academics and others reading this debate should also read that very important document from the Electoral Commission, which shows that there will be a drop in registration in many parts of the United Kingdom arising from the introduction of national roll-out registration on the basis that is being advocated.

</p>

<a name="60321-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_47"></a>I am also concerned about the pilots, because the EROs are worried about what they are doing. Many of them believe that a system based on signatures, unless very closely scrutinised in any particular area, is beyond their resources&#151;even the resources that are to be made available to them. Those are my reasons.
</p>

<a name="60321-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_48"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has always impressed me with his argument, because he has been very persistent on this issue. I recognise that there is a real problem. I had been only briefly in this House and was sitting at the Long Table having dinner when we had a conversation in which he first drew it to my attention. There is a problem.
</p>

<a name="60321-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_49"></a>At first glimpse, my amendments do not appear very palatable. However, they bear close scrutiny because, although they raise issues&#151;to be absolutely blunt&#151;of voting in ethnic minority communities, the reality is that the agenda with which we are dealing here today arises from problems that exist in very few parts of the United Kingdom, essentially in areas where there are substantial ethnic minority populations. I do not want to get into issues of race, but I think that I should place that on the record because that is the conversation that is going on behind the scenes when we discuss this issue. There is essentially a problem in particular areas. The question is: how do we deal with that problem in those few areas without getting into discussions about ethnicity?
</p>

<a name="60321-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_50"></a>My amendments deal with the problem, because they avoid the state saying: &quot;You have a problem. We are going to resolve it. We will sort out your problem&quot;. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC86"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC86</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

They avoid the state being identified as the agency to address the problem in an area where there is a substantial ethnic minority population. My amendments place a responsibility on the local authority that has a problem with corruption of the electorate to say: &quot;We have a problem. We want to sort it out. We do not have the power to sort out the problem locally. We need that power. We want a scheme and you, the state, need to confirm whatever arrangements we decide on for ourselves&quot;. So I am turning it away from the state saying to a community, &quot;Sort out the problem&quot;, to the local community saying, &quot;We want to sort out the problem ourselves and we want you, the state, to give us the power to do so&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60321-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_51"></a>When I have discussed my amendments outside the Committee, it has been put to me that, whatever happens, we may find ourselves discussing ethnicity in particular areas. I keep coming back to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, because I know that he lives in one of the areas where there is a problem of that nature that he has been trying to address for several years. He will correct me if I am wrong, because he may be the only Member in this Room today who has first-hand experience of the problem.
</p>

<a name="60321-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_52"></a>There is a debate in those communities. It is not necessarily a debate between the communities; rather, it is one within the ethnic minority community itself. These are intra-community debates. One part of the community is losing out to another part because within it are people representing all the political parties. So within ethnic minority communities in parts of the United Kingdom there are debates on how to resolve the problem whereby one side of the community objects to the other side being engaged in these practices.
</p>

<a name="60321-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_53"></a>I await an intervention from the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, because, as I have said, I believe that he has great knowledge of these matters and the problem I am referring to.

<a name="60321-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   The noble Lord invites me to intervene and far be it from me to refuse. The reason why I have not spoken much about these matters in Grand Committee is that it is widely recognised that there are problems related to these issues. Although they are not restricted to particular ethnic groups, these problems have been most severe within certain ethnic groups in this country. I did not think it necessary to come to the Committee and explain it all again, because the point is now much more widely understood, not least, for example, because of the Birmingham court case and a number of other instances. Five years ago, people were saying, &quot;We don&#039;t think this is a real problem&quot;. They now accept that it is, even though not many cases come to court. I have not spoken at length, because we should be concentrating on the other issues. Nevertheless, I welcome the noble Lord&#039;s acceptance and <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="gc_st_43"></a>
<a name="60321-31_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   There is also a debate going on in the local newspapers serving these communities, with frequent calls for regulation being made in letters to editors. They are not asking for regulation nationally. Indeed, our whole debate today arises from some court cases in just a few communities and some complaints from representatives of very small groups. Yet we are involved in a national roll-out simply to deal with a problem that arises only in certain small, individual areas. I live in the Lake District in Cumbria. Not for one moment do I believe that there is any corruption of the electoral system in Cumbria. As the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, observed the other day, there may well be cases of people voting in two different places if they have a second home, but if the system is not corrupt in Cumbria, why should everyone have to go into the whole exercise of filling in this form? Everyone has to fill in a form simply to resolve a problem that arises in only a few parts of the United Kingdom.
</p>

<a name="60321-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_54"></a>We are going to spend tens of millions of pounds on this exercise, one that could be done equally well simply by concentrating far fewer resources in just one or two communities where there is a history of manipulation of the vote. Indeed, in my amendments, I think that I have set out the criteria regarding the conditions in which an order would be sought. Perhaps I may explain how my amendments would work.

<a name="60321-31_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. Could I ask him to deal with a particular problem?

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_45"></a>
<a name="60321-31_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   There would never be a majority on the local authority as a result of manipulation.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC88"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC88</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_47"></a>
<a name="60321-31_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   I find that utterly extraordinary. Even in the worst conditions of corruption of the electoral system, it is inconceivable that a local authority could be taken over by a majority of people who had manipulated the local electoral registration system to their benefit. In any case, there would be such a sense of outrage in the local community that those people would not be able to sustain the position for long. Even in the worst case imaginable, I cannot think that that would happen. Again, we should call on the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. Can he imagine his area ever being dominated by a group of people, all of whom had been elected on the basis of a distortion of the electoral system?
</p>

<a name="60321-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_55"></a>I shall go back to explaining how my amendments would work. Under these arrangements, if a local authority realised that it could not deal with a problem of manipulation of the registration system, it would be able to decide whether it needed to have a scheme. Once the authority had decided to have a scheme, that scheme could take one of two forms. The first, scheme A, could be based on what is to be proposed in the pilot&#151;in effect, the scheme being proposed for national roll-out. However, it would apply only to the local area in question. Alternatively, the authority could adopt a lesser scheme. When I originally drew up the amendment, it was based on the Electoral Commission&#039;s transitional arrangements. I call that one scheme B, although it has now been amended&#151;in my view successfully&#151;by my noble friend Lord Elder in his Amendment No. 80.
</p>

<a name="60321-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_56"></a>So the authority would decide to take on the first scheme involving full registration or the lesser system in the second scheme. It would then apply to the Secretary of State for an order to allow it to introduce the scheme. The Secretary of State would have to apply to the Electoral Commission. In turn, while the commission could not determine what was to happen, it could advise the Secretary of State on whether it believed that the scheme being applied for was sufficient to deal with the particular local problem.
</p>

<a name="60321-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_57"></a>The question to ask is this: what would be the resulting benefit for the local community? My view is that, first, local authorities would avoid like the plague introducing a scheme and thus having to make an application for an order. Rather, they would direct into those wards with a particular problem&#151;as I say, nationally there are very few of them&#151;as many resources as possible to try to avoid applying for a scheme. They would do that because they would not want to have to make such an application. To do so would be to recognise that they had failed to deal with the problem internally. Wherever possible, they would avoid applying for an order and they would try to sort out the problem themselves.
</p>

<a name="60321-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_58"></a>Secondly, the very fact that a power existed for a local authority to apply for such an order would generate within those communities where there is a problem a debate about the right way forward and whether it could be dealt with internally, either directly <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC89"></a>

by the community itself or indirectly by the local authority, which then would not have to resort to applying for an order.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_59"></a>Thirdly, the proposal would avoid inconveniencing millions of people and would save even more millions of pounds. There are major public expenditure implications, such as that which I raised with my noble friend before about signatures. We are proposing to spend billions of pounds in making the national identity card system secure. It will cost a lot more than &#163;10 million or &#163;20 million to make the system more secure just to protect the signatures. However, we are going down this route without understanding the cost implications&#151;with CORE, which comes into all this&#151;of introducing a system whose security will be very expensive to maintain.

<a name="60321-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_60"></a>The amendments that I have just talked about basically leave the existing system of national registration intact&#151;with a few amendments such as those in Clause 9 on duties and responsibilities of electoral registration officers&#151;apart from in those areas where there is a particular problem that needs to be addressed. However, Amendments Nos. 77 and 78 take the Electoral Commission&#039;s proposals for a transitional scheme and graft on the back of them the proposals that I have set out in relation to the previous amendments. If I had seen Amendment No. 80 earlier, I would have used that amendment as the background framework on which to graft the amendment for the local authority schemes to be introduced.

<a name="60321-31_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Norton of Louth: </b>   One fundamental problem strikes me as a result of the exchange with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. On paper, the provisions look fine, but the problem is the triggering mechanism. On the first day of Committee when we were talking about the prospect of fraud in local elections, the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, got to his feet and asked where the evidence was. That is the fundamental problem with this group of amendments. Where will the evidence come from? The noble Lord is proposing that the local authority should trigger this and put in the application. But the local authority is the beneficiary of the existing arrangements, so I cannot quite see that it would necessarily be that keen&#151;apart from the reasons that he touched on&#151;and I would have thought that it would try to hide the problem rather than to clean up its act. I am not sure that there is the right triggering mechanism to bring this into effect. There are other problems, but that is a fundamental problem with what the noble Lord is proposing.

the noble Lord could remain seated when he speaks. It seems to me that for him to have to stand up is a quite unnecessary burden; we will hear his points perfectly well.
</p>

<a name="60321-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_62"></a>I will not be quite so kind in reply to the noble Lord&#039;s amendments. There are great difficulties with just making this a spot matter, which is what it would have to be. You could see a situation with a small part of a local area potentially suffering from bouts of corruption, and a local authority not wanting to grasp that problem for a number of reasons.
</p>

<a name="60321-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_63"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, in this respect. We are, in a way, having to take an elephant to crack a nut. It is a question of how you crack that nut. We know that there is corruption; that has been demonstrated in the postal voting system. We are most worried about cases where people are not themselves going to polling stations but are using a postal or proxy vote, so that you have not got the person in front of you to enable you to identify what is going on.
</p>

<a name="60321-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_64"></a>While I think that the system proposed in the Bill is cumbersome, there is frankly no alternative but to have it nationally. We could go back through the debate we had over CORE and argue whether it is necessary to have a centralised computer system. We picked our way through that earlier in Committee, but it is one of the big questions that we have not answered: whether you are required to put these registers into one system. If you did not, and you remained on a local level, you would rule out many of the problems that have been raised about identifiers, because you could have systems which simply excluded anything but the name so that people could not read the identifiers. That is diverting a bit into something that may come up on Report.
</p>

<a name="60321-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_65"></a>We earlier discussed the drop in registration. The Minister said that there was evidence that registration had gone down in Northern Ireland and that, indeed, it had gone down again once the register had been cleaned up. Again, that is a point of whether you worry more about the register dropping or being clean. To do this on a local basis&#151;having to get the evidence from a local newspaper that has got a bit of a fly going on a particular part of its community&#151;could conjure up all sorts of unpleasant things, especially if the problem is identified as being entirely an ethnic minority one, with schemes then being locally targeted at them. That outcome would be unfortunate. We must therefore look at a national scheme; I do not see any other way.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_50"></a>
<a name="60321-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. We want a national scheme. It is entirely wrong that there should be any difference between constituencies, districts or whatever in the country. We recognise that, with the Government&#039;s proposals for a pilot scheme, there will be differences for a limited time, which we do not welcome. We would be far more hostile, however, to any scheme that basically made this a permanent system.
</p>

<a name="60321-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_66"></a>We recognise that, if an order is made on a particular local authority, under the scheme of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, the need to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC91"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC91</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

require a personal identifier would apply to everybody on the register in that constituency or district, whatever their ethnic background. Nevertheless, in the current circumstances, we would almost certainly end up with a system whereby it would be much more likely that the order for personal identifiers would be made in areas with a large ethnic minority group than in areas where there were no, or few, members of ethnic minorities. This, frankly, would inevitably be seen as racist, so we cannot support it.
</p>

<a name="60321-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_67"></a>I also see more practical difficulties. For instance, in many places in London, the parliamentary constituencies cross the borough boundaries. One would then have a difficult situation. In the case of a parliamentary constituency located partly in one borough which had applied for an order and partly in a borough which had not, what would happen to voters in that constituency? I believe that it is far more likely than the noble Lord admits that these problems could arise. For example, let us take a group which had won control of several safe wards quite genuinely, but its majority was dependent on fixing the vote in a small number of marginal wards. It would be perfectly possible for the majority party on a local authority to be unwilling to apply for an order which would take away the advantage that it gains by manipulating the system. I do not need to say anything more. It is inevitable that we cannot support these amendments.

<p><a name="gc_st_51"></a>
<a name="60321-32_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   My remarks are probing in nature on the amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. During the 15 years before I entered Parliament, while I was abroad for four of them, for some 11 years I was involved in active campaigning in north London. I stood three times in local government elections and once in a parliamentary election. I did a great deal of canvassing, particularly in the London Borough of Camden. It is a unique borough in that it starts in the commercial centre of the capital where the old Pearl Assurance building used to be and goes right out to the leafy suburbs, stopping just short of Hampstead Garden Suburb. As I say, I have had a great deal of canvassing experience and, while it is hazardous to extrapolate from a single case, perhaps this account will make the question more vivid.
</p>

<a name="60321-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_68"></a>On one occasion, I was canvassing in Kentish Town and arrived at a house in multiple occupation, which is the worst possible canvassing experience one can have. One sees a large number of bell pushes with soiled and illegible labels, and the names on those labels bear only a small correlation to the names on the electoral register. I am sure that every one of your Lordships has had this experience in urban areas, and possibly even in rural areas. I pressed one or more of the buttons, knowing perfectly well that the reaction would come from a window high above my head. Someone would look out and we would conduct the canvass in a most indiscreet manner that could be heard by everyone in the street. But, as chance would have it, on this occasion two people appeared at the front door. One was a large Englishman wearing the sort of shirt whose collar detaches. It was evening, so it was detached and the collar stud was not in place. Standing in front of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC92"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC92</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

him was a much smaller person, a representative of a particular ethnic minority which I shall not identify. After I had gone into the usual spiel, the large Englishman said, &quot;We&#039;re Labour here&quot;. I did what one always does on those occasions; I said that one wins a few and loses a few, and I thanked him for answering my questions so directly. I then went away to do another hour and a half of canvassing in the neighbouring streets.
</p>

<a name="60321-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_69"></a>My car was parked close to that house and, by chance, when I returned to collect it, I saw the member of the ethnic minority exercising his dog in a very English way. As I went to my car, he asked, &quot;Did we have a good evening?&quot; I replied, &quot;From our conversation at your abode, I understand that you will not be supporting my party at this election&quot;. He said, &quot;It is true that at the last election I voted for another party, but I am going to change my vote on this occasion. Had it not been for the presence of that very large man&#151;I live in close quarters to him&#151;I would have told you my intentions. As it was, I did not misinform you, I just did not say anything&quot;. I said, &quot;That is extremely helpful. Thank you&quot;. The man went on to say: &quot;I should tell you that more votes than my own will be changing. My extended family lives in the neighbouring streets and they will all be voting the same way as I will&quot;. So I said: &quot;As a matter of curiosity, how many of them are there?&quot; He said that there were about 25. I went on my way, thinking that I had possibly secured the largest canvassing coup in the history of British electioneering, since 50 people were going to change their votes. The fact remains that the process was unsatisfactory if they were all going to swing in that particular way. The area was not, I have to say, particularly ethnic.
</p>

<a name="60321-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_70"></a>What I cannot tell from the noble Lord&#039;s amendments is whether he envisages that these applications and orders will occur only where there are large ethnic minorities. It seems to me, as somebody who is interested in the British constitution, that it is just as serious that that process would be occurring in a small number of streets with a single family as it would be if it occurred on a larger scale, for the magnitude of the swing quite clearly has significance in terms of an election. Therefore, what I am not sure about is how widespread the issue has to be for it to become a matter that is then subject to his proposals.

Is that what he is actually saying? That is what I think that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, was suggesting.

I am not going to go over it again.

I am not going to say that everybody in the leadership of that group turned a blind eye, because I think that a lot of them did not know what was going on. It was going on in some wards and not in others. But certainly some of the leadership were implicated in it.

That was the argument used against my amendment. I am tackling the matter straight on. The noble Lord is not saying that that has happened.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_58"></a>
<a name="60321-33_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I am being very careful with what I say because I do not want to use parliamentary privilege to say things that I would not say outside.

</p>

<a name="60321-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_73"></a>The point that I was going on to make is that what I call &quot;small-scale benign postal-vote fiddling&quot; is a much greater problem than people accept. I had a conversation with a gentleman. I cannot remember his name, but he is a Conservative Member of Parliament for one of the Trafford constituencies. We were discussing this issue on Granada Television some time ago. He was telling me that in the all-postal pilots in Trafford, which were generally thought to have been quite successful, there was a very clear increase in the number of households where everybody voted. In households where normally two or three out of four people on the register voted, in the all-postal pilot, everyone voted. I regret that when we had the all-postal pilots in the European and local elections, more research was not done locally into how the voting <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC94"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC94</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

patterns at a micro-level were affected. More research should have been done by going back to question some of those electors and conducting on-the-ground academic research. The research that was done was opinion polling that asked people if they found the process convenient or were happy with it. That was the wrong sort of research. We missed a real opportunity there, having had those pilots.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_59"></a>
<a name="60321-33_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   Was not the intention behind the pilots to get more people to vote? Is not the noble Lord seeing something in the pilots that was possibly corrupting the system, when in fact the intention was simply to secure more votes in households where, historically, people had not voted?
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_60"></a>
<a name="60321-33_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   Some of us bear the scars from the Bill to introduce the pilots. The noble Lord, Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, is not in his place, but he will remember it very well. I do not want to go back over all that. It is all anecdotal and about a feeling of what happens in your own area as you observe it, but I think that things such as parents voting for their student children who have a postal vote at home, or one member of a couple voting for their wife or husband, take place in extensive postal voting much more than people recognise.
</p>

<a name="60321-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_74"></a>As I said, we had the opportunity in the pilots to do the research. Some of us asked for that research, but it was not done because the Electoral Commission, in its wisdom, thought that it was unnecessary. My point is that the real value of personal identifiers and, possibly, more individual registration will be in cutting the number of people voting for someone else, not on an organised, fraudulent basis but just because it is in-home and easy within the system. The proposals could discourage that, although they will not abolish it.
</p>

<a name="60321-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_75"></a>We now come down to some different models of how we may pilot these things. The Government want to pilot them in certain areas. My noble friends, supported, I hope, by the Conservatives, are now going for piloting on postal voting, while the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, proposes a different way to do it. Postal voting is an important part of the whole question; in my view, it is at the heart of the problem of fiddling votes&#151;whether at a very small scale within a family in a quite benign way where people do not think that they are doing anything wrong, or at the sort of scale about which the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, talks. My view is firmly that my noble friends have the right line here, but we will come to decisions on this when the Bill returns to the House.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_61"></a>
<a name="60321-33_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Tyler: </b>   I support my noble friend&#039;s point. The concept of a benign fiddle may in certain circumstances be critical. I apologise to the Committee for referring again to February 1974, when the majority that I eventually achieved in the Bodmin constituency was nine. Throughout the day on 1 March, it appeared that the success or failure of the government of this country might depend on which way the count went. I have no knowledge whatsoever of whether there were any benign fiddles in Bodmin <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC95"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC95</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in 1974, but the point made by my noble friend is absolutely right. We should seek to remove all fiddles. Those are clearly most likely to occur in relation to postal and proxy votes.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_62"></a>
<a name="60321-33_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   This has been an interesting debate, which I am pleased that my noble friend has led us through. I pay tribute to him for trying to address this concern. For Members of the Committee who have not had the benefit of it, I should say that he has produced a diagrammatic form, in part, of his amendments. My noble friend described himself to me a precision engineer when he was putting this amendment together, and his approach reflects that. He has also given me the benefit, as he has my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor, of going through the amendments in some detail. My noble friend knows that the Government do not support the amendments, but I want to explain some of the issues that have been raised as a consequence of them and perhaps reflect on some issues that have come forward today. As Members of the Committee have pointed out, at the next stage we will perhaps have the opportunity on the Floor of the House to come to more decisions.
</p>

<a name="60321-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_76"></a>With great humility, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, that an Englishman could be of any colour. There was an implication almost in what he said that an Englishman would be white. I know that that is not what the noble Lord meant, but he spoke about an Englishman and someone from an ethnic minority. Of course, they could both be Englishmen and they could both be black. I know that the noble Lord will not mind if I reflect on that. Members of the Committee have been candid in their experiences about whether something is benign fiddling&#151;I am not quite sure that I understand the concept of benign fiddling&#151;but they are concerned about what is happening. We need to think of that issue as a national question, not one that is associated with one community or another, whatever the prevailing information that we might have; it could be pertinent and relevant anywhere.
</p>

<a name="60321-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_77"></a>I will resist the temptation to return yet again to the CORE question. I see that much more as putting address books together and having a database that is of value to those who are able to use it, such as the political parties, which, I understand, are very interested in it. But I take my noble friend&#039;s point about eventuality in terms of other forms of databases that might be available.
</p>

<a name="60321-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_78"></a>The Government began from the principle that you need to pilot. When we do something that affects our democracy, it is important that we test it properly and thoroughly to ensure that any detrimental impact&#151;we have talked about the Northern Ireland experience&#151;is mitigated. That is very important if we take fully on board the questions raised about ensuring that people have the right and the ability to cast their votes.

<a name="column_GC96"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC96</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

we can understand what happens when we bring in new things in a compulsory way. We would make sure that we work very closely with those participating in the pilots to deal with any questions that might arise. Although we can predict most things, already we have had discussions today about additional factors that we would also want to test out. As I have tried to indicate, when overlaying a number of things that may look sensible and straightforward, one has to realise that the recipient is receiving everything in one go. We have to check that there are no unforeseen consequences that affect people&#039;s ability to vote.
</p>

<a name="60321-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_80"></a>One question that always arises for me is whether people feel that something is complicated or complex. There are particular groups in our society who find it more difficult to exercise their democratic right; some London elections have demonstrated that. The cost of the pilots is &#163;2 million, which I hope was clear. We sought volunteers in local authorities to enable those who were interested to come forward, but we will take the pilots forward only if we are clear about the level of support. Of course, we seek to find a balance between rural and city environments, different political persuasions in control of the local authorities and so on. As soon as we have further information on that, I shall bring it to your Lordships for discussion.
</p>

<a name="60321-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_81"></a>The difficulties with my noble friend&#039;s specific proposals have been raised. Members of the Committee have looked at this from different angles. My noble friend has been very clear with me that he sees his scheme, in part, to be a deterrent&#151;a preventive measure. Local authorities would not wish to find themselves in the position where they had to go down the route of developing a scheme. But, if it is in legislation, we have to assume that it will have the opposite effect, as, indeed, it might. A local authority, in order to avoid being the subject of any suspicion that it did not deal with issues of corruption, might find it easier simply to apply to the Secretary of State to designate. It could, under the scheme, designate one, two or three wards, or the whole local authority. Although it would be possible for local authorities to target, which may, on the face of it, be quite appropriate, we have also to consider the implications of what that would mean. They could develop their own systems. We could, for example, have three or four different systems of personal identifiers running in one area. You very quickly get into a sort of postcode lottery. If you live in a particular ward in a particular place, you have to fill in a particular kind of identifier, which if you move away you do not have to do.
</p>

<a name="60321-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_82"></a>I am not testing what that would mean and what that could do. I think that it would be detrimental to our democracy and that we have to go for simplicity, straightforwardness, clarity and universality in anything that we do. Although I accept that the pilots, in a sense, set a different position for a short while, their purpose is to enable us to get to that point. Anything else is potentially very difficult.

I do not intend to delay the Committee with anything else, other than to say that I have heard the debate and recognise that some very powerful arguments were put on the need specifically to deal with the problem of postal voting, which takes me back to my noble friend&#039;s amendment.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_10"></a>After Clause 14, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_amdt_3"></a><br>
&quot;INCORPORATION OF PERSONAL IDENTIFIERS

<br>
(1)   In the first two annual canvasses following the coming into force of this Act, provision shall be made on each canvass form for each person registering to provide the personal identifiers as specified in section 14.


<br>
(2)   Each canvass form shall contain a form of words specifying that the provision of personal identifiers is voluntary, except in respect of the conditions specified in subsection (3).
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC98"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC98</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(3)   Each canvass form shall contain a form of words specifying that the provision of personal identifiers is necessary if the person registering applies subsequently for a postal ballot.

<br>
(4)   After the first annual canvass under subsection (1), the Electoral Commission shall report to the Secretary of State on the effect of the inclusion of personal identifiers, encompassing&#151;


<br>
(a)   the proportion of electors supplying personal identifiers;


<br>
(b)   the effect on registration;


<br>
(c)   such other criteria as the Secretary of State may specify.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_65"></a>The noble Lord said: I will attempt to be brief. I suspect that there may be a correlation between the length of the amendment and the length of speeches. As the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said, different models are being offered, so this is a contribution to that. It is my modest contribution to what is becoming rather a crowded field. In the light of many of the things that have been said, I can be fairly succinct in addressing it. It is a compromise.
</p>

<a name="60321-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_90"></a>Along with my noble friend Lady Hanham and others, I would like to move straight to the national application of the use of personal identifiers. But if we are not going to get there, this is offered as a compromise which I hope may commend itself to the Government. I appreciate that that is a rather forlorn hope, even though I draw attention to the fact that it introduces a voluntary element but with a compulsory dimension.
</p>

<a name="60321-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_91"></a>The amendment really seeks to address two problems that I see in the Bill. One is the problem of the pilots. To be effective for piloting purposes, particular areas need to be designated and of a population size to permit rigorous evaluation. The problem with the way the Bill is drafted is that it cannot guarantee it. I am trying therefore to get away from that problem.
</p>

<a name="60321-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_92"></a>The second flaw relates to postal voting, which has been discussed in some detail in Committee. As we know, people applying for a postal vote will need to supply a signature, but there will be nothing to compare it against. This provision seems to have slipped in in the Commons without fully realising its implications. The new clause is designed to address both problems in a way that I hope is fairly self-evident.
</p>

<a name="60321-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_93"></a>The clause also provides that the Electoral Commission shall evaluate the effect of the scheme on registration, so the provisions that I propose can look at the effect of the numbers supplying personal identifiers. It is designed to provide an element of flexibility and to address some of the problems that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, identified at the beginning of his speech, which derived from the publication to which he drew attention. So we will move flexibly, but towards achieving the ultimate national roll-out. Unless there is a major problem, the requirement to supply personal identifiers can take effect in 2000.
</p>

<a name="60321-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_94"></a>The new clause is fairly self-evident. Rather than repeat points already made by Members of the Committee which this amendment seeks to address, I will not take up the time of the Committee. But it was worth putting the proposal forward. As Gus would <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60321-34_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I love the reference to &quot;Drop The Dead Donkey&quot;&#151;one of my favourite series. I shall have to think on whether I can get in a Damian gag, or a Joy gag, which would be even better. I am grateful to the noble Lord. In Committee, it is important to develop our ideas and to listen to the underlying principles of Members of the Committee. The noble Lord knows well that I have difficulty with a voluntary scheme as a way of piloting or evaluating a compulsory scheme. By its very nature, the one thing you would not be doing is making people give you information. So those groups who would not wish to participate do not have to. That is my problem overall. I have discussed this at great length with Sam Younger who has been very helpful, but I do not think that it gets us to the point that we need to reach. Anything that might affect a person&#039;s ability to vote which we do not test thoroughly is a difficulty.
</p>

<a name="60321-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_95"></a>We also need to think carefully about how to address the issues raised in our previous debate&#151;I refer to my noble friend Lord Elder&#039;s amendment. I can see that Members of the Committee seek something which specifically addresses postal voting. That issue, above any, is of great concern and noble Lords want to deal with it as quickly and effectively as possible. That, again, is a continuing theme. Members of the Committee, while not necessarily agreeing with me, take the point that I am trying to make about the difficulty of evaluating voluntary versus evaluating compulsion, which is something we will do.
</p>

<a name="60321-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_96"></a>Noble Lords also want a degree of certainty on how we will have been seen to tackle particular issues raised in our discussions effectively. We have to make sure that there is appropriate evaluation of any schemes being tried and tested. We discussed the potential role of the Electoral Commission&#151;I shall say no more; we discussed amending the Bill in our previous deliberations&#151;and making sure that that evaluation is done well.
</p>

<a name="60321-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_97"></a>Without wishing to hold up discussions any further, perhaps I may take the noble Lord&#039;s amendment along with that of my noble friend Lord Elder and all other noble Lords to see what, if anything, might be added to where we are. I know that noble Lords have been generous in offering to meet with me between the Committee and Report stages where I hope that we can tie down some of these issues effectively. A clear set of objectives are coming through our Committee debates, which are extremely helpful to me in trying to see what more we might do, although that may not be helpful to the Committee.

<a name="60321-34_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I did not comment before because I wanted to hear what the noble Baroness had to say. My noble friend Lord Norton has perhaps taken into account the postal vote pilot that we want to see. If so, the amendment fits quite neatly with that. If we take that into account, it would not be necessary for everybody to sign up the first time; it would be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC100"></a>

necessary when everybody wanted a postal vote to have their identifiers in place. Under those circumstances, and hearing what the noble Baroness has said&#151;which is in a sense a softening of hard lines&#151;the amendment is very appropriate.

I understand what the noble Baroness is saying. I was going to make a similar point about the different models being offered. It is an opportunity to reflect on what is being said and see whether some sort of combination might be derived from these proposals to see whether we might strengthen the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60321-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_98"></a>I understand the point made by the noble Baroness about the voluntary nature of the provision and those who might not participate. I can see it from the other direction because it would be a way of evaluating those groups that were not participating and checking whether or not there was a problem. I was looking at the matter from that perspective, so it could cut both ways. I fully understand the points the noble Baroness made. I shall not make any comments about us both being of a certain age where we therefore appreciate the value of &quot;Drop The Dead Donkey&quot;. On that point, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>

<a name="60321-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_104"></a>This part of the Bill deals with the areas the pilots might cover. Amendment No. 82A seeks to leave out paragraph (b) of Clause 15(2). It states that the pilot may take place,

<a name="60321-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_107"></a>These are both probing amendments to point out that there could well be unintended consequences by including either parts of a local authority area or part of a parliamentary constituency, depending on which election was taking place. In most places it is true that local authorities and parliamentary constituencies are not contiguous. In the part of the world where I live, Pendle and Burnley, we are very fortunate that the district is the constituency. It is ideal, but in most places because we try and match up numbers evenly that does not happen.

</p>

<a name="60321-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_108"></a>The unintended consequences could occur as a result of the impact of piloting proposals for personal identifier schemes on the actual election results. If the effect of introducing these schemes is indeed that some electors are no longer registered and the proportion of people on the register goes down, it could have a disproportionate effect if the areas being piloted and the areas not being piloted either within a local authority or within a constituency vote in different ways. I can think of a couple of constituencies in the north-west that straddle local authority boundaries where the part of the constituency in one local authority is on the face of it more &quot;Conservative&quot; and the part in the other local authority is more &quot;Labour&quot;&#151;one is more middle class and one is more working class. However, I know that nowadays in many places the middles classes vote New Labour and the working classes vote Liberal Democrat. However, in parliamentary terms there is still basically a correlation between socio-economic class and the party that people vote for, although it is obviously not absolute.

</p>

<a name="60321-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_109"></a>When it comes to choosing pilots, it is very important indeed to look not just at getting a fair representation of the different things that have already been talked about&#151;different sorts of areas, different sorts of ethnicity, different parties controlling the local authority&#151;but also to make sure that there will be no unintended consequences which severely affect the election result. If one half of a constituency is in a pilot but the other half is not, it may well change the result. Equally, if you pilot one part of a local authority that might be full of council estates and do not pilot another part that may comprise a prosperous rural area and suburbs, or vice versa, it could have that consequence. I do not think it is possible to put in the Bill what I am asking for; that is, sensible area pilots. Nevertheless, it is very important indeed that this issue is looked at. If there are allegations afterwards that the process has affected the election results, it will discredit the whole pilot. I beg to move.

<p><a name="gc_st_70"></a>
<a name="60321-35_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I agree with the spirit of these amendments. We hope we have been clear that we intend each pilot to cover an entire local authority. The only exception we have suggested is where parliamentary constituency boundaries make it sensible to take a small part of an authority so that different parts of a constituency are not asked to vote by different methods, which I am sure fits with what the noble Lord seeks.
</p>

<a name="60321-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_110"></a>Local authority level pilots in a variety of different areas will give us the evidence base we are looking for on which government and Parliament can make a decision on national roll-out.

</p>

<a name="60321-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_113"></a>As the Committee will know, the Bill includes the power to hold pilots of the collection and use of personal identifiers. As part of these pilots, electors will be asked a new question at the polling station. The new question is: &quot;What is your date of birth?&quot; Consequential to this change is the ability, at Clause 13(5) of the Bill, for a person to receive a tendered ballot paper if they give an answer to the date of birth question that does not match the information held on record. Not linked to the personal identifier pilots, the Bill includes at paragraph 71 of the schedule a new requirement for electors to provide their signature when they vote at a polling station. Signatures will not be checked on the spot but are intended to provide an audit trail for use in alleged cases of fraud. This provision has also necessitated a consequential change, at Clause 14(3)(a), to provide that if a person casts a tendered ballot they must also provide their signature.
</p>

<a name="60321-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_114"></a>The issue the amendments in this group address is that where the Bill defines the &quot;personal identifier provisions&quot; which may be the subject of pilots&#151;at Clause 15(13)&#151;the consequential changes in relation to tendered ballots which I have described have been treated incorrectly. As a result the signing in polling stations consequential change has been treated as a personal identifier provision while the change made as a consequence of asking for a person&#039;s date of birth has not. The reverse should be the case. The first amendment in this group corrects this drafting error, with the remaining two amendments making consequential changes to the Bill&#039;s commencement provisions.

<br>

<p><a name="gc_st_75"></a>The noble Baroness said: We are discussing pilots. The noble Baroness will be aware that ultimately we hope to end up with one pilot. But in the meantime, as the Bill stands, we need to try to make these provisions as perfect as we can.
</p>

<a name="60321-35_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_117"></a>Amendment No. 86 would add a provision to the Representation of the People Act 2000 to ensure that there could be no compulsory all-postal voting in a pilot. Amendment No. 87 has the same effect but includes the provision that there could be no all-postal vote in any election. Amendment No. 88 would make further additions to the 2000 Act by ensuring that no pilot scheme could provide for the use of analogous electronic means.
</p>

<a name="60321-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_118"></a>I hope that the thinking behind these amendments is clear. All Members of the Committee are mindful of the need to prevent fraud&#151;we have discussed it endlessly for the past two Committee days. We discussed at Second Reading the postal vote fraud scandal in Birmingham. Yet there is nothing in this Bill that rules out all-postal voting or experiments with other methods of voting. Indeed, the CORE consultation paper mentions e-voting and the ease with which it could be introduced via the CORE register.
</p>

<a name="60321-35_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_119"></a>Apparently, online fraud is growing at 300 per cent a year. It is the fastest growing type of fraud in the world. Therefore, there is a possibility that if pilots are introduced, they could be used as a vehicle for voting experiments that would put at risk the safety of the franchise. Postal voting alone is subject to interception on receipt of votes by post, misuse through handling by third parties through identity fraud and the pressures of undue influence, especially on those voting, for example, from residential homes.
</p>

<a name="60321-35_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_120"></a>It is really not fair to the electorate to select a random area&#151;as we have discussed this afternoon&#151;and force all voters in that area to vote in a certain way, and perhaps sometimes to vote in a way to which they are not accustomed. The Electoral Reform Society stated that rather than going for all-postal voting voting in a solve-all tactic, the Government should concentrate rather on,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_16"></a>&quot;making more votes count and introducing a more appealing political culture&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="60321-35_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_121"></a>However, I am not discussing that at the moment. The Bill makes no provision for personal identifiers which could secure the postal vote further.

It seems absurd that the Government are willing to subject that right to short-term experimental schemes which we are trying to rule out through these amendments. The amendments intend to put in place safeguards against the pitfalls of elections taking place via piloting. We have already put forward our opinion on pilots and our proposed alternative, the transitional provision for personal identifiers by using the postal vote to &quot;test drive&quot; the idea. We believe that all-postal voting is a step too far. I beg to move.

<a name="60321-36_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for explaining the detail of her amendment. We have already made it clear that we have no intention of rolling out all-postal voting at this time as a default position for local elections. There may be instances where such ballots can be conducted effectively, without security concerns and with a clear benefit to turnout and thus the mandate of those elected. In order to consider whether there is a case for allowing an election to be conducted on an all-postal basis, it is necessary to ensure that pilots can be run to test and improve on the systems before any wider implementation. The Committee will know that in very specific areas, such as a local parish, from time to time local authorities have asked whether this is an appropriate way for them to conduct an election.
</p>

<a name="60321-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_123"></a>I know that the amendment is probing in nature, but the difficulty is that it would prevent all-postal ballots being introduced for any pilot or election, including referendums. It might even include non-statutory elections such as that held recently to elect the new Conservative leader. I know that that is not at all what the noble Baroness seeks, but the amendment could have that impact. I thought that I should mention that on the way.

<a name="60321-36_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I accept the point, but my advice suggests that it is a question of any pilot or election. The breadth of it could lead at least to uncertainty, which I am sure the noble Baroness does not seek to achieve. Rather let me say simply that if you rule something out altogether, you lose the opportunity to carry out a test. I understand the Committee&#039;s concern regarding all-postal pilots. Although I did not participate in the earlier debates, I sense that a frisson passes over the Committee every time we go anywhere near the subject.

Again, I take the point rightly made by the noble Baroness that online fraud is a very real concern and has to be dealt with. But we must also recognise the value of making voting easier and more accessible. Research released by the Electoral Commission in 2003 showed that there is a significant demand for electronic voting and that it could help to stem the decline in turnout at elections. Some 55 per cent of English adults said that being offered electronic <br>&nbsp;<br>

voting in some form would encourage them to vote at the next local election. Moreover, it comes as no surprise that the youngest demographic group, the 18 to 24 year-olds, are the most keen to try the new methods. Three-quarters of those responding said that e-voting would encourage them to participate. Local authorities have also demonstrated an interest in using electronic voting as an option in local elections and a number of pilots have been conducted. They have provided important lessons to help establish the basis on which further pilots can be delivered in future.
</p>

<a name="60321-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_125"></a>I take the point made by the noble Baroness about experimenting in different ways and being clear that we do so appropriately. However, it is right and proper to consider technology as an opportunity as well as something that we need to ensure is safe and fraud-free, particularly in light of the fact that the generations following us use technology in the way I used to operate my cassette player when I was a youngster. It is something they are familiar with and expect to be able to use. So we need to recognise two things: the world changes and new technology provides real advantages; and, when research suggests clearly that people&#151;particularly but not exclusively the young&#151;value the opportunity to be able to consider new ways of voting, the Government are beholden to test different methods so that we can address issues of safety and security.

<a name="60321-36_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Norton of Louth: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. Is there not a third point here, that of the element of balance? The Bill is designed to increase participation, but we must balance that against security. Much of the debate has been about fraud in the sense of deliberate acts, but there is the much wider issue of the secrecy of the ballot and how to secure that. We have to be careful, and it may be that something has to be written into the Bill to ensure it. It is not sufficient to run pilots; something must be written in to ensure that the balance is right.
</p>

<a name="60321-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_126"></a>As I say, I do not mention those deliberately looking to commit fraud but, whether voting is conducted electronically or on paper through the postal ballot, issues arise. The ballot box ensures secrecy; the living room does not. That is the fundamental problem that we must address.

<a name="60321-36_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I do not dispute that and I agree with the noble Lord about the importance of secrecy, although I resist the temptation to put anything more in the Bill. However, the central point is that as we use different methods of electronically conducting lots of transactions where secrecy is an important issue, so we learn more about how to make systems secure. The noble Lord looks suitably dubious, but I do not suggest for a second that we are there yet. I say simply that we would be failing in our duty to the electorate if we did not consider the possibilities and opportunities for the future, especially as those are important, although not critical, factors in what we are being told about how people view their own voting behaviours.

Perhaps we never will, but we must look at these issues seriously. Certainly many institutions around the world are grappling with the problem of how to ensure that technology is being provided in a safe and secure manner&#151;in secret where that is appropriate. Moreover, we should at least be aware of the fact that that is something that our young people, especially, want us to do.

<a name="60321-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_128"></a>For those reasons, I resist the amendments, but I take the points about not trying too many experiments and being clear about the ability to vote.

<p><a name="gc_st_83"></a>
<a name="60321-36_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I was going to say that I deliberately have not brought with me my file on the debates on the Ballot Act 1872, particularly the fascinating stuff in the House of Commons. People looked closely at these issues because at the time the secret vote was a new concept. They debated in great detail how to ensure the secret vote. I am glad that I did not bring the file because I would have been tempted to delve into it. Although the noble Baroness has done us a favour by raising the issue, those points are not fundamental to the Bill.

<p><a name="gc_st_84"></a>

<a name="60321-36_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I can tell the noble Baroness that they were considering things like postal voting&#151;and they rejected it because they did not think that it was secure. The point I make is that the basis of those debates was the principle, not pragmatic issues like how to raise turnout. I think that the principle still applies. On that basis, I am happy to be old fashioned.

It contrasts quite dramatically with the gung-ho, &quot;white heat of technology&quot; speeches which have been made by some Ministers in the House of Commons.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_130"></a>If the Government want to experiment with new technology, in my view the place to do so is in the polling station or within polling places. They may want to look into setting up polling machines in the high street where the crucial issue is not whether you have an electronic machine that appears to work, but what happens to the audit trail produced by the machine and the encrypted receipt to be given to the voter. You cannot see how someone has voted, but if the technology works well the receipt can be matched to the person if later there is a query. If a proper audit trail can be produced and the voter can be given a print-out of how they have voted which they can then put in a ballot box, which if necessary could be checked if there are questions about the accuracy of the machine; and if the voter can be given a receipt to show how they have voted and which can be returned to the machine to be unencrypted, we can move towards investing in voting machines in polling places. That would deliver fairly instant election results except in those instances where there are queries or recounts. If the Government want to consider new technology, that is the way to do it, rather than looking at ways of enabling people to cast their vote away from polling stations.

<a name="60321-37_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am trying to find a way to get hanging chads into the debate. Members of the Committee will remember well the Florida experience when we were all glued to the wall-to-wall TV coverage, wondering what they would do to the American elections. That made us all think about technology and the need to ensure that it works properly. I think that the noble Lord probably accepts that for some people, getting to the polling station is a real difficulty. That applies not just to those with disabilities, but to the elderly and those with family responsibilities. I try to be measured because I accept absolutely that there are difficulties. However, for some the physical act of getting to the polling station, picking up the pencil and making your cross&#151;which we may regard as something positive&#151;is just not a practical proposition. We need to be careful that we do not disfranchise anyone. I am thinking here of mums with young children as much as those with disabilities.

<p><a name="gc_st_87"></a>
<a name="60321-37_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I accept postal voting for people who for good reasons cannot get to the polling station, although I would much prefer to open polling stations for a week or 10 days before polling day to allow for those who are away, rather than giving them postal votes. What I do not accept is that voting should be made much easier for those who are fundamentally lazy. There is a philosophical difference here. I believe that what the Minister said about going to the polling station as a symbolic act of civic engagement, to use the modern jargon, is important. However, that is far less important than the fact that at the moment the polling station is the only place in which the secrecy of the vote can be guaranteed. As the noble Lord, Lord Norton, said, that is the crucial point.
</p>

<a name="60321-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_131"></a>I make no bones about it. I am against the present system of postal voting on demand. We ought to go back to a system in which postal voting is provided for <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_88"></a>
<a name="60321-37_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Norton of Louth: </b>   May I add a brief postscript? The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has made an important point. In terms of postal balloting, there is an important distinction to be made between those for whom it is convenient and those for whom it is necessary. If some of the studies we carry out can distinguish between those so that we get some idea of the actual numbers, that would be extremely relevant in considering how to address the problem.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_89"></a>
<a name="60321-37_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   At the risk of prolonging the debate&#151;although I must admit that I am enjoying it&#151;the trouble lies in the fact that the dividing line between convenience and necessity is difficult to draw. I can think of someone close to my home who has a postal vote because he is always broadcasting on election day. I cite those with young children who find it difficult to vote because the polling station may not be close by. I think of those who want to vote, but who somehow never quite get round to it. Although I take the point made so well by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that there is something positive about going to the polling station, we have to recognise that although some people may wish to participate, they do not have the same level of engagement and involvement as us. Nevertheless, we have a responsibility to ensure that those people can exercise their democratic right to cast a vote. That means being mindful of their personal circumstances.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_90"></a>
<a name="60321-37_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Norton of Louth: </b>   I appreciate that it might not be a simple dichotomy; there may be a sliding scale. However, that is not an argument against a study to explore the range of the measure so that we can get a sense of the number of those for whom it is an absolute necessity and for whom it would be difficult, for the reasons that the noble Baroness has given. As I say, that is not an argument against a study but it identifies some of the problems that would need to be teased out in it.

However, as regards public confidence, it will be a matter of reassurance, before we start trying new methods, if the country as a whole has confidence that the rudimentary methods that we use at the moment are fraud proof. If we were to have a repetition of the Birmingham events, that would deal a very serious blow to confidence in the security of the system. Therefore, I hope that too much of the Government&#039;s time will not be spent in thinking of ways of changing the system and that proportionately more time will be spent in making sure that it is secure.

<p><a name="gc_st_94"></a>The noble Lord said: I can be fairly quick with this amendment. It refers to the section of the Bill that states that when there has been a pilot scheme, the local authority should be consulted by the Electoral Commission before the latter writes its report. I entirely agree with that. I just add in parenthesis that when we were talking about setting up CORE schemes, the consultation was all with the electoral registration officer. I proposed that local authorities should be included in that, but that did not meet with the Government&#039;s favour. I think that in all these cases the electoral registration officer as a professional should be consulted and the local authority as a local authority should be consulted, to be consistent.

That is an important consideration, as any reduction in the number of pilots would be detrimental to our ability to test innovations that would modernise our electoral system. The Secretary of State has to assess the level of local political support for the proposal before granting approval. In the event that the composition of political parties on the council does not lend itself to that approach, or should support for a proposal be split, the Secretary of State would seek detailed reasons from the objecting parties setting out the grounds for objection before deciding whether the application should be approved.

This would mean that although personal identifiers will still be collected for the purpose of registration, the question provided for by clause 15(3)(b) (&#039;What is your date of birth?&#039;) to be asked in a polling station prior to an elector being provided a ballot paper need not be asked&quot;.</p>

<a name="60321-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_153"></a>The suggestion is that in certain local elections the personal identifier provisions, which will apply to other elections there, will not be asked. If there is an election for the district council, a parish council or a town council, if that is disapplied it will not have to be applied during that election.
</p>

<a name="60321-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_154"></a>If that is what it means, I do not understand why the provision is being made. Apart from anything else, it will cause problems if there are elections on the same day. Most parish, town and community elections are on the same day as elections for local authorities in an election year. Sometimes in the case of a by-election they will not. In almost all cases where parish council elections take place, it is a double election and people go into the polling station and vote for the district or borough councillor and the parish councillor at the same time. Why are we disapplying one and not the other? That seems very odd. The way that it is written does not suggest that it can just disapply for one by-election if there was a one-off parish election; it would be for that local authority generally. I do not understand what it means or how it would work.
</p>

<a name="60321-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_155"></a>More particularly, I do not understand why it is needed or why it should happen. If we are having a system of personal identifiers, and people become used to it, so that when they go to the polling station or get their postal vote they have to sign their name and provide their date of birth, why should that not apply <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60321-38_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord. On Amendment No. 90A, he has recognised that we sought that for elections to parish or community councils we should have a power that says we could exclude them from the need to use personal identifiers, just because we were concerned not to do anything that might be perceived to be disproportionate for polls on a very small scale.
</p>

<a name="60321-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_156"></a>I take the point that the noble Lord is making that as people get used to it that will become the norm. As elections are going on at district level and parish level at the same time, you would use identifiers. It would not be that you needed it for one and not the other. It was simply that when a very small-scale election is going on, we thought that it was worth having a power in the Bill to make using identifiers unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="60321-38_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_157"></a>The noble Lord looks puzzled; I am not surprised. I will take this away, if I might. It was meant to give us some flexibility for those circumstances. I wonder whether noble Lords have views on this. I do not feel that we need to push it to any great lengths. I am keen, as always with primary legislation, that we keep as much flexibility as we can. It would be in those circumstances alone where it might apply.
</p>

<a name="60321-38_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_158"></a>On Amendment No. 90B, as the noble Lord has said, Clause 17(7) covers the rules relating to the conduct of various types of election that would be affected by the introduction of personal identifiers. Obviously, the pilots necessarily involve a degree of experimentation. If the pilots show that personal identifiers should be rolled out, but that some degree of modification to the provision was needed, Clause 17(2) provides the necessary flexibility to allow for that. I am sure that the noble Lord will appreciate that is quite important.
</p>

<a name="60321-38_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_159"></a>Clause 17(7), which allows for subsequent consequential changes to be made to subordinate legislation, is also necessary to allow for that flexibility in terms of the roll-out. This has been through the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which said that this power was appropriate because we need to have the flexibility. Otherwise, it would be difficult to amend what may, in a small way, be what we have been testing to make sure that we can roll it out appropriately and do not delay unnecessarily while we brought it back for legislation.

The definition of electoral ward in that section is to be repealed and replaced by a definition set out in Section 1 of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004.

<br>
(1)   An electoral quota system shall be introduced to determine the size of each constituency electorate.

<br>
(2)   The quota shall be determined by dividing the total electorate in the United Kingdom by the number of seats in the House of Commons.


<br>
(3)   The relevant authority must have regard to the maintenance of an equal number of electors per seat above all other considerations when determining all electoral boundaries.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_114"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment moves us into a wider area, but it seems an appropriate Bill in which to try and insert it. The amendment would place a duty on the Boundary Commission to have regard to the maintenance of an equal number of electors per seat above all other considerations when considering existing geographical and country boundaries.
</p>

<a name="60321-39_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_177"></a>The thinking behind the amendment is not, as has been suggested elsewhere, a disguised criticism of the Boundary Commission, rather it is a necessary suggested code of practice. We have addressed the issue of fairness at many levels in this Bill, about encouraging electoral participation and about ensuring that the vote is safeguarded. Those are surface measures, and our electoral system will not be truly fair until each elector is equally represented.
</p>

<a name="60321-39_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_178"></a>We have a voting system where some votes are more equal than others. Votes in the United Kingdom have values that differ significantly from constituency to constituency. Hackney South and Shoreditch has 57,204 electors; Banbury leaps to 78,817; and the Isle of Wight goes up to 103,480. Those figures are a random representation of an unwieldy state of affairs. An analysis of the overall figures shows that the average number of votes cast for the winning party in England at the last election, per seat, was 18,833. Conversely, the average number of votes cast per seat for the Tory party was 22,763.

<p><a name="gc_st_116"></a>
<a name="60321-39_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I did not say that this was going to be an equitable amendment. Put another way, of 118 seats that are under quota, 83 of them are Labour. Of seats that are above average quota, over half of them are Conservative.
</p>

<a name="60321-39_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_179"></a>I appreciate that this is a sensitive topic. It feels rather uncomfortable to unleash those statistics, but this House is the right place to do it. For the other place, this issue reminds one of the old saying, &quot;turkeys voting for Christmas&quot;. As the Upper House, it is our duty to scrutinise, and those figures demand that scrutiny. Also as a non-elected representative for our respective areas, the task of untangling the injustice of inconsistent representation of the electorate is important. There is a strong case for ending the wide disparities in the size of parliamentary constituencies, which goes beyond those revealing statistics.
</p>

<a name="60321-39_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_180"></a>Each elector deserves equal representation, but at present that is not the case. The introduction of a fixed electoral quota, the electorate divided by the number of seats, would be the first step in this process of equality. A small margin of difference could be allowed to avoid splitting local government wards. Furthermore, the extensive and valued work of the Boundary Commission could be given greater effect by <br>&nbsp;<br>

being implemented earlier. The last boundary review was conducted in 2000, but it will not be implemented until the next election. Since that time, there have been considerable demographic changes in a number of seats, which need to be accounted for. It is a very long time between one consideration of electoral boundaries and another. Perhaps it could be done on the census, more frequently or, more sensibly, at each election. Something needs to be done to try to address a system that is throwing up inconsistencies, where consistency is the one thing that matters most of all&#151;apart from people being able to vote. I beg to move.

<a name="60321-40_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Tyler: </b>   I sympathise, and I understand where the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, is coming from, but there are severe practical difficulties with Amendment No. 95. I draw the attention of noble Lords to the proposed new subsection (3), where it is suggested that the authority should have regard to the,

I pay tribute to the Boundary Commission, which does an extraordinarily difficult job, as the noble Baroness said. But it is a cumbersome process and it takes a long time. The prospect of going all the way around the country again at the speed proposed by the noble Baroness is, frankly, mind-boggling. Yesterday, the Leader of the Conservative Party suggested that the number of Members of Parliament and therefore of constituencies should be cut by a third. That is a recipe for constipation in our constitution. It would take at least five years for every single existing Member of Parliament and every single member of each constituency party to challenge such a proposal. The idea is absolutely ludicrous.
</p>

<a name="60321-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_182"></a>This sort of suggestion presents very considerable problems. I am sure that it is a probing amendment and my contribution will be to probe it further. Let me illustrate the sort of problems that would arise if it was seriously proposed that above all other considerations, equality of the electorate should be the determining issue. I turn to Orkney and Shetland. What are we to do? Should we add one or two of the Western Isles to bring up the population level? I have a particular problem with what I shall call the great nation of Cornwall. The suggestion that every so often we would either have to take in a bit of Devon or give a bit to Devon would be met with the worst rebellion since that against the English prayer book in the 16th century. We would have people marching on London. The tale of my ancestral hero, Bishop Jonathan Trelawny, would be as nothing compared with the row that would take place if Devon took over Cornwall.
</p>

<a name="60321-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_183"></a>The noble Baroness is quite right to point out that very considerable changes take place between general elections. There may well be a case for accelerating the process, but the idea that one should take note of what may have happened at every general election is difficult. We have seen a very considerable increase in the population and therefore the electorate in <br>&nbsp;<br>

Cornwall over recent years. Does that mean that each time it happened, we would have to bring about a change in our situation? The practical difficulties of imposing this set of criteria in such terms&#151;the amendment states clearly that this is to be &quot;above all other considerations&quot;&#151;would be appalling. There would be complete constipation in the entire boundary review process.
</p>

<a name="60321-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_184"></a>I sympathise with the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. She is quite right to point out that we do have a problem in our electoral system about equality of value in the voting system, but that is endemic to first past the post, and she and her party will discover that if they have not done so already. Some wiser heads in the party have already discovered it. First past the post does not give equal value to each vote, but I am afraid that to suggest that the Boundary Commission could somehow cure the problem is simply nonsense.

<p><a name="gc_st_118"></a>
<a name="60321-40_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Norton of Louth: </b>   I shall resist the temptation to digress too far in response to some of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. Suffice it to say on his point about reducing the number of MPs, I invite him to re-read the report published in 2000 of the Commission to Strengthen Parliament, which I had the opportunity to chair and of which my noble friend Lord Brooke was a member. It deals with the problem. Nor do I intend to go down the path of responding to the noble Lord&#039;s points about first past the post, save to say that it delivers benefits which the alternative systems on offer do not. But that is something we will doubtless debate on another occasion.
</p>

<a name="60321-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_185"></a>I rise only to support my noble friend&#039;s amendment and the principle that underpins it, which is what she is concerned with since I suspect that it will not be accepted today. We are really looking at the principle which has motivated it. The amendment is now on the record and so we can pursue it in order to deliver the particular principle that she has enunciated. The amendment seeks to deliver something that was pressed for in the 19th century. Indeed, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, touched on the point. At the time there was a demand for one man, one vote, which was then extended to one person, one vote, one value. What that referred to was the equality that is embodied in my noble friend&#039;s amendment. So in principle it is absolutely right and there is a case for saying that it is a very modest amendment. There is now an argument for moving beyond it and reducing further the representation from Scotland on the precedent set by Stormont from 1922 to 1972. Once you provide a parliament, there is a case for not offering equality with the rest of the United Kingdom.

</p>

<a name="60321-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_186"></a>There is a clear precedent. Indeed, when Stormont was abolished, the number of Members from Northern Ireland sitting at Westminster was increased; so one could go further. But the principle that my noble friend enunciated is absolutely right. It is something we should pursue in greater detail. I look forward to an opportunity to do that.

I remember when my constituency was substantially increased in size&#151;bigger than other constituencies in the county. It meant taking in areas as part of attempt to create more balance, but my area lost out and became almost unmanageable. There is an argument for greater consistency in numbers of constituents.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_187"></a>I remember going to a particular Boundary Commission inquiry in 1983, during the course of which it became quite clear that the Boundary Commission did not have constituent numbers in mind.

The amendment does not impose any responsibility on the Boundary Commission to take those things which distinguish one constituency from another into account. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, has referred to an archipelago of islands. The same could reasonably be said of seats in the north of England, which are 2,000 square miles&#151;one forty-seventh of the landmass of the United Kingdom.

<a name="60321-41_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   The maintenance of an equal number of electors per seat is obviously desirable in principle. It is clearly undesirable to have, as we have had in the past, inner-city constituencies with very small numbers of voters. On the other hand, I cannot go as far as supporting an amendment which says that equality of numbers must be put &quot;above all other considerations&quot;. It is a factor, but there are others, as the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, and my noble friend Lord Tyler have just said. They include geography; the fact that we must have constituencies of relatively small numbers in thinly-populated areas to avoid having gigantic constituencies; and some of the physical characteristics. It is desirable, where it is practical to do so without too greatly distorting the numbers, to ensure that constituencies are within the boundaries of a single county.
</p>

<a name="60321-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_189"></a>One of the examples of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, was the Isle of Wight, the largest constituency&#151;in population terms&#151;in the country. That is a difficult issue. If you were restricted by having numbers as the outstanding consideration, the Isle of Wight would end up having two constituencies, also involving a slice of the New Forest. That would be unsatisfactory, so the existing remit of the Boundary Commission is about right.

<a name="60321-41_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   This has been an interesting debate. In a sense, I wish we were having a separate debate on this; we have noble Lords with a great deal of experience, not least the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth. Noble Lords, perhaps from their experience of representation in another place, have a huge amount to contribute. I feel sadly wanting on both counts. Noble Lords tempt me to start a debate about voting systems and their purposes; believe it or not, I quite enjoy that. I will resist that temptation in order to make progress.

<a name="60321-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_190"></a>We have all paid tribute to the work of the Boundary Commission; it is a difficult job. I agree that there is no criticism intended by the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham; rather, she probes a fundamental principle behind it. I gather that the Boundary Commission for England will be publishing its review later this year, which I hope will address some of the apparent discrepancies in current voter issues.
</p>

<a name="60321-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_191"></a>I agree with much of what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said about the difficulty of the amendment. While we accept that electoral equality is an important factor, we agree that it should not be the <br>&nbsp;<br>

overriding one. Indeed, I have the same example as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart: the Isle of Wight. If we put this amendment into practice, about 30,000 residents of the Isle of Wight would be merged into a mainland constituency. If the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, can sell that to her noble friend the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley, good luck to her&#151;I know of that noble Baroness&#039;s long and distinguished connection with the Isle of Wight.
</p>

<a name="60321-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_192"></a>If we had strict adherence to the electoral quota as the sole consideration, then the parliamentary Boundary Commission would not be able to use the building blocks of county, London borough and district ward boundaries to create parliamentary constituencies. That would make the process of devising constituencies much more difficult. The 1986 Act also requires that the number of constituencies in Wales should not be less than 35; we calculate that the number of seats would be reduced from 40 to only 32.
</p>

<a name="60321-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_193"></a>Noble Lords suggested using the census, but the census also records people not eligible to vote. Because it is done every 10 years, I am not sure that it would help much. Noble Lords questioned whether we should have more frequent reviews. When we used to have more frequent reviews, I gather that it was deeply unpopular with our colleagues in another place&#151;I see noble Lords who have been MPs nodding&#151;because things kept changing. It is always a question of trying to strike a balance, which the current position probably does.
</p>

<a name="60321-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_194"></a>I understand the issues rightly raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, but it would be wrong to take one criterion and say that it was the only one, when issues of community and geography play a part. I hope that the noble Baroness will bring forward a separate debate on this issue&#151;perhaps on a Thursday&#151;as I think it would be worthy of a longer debate in your Lordships&#039; House, in which we could get into the detail and thrash out these issues more fully. I hope, on that basis, she is able to withdraw the amendment for today.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_195"></a>I hear the criticism of the words &quot;above all other considerations&quot;, and accept it.

is that they are very mobile. Areas of the country quickly get substantially larger populations, and constituency numbers thereby become quite distorted. We must somehow find a way of being slightly more flexible about constituencies, so that we maintain one of the most valuable parts of our parliamentary system&#151;having a representative Member of Parliament&#151;but representing the correct number of people; all Members of Parliament representing as equal a number of people as possible.

&quot;VOTING AGE

<br>
(1)   The 1983 Act shall be amended as follows&#151;

<p><a name="gc_st_128"></a>The noble Lord said: I did not move Amendment No. 96 because it seemed a minor amendment, whereas Amendment No. 97 is a major amendment and I thought it desirable to have proper time to debate it.

<a name="60321-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_201"></a>I recognise that Amendment No. 97 goes somewhat outside the aims of the Bill, introducing a fundamental change into our voting system by reducing the voting age from 18 to 16. That is clearly an important constitutional issue. The policy of reducing the voting age to 16 has been supported and pressed by the Liberal Democrats for some years. We believe that it is a change for which the time has now come.

<a name="60321-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_202"></a>At the age of 16, young people can leave school and get a job, on which they will pay taxes; they can join the Army; they can consent to sexual relationships; they can get married or enter into a civil partnership; consent to or refuse medical treatment; and when the Company Law Reform Bill, now before your Lordships&#039; House, goes through, they can even be appointed as company directors. Frankly, I was somewhat surprised at that, because it seems to me that being a company director needs more knowledge, judgment and sense of responsibility than voting.

</p>

<a name="60321-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_203"></a>From my own experience as a parliamentary candidate, I know that young people in years 12 and 13 are often the sharpest and most challenging audience that it is possible for a candidate to face. I remember an occasion when my Conservative opponent addressed what was then <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC123"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC123</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

called the sixth form of a secondary school as if they were a bunch of 10 or 12 year-olds, and was almost literally torn to pieces.
</p>

<a name="60321-41_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_204"></a>The young can, and now do, take responsibility for their own lives in many ways. Of course, they do not have the same degree of experience as those of us who are older&#151;in my case, much older&#151;but they make up for it with a willingness to question ideas which are in some cases taken for granted by older people, and their ability to learn more quickly. Anybody who has been the parent of children aged 16 or 17 knows that they are unlikely to vote for a candidate simply because one of their parents has told them to.
</p>

<a name="60321-41_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_205"></a>Furthermore, lowering the voting age will increase the interest of young people&#151;not just 16 and 17 year-olds&#151;in politics. We now have citizenship education in all secondary schools. Having the right to vote will make citizenship education not just theoretical, but real to the students. The vast majority of young people who stay on at school through year 13 will find that they have the right to vote in a local, Scottish or Welsh election before they leave school. Around half of them will have the right to vote at a general election if they continue to be held, as they have in the recent past, at four-year intervals.
</p>

<a name="60321-41_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_206"></a>Voting may even come to be regarded as a minor rite of passage. If we get young people to vote before they reach the age of 18, it is more likely that they will continue to vote after that age. That would help to reduce the appallingly low turnout, particularly in the 18 to 24-year age group, where the turnout at the last election was just over 30 per cent.

<a name="60321-41_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_207"></a>One of the recommendations of the recently published Power report&#151;from the committee chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws&#151;which was well received by the media, was to reduce the voting age to 16. The arguments for doing so are extremely strong; the arguments for not doing so are increasingly thin. As I said, the time for this amendment has come, and I beg to move.

<a name="60321-42_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Listowel:</b>  I apologise most sincerely for not being present when the noble Lord moved the amendment, but I just finished the Second Reading of the Childcare Bill. I believe that we have now reached the question of lowering the voting age to 16. I do not intend to speak to my amendment, but I appreciate what the noble Lord is seeking to do in engaging more young people in the political process, given the concern that many of them will not get an opportunity to vote until the age of 21.
</p>

<a name="60321-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_208"></a>My concern is particularly around the issue of criminal responsibility in this country, which at the age of 10 is the lowest in Europe except for Scotland. In Scotland, they have a very different way of treating children in law, which is much more sympathetic. Since 1997 we have lost a provision called <i>doli incapax</i>, which gave some protection to children. The danger in lowering the voting age is that it would encourage those, particularly those in the media, who are keen to demonise children. There is a problem of either placing children on a pedestal and highlighting their innocence <br>&nbsp;<br>

and vulnerability, or placing them in a pit and attacking them, not recognising that often vulnerable children cause trouble and so on.
</p>

<a name="60321-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_209"></a>For instance, in a recent meeting discussing vulnerable young asylum seekers, a Member of your Lordships&#039; House suggested lowering the age at which we call asylum seeking children &quot;minors&quot; to 16, because that would make people feel more sympathetic to their situation. There will be many who do not understand so well the questions of child development and will push for more vulnerable children to be treated harshly. That is my concern, and I am grateful for the opportunity to raise it. I respect what the noble Lord is driving at in the amendment, and I apologise for not highlighting my concerns to him beforehand. I also recognise the involvement of many young people in the campaign to lower the voting age. This is a very useful debate.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_130"></a>
<a name="60321-42_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Norton of Louth: </b>   I agree that it is a very useful debate and it is appropriate that I come in at this point to put a counter-argument to that of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. The noble Lord said that the Power report was well received; that is an interesting observation. It would be interesting to know who it was well received by, apart from the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart.
</p>

<a name="60321-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_210"></a>On the arguments deployed by the noble Lord, there is an important distinction to be made that was not made clear in his argument. Voting can be exercised directly, so when you lower the voting age to 16 you are therefore empowering 16 year-olds. With a lot of the things he mentioned, you are not empowering 16 year-olds but people who can select 16 year-olds for fulfilling certain purposes. He said that 16 year-olds can join the Army; that is not so much empowering 16 year-olds as empowering the Army, because you have to be selected. Mind you, when you are 16 you are not sent to the front, so that is a distinction between those aged 16 and those who are 18. Similarly, you can get married at 16, but only with parental consent. Again, there is a difference. If you lower the age at which you can become a company director to 16, you are not so much empowering 16 year-olds as empowering companies because a selection can be made from 16 year-olds. Similarly, on the amendment we are coming on to in lowering the qualifying age for election to public office, if you lower that age to 18 you are not empowering 18 year-olds, you are empowering the electorate because you widen the freedom of choice of electors of whom they can choose. The 18 year-old would still have to go through a certain process to achieve what they are being given. With 16 year-olds voting, that can be exercised directly. There is an important distinction to be drawn, which we need to recognise.
</p>

<a name="60321-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_211"></a>On the issue of whether the voting age should be lowered, you cannot use the argument that 16 year-olds can do other things for the reasons that I have just given, so we need some other basis for change. What could we draw on? Popular support? Opinion polls show that there is no popular support for the change. Today I received a briefing paper making the case for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC125"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column GC125</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

lowering the voting age, which engages in absolute contortions trying to avoid the fact that there is no popular support. Some say it was a loaded question; it was not a loaded question at all. All it found was that people who respond to consultations tend to support them, which is because those who support them want to reply to the exercise.
</p>

<a name="60321-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_212"></a>Is following the rest of Europe a criterion? On the whole, elsewhere it is 18 years old as well, so that is not a basis to depart from it. There has to be a compelling case to go against public opinion and practice elsewhere. I have not heard a compelling case for it. A line has to be drawn somewhere. If we are to move from 18 years old, what is the basis for it? I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, says. It is well intentioned and it would be nice if it had those effects. The problem is that there is no empirical evidence to sustain the argument. We need more in terms of substance to move away from it.
</p>

<a name="60321-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_213"></a>The arguments deployed so far, which are substantive, do not support the case. As I say, there is a key distinction to be drawn between exercising something directly&#151;in this case, empowering 16 year-olds&#151;and allowing 16 year-olds to be chosen to be selected to do other things, where you empower those doing the selection. That is a key distinction which we should not lose sight of. I am not persuaded that I have heard a compelling case for departing from the present situation.

<a name="60321-42_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   I intervene briefly to say that I have been confronted by very articulate 16 year-olds in the classroom challenging a Member of Parliament. Often, during a campaign, they put up a better argument than many other electors. The problem that I have is very simple&#151;parental bullying. It is a major problem which will arise if we extend the age to 16. Particularly in conditions of postal voting, the parent will fill in the form or will sit over the 16 year-old when the form is being filled in and, effectively, will fill in the form on behalf of the child. Parental bullying is an argument no one has addressed, but it is a debate that is going on nationally.

<a name="60321-42_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Tyler: </b>   In response to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, he has made a serious point which, of course, equally applies to the 18 years-old plus age group in many circumstances. It is not unknown for a spouse to exert quite a lot of pressure on his or her partner in such circumstances. If we are to abolish any pressure of that sort, a rather more comprehensive change in the law would be required.

<a name="60321-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_215"></a>She was reflecting on and responding to an important report from the Electoral Commission that demonstrated that not only are the 18 to 24 year-old age group not in the habit of voting, but also, as they get older, they still do not vote. It is a very important issue we all need to address. Young people may not be particularly interested in political institutions, but when they take an active interest in important political issues in school, which they do as part of the citizenship syllabus, they directly address those issues. They are told, &quot;You have now got a good balance for thinking about political issues, but of course you cannot do anything with it&quot;. We should address that.
</p>

<a name="60321-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_216"></a>I give the Government full credit for introducing into the syllabus an important area of new study, of which a lot of people have taken advantage. Teaching is improving all the time. I have a lot of experience of going into schools and I find that the 16 year-olds who have just come through the process are often more alive to real issues than their immediate elders who may not have had the benefit of it or have now become more specialist in their studies because of the imminence of other exams. We have to look very carefully at the way in which young people are introduced to political issues and then are given some influence over them. They may be only a small minority of the total electorate, but they are an important minority.
</p>

<a name="60321-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_217"></a>As my noble friend said, the percentage of those who voted in the previous two general elections in the youngest age group at present&#151;the 18 to 24 year-olds&#151;went down despite the figure for the electorate generally going up in 2005. It went down from 31 per cent in 2001 to about 30 per cent in 2005. That is a real problem. I do not expect the Minister to address it in the few minutes we have today, but I hope that all parties recognise that the problem needs to be addressed. We all need to try to find ways to deal with it.

<a name="60321-43_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   It is really straining the level of credulity to think that the percentage of voting will improve in this country if we cast it down to 16 year-olds. If we cannot attract 18 to 24 year-olds to vote, surely we will not attract 16 year-olds. What is wrong with the system at the moment is that people are not voting throughout. To say that if we give votes to 16 year-olds, that gives them an opportunity to get into the habit of voting and, hey presto, it will all get better, is beyond comprehension.
</p>

<a name="60321-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_218"></a>I have done my own straw poll of 16 year-olds. It is not very scientific, but they are not interested, basically. They have other things on their minds and they do not want to be burdened with what they see as yet another responsibility too far. Why should they? A whole list of things has been given that 16 year-olds can do. They can do those things or not, but the expectation is, if we lower the age to 16, or whatever age, that people will exercise that power and responsibility. It should be recognised that that is what <br>&nbsp;<br>

it is: it is a responsibility to cast your vote to elect a government of your country and to understand the implications of what you are doing.
</p>

<a name="60321-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_219"></a>I know many very articulate 16 year-olds. I agree that some of that age group are articulate because they have been led out of being afraid to discuss matters with adults, which was one of the problems of previous generations. But why would they now want generally to be able to vote? That would be placing far too much responsibility on what are, to all intents and purposes, still young people who have other things to do than politics. They need to be out and about; we need to listen to their perceptions; and they need to have the opportunity to drive us all mad. Those may not sound good reasons for me being against lowering the age to 16, but I do not think that that would have the slightest effect on increasing the vote either now or in future. The only thing that will generate interest is when politics are sparky and pointed and affect people, and people feel strongly that they have an effect on their lives, and, possibly, that politicians look as if they are upright and straightforward&#151;all the things that we know that they are and should be.
</p>

<a name="60321-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_220"></a>I accept that the polls suggest that 16 year-olds do not want to vote and have no intention of voting if they were given the vote. That is a step far too far and I shall certainly not support the amendment.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_222"></a>I acknowledge that that is within a smaller community and that they are heavily regulated, but, none the less, the experience of having a voice and taking part is one that children are capable of taking on at a very early age. Neither do I agree with my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth that public opinion as expressed by those who have the vote is necessarily the guide that we should follow. If there had been opinion polls when the franchise started to be expanded, restricted to those who had the franchise, we would have found large votes against almost every change. It was because political leaders chose to make a difference on the basis of what they understood to be right and good for those who did not have the vote that we have the franchise that we have now.

of interest in politics among 16 year-olds who are involved in the extremely boring citizenship courses that we imposed on them at present. I am of the mind that there is a lot else that we must do to engage pupils&#039; minds in the world around them by way of reforming the curriculum. It will not happen just because they are given the vote.
</p>

<a name="60321-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_224"></a>That is not where I am coming from in this debate. We must decide when we allow our children to have a voice in what is happening to them. Over the past 20 to 30 years, we have been heaping more and more responsibility on children. Not long ago, there was a case in which a girl well under the age of consent had a termination without the consent of her parents. If that is not putting responsibility on children, I do not know what is. There have been many other little ways in which we have been loading responsibility&#151;criminal responsibility or social responsibility&#151;on children, asking them to take decisions, effectively without the support of their parents or family.
</p>

<a name="60321-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_225"></a>When we have been doing that, we owe it to our children to consider whether we should give them the right to have a say. That is a right. We have given them the responsibilities that go with it. Should we be giving them the right? That is something that the Commons should have an opportunity to debate. They did not have that opportunity when they were considering the Bill, because the amendment was not selected for debate in Committee. I very much hope that the Liberal Democrats will give us a chance to send that question back to the Commons. If the Commons say no, I should not dream of arguing with them&#151;there is no danger of ping-ponging on this&#151;but we have reached the point where we need to consider this and to take a decision.
</p>

<a name="60321-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_226"></a>The very idea that we could say that children can be company directors, with the immense personal responsibility that that involves and, at the same time, deny them the vote, is totally ridiculous.

<a name="60321-43_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Norton of Louth: </b>   I respond to my noble friend by explaining my point. I was not saying that we should rely on public opinion. My point was that there are occasions on which we depart from public opinion. We should not be driven by it. However, if we are to depart from it, we must have a very clear reason for doing so to explain why that is the case. My point was that I have heard no compelling reason to move away from the current position. Yes, a balance must be drawn but, on my noble friend&#039;s last point, I return to my earlier point: there is a difference between becoming a company director, where an individual is chosen by the company for the particular skills that that person has that sets them apart from others; and giving everyone in that age group a right that they can exercise. There is a clear distinction between the two. If we are to move away from public opinion, there must be a compelling case and I have not heard it.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_228"></a>I do not think that the percentage of people voting is relevant here. I return to the point that I keep making: the most important thing in the world is not the proportion of people who voted; it is the opportunity given to those people who wish to vote and the opportunities that they take to vote. If the proportion of 16 and 17 year-olds who vote is lower than the average in the population, that is not an argument for or against votes at 16. The argument for or against votes at 16 rests on its merits as such, not on the outcome. As for bullying, valid points were made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, but the answer lies with postal voting, not with the age of the franchise. If we are talking about the age at which people are bullied, people aged 85 or 90 may get bullied more than anyone else.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_230"></a>However, more to the point, I have a real sense of <i>d&#233;j&#224; vu</i> about this debate. I remember that back in 1961&#151;which will be too far back for the noble Baroness to remember&#151;the National League of Young Liberals launched a campaign entitled, &quot;Votes at 18&quot;. Eventually&#151;in fact, not very long after; I think that it was in 1968 or thereabouts&#151;the Harold Wilson Government introduced votes at 18.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_142"></a>

<a name="60321-44_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   The noble Lord tells me that it was in 1969; it was certainly before the 1970 election.

</p>

<a name="60321-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_231"></a>The arguments that we used as we campaigned for votes at 18 back in the 1960s are exactly the same arguments as are being used now. Of course, it is a matter of judgment. No principle is involved as to what age is appropriate; it is a matter of pragmatic judgment. The principle is: how mature are people; how educated are people? We then make a judgment on that basis. I believe that, nowadays, people in their teens are on average substantially more educated and more mature than we were when we campaigned for votes at 18; and than whenever the franchise was first set at 21 for men.
</p>

However, I should say that when the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, launched a report into the rise in prisoner numbers, it highlighted that the number of children in custody had doubled over a 10-year period, at a time when crime overall had declined by 10 per cent.
</p>

<a name="60321-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_233"></a>The turning point with regard to the number of children in custody was the Bulger case. Media coverage of these matters is becoming more and more important in influencing government policies. Anti-social behaviour orders have resulted in children as young as 10 having their photograph, home address and school recorded in the local press. That is on occasion picked up by the tabloids and one sees photographs of children as young as 10 in their centre pages. We must remember that in Germany, where young people can vote at the age of 16, the age of criminal responsibility is 14. We need to be mature enough as a country to recognise the vulnerability of children and young people, not to demonise them and react in an overly harsh way, before we can afford to reduce the voting age.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_234"></a>It is interesting that the two noble Baronesses in the Committee&#151;I appreciate that they are aided by some Members of the Committee who happen to be men&#151;stand shoulder to shoulder in rejecting the amendment.

</p>

<a name="60321-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_235"></a>I shall try to deal with some of the issues that have been raised. When one considers lowering the voting age to 16, one has to ask: in order to do what? I am not suggesting for a second that this has been said in the Committee today, but it has certainly been said in other places, that one of the advantages of lowering the voting age would be to increase the numbers voting. Of course, we would probably decrease the percentage of the electorate who would vote. I am sure Members of the Committee agree with me that that is not a proposition that anyone could accept because, indeed, there is an issue of voter turnout&#151;there is a particular issue with regard to 18 to 24 year-olds&#151;which we must address by means other than seeking to expand the numbers of people who can vote, thereby increasing the specific numbers.
</p>

<a name="60321-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_236"></a>Members of the Committee have said that those young people might be more likely to carry on voting. I accept that it is important that young people get the opportunity to understand democracy. Indeed, Members of the Committee have paid tribute to the work that this Government have done on the citizenship agenda. When I had responsibility for that at the Department for Education and Skills, I was fairly knocked out by some of the things that were going on in schools. I refer to school councils where young people can participate and learn about democracy. However, I reject the principle that seems to lie behind the measure that there is a two-year dearth from when you end citizenship education at 16 to when you start voting at 18, during which you have no opportunity to be involved in your community. I do not think that is true. We always have to invite, and invest in, young people&#039;s involvement. However, I do not think that you can make the leap of saying that someone involved in citizenship education has to be able to vote at 16, and that they will lose the will to vote by the time they reach the age of 18 if they are not.

I live with a 16 year-old who will bitterly resent this when he reads it&#151;and a 14 year-old who will resent it even more&#151;they are children. There is a question in my mind about ensuring that children are allowed to develop their understanding and knowledge of democracy while not being expected necessarily to participate fully as voters, which I personally think goes alongside what we have in the Family Law Reform Act 1969, which states that the age of majority is 18 for certain purposes. This is a good example of such a purpose.
</p>

<a name="60321-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_238"></a>I do not accept that this is about the only way that young people can be involved as citizens in our country and that by letting them vote at 16 we necessarily capture them to vote later. I accept that there is a lot of work to be done in education for young people and ensuring that they participate in other ways in their community. I do not think that there is enough evidence, as the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, said, to suggest that we have reached a conclusion which is so overwhelming that we should take advantage of it.
</p>

<a name="60321-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_239"></a>This is something that we need to return to and to keep under review because it is an important issue. It is important to ensure that we recognise that we have young people who need to be involved in communities. I do not consider that attitude to be in the least bit patronising&#151;or matronising, as I prefer. I think it is realistic to recognise that 16 year-olds are 16 year-olds who need to participate properly, and at 18 they vote.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_240"></a>There has been a good deal of argument against us. However, of the speeches made on this group&#151;I am sure my noble friends will not object to my saying this&#151;the one I found most impressive was that of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. He is someone who, unlike us, comes from a party which does not have a policy of reducing the age of voting to 16.
</p>

<a name="60321-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_241"></a>Many arguments have been put forward in the other direction. I suspect strongly that the same arguments were put forward a few years ago when the voting age was reduced from 21 to 18. I do not think that anybody would suggest for a moment that it should be put up again. I see that the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, put that into his amendment. From what he said, it is clearly not something which he is proposing. Of course, that does not prove my case because at some age, clearly, it would be wholly inappropriate to give children or young people the vote. I would describe somebody who has reached the age of 16 as being a young person rather than a child. That is very much the general view now.
</p>

<a name="60321-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_242"></a>I believe there is a significant reaching of a stage at the age of 16. By that time, puberty, if not complete, is certainly well advanced. There is a recognition that the protection given to children is no longer appropriate or necessary in many respects.

irrelevant because they all refer to cases where young people are selected by others. That may, I suppose, apply to the case of directorships, although even there it may be that a 16 year-old could not only start a company but also appoint himself as a director. On looking at the responsibilities that young people of 16 are allowed to accept, they are trusted in many ways to look after their own lives. It is true that marriage under the age of 18 requires the magistrate&#039;s consent if parents refuse it, but that is not something much relied on these days. One hardly ever hears of cases where that happens.

<a name="60321-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_244"></a>If one considers a young person&#039;s ability to take a decision about their medical treatment or sexual activity, that shows that that is the age at which childhood ceases and they become something more&#151;a young person. Therefore, it is not only logical but appropriate to say that 16 is the age at which you should be entitled to take a decision about not only your health or sexual activity but how you vote. I cannot say that I am very worried by the prospect of parental bullying.

<a name="60321-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_246"></a>We have now reached a stage at which it is appropriate to reduce the voting age to 16. We will certainly bring the amendment back for further argument when we reach Report. Of course, we have not taken a final decision, but it is very likely that we will press it to a vote to make our position clear. I must tell the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that, on the basis of the views that we have heard from both the Government and the Conservative Front Bench, it is unlikely that we will be able to send it back to the House of Commons, but we will do our best.

lowered to 18 years. That is an argument that I have advanced in print, including in <i>Public Law</i> in 1980, so I am glad that this modest provision is being brought in. It is modest but very important. The principle, to which I referred earlier, is that of freedom of choice on the part of electors. By lowering the qualifying age, one is empowering electors through widening their freedom of choice. That leads me to the argument for the amendment. It is a narrow one which, I appreciate, was discussed in the other place, but it is one to which I want to return.
</p>

<a name="60321-45_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_253"></a>As I say, in practice, the consequences are limited, but there is a principle involved. The subsection provides that the candidate must have attained the age of 18 on the day on which the candidate is nominated. My amendment provides that the candidate must have attained the age of 18 on the day on which the election is held. I appreciate that the difference is a matter of days. It is unlikely to affect many people; it may affect none. However, there is always the possibility of a party wanting to nominate someone whose 18th birthday falls between the close of nominations and polling day&#151;most likely, in respect of local elections.

<a name="60321-45_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_254"></a>I realise that the argument employed against the amendment in the other place was that it would introduce a discrepancy between the law as it applies to Westminster and the law as it applies to the Greater London Authority and local elections, where the date of nomination is employed. The Government may want some standardisation. I appreciate that, but standardisation should be in favour of the day of election.

<a name="60321-45_para15"></a>

be disqualified. Therefore, we have chosen to put everything on the same day. I understand that there will be the occasional candidate for whom that will be a difficulty. But we have to choose one way to do this, and we think that the date on which nominations close is the right way. It is clear and unambiguous, and is the point when the determining factors of nominations and other issues of disqualification might apply. Therefore, for the moment we have chosen that date and will stick with it.

<a name="60321-45_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I support my noble friend&#151;so I will not disagree with him all day. Following on from my noble friend&#039;s logic, perhaps he will support me if I introduce an amendment on Report to reduce the figure to 16. Why should not the electors have the chance to choose a 16 year-old?

<a name="60321-45_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Norton of Louth: </b>   I can help my noble friend: there is a clear distinction to be drawn between the qualification age for election and the voting age. They should not go in tandem. If one age is to be lower than the other, it should be the qualification age for election, not the voting age, for the reason that I gave. If you lower the qualifying age to 18, you empower the electors. If you lower the voting age to 16, you empower 16 year-olds. There is a very clear difference. Furthermore, I would have no worry if we elected anyone at the age of 18. In the context of the history of this country, it would not be exceptional. Some MPs were elected underage prior to the passage of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60321-45_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_257"></a>I hear what the Minister says. I appreciate her point about making a choice between one or the other. For the reasons that I gave, on principle I would lower it. But, as she said, there is only 11 days difference. I stick by the argument. I favour mine, but I understand what she said. We do not need to pursue this today. I just want to put it on record on principle. I also want to take the opportunity to welcome very much indeed the lowering of the qualification age for election. I am all for pushing it further. The electors should be able to choose whomever they wish. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="60321-46_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Aviation: Price Control Review</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="60321-46_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Alistair Darling) has made the following Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>My department has responded to the Civil Aviation Authority&#039;s price control review consultation. The response makes the following points:
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The economic regulation of London airports is, in general, supported by users. Regulation is designed to further the interests of airport users, promote efficient operation of airports and encourage investment in new airport facilities.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>Air travel is essential to the United Kingdom&#039;s economy and to our continued prosperity. Airports are a key part of the country&#039;s strategic transport infrastructure and are important drivers of regional growth and employment. For these reasons, securing the delivery of the White Paper <i>The Future of Air Transport</i> (Cm 6046) remains central to government policy. This is most urgent in the south-east of England, where the White Paper recommends two additional runways be provided by 2030, with the first to be delivered as soon as possible at Stansted.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>The Government therefore support the view, recently expressed by the CAA, that it is important that any owner of a London airport should recognise the significant near- and medium-term investment requirements. This is likely to require the maintenance of credit quality sufficient to ensure the cost-effective financing of future investment.

</p>

<a name="60321-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>The Government welcome the CAA&#039;s approach to the equitable sharing of surface access costs between aviation users and the public sector. The White Paper makes clear the importance of airport operators making a proportionate contribution to the costs of any road or rail improvements catering for airport-related traffic. The Government are actively considering these issues in respect of the London airports, and will keep the CAA informed.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>There will be a presentation by the commission on measures to support the poultry sector, as a result of the economic impact on the poultry market due to the consumer reactions to avian influenza. Consumption of poultry in several member states has fallen, despite scientific advice that there is no food safety risk from properly cooked poultry meat.

</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>There will be discussion of a French memorandum calling for more simplification of the CAP and the introduction of new measures for the management of market risks and crises. I will stress the importance of avoiding new EU measures which contradict the market direction of recent reforms of the common agricultural policy.

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="60321-46_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Don Touhig) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>The <i>Departmental Strategy for the Defence Estate 2006&#151;In Trust and On Trust</i> will be published today. It builds on the robust foundations and achievements of <i>In Trust and On Trust: The Strategy for the Defence   Estate</i>, published in June 2000&#151;the first comprehensive strategy for the management and use of the Ministry of Defence&#039;s estate&#151;but it recognises new challenges and aspirations. The strategy will continue to deliver a more efficient and effective estate and ensure that the Ministry of Defence targets resources to the estate in the most effective way. Copies will be made available in the Library; it will also be available via the MoD website at www.mod.uk.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>The strategy is aimed at all estate stakeholders, and the Ministry of Defence has consulted closely with external stakeholders who have an interest in the defence estate. The primary challenge is to produce an estate that enables the Armed Forces to counter new and existing threats, and to respond effectively to the changing demands and requirements placed upon them.

This is a far-reaching document which will be of benefit to all those with an interest in the Ministry of Defence&#039;s estate.

The publication of the report implements the commitment in the defence estate strategy <i>In Trust & On Trust</i> to report annually performance across a range of estate-related objectives, and to demonstrate that the department is discharging its obligations properly and acting responsibly in meeting the needs of the Armed Forces. The report attempts to balance:

<a name="60321-46_head3"></a><h3 align=center>Northern Ireland: Review of Public Administration</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="60321-46_spmin3"></a><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Lord Rooker): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Peter Hain) has made the following Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>I am today announcing the final outcome of the Review of Public Administration (RPA) in Northern Ireland. My previous announcement of 22 November 2005 dealt with local government, education and the major health and social services bodies. Today I want to deal with the remaining executive agencies and public bodies, as well as a number of residual issues carried forward from the 22 November announcement.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>In addition to the major organisations in local government, health and social services, and education there is a plethora of other bodies that fulfil a variety of roles in the overall system of public administration. These include 15 executive agencies, 39 executive and 16 advisory non-departmental public bodies or quangos and 11 tribunals: a total of 81 public bodies.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>A variety of views were expressed in the consultation process on the future of these executive agencies and public bodies. However, in general, the responses <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS26"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column WS26</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reflected a concern about the number of public bodies and recognition of the need for improved accountability. While it is acknowledged that there is a role for quangos in the future arrangements for public administration in Northern Ireland, it is accepted that these should be retained or established only when there are clear advantages to the arm&#039;s-length relationship.

</p>

<a name="60321-46_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>I have now had time to reflect on all the evidence and to take account of the views of the major stakeholders, including local government, to which significant extra functions will be transferred as a result of today&#039;s decisions. In order to streamline public administration, clarify accountability, and ensure public services are easily accessible and customer-focused, the total number of these bodies remaining will be reduced from 81 to 53. Taken together with the decisions that I announced in November 2005, this means an overall reduction in public bodies in Northern Ireland from 154 to 75&#151;51 per cent. The changes announced in November and today will result in savings in excess of &#163;200 million per      annum, and demonstrate the Government&#039;s commitment to cutting waste and strengthening front-line services in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>The changes I am announcing today will be achieved, in the main, by merging bodies or transferring complete functions to local government or central government. Many of the remaining bodies will have reduced responsibilities through some of their functions transferring to local government. All the bodies that remain will be required to work with councils in the community planning process. Functions that are transferred to local government will be accompanied by an equivalent transfer of funding. To achieve this, a new system of local government financing will be developed.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>Where there are a number of bodies carrying out related functions we propose to merge these into one new organisation, streamlining the delivery of those functions and saving overheads. There will be a new land and property services agency that will incorporate the valuation & lands, rate collection, land registers and ordnance survey agencies. Similarly, in the area of the environment and heritage, key functions are currently spread across the Environment and Heritage Service and the Rivers Agency, supported by four advisory bodies: the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside, the Historic Buildings Council, the Historic Monuments Council and the Drainage Council. On 28 February 2006 we launched an independent review of environmental governance, which we expect to result in the creation of an independent agency to deliver a comprehensive range of environmental functions.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>I am also announcing the establishment of a new regional library authority that will have responsibility for all libraries across Northern Ireland. It will have the capacity to develop the service beyond purely educational needs, providing a valuable resource for the wider community and recognising that the library has cultural, recreational and community roles.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS27"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column WS27</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60321-46_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>Other bodies will merge into existing organisations reducing overheads and facilitating better joined-up working. The Northern Ireland Events Company will become part of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board; the Pig Production Development Committee will become part of the Livestock and Meat Commission, and five existing health bodies&#151;Health Estates, the Central Services Agency, the Mental Health Commission, the Practice and Education Council for Nursing and Midwifery, and the Medical and Dental Training Agency&#151;will be merged into the new health and social services structures. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency will merge with the Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency, and the Construction Industry Training Board will amalgamate with the ConstructionSkills sector skills council.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>Other functions will be transferred to either central or local government, not only streamlining these functions but also clarifying lines of accountability. The functions of the Public Records Office, the Fisheries Conservancy Board and the civil service&#039;s internal consultancy service will transfer to their parent central government departments. The Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority and the Fire Authority for Northern Ireland will transfer to local government, as will the Local Government Staff Commission once the new councils have been established. The delivery of rural development functions will also transfer to local government while the remaining policy development functions of the Rural Development Council will transfer to central government. Similarly the functions of the Northern Ireland Museums Council will transfer to local and central government. Once the new councils are established consideration will be given to the transfer of ILEX to the new council in the north-west. The functions of the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board will transfer to the equivalent GB body, whose remit will be extended.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>A further number of bodies will cease to exist. These are: the Northern Ireland Housing Council, the Agriculture Wages Board and Enterprise Ulster.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a>Finally, local government will receive additional functions, and the accompanying funding, from some of the bodies that will remain. Some of the funding currently administered by the Arts Council and the Sports Council will become the responsibility of local government, as will some of the functions of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Invest Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a>We believe that housing is essentially a local issue and for that reason we will consider the transfer of housing to local government at a future date, once the new councils are in place, fully operational and bedded in. In the meantime, however, while the Northern Ireland Housing Executive will remain, some of its non-core functions will transfer to local government when the new councils are established in 2009.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>In recognition of the significant strengthening of local government in the context of a smaller number of councils, I have reconsidered my earlier decision to reduce the overall number of councillors to 50 per <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS28"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column WS28</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

council, giving a total of 350. Instead, the order that I will put before Parliament to direct the Local Government Boundary Commissioner, who will make the recommendation on the final number of wards for each council, will be on the basis of approximately 60 councillors per council, thus increasing overall councillor numbers to around 420 compared with 582 now.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>It is essential that, for those public bodies which remain, accountability is clear. For the future, all board members will be appointed under the guidelines laid down by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. Public bodies are accountable to their sponsoring Minister and through that Minister to the Assembly or Parliament. Board members must be chosen solely on the basis of the skills and expertise necessary to do the job. All appointments are to be made on merit and no one should be appointed to any position solely because they hold a particular position in another organisation.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a>There are a number of tribunals in Northern Ireland which deal with employment disputes and appeals arising from certain decisions taken by government departments and other public bodies. These are mainly funded and provided with administrative support by the department responsible for the relevant area of policy. These arrangements have been considered in the light of reforms in England and Wales and of concerns about the independence of tribunals under their current administrative relationships with departments. To secure greater independence and more streamlined administration, responsibility for the administration of those tribunals currently sponsored by departments will transfer to the Northern Ireland Court Service as part of a new courts and tribunals service.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>All my decisions have been underpinned by consideration of the implications for equality, social need, good relations, human rights and rural communities. The local administration arrangements will provide an anchor for <i>A Shared Future</i> and ensure that good relations actions are earthed in the needs of local communities. There are clear expectations that my decisions will lead to improved accessibility to public services&#151;particularly for the most vulnerable in our society&#151;improvements in the diversity of people who participate in public life, and fair treatment for staff. I believe that these three issues should be a central part of the decisions taken within organisations, sectors and across the public sector as a whole during implementation.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a>The decisions I have announced on the RPA will cut costs and transfer resources from bureaucracy to front-line delivery of key public services.
</p>

<a name="60321-46_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a>I have today published a summary of the full range of decisions flowing from the RPA. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House. All the evidence gathered as part of the research that led to the final decisions is published on the review website at www.rpani.gov.uk.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a>When a person moves their pension rights from one scheme to another, a cash value is put on those pension rights and that cash sum is passed from one scheme to the other.
</p>

<a name="60321-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a>The Government have delegated to the actuarial profession the responsibility for specifying the framework within which actuaries must work when advising pension scheme trustees on the calculation of transfer values.
</p>

<a name="60321-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a>Recently the actuarial profession consulted on changes to its guidance on the calculation of transfer values. The consultation gave rise to a significant difference of view on the way forward.

<p><a name="wms_st_7"></a>
<a name="60321-47_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Lord Rooker): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Peter Hain) has made the following Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60321-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a>With the introduction of a new tax regime for   pensions from 6 April of this year, it will be necessary for pension schemes to be registered with HM Customs and Revenue before receiving tax privileges. As a result of the discrete way in which the current pension scheme for the Police Service of Northern Ireland was established, the scheme will be registered separately from the scheme for officers serving in home forces in Great Britain. To coincide with the tax changes, three new police pension schemes are being introduced from April 2006. As a result, officers transferring between Northern Ireland and Great Britain on or after 6 April would not be able to remain in the current pension scheme arrangements as these will be closed to new members from that date. As matters now stand, officers wishing to continue to contribute to a police pension would be obliged to move into one of the new schemes on transfer.
</p>

<a name="60321-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a>In view of the need to ensure that currently serving police officers can continue to move between the PSNI and GB police forces as at present, the Government, in consultation with Scottish Ministers, have decided that the current police pension schemes across the United Kingdom should be unified. I therefore intend <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS30"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column WS30</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to seek parliamentary approval to amend the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 and the Police Pensions Act 1976 to allow the pension schemes to be formally merged. This will allow officers serving at present who transfer on or after 6 April to remain in the current pension scheme on permanent transfer, should they so wish. This will apply to police officers serving in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland who are members of the current pension scheme on 6 April.
</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a>Later this year serving officers will have the opportunity to move across to a new police pension scheme. Today&#039;s announcement is to clarify the position for those officers who might not wish to join a new police pension scheme, but who may wish to apply for posts elsewhere in the United Kingdom to gain experience or promotion.
</p>

<a name="60321-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a>After the current pension schemes in Northern Ireland and Great Britain have been merged, police officers in post before 6 April would be able to transfer from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, and vice versa, without having to move into the new pension arrangements. However, as the parliamentary process necessary to merge the schemes will take some time, the Government propose that officers transferring between the PSNI and GB forces in the interim will be able to do so under conditions which enable them to remain in the current arrangements. It is envisaged that these interim transfer conditions will last up to three years.

<a name="60321-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a>My Statement of 20 March set out the way forward for the East Midlands, South East and Eastern regions. This followed similar Statements on 6 February and 3 March, which set out the way forward for Wales and three English regions: the North East, the North West and the West Midlands. I now have the professional policing and financial assessments to enable me to identify which option will be of the greatest benefit to the Yorkshire and the Humber region. I am therefore today meeting the representatives from the police forces and authorities in this area and, as with the other force and authorities, I will be inviting them to engage closely with me to consider taking forward the option for policing which I believe will be of greatest benefit to their communities. I will be inviting the police authorities concerned to respond by 7 April and I shall then make a final decision on how to proceed in this area.

<a name="60321-47_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Derek Twigg) has made the following Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60321-47_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a>I am today announcing the conclusions of the review of the Northern Rail franchise. Copies of the consultant&#039;s report detailing their review will be placed in the House Library.
</p>

<a name="60321-47_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a>Northern Rail, one of the largest franchises, provides services across the north-east, north-west and Yorkshire and Humber. Passenger journeys have grown by 10 per cent in the past 12 months, and now stand at more than 71 million passenger journeys each year, and public performance measure is currently 89 per cent.
</p>

<a name="60321-47_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a>The projected public subsidy is &#163;2.4 billion (in 2004 prices) for the 8&#190; year period of the contract. Collectively, the five northern passenger transport executives (PTEs) are co-signatories to the agreement and sponsor the majority of northern services.
</p>

<a name="60321-47_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a>The Strategic Rail Authority initiated a review in March 2005 with the purpose of reviewing the current timetable, which had not changed over several years, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS32"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column WS32</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to ensure it meets present-day demand and secures value for money for the taxpayer.
</p>

<a name="60321-47_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a>The review started with a comprehensive assessment of the franchise in its present form. It looked at the different markets served, current and future demand, revenue, costs, the number of trains being used and funding arrangements. It considered options for cost changes.
</p>

<a name="60321-47_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a>The review found that the franchise operates efficiently, with its trains allocated to meet the needs of peak-time travel into the major towns and cities.
</p>

<a name="60321-47_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a>It found that revenue through fares, at 11p per passenger mile is lower than for comparable rail operators. In the PTE areas, which account for 72 per cent of passenger journeys, the figure is as low as 8p per passenger mile.
</p>

<a name="60321-47_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a>In the light of these findings, and the growth that the franchise is currently experiencing, the department has concluded that there is no compelling case for amending the current timetable or allocation of rolling stock. Service patterns will not change as a result of this review. The current levels of subsidy are also unaffected by this review.
</p>

<a name="60321-47_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a>There has been concern within the regions affected that the service review would lead to service cuts and fail to support predicted growth and economic development. We are committed to supporting current and future rail services in this franchise area and across the rail network. We will continue to work closely with Northern Rail and passenger transport executives to make sure that services meet future demand and that government policy for the regions is supported.

<p><a name="wa_qn_0"></a>
<a name="60321w01_wqn0"></a><b> The Countess of Mar </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>What is the progress of the study being conducted by the Health and Safety Laboratory on mortality and cancer incidence in a large cohort of pesticide sprayers recruited from those qualifying through the scheme operated by the National Proficiency Test Council; and how many participants have been lost from the cohort since its inception.  [HL4550]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="60321w01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </b>  The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) established the Pesticide Users Study in 1996 to provide information on cancer and causes of death in professional users of agricultural pesticides and other plant protection products, and to provide a database of individuals who could help with other research into the safety of pesticides.
</p>

<a name="60321w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>The study aims to recruit as many volunteers as possible from those obtaining a certificate of proficiency in England and Wales in the professional use of these pesticides. Their details are submitted to the National Health Service Central Register (NHSCR), which notifies the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL) about those who develop cancer or die. The type of cancer and cause of death are notified too. Forty-three per cent (66,000) of those awarded a certificate have volunteered to take part and 80 per cent. of them have been identified successfully by the NHSCR. Of these, 1,725 have developed a cancer and 1,542 have died of cancer or some other cause.
</p>

<a name="60321w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>The current focus of the study is on collecting information from participants about their past use of different pesticides, rather than on analysing the cancer incidence and cause of death data. In 2004 a rolling programme of surveys of their use of pesticides and of measures to mitigate exposure commenced. The Health and Safety Laboratory expects to complete this task by November 2007.

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_1"></a>What action they are taking to prevent the importation of illegal or counterfeit agrochemicals.  [HL4608]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_2"></a>
<a name="60321w01_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b>  Neither the UK nor EU pesticides legislation deals with the importation of pesticides per   se. But under Article 3 of Directive 91/414/EEC and    Regulation 6 of the Control of Pesticides (Amendment) Regulations 1997, for a pesticide to be stored, supplied, used, etc. in the UK, it must hold an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WA24"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2006 : Column WA24</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

approval here for those purposes. This requirement applies irrespective of whether the product concerned is manufactured in the UK or is imported there.
</p>

<a name="60321w01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>The pesticide controls are enforced in the UK by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) on farms and by the HSE and the appropriate local authority at the distributor and retailer level. All cases of alleged infringement of the regulations are followed up by the Pesticides Safety Directorate as the principal UK regulatory authority. With this in mind the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs currently has in hand two important cases concerning the illegal importation of pesticides, which will shortly be heard in the courts.
</p>

<a name="60321w01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a>In addition, the Pesticides Safety Directorate is consulting the European Commission, and through it other member states, about improving and clarifying the guidelines on the import of pesticides.

The Government will, however, make provisions under the transitional arrangements for registered HMOs that meet the requirements of the new licensing arrangements to be passported into the licensing scheme for the remaining term of their existing registration.

<p><a name="wa_st_32"></a>
<a name="60321w04_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   Section 56 of the Housing Act provides for local authorities to make designations for additional licensing schemes to extend houses in multiple occupation (HMO) licensing beyond the scope of mandatory licensing to smaller properties in their area. However, before making such designations, authorities are required to consult with those likely to be affected by the designation and take account of any representations received.

The IDeA also facilitated some regional joint events for local authority staff and landlords, which attracted more than 600 delegates and involved input from a range of private landlord organisations. The events also provided an opportunity for the two groups to talk constructively about approaches to licensing, including the consultation process for additional licensing.

<p><a name="wa_st_33"></a>
<a name="60321w04_spmin6"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Baroness Andrews): </b>  The 2003 English House Condition Survey estimated that 1 million privately rented homes fell below the decent homes standard&#151;47 per cent. of all privately rented homes, compared to 31 per cent. of all homes. The 2003 survey also estimated that 226,000 privately rented homes were unfit for human habitation&#151;10 per cent. of all privately rented homes compared to 5 per cent. of all homes. This shows substantial improvement from 1996, when 1.25 million privately rented homes (62 per cent) were non-decent and 337,000 homes (17 per cent) were unfit. As part of the drive to improve standards, the implementation of the Housing Act 2004 will, from 6 April, make new provisions for the health and safety of all residential accommodation and for the licensing of larger houses in multiple occupation.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_34"></a>The radiation dose required to produce a digital radiographic image is approximately the same as the film-based radiation dose. Digital radiography has an added advantage where, if the operator should misjudge slightly the size of the patient, the detector unit compensates for this and ultimately can save a repeat procedure, which means no extra radiation dose.

<a name="60321w07_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b>  The exercise conducted in the Channel Tunnel in the early morning of January 15 was one of a series of such exercises, normally conducted about annually, to test the response of railway staff and the emergency services in Britain and France to major incidents in the tunnel resulting from accidents or terrorist acts. They are useful in ensuring that emergency procedures are regularly practised and identifying areas where those procedures could be refined.
</p>

<a name="60321w07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_38"></a>All volunteer participants had reached the surface within four and a half hours of the emergency being declared. The evacuation on this occasion took longer than might have been expected because the chosen scenario introduced a variety of new emergency procedures that needed to be thoroughly tested. The exercises also assumed that the triage of &quot;casualties&quot; takes place in the service tunnel, and all casualties are assessed and receive initial first aid in situ before being moved out, in an orderly fashion, to hospital. The service tunnel provides a safe refuge where passengers can congregate and be looked after until it is possible to remove them to the surface. The speed of the evacuation to the surface is therefore not necessarily an important parameter.

The contribution, estimated at &#163;7.4 million for 2005&#150;06, is, however, expected to rise to around &#163;8 million in 2006&#150;07. This increase reflects the construction costs of the combined head office and depot facility in Dun Laoghaire for the Commissioners of Irish Lights, after allowing for the estimated proceeds from the sale of the existing building in Dublin, expected to be returned to the GLF during 2006&#150;07. The Irish Government will contribute 35 per cent. towards the cost of the project.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_67"></a><i>Letter from Dr Malcolm McKibbin to Lord Laird, dated 16 March 2006.</i>
</p>

<a name="60321w08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_68"></a>You recently asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government a Parliamentary Question about what proposals they have to increase the provision of bus lanes in Belfast.
</p>

<a name="60321w08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_69"></a>I have been asked to reply as the issue falls within my responsibility as chief executive of Roads Service.
</p>

<a name="60321w08_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_70"></a>As you will be aware, the provision of quality bus corridors (QBCs) on all the main radial roads in Belfast is one of a number of initiatives identified in the Regional Transportation Strategy (RTS). These proposals, which include the provision of bus priority measures to improve bus journey times and reliability, improvements to the quality and frequency of bus services and the provision of high-quality shelters and passenger information, are intended to make travel by bus an attractive alternative to the private car.
</p>

<a name="60321w08_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_71"></a>The Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan, launched on 30 November 2004, is a &quot;daughter&quot; document to the RTS. It sets out the detailed transportation proposals for the greater Belfast area up to 2015 and expands the detail of the proposed RTS initiatives, including the introduction of QBCs on 14 of Belfast&#039;s arterial routes and on two orbital routes.
</p>

<a name="60321w08_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_72"></a>We are working with Translink to deliver an agreed QBC programme that will be implemented, in stages, over the next five years. While it is not possible to <br>&nbsp;<br>

quantify exactly the number or extent of further bus priority measures until the necessary traffic modelling, costing and appraisal work has been completed, you may be aware that Roads Service has already provided 65 separate bus lanes (totalling approximately 29 kilometres in length) in Belfast. During 2006&#150;07, we propose to introduce a further six kilometres of bus lanes on the motorway hard shoulders and on the Shankill Road.

<p><a name="wa_st_61"></a>
<a name="60321w09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The Commission has not yet made a proposal to mandate the use of headlamps during daylight hours. The Government oppose such compulsory use, except where required by poor visibility. While improved vehicle conspicuity is desirable, compulsory daytime headlamps might adversely affect the relative daytime visibility of pedestrians and cyclists. In addition, motorcyclists currently enhance their daytime conspicuity, on a voluntary basis, by using dipped-beam headlamps. If all vehicles were illuminated this advantage might be reduced or disappear. Constant headlamp use by all vehicles would also increase fuel costs and CO2 pollution. Dedicated low-wattage daytime running lights (DRLs) rather than headlamps might meet some of these concerns but we would still oppose compulsory use.
