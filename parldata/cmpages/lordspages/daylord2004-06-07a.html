<a name="40607-01_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Royal Mail</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What steps they are taking to ensure the satisfactory delivery of post by the Royal Mail.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, Royal Mail is currently undertaking a complete restructure of the business with the full backing of the Government. This is a huge undertaking for the company. I understand that, for the most part, the change has gone reasonably smoothly and is now working well. There have been some problems in certain areas and Royal Mail has apologised for the fall in service. Royal Mail has drawn up detailed plans to tackle these problems and DTI Ministers have Allan Leighton&#039;s personal assurance that these will be implemented vigorously.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that he has been misinformed? Nothing is going smoothly and it has not been going smoothly for many months. The Royal Mail is a national disgrace. I do not accept the figures that have been given. Is it not fraudulent for Royal Mail to charge people for a first-class stamp when it knows for certain that in many cases there is no hope of completing a first-class delivery?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I think that the noble Baroness should be a little reserved about dismissing the figures. They are externally verified. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_2"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The position is that the Post Office has rightly identified that its target was for 93 per cent of first-class mail to be delivered the next day and it hit only 90 per cent. It has apologised for falling short of that target. In other respects, the process of major restructuring in any company as large as this is bound to cause some difficulties in the short term.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Clarke of Hampstead: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a former postman with more than 50 years&#039; experience of the Post Office. Is the Minister aware that it is the dedicated workforce, especially the regular delivery officers, who are bearing the brunt of the criticism&#151;which is justified in many cases&#151;and that they receive insults on the doorstep because of the deteriorating service? Does he agree that the increasing use of untrained, straight-from-the-agency staff to deliver people&#039;s important mail is causing widespread delay and misdeliveries? As the Government wholly own the Post Office, should they not be using their influence to halt the obscenity of paying senior managers vast bonuses for their failures?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend that the vast majority of full-time postmen discharge their responsibility successfully and conscientiously. As he has indicated, there have been problems with regard to the employment of casual labour, which has been necessary because it is extremely difficult to recruit postmen in certain parts of the country. On the more general issue of pay and bonuses, the senior figures in the Post Office forsook their bonuses, except in the area of the financial target. It is in the area of the financial target that they have been successful. In all other areas, they did not receive bonuses.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   My Lords, has the Minister read the report by his noble friend Lord Sawyer, which was circulated in the past 24 hours, on the question of labour relations within the Post Office? If he has read it, would he not agree that his somewhat optimistic statement to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_3"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 3</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the noble Baroness regarding improvements in the Post Office, particularly in the Royal Mail, is perhaps undeserved?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, in a service industry like the Royal Mail, the relations between staff in the organisation are crucial. Last year was a bad year and, without any doubt at all, it contributed to the significant failure of the Post Office to hit certain targets. There is clear room for improvement. Assurances have been given to the Government that it is the area on which the management intend to put the highest priority.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Wright of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, I recall reading in the press about two months ago that Royal Mail had decided to revert to the excellent practice of putting the time of the last post into the slot on post boxes. Does the Minister know when this will start?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I had voluminous briefing for this Question but not a single reference to that particular point. The noble Lord has clearly indicated something that the Post Office ought to consider and we will make sure that his comments will be referred to it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Dubs: </b>   My Lords, will my noble friend confirm that even if there are difficulties with mail deliveries in some parts of the country&#151;London may be an example&#151;there are other parts of the country where the service is excellent; for example, in Cumbria? It is much to the dismay of postal workers in those parts of the country that they are being tarnished by the kind of allegations that have been made from the Benches opposite. There continues to be an excellent service in those parts of the north of England with which I am familiar.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is right that across the vast range of the country postmen are fulfilling their duties with the conscientiousness for which we have always respected them. There are one or two areas where there have been very considerable difficulties. At least one of those areas is one where there is a heavy movement of mail; namely; London. Last year, that contributed to the failure of certain aspects of the postal service.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Inglewood: </b>   My Lords, having heard the Minister&#039;s fulsome confidence in the future performance of the Post Office, can he assure the House that the cheque in the post will come more quickly than it has in the past?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is one of those fortunate beings who receives cheques in the post. Many of us envy him.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, although it is good that my noble friend the Minister says that Post Office directors forwent bonuses last year in relation to delivery, they still received bonuses for financial performance. Financial <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_4"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 4</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

performance is clearly important, but with delivery performance as appalling as it still is in some parts of the country, surely they should not receive any bonuses at all.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I think the chairman of the Post Office is all too well aware of my noble friend&#039;s sentiment in this respect; he made it clear that he was not prepared to accept a bonus. However, there would be no point in having targets and bonuses attached to targets if the bonuses were not paid when the target was hit. As I indicated earlier, the financial target was hit. That was the area in which the bonus was paid.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   My Lords, following the noble Lord&#039;s first&#151;very polite, but perhaps somewhat complacent&#151;Answer, and as he spoke a little later about London, is he aware that in the postal district where my office is located&#151;in London W1, where there are loads of solicitors, accountants and professional people&#151;the Royal Mail&#039;s target is to deliver the mail between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., and that that is all? Does the Minister really think that delivering on such unrealistically low targets is what could be called a proper delivery service?
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40607-01_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, there has been widespread recognition of the fact that the Royal Mail has moved to one delivery. That made financial sense because 20 per cent of its resources were being devoted to a delivery of only 4 per cent of the mail. The noble Baroness has identified the fact that the service needs to be improved&#151;the chairman made it absolutely clear in his meeting with Ministers that he regards that as the top priority&#151;and she is quite right. In parts of the London area the service has not been satisfactory and the Post Office recognises that fact.

<a name="40607-02_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Freedom of Information Act 2000: Implementation</h3>

<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="40607-02_time0"></a><h5></h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord McNally </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Whether preparations for the implementation in 2005 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 will include provision for a fee structure for access to government information; and what the level of fees will be.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Lord Filkin): </b>  Yes, my Lords, the Government will bring forward fees regulations under the Act in good time for their coming into effect in January 2005. We have published draft regulations, and we will be bringing forward to Parliament a final version by October.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that a fee structure that charged exorbitant fees for freedom of information would in fact be the freedom to dine at the Ritz? Does he not grow more concerned <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_5"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 5</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

every day about how far we have moved from those heady days when the noble Lord, Lord Clark of Windermere, brought forward his wonderful White Paper which cost him his job in the Cabinet? There was a commitment to freedom of information and to removing the culture of secrecy from Whitehall, in contrast to the position today when the culture of secrecy is firmly embedded in the Government.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord on his first point. A fee structure that acted in any way as a significant deterrent to people making use of their rights under the Act would go against the spirit and purpose of the Act. As for dining at the Ritz, I do not know whether that was an invitation, but I shall consult the <i>Ministerial Code</i> about it. As for the thrust of the noble Lord&#039;s question and the possibility that he has inferred from, I think, a wholly erroneous report in the <i>Guardian </i>that the Government are in some way negative or ambiguous about the importance of freedom of information in strengthening democratic participation, he is wrong. We will demonstrate that as the Act is implemented.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Henley: </b>   My Lords, has the Minister made any estimates on behalf of the Government as to how many new civil servant jobs will be required for this?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, the best answer would be to make it quite clear that the Treasury says that no additional money will be made available to departments as part of fulfilling their obligations under freedom of information. The noble Lord can draw his own conclusion from that answer.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, on that commitment to freedom of information, when I sat on the Select Committee that looked into freedom of information we took evidence from Canada and Ireland which was very strongly in favour of training civil servants in the run-up to implementation of the Act. What training programmes are the Government currently implementing?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I cannot do justice to the scale of that question now, but I would be genuinely happy to have a discussion with the noble Lord to talk about it in more detail. In short, we are reviewing the matter with all government departments. I have had face-to-face discussions with every department about its implementation plans, and part of the review mechanism of course includes their training plans to ensure that all civil servants are properly trained. There is a judgment to be made about how soon one does that. One has to ensure at this point that there is general awareness, while delivering the high-pressure training nearer to the deadline date.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Henley: </b>   My Lords, in response to the question I asked, can the Government therefore confirm that the costs will be borne entirely by those making inquiries under the Act? Therefore, perhaps the noble Lord, Lord McNally, was right in suggesting that this may be a case of dining at the Ritz.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   No, my Lords, neither suggestion is correct. The Government&#039;s position has always been <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_6"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 6</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as it was at the point of the Bill&#039;s passage: we shall see that the cost of handling information requests is borne substantially by public sector bodies, as is right and proper. How the conundrum is squared between that and the Treasury position is not difficult; a normal part of officials&#039; responsibilities is to respond to requests from the public for information. The only caveat is, and has always been, the cap on the amount of time and effort that we will put into very obscure or complex requests, as was made clear when the Bill was passed.

<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Ezra </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>What is their response to recent uncertainty in the oil market.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, oil is traded in international markets, and it is not for the Government to intervene directly. However, I repeat the sentiments of the statement made by the Finance Ministers in the Group of Seven on 23 May, in saying that we welcome recent announcements by some oil producers to increase production and call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies, to ensure that world oil prices return to levels consistent with lasting global economic prosperity and stability, particularly in the poorest developing countries.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Ezra: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that reply. However, would he agree that, in addition to short-term measures intended to increase supply to take the pressure off current oil prices, there should be an intensification of longer-term measures to reduce the demand for oil, especially in the road transport sector?
</p>

<a name="40607-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>Would he further agree that such measures should include: the rapid introduction of biofuels; the encouragement of the use of hybrid vehicles, which cut petrol consumption by half; and the wider application of fuel cells to buses, as at the moment only two vehicles use them? Is there not a case for a targeted strategy to reduce oil consumption, to run in parallel with the targeted strategy for increasing renewables?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, the Government are fully committed to increasing the diversity of energy supplies. The key commitment in last year&#039;s energy White Paper is   to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 60 per cent by 2050. We are giving priority to encouraging renewables and energy efficiency. We directly support the use of more environmentally friendly fuels through reduced fuel duty rates, and the Government further encourage the use of cleaner vehicles through reduced vehicle excise duty rates based on vehicle emissions.
</p>

<a name="40607-02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>The Government want the United Kingdom to lead the shift to low-carbon automotive economies, and to be a good place in which to develop, research and manufacture them. Hybrid vehicles are supported by the Government&#039;s Powershift programme, in which grants have been offered of &#163;700 towards the purchase <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_7"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 7</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of those vehicles. We encourage buses that use dual supply in the same way. The targeted strategy to increase the number of fuel-efficient vehicles in the UK exists through those plans, copies of which are available in the Library.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Corbett of Castle Vale: </b>   My Lords, does not the current speculation about the future price of oil&#151;that is what it is&#151;underline the wisdom in the Government&#039;s energy White Paper of making the maximum use of alternative and sustainable energy and, if possible, of trying to ensure that those targets are seen as a minimum, not a maximum? That is the way to guarantee the safety of our energy supplies.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I wholly agree with my noble friend. There are limits to what the Government can do by way of interposing ourselves in any kind of market arrangement. However, we most certainly can look at the future in the most serious way through some of the alternatives now being developed, not least as a result of the high quality of United Kingdom science and technology, so that we can drive to a point where we are not held hostage by oil prices.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Marlesford: </b>   My Lords, in light of the deeply deflationary impact of hikes in the oil price, how much longer will it be before the Government review their allegedly neutral, and in practice hostile, attitude to nuclear power?
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I feel as though I am revisiting a very well loved relation. The arguments have been well rehearsed in this House and I do not intend to repeat them, other than to say that the nuclear option has not been foreclosed. However, serious attention is being given to renewable sources of fuel that we believe will be environmentally friendly and will help to sustain the United Kingdom&#039;s energy requirements.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="40607-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Tanlaw: </b>   My Lords, how can the noble Lord say that the Government are doing everything to encourage renewables? In south-west Scotland, which is arguably the best place for wind turbines, there is a blanket objection by the Ministry of Defence to hill farmers&#151;I have a declared interest in the matter&#151;who wish to help the Government in their renewable energy programme. Nothing has been done and no answer has been given on the issue, which I have raised on a number of occasions.

<a name="40607-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, the issues of aircraft and radar and other signals are being actively pursued.

<a name="40607-03_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Tomlinson: </b>   My Lords, although my noble friend has a sense of <i>d&#233;j&#224; vu</i> in revisiting the subject, would he accept that there was a sense of <i>d&#233;j&#224; vu</i> in the House about the inadequacy of the answer? It is not fully acceptable to say that the Government have not closed their mind to the nuclear option. That in itself is a negative reply. Will he give us a very clear assertion that all steps will be undertaken to maintain the existing supply and our future needs for electricity generated by nuclear power unless and until we have adequate alternatives in place? None of the options should be forgone or allowed to degrade unless and until those renewables that we all want are actually in place, not merely a wish, a dream or a hope.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="40607-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, as ever, I am deeply grateful to my noble friend for providing so robust a question. I cannot add to the general point. We have not closed the door on any of the fuel sources that we believe will be required. It is not right to make a distinction of the kind that may have appealed to one or two noble Lords about the intention to drive down carbon fuels, find new forms of renewable energy, and make sure that we have not closed the doors to some technologies that have proved extremely valuable in the recent past providing an envelope within which we will meet the fuel and energy needs of the country.

<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="40607-03_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   My Lords, I revert to the Question. Is not the Government&#039;s response wholly related to the question of taxation, not to the supply of oil or indeed to carbon emissions, wind farms or whatever?

<a name="40607-03_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   No, my Lords. It could not conceivably be argued that that was the case.

<a name="40607-03_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Desai: </b>   My Lords, despite all the fuss, is it not true that the real price of oil is below what it was in 1973? Oil is cheaper in real terms than it was. There is no energy crisis to justify a nuclear revival.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="40607-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, it is quite right that, in real terms, oil prices are still at half the levels reached in the early 1980s.

<a name="40607-03_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   My Lords, the oil producer knows full well that, of the pump price of petrol in this country, 75 per cent is tax and only 25 per cent is there to account for the whole cost of production, transport, refining and retailing. Does the Minister agree that, from the oil producer&#039;s point of view, it looks a bit rich for the Government to complain about him increasing his share?
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="40607-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I do not think that there have been complaints. Indeed, the dialogue that has been opened between OPEC and non-OPEC nations about greater transparency in all issues of pricing has been one of the central features of contemporary negotiations about oil prices. World economic stability is as much in the interest of oil producers as it is, if I may say so, in our interest.

<a name="40607-03_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_3"></a>Whether they are satisfied that all the arrangements are in place for the European parliamentary and local elections on 10 June.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="40607-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   Yes, my Lords, we are satisfied that all the arrangements are in place and that we are on course for successfully run elections on 10 June.

<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="40607-03_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply, but is he not aware that we are still receiving reports that ballot papers have not been received by electors? In fact, in the ward of Aspull in Wigan, people were informed on Friday that they will have to go to the town hall to vote. In the light of all the assurances that were given during the passage of the elections Bill and the fact that his right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister appeared to pioneer the process, would the <br>&nbsp;<br>

Minister agree that if any evidence emerged showing that anyone was unable to vote in the election or that people had been disfranchised it might be a resigning matter?
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="40607-03_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I shall not go into specifics about the detailed situation in the local authority to which the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, refers. I shall outline the overall position and try to give the House a little more detail about why we are confident that the process is on course. We had a debate about that following a Statement that I repeated to the House just before the Whitsun Recess, when we signalled that we were confident that returning officers would comply with their legal obligation to issue ballot papers by the deadline of 1 June. They achieved that: 99.24 per cent of ballot papers were issued by that date   and the 0.76 per cent were late were late by five hours   and the Post Office incorporated them into the delivery. Therefore, there was no disadvantage to the public.

</p>

<a name="40607-03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>I am further advised by the Royal Mail that ballot papers had, to the best of its knowledge, been delivered to   everyone and that 99.9 per cent were delivered by Thursday last week. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, is right that there are isolated examples, as is true in most elections, where there appears to be a glitch in local areas. But there is ample opportunity and time for electors in those areas or the returning officers, if they are aware of an issue, to ensure that replacement ballot papers are provided or that alternative or additional electoral arrangements are put in place.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="40607-03_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness David: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that, in Cambridge, my postal vote had not arrived by this morning? I have had a postal vote for a long time. I have been in touch with the Electoral Commission in Cambridge. It told me that it will send me a postal vote here. That may not arrive in time, but I have to take that vote to the polling station or to the Guild Hall myself. I do not think that that is satisfactory; does the Minister?
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="40607-03_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I share my noble friend&#039;s concern about the inconvenience. We would not want to lose her from the House by her having personally to deliver the ballot paper to Cambridge during the next few days. I am sure that her words will have been marked in Cambridge and that the authorities will ensure that they fulfil the promise that they have given her, so that she is adequately enfranchised.

<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="40607-03_spnew19"></a><b> Lord Renton: </b>   My Lords, the elections to the European Parliament are due to take place within three days. Will the Government make an immediate statement to the electorate in this country that there are now so many members of the European Community and their legal systems and other circumstances differ so much that the European Parliament will be unable to make laws of universal application within the Community?
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="40607-03_spnew20"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   No, my Lords, we will not issue such a statement for two reasons. First, the question is wide of the mark of the Question on the Order Paper. Secondly, <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="40607-03_spnew21"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that most of us think that his statement is remarkably complacent and that there have indeed been some disastrous reports of what has been going on in the four areas in the north where there is all-postal voting? Will the Minister today give an unreserved assurance that for all future elections, especially the regional referenda that are coming up, voters will again be given the opportunity to cast their vote in the ballot box in the traditional manner?

<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="40607-04_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, to come to the last point first: we have always been clear that these are pilots. They are pilots for a good reason, as we discussed at length during the passage of the Bill. Therefore, it is right and proper that the experience of the pilots is evaluated, reported on and discussed before we move forward on all-postal balloting. The right of an individual elector to opt for a postal ballot is already enshrined in law and we have no intention of retreating from that position.
</p>

<a name="40607-04_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>Before we get overexcited about prematurely celebrating a disaster, we should make a distinction. Several things are going on at once. We have combined elections, which in itself is slightly more complicated for electors than a single election&#151;although it is not the first time that that has happened. Moreover, we have all-postal ballots, which is bound itself to be a novelty to some people. It would be surprising if it were not. But that does not mean that one has a failed or a flawed electoral system.
</p>

<a name="40607-04_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>Irrespective of that, we will receive a report from the   Electoral Commission in mid-September, as it is statutorily obliged to report on its evaluation of postal ballots. That will give us an opportunity to discuss the issues again.

<p>

<a name="stpa_13"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: The amendment addresses a potential problem in connection with the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. Section 1 of that Act gives a Minister of the Crown power to reform primary legislation that has the effect of imposing burdens that affect persons in the carrying on of any activity. Such reform is made by way of a regulatory reform order. Section 1(4) of the Act prevents a regulatory reform order being used to amend a provision in an Act that has already been amended during the past two years, other than consequential or incidental amendments. The Bill, of course, amends a number of Acts by repealing parts of them. Section 1(4) of the 2001 Act will prevent Ministers from making a regulatory reform order reforming parts of any provisions that have been partially repealed during the two years after the Bill receives Royal Assent.
</p>

<a name="40607-04_para10"></a>

<a name="40607-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>I trust that the amendment&#039;s measures are largely self-explanatory. We recognise the arguments put forward by noble Lords in Committee that subsection 2(a) of new Section 103A was not as clear as we intended. That is why we have tabled Amendment No. 42A, which has the advantage of being a formula from the civil procedure rules.
</p>

<a name="40607-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>The Civil Procedure Rule Committee, when considering the rules relevant for the purposes of Section 101 of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, decided that it would be appropriate to add the words &quot;may have&quot;. That addresses the point that when dealing with an application on the papers the judge might not be able to be certain whether an error of law had been   made. We wish to stick closely to the statutory review test, which already has the benefit of judicial interpretation.

<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="40607-04_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, in our original amendment, tabled on the first day of Committee, our test for review was more demanding, although it was predicated upon changes at the Home Office interview stage and the single-tier tribunal stage, which have so far not been forthcoming. So we will not contest it.
</p>

<a name="40607-04_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>However, the Government will have to recognise that their amendment will have implications for their legal aid proposals. You cannot have a test for review consisting of the Government&#039;s new definition on the one hand, and a legal aid regime that gives legal aid <br>&nbsp;<br>

only<i> ex post facto</i> for wins or near-misses on the other. That legal aid regime is clearly no longer appropriate. The list for provision of legal aid should clearly match the new government review test; otherwise the legal aid system will block access to rights now to be granted by legislation.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>Page 13, line 33, leave out &quot;5&quot; and insert &quot;10 working&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos.   44, 51, 52 and 59.
</p>

<a name="40607-04_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>New Section 103A of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, added by this Bill, imposes a draconian timetable on applications for review of tribunal decisions. It allows a period of five days, beginning with the date on which the appellant is treated as receiving the notice of the tribunal&#039;s decision in accordance with the rules. Frankly, that is a ridiculously inadequate period.
</p>

<a name="40607-04_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>First, the date of the actual receipt of notice may be later than the deemed date under the rules, particularly if the now notoriously unreliable postal service is used. It is perfectly proper to include a deemed date in a Bill, because it prevents problems of uncertainty about when notice was received. However, a deemed date is acceptable only if the time as a whole that is provided is reasonable and it can be accepted that the deemed date may be a day or two in advance of the actual date of receipt. In other circumstances such as those in the Bill a deemed date is not acceptable.
</p>

<a name="40607-04_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Secondly, the period allowed is not even five full days; in reality, it is more like four. As the Bill is drafted, the day on which the notice is deemed to have been received is the first day of the five-day period. Therefore, even if notice is deemed to have been received on a Monday and is indeed received on that day, that constitutes the first day of the five-day period, and the second, third, fourth and fifth days are   Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. So the application received on Monday will have to be submitted before the court closes for business on Friday afternoon. That is inadequate time.

</p>

<a name="40607-04_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Let us look at what needs to happen. The appellant&#039;s lawyer, if he or she has one, cannot set out grounds of appeal before seeing what the tribunal has said and the grounds on which it has decided the case. The lawyer will therefore have to read the tribunal&#039;s decision, to consider further the legal issues involved in the decision and possibly consult the client&#151;that may involve arranging a meeting at which an interpreter must be present. The lawyer will have to draft grounds of appeal, get the application in proper order and submit it to the appropriate court before it closes for business on the last <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_15"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 15</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

available day. Lawyers are likely to be busy and have several cases running simultaneously, with the result that the one who handled the first stage may have other commitments, meaning that a new lawyer must be found to submit the application.
</p>

<a name="40607-04_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>We recognise the power in subsection 4(b) of new Section 103D to extend the time, but that safety valve is not an adequate reason for allowing much too short a time for the basic period. If applications made out of time become frequent, it leads to unnecessary time-wasting and cost-wasting satellite arguments about whether there is adequate justification for the delay. Ten working days is quite a short period but would be just sufficient for these cases.
</p>

<a name="40607-04_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 follow on from the earlier Amendments Nos. 43 and 44. We recognise that there may be a need for power to vary the timetable by secondary legislation. But that power can be used not only to extend the time but to reduce it to a period shorter than that stated in the Bill. We believe that if it is used for that purpose, the order should require the affirmative resolution procedure. We feel that among the many defects of Clause 14, given that it is a considerable improvement on its predecessor, the extremely and unnecessarily short timescale that is provided for making the application is one of the worst. I beg to move.

<a name="40607-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, I support what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has said. We are grateful that there has been some improvement in Clause 14. The Government ought to be congratulated as far as that is concerned. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, the period of five working days is wholly inadequate. The purpose behind my support for these amendments is to improve rather than diminish the practicability and effectiveness of this clause. It is the view of the Law Society that the amendments that have been moved are likely to be more realistic in the circumstances. As the Law Society has contended, the crucial matter is that justice should be done and be seen to be done. Speed is significant, but it is not the whole argument. For that reason, I support the proposal of 10 working days.
</p>

<a name="40607-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The time limit is in many cases impracticable, and it will have the unfortunate consequence of persuading more applicants to apply to the court for an extension of the statutory time limit. The essential issue is that the case ought to be properly prepared and presented; that cannot be done in five working days. I speak from some experience as far as this provision is concerned, both direct and indirect. We are talking about people&#039;s right to present their case properly. There have been many incidences of this concern in practice.
</p>

<a name="40607-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The amendment is supported by the Law Society for the reasons that I have elaborated. As I understand it, the Law Society has explained its purpose to Ministers. What have Ministers said to the Law Society in response? The House is entitled to know. After all, the Law Society is concerned&#151;as is the Bar Council&#151;to make these provisions practicable and enforceable. I <br>&nbsp;<br>

hope, notwithstanding the initial response, that my noble friend will have second thoughts about this important matter.

<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="40607-05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Newton of Braintree: </b>   My Lords, I rise to speak only briefly, reminding the House, as I did when I spoke in the original debate on the ouster clause, that I am chairman of the Council on Tribunals, which I hope may be seen as a qualifying interest, rather than a disqualifying interest in this context.

</p>

<a name="40607-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Looking carefully in the direction of the Minister, I wish to express my support&#151;and I think I can safely say the support of the Council on Tribunals&#151;for some extension of this five-day rule. Like everyone else, we focused our principal attention on the original ouster clause, and share the gratitude of all that it has disappeared in its original form.
</p>

<a name="40607-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>However, this was one of the various points of detail on which we had focused. I can only say that we believe&#151;I certainly do&#151;that five days is much too short a period to obtain proper advice about applying for a review and help in preparing it, and much too short a period for an appellant with no means of obtaining advice or assistance. In general, there is a risk that this   would run contrary to what we would all agree, however difficult the problem, should be an open and proportionate system of review.
</p>

<a name="40607-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>I do not think that I need to say more, but I hope that we shall receive a positive response from the Minister. Whether 10 days is the right figure is not a matter that I would want to die in a ditch on, but I am clear that five   days is too little. I hope that the Government will be prepared to look at this again.

<a name="40607-05_spnew2"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Newcastle: </b>   My Lords, I support the amendment standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I am grateful for some of the changes that the Government have made in Clause 14. They have gone some way to satisfying some of the objections that some of us have had. In my view, they have not yet gone far enough. I am particularly bothered about the five-day limit. I do not believe that it is workable. A much-respected immigration solicitor in the city of Newcastle, where I live and work, says that she spends some 20 hours preparing a case with a client. She believes that her job will no longer be viable if these regulations are to come in. In an asylum system that anyway is operating with a culture of disbelief, how on earth will vulnerable people be able fully and effectively to put forward their evidence within those five working days of the notification of the decision?
</p>

<a name="40607-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>Grounds of appeal prepared in great haste do not give the best material on which to make difficult decisions. The five-day limit is not a proposal for a fair system, let alone an effective one. Therefore, I strongly support this amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart.

<a name="40607-05_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, I am glad that the right reverend Prelate has raised the question of the time that is required to obtain the legal advice that is necessary, because this is a matter that has been raised with all your Lordships by the Refugee Children&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>

Consortium. It says that this is a universal problem. It is not just the particular adviser who has informed the right reverend Prelate of this problem; all advisers are in the same boat. They already must spend a great deal of time accessing legal advice on behalf of their clients, and these regulations will make life almost impossible.
</p>

<a name="40607-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>In the representation that the consortium has made to your Lordships, it says that its staff already spend hours on the telephone seeking a legal representative, or to make an appointment with a legal representative. The first lawyer that they approach many not be willing to take the case on, and there may be several iterations of the calls. The original lawyer who dealt with the case at an earlier stage may not be prepared to act in this instance.

</p>

<a name="40607-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>It is almost universally agreed that the time limit of five days is impossible. It was referred to particularly in the JCHR sixth report of session 2003&#150;04, which says that,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;the UNHCR has expressed the same concern about the five day limit and the likelihood that it may result in . . .  contravention of the fundamental principle of non-<i>refoulement</i> in Article 33 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40607-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>They say that it falls short of international standards of   fairness, while seriously compromising the ability of asylum applicants to access their rights of appeal. Faced with this barrage of opinion from all quarters, I cannot imagine that the Home Office will stick with its original decision. It must bow to the weight of professional and legal opinion and make the concession that my noble friend has asked for.

I am a lay member&#151;currently an endangered species&#151;of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. I support the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and all the other noble Lords who have spoken in favour of this amendment. Already the number of lawyers who are registered as being allowed to represent asylum seekers is limited and, from my own knowledge, they are extremely hard-working and hard-worked individuals. If they are not given time to prepare a case properly it is going to defeat the objective of this Bill, which is to speed up decision-making, so I offer my support.

<a name="40607-05_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Plant of Highfield: </b>   My Lords, I intervene as a   member of the Joint Human Rights Committee, whose report the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has just mentioned. The Committee deliberated long and hard about the new clause and all its various ramifications, and we looked at a great deal of evidence. I remind noble Lords, with their indulgence, of precisely what the Committee said on page 21 of its recent report; it is pretty categorical. It stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>      &quot;We consider the five day time limit to be far too short for the right of access to the High Court and beyond to be practically effective. The number of tasks to be performed between receipt of a decision and lodging an application for a review makes it simply impracticable to require applications to be lodged within five days. An application for reconsideration will require the applicant&#039;s legal representative to receive a copy of the Tribunal&#039;s decision, to read and consider it, to marshal any necessary evidence (which may require a meeting with the <br>&nbsp;<br>

We consider that, more often than not, completing all these steps within a five day time limit will be a physical impossibility for most asylum seekers&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>We come to the conclusion that this provision may in effect impede the idea of a right of access to the higher courts.

<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="40607-05_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Ackner: </b>   My Lords, it is obviously desirable that any time limit should be fair, but it is even more important that it is practical. If it fails in that, there is a real risk it will defeat itself, and there will come before the necessary authorities something that may be looked upon as half-baked. To bake it properly will waste time, which will be due entirely to the defect that has been pointed out. The offer to increase the five days by another five is an extremely reasonable and sensible approach, which involves the Government in no cost of any significance.

<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="40607-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, so many of your Lordships have spoken to the same effect on this amendment that I have little to add. We have added our name to the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord   Goodhart, and so your Lordships would naturally expect me to support it, which I happily do.
</p>

<a name="40607-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>We on these Benches have always been opposed to the five-day period for the reasons that the noble Lord, Lord   Goodhart, and others of your Lordships have so   eloquently expressed. In an amendment tabled in Committee, we suggested a seven-day limit. However, that suggestion was based on a number of assumptions about the rest of the Bill that no longer apply, of which I shall mention just two. The current appeals rules&#151;that is, the rules of 2003&#151;allow for the interests of justice to be taken into account when considering an extension of time. That provision is in paragraph (2) of Rule 16. We should contrast that with the test for extension of time found in Clause 14(6), which sets out the terms of subsection (4)(b) of new Clause 103A. The test is expressed thus:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;the appropriate court may permit an application under subsection (1) to be made outside the period specified in subsection (3)&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>in this case, it is five days&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;where it thinks that the application could not reasonably practicably have been made within that period&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>I am sure that your Lordships will agree that that is a much more severe test for the applicant than the test under the existing rules.
</p>

<a name="40607-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>Our second reason for supporting the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is that our suggestion&#151;seven days&#151;also assumed that oral hearings would be permitted in the review, where they were considered by the High Court judge to be in the interests of justice. In the absence of the ability to make such oral submissions, the quality of written submissions and their degree of comprehensiveness must be very high. We do not see how that can be achieved within the short period of five days.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_19"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 19</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>For those reasons and for others that have been amply expressed by your Lordships, we support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="40607-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, in responding to the many noble Lords who have spoken to the amendments, I thank those who paid tribute to the fact that the Government have listened to representations made in this House and elsewhere. That is appreciated. As a consequence, we have crafted a system that still enables us to achieve the essential thrust of the policy, while listening to the concerns that have been raised.
</p>

<a name="40607-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Amendments Nos. 43, 44 and 59 would extend the time limit for making a review application and for opting in under the transitional provisions from five   working days to 10 working days. As the House knows, we wish to make the review process as swift but as fair as possible. We are confident that, in practice, five working days allows an appellant sufficient time to consult a legal representative and lodge the application papers for a review. It should also allow sufficient time for an applicant to opt for the review application to be looked at by the High Court under the transitional provisions in Schedule 2.
</p>

<a name="40607-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>I shall explain why we have come to that view. It is important to remember that we are not talking about the appeal against the initial decision by the Secretary of State or entry clearance officer. The review is a process that we will put in place to allow a tribunal decision to be reconsidered, if there may have been an error of law by the tribunal that affected the tribunal appeal determination. In those circumstances, the shorter time limit of five working days best achieves the balance between speed and fairness.
</p>

<a name="40607-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>The reason why we believe that the timetable is practical is that the grounds for appeal will already have been covered at the appeal before the tribunal. There will have been a clear statement of reasons for the appeal that will focus the appeal on the key points at the hearing. The process is not a rehearing of the case requiring new grounds but a process to allow errors of law by the tribunal to be corrected, if it affected the original appeal decision. That should not be over-onerous on the legal representative, as, first, the legal representative should already be familiar with the case through the earlier work on the appeal and, possibly, the initial claim to IND. Secondly, the kind of issues that we are talking about with regard to an &quot;error of law&quot; should be familiar to the lawyers from   their experience of judicial review and statutory review. If there is a genuine exceptional reason why the application could not be made in five days, it is down to the judge to decide whether to allow a late application.
</p>

<a name="40607-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, explained as elegantly as one would expect why he has moved from supporting a seven-day timetable to supporting one of 10 working days. When my noble and learned friend <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_20"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 20</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Lord Chancellor announced at Second Reading that we would introduce measures to provide for oversight by the higher courts, he stressed that we would balance them with the aims of speed and reduction of abuse. We must bear those objectives in mind at the same time. It is important to ensure that there is a fast, end-to-end process. It is not in the interests of genuine appellants to drag out the appeal process. Shorter time limits would help to dissuade people from abusing the process or wrongly believing that they can.
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="40607-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the Minister giving way so courteously. I understand his point about expedition, which was made by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor at an earlier stage. But does it not fit ill with the refusal of the Government to include in the Bill either a limitation period for the   period between the asylum application and the application decision by the Home Office or the additional refusal of the Minister or the Home Office to accept any time limitation between the end of the statutory review process and the moment of deportation? What relevance has five days within the appeal process if the Government have dug their heels in on those other periods, which often amount to years?
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="40607-06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I shall now relay the remarkable reduction in the overall speed of decision making that has taken place on asylum and immigration matters since 1997. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is well aware of the significant overall reduction. We are debating the specific time limit of the appeal in order to see whether we have allowed a process that gives an appellant an adequate time in which to put forward his or her case. With the leave of the noble Lord, I shall continue my explanation about why we believe that we have got it pitched right.
</p>

<a name="40607-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>As I have said, we accept that there will be exceptional circumstances when, for reasons outside the control of the applicant and his or her representative, it will not be possible to lodge an application within the five-day time limit. The Bill recognises that and makes provision for applications to be accepted out of time in those circumstances. The discretion in doing so will rest not with the Government but with the High Court judge who is considering the issue.

</p>

<a name="40607-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 would make the order-making power to vary the time limits subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee scrutinised the order-making and regulation-making powers in Clause 14 and published its recommendations in its 15th report of this Session. The committee recommended that regulation-making powers under Section 103D of the 2002 Act, which concern new legal aid arrangements, should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. I have brought forward an amendment to give effect to that recommendation.
</p>

<a name="40607-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>However, the committee did not recommend that the order-making power to vary time limits should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. If the order-making power is used, both Houses would have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_21"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 21</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the opportunity to give detailed consideration to the order. If they felt it necessary, they could of course pray against it.
</p>

<a name="40607-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>Perhaps I may turn to some of the specific points&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="40607-06_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, I am much obliged to my noble friend the Minister for giving way. I am sure that he has had an adequate opportunity to advance all those arguments to the Law Society, the Bar Council and others, but would he care to mention who supports the Government where this is concerned? After all, the House is entitled to know that. When my noble friend advanced those arguments to the powers that be, what was their response?
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="40607-06_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I was not privileged to be privy to all of those discussions with the relevant professional bodies. In response to the question about who supports the attempt of the Government to ensure that we uphold our traditions in this society of giving fair and proper consideration to people who apply to us for refuge and asylum, the public are clear that they want government and society generally to ensure that the abuse in the system is stamped out. There is strong support for that position, not just&#151;how shall I put it?&#151;among the more extreme elements of the popular press, but also among those who hold dear the tradition of this society, and its responsibilities, to consider applicants for asylum. That is my answer to my noble friend.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040607/text/40607-07.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="40607-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, I am much obliged. It is astonishing to say that to extend the time limit from five to 10 working days is extreme. I do not believe that. What I said at the beginning is wholly true. I want to make these considerations workable and practical. Nothing that my noble friend has said draws me to an opposite conclusion.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="40607-07_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I have no doubt that that is the thrust of my noble friend&#039;s intention on this measure, as it has been on many asylum and immigration matters. I am saddened that I have not managed to persuade him at this point.
</p>

<a name="40607-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>Perhaps I may turn to a number of points that were raised in discussion. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, raised the important issue of deemed service. The five days starts two days after the issue of the notice of decision from the AIT. Therefore, for very good reasons, it is effective not from the date of being sent out but from two days after that date. The last day of deemed service would not overlap with the first day of the five-day application period. We will ensure that that is done and set out in the rules.
</p>

<a name="40607-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, also referred to the UNHCR disapproving of the five-day limit. The UNHCR comment relating to a five-day limit refers to filing an asylum claim. We are not referring to that in these measures, but to a subsequent time limit for seeking a review and reconsideration.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_22"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 22</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>We do not wish to ignore the representations of the House, but we have given the issue very careful consideration. In the vast majority of cases, an asylum applicant will have had a lawyer at the original asylum and immigration tribunal hearing. In many cases, during the hearing, the points of law on which it seems likely that the tribunal&#039;s determination will turn and hinge will be identified, so the lawyer and the applicant will not come cold to the thrust of the likely decision by the tribunal. Therefore, in most cases, a lawyer and his client would have been in a position to have discussed whether, if the hearing did go against them, they would wish to lodge an appeal. Often, the lawyer would be well prepared about what should be the thrust of the case that he or she would put before the High Court when seeking an <i>ex parte</i> application.
</p>

<a name="40607-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>Therefore, for those reasons, we think that five days is workable. However, that should be cautioned, of course, by the fact that there is a discretion for the High Court judge to waive that when he or she thinks that the interests of justice require it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="40607-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord. My quotation from the UNHCR was not direct, but it came from paragraph 1.81 of the 6th   report of the JCHR. That was in the context of the shortness of the time limit for applying to the High Court for a reconsideration. It was not in terms of the first application at all. If the noble Lord refers to the JCHR report, he will find that my quotation was relevant to this discussion.
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="40607-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for his correction.
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="40607-07_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, the Government have said that their objective is to have a procedure that is swift but fair. We agree with that objective. Unfortunately, the Government&#039;s proposals, while plainly swift in this respect, are blatantly unfair. The Government say that they are confident that an appellant will have sufficient time because&#151;so they say&#151;the grounds for appeal will already have been covered in the argument at the first hearing before the asylum and immigration tribunal.
</p>

<a name="40607-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>The idea that the judgment of the tribunal is so predicable that, in effect, it is possible to draft a notice of appeal in advance is utterly unrealistic, as, I believe, anyone who has practised in the courts will agree. Many speakers in this debate have said that a five-day period is utterly impracticable. The five days&#039; limit will be only a very minor factor in extending the time before the removal ultimately of an unsuccessful asylum seeker. The five days&#039; limit will be a major factor in creating unfairness in the system.
</p>

<a name="40607-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>I am most grateful for all the support that this amendment has received from all parts of your Lordships&#039; House. The amendment echoes the views of the highly respected Joint Committee on Human Rights. In those circumstances, it is proper for me to seek the opinion of the House.

<a name="40607-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart </b>   moved Amendment No. 45:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>Page 14, line 13, leave out &quot;applicant&quot; and insert &quot;parties to the appeal&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I hope to be quite brief. It is undesirable that, where reconsideration is ordered because an error of law may have been made, the case should be referred back to the same member of the tribunal who made the original decision to decide whether in fact he or she got it wrong the first time round. There may be exceptional cases where it is legitimate, but they are few and far between. It is also usually desirable that, where an error of law may have been made, the case should be reconsidered by a panel of three rather than by a panel of one.
</p>

<a name="40607-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>It is true that under Schedule 5 to the 2002 Act the president of the asylum and immigration tribunal will have power to direct, where in his view it may be appropriate, that the case should be reconsidered by a different member of the tribunal from the original one or should be reconsidered by a panel of a different size.   But it seems appropriate that the judge of the High Court or whichever is the appropriate court in Scotland or Northern Ireland who has actually heard the application and is therefore aware of the issues involved should have power not only to direct a reconsideration on the grounds of an error of law, but also to decide on the form of tribunal which is to hear that reconsideration.
</p>

<a name="40607-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>I do not suggest that the judge should be bound to exercise the power, but in cases of this kind it would be appropriate for the judge, if he or she has clearly decided that it cannot go back to the person who made the original decision, to decide there and then who is to hear the reconsideration. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="40607-08_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </b>   My Lords, I thought that Amendment No. 45 had been called, but the statement by the noble Lord in support of it appears to be more appropriate to Amendment No. 46.
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="40607-08_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, I apologise. The noble and learned Lord is quite right. The amendments are grouped together, but Amendment No. 46 is the substantial amendment. Amendment No. 45 suggests a minor point to make it clear that this provision should apply to both parties of the tribunal, not only to an appellant.
</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="40607-08_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Ackner: </b>   My Lords, will the noble Lord assist me on one point? Since the emphasis of the whole of this part of the Bill is on expedition, and since we are dealing with a point of law and a tribunal which is a qualified judge, why should not the judge himself make the decision that there was an error of law and the consequences are as would be appropriate? Why would it need to go back in every case?
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="40607-08_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, I am pleased to be able to help the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner. I am sorry if what I said was confusing, but the purpose of this amendment is exactly that: it is to make sure that the judge who hears the application for an order for reconsideration should be able himself or herself to <br>&nbsp;<br>

say, on the spot, &quot;We need not bother the president of the asylum and immigration tribunal. I myself am convinced that this is a case which should not go back to the member of the tribunal who took the original decision. The issue is so important that it requires a panel of three&quot;. So I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, with whom I think I am in entire agreement.
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="40607-08_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Renton: </b>   My Lords, pages 1 and 2 of the Marshalled List state:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;An order . . .  may direct that the decision of the Tribunal may be reconsidered by&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>(a)   a member who made the decision;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>(b)   another member; or</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>(c)   a panel of 3 members&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>Why should it be necessary to insert a provision for three members if one member is enough? I should be grateful if the noble Lord could help me on this point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="40607-08_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. There is an existing power for the president to declare that a case is sufficiently important to require it to be heard by more than one member of the panel. Therefore, if the judge is to be given a choice, he or she should be given the same choice as the president would have, which would include the power to direct that the case should be heard by a panel of three members.
</p>

<a name="40607-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Three members seems the right number here. Two members would be unsatisfactory, as even numbers tend to be when taking judicial decisions, and rising to five members would be to over-egg the pudding.
</p>




<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="40607-08_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, Members on these Benches support the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, save for one qualification. The noble Lord will see that Amendment No. 57A would require three members to be the normal number to sit on the tribunal,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;unless the President from time to time directs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40607-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Were that amendment ultimately to find itself included on the face of the Bill, I suggest that a slight modification would need to be made in Amendment No. 46 to new subsection (5A)(a) and (c). Subsection (5A) would have to read, &quot;member or members who made the decision&quot;, while (c) ought to read, &quot;or another panel of 3 members&quot;. However, the changes would be necessary only if the contents of Amendment No. 57A were to find their way into the Bill. I apologise to the noble Lord for not drawing his attention to this point earlier.
</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="40607-08_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </b>   I had proposed to say a few words about Amendment No. 45, because I am not sure of the Government&#039;s attitude towards this amendment. I assume that, for the sake of brevity, they would want to have the case decided without the necessity of inviting the   respondent to make representations. I think that Amendment No. 45 implies a right, or at least a power, to require representations from the other parties to the appeal.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_27"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 27</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>The point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Ackner, seemed to be that, if it is apparent that there has been an error of law, the simplest way to correct it is perhaps to make a new decision immediately which has the opposite effect. The problem about that is, unless and until the basic opening of the clause is changed, the only power in the court is to remit the case to the tribunal. If the point made by my noble and learned friend were to be given effect, some further amendment would therefore be required. I do not think that Amendment No. 46, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, would have that effect.
</p>

<a name="40607-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>So far as Amendment No. 46 is concerned, for my part I would be willing to take it that the judge hearing the case in the High Court would have these powers in any event. If there is any doubt about that, however, I see no reason why these amendments should not be made.
</p>




<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="40607-08_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </b>   My Lords, if on review the judge decides that there has been an error of law, I do not think that it follows that the lower tribunal, with one or three members, would necessarily reach a particular conclusion. For instance, if the decision is that an irrelevant matter has been taken into account, it still leaves open the question of what happens when the relevant matter is taken into account. On the face of it, that would not be a matter for the High Court judge.
</p>

<a name="40607-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>While judges are perfectly capable, when looking at a decision which overturns their own decision, of saying, &quot;That is what that court says&quot;&#151;they probably got it wrong, but that is beside the point&#151;&quot;They have the last word, so of course I will follow it&quot;. We know, or at any rate those who are involved in the law know, that that is so, but the lay public do not. If there is a situation in which a decision is sent back to the original member, who then says, &quot;Having taken account of the guidance I have received from the High Court, I still think that the answer is what I said it was&quot;, it is probably a perfectly possible answer but it is not one which would carry conviction with the public.
</p>

<a name="40607-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>It would therefore be important that the judge of the High Court should consider very carefully before sending it back to the same member as had it in the first place&#151;unless he is quite satisfied that the answer will be a different one.
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="40607-08_spmin0"></a><b>The Countess of Mar:</b>  My Lords, there are occasions when it is appropriate to send it back to the person who   made the decision in the first place. Sometimes that person will not have taken all matters into consideration and will need to be reminded that this should have been done and, if he had taken all matters into consideration, what then would have been his decision.
</p>

<a name="40607-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>On the other hand, in most of the cases that have been through my hands, when it has been sent back to a lower level for a rehearing, it has been to a fresh hearing as opposed to a filling-in of what has already been heard. There is therefore room for both cases.

<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="40607-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, in responding to an interesting debate, it may be helpful if I start by emphasising what the Government are seeking to do under Clause 14 in this respect.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>Essentially, and for reasons which will be well known to the House, we think that there is a need for and merit in a single process in the new Asylum and Immigration Tribunal to deal with issues, rather than a second two-stage process. However, the House and others have made representations to us that the ouster of judicial review went too far and did not allow an adequate supervision by the higher courts of points of law or failures by the tribunal.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>Therefore, in the amended Clause 14 we are seeking to ensure that the single-tier tribunal, the AIT, has the capacity, skills and competence to deal with these issues, but allow an opportunity, when there appears to have been a case where there is an error in law, for that to be considered by a higher court, normally the High Court and, if the judge hearing that case believes that an error in law has been made, to send that back for reconsideration.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>We are not trying to reconstruct a two-tier process built on the AIT&#151;for very good reasons, because that would in large part take us back to where we are at present.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>That is why we are not sympathetic to Amendment No. 45. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, suggests a requirement for the High Court or Court of Session to   determine review applications by reference to the written submissions of all parties to the appeal, and not only the written submissions of the applicant. That effectively puts the High Court&#151;if the High Court is hearing it&#151;in the position of deciding on the substance of it. That is not what we want to do, and for good reason.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>It is important to recognise that new Section 103A has been drafted to reflect the fact that the review procedure will be <i>ex parte</i>: in other words, if a person who has agreed with the decision of the AIT has an opportunity to direct to a higher court a challenge that there has been an error of law by the AIT, and if the judge in that case is persuaded by that to direct a reconsideration.

</p>

<a name="40607-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>The current permission stage to the AIT and the statutory review procedure under Section 101 of the 2002 Act, for similar reasons, are both <i>ex parte</i> and we think that it is necessary and right to continue with this.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>Requiring the High Court to determine review applications by reference to the written submissions of all parties to the appeal would effectively put it in the position of determining the appeal, would add delay to the process, and is unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>It is also undesirable for other reasons. One of the problems experienced has been that the High Court has been swamped by appeal applications of this type. That has put an inappropriate burden on the High Court. Therefore, the procedure as crafted by new Section 103A allows for the proper exercise of High Court supervision on points of law, but does not take <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_29"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 29</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

away from the specialist tribunal the reconsideration of those matters. In other words, it has been carefully crafted&#151;we believe for good reason.

</p>

<a name="40607-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>If the High Court or a senior member of the tribunal considers that there may have been an error of law and orders a case to be reconsidered by the tribunal, at that point all parties to the appeal will have the opportunity to make written and, if appropriate, oral representations. We therefore believe that the provision is well constructed. The substantial hearing, if there has been a finding on a point of law, is back into the tribunal following the determination by the High Court judge.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>Amendments Nos. 46 and 57 will enable the High Court or the Court of Session to direct how the tribunal should be composed when it reconsiders an appeal. As it stands, the president of the AIT will direct the composition of the tribunal under paragraphs 7 and 8 of Schedule 1 of the Bill. We believe that is where that discretion should lie.

</p>

<a name="40607-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>We agree that the reconsideration process will need to vary. Some appeals will be best reconsidered by a full hearing but, for others, this may not be necessary. Some appeals will require a panel of judges to hear them, because it is seen by the president as potentially a pivotal case that will set a precedent relevant to other cases. In such circumstances one would expect that there would be three judges in the AIT hearing such a case. In other cases it will not be so, and therefore we believe that the president should take into account any recommendations made by the High Court or Court of Session but should have the discretion within that to make a determination on how best the appeal should be reconsidered in the AIT, depending on the particular circumstances. Ultimately, the president is best placed to take these decisions on the deployment of judiciary within the tribunal.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>This has been a helpful debate. I do not think that I have replied to the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, as to why the High Court should not be given the power to reverse. I may have done so in passing, because I have signalled that it is a different function for the High Court. It is not to hear the substance but to hear whether it considers that an error in law has been made. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, helpfully signalled, that does not imply that in every single case&#151;even where an error of law may have occurred&#151;the reconsideration decision will automatically be reversed. It will depend on the circumstances of the case.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>I hope that my comments have been helpful to noble Lords who have spoken to the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="40607-09_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, I am not wholly unsympathetic to the Government&#039;s view. I do not think that it would be appropriate for the judge to turn what is, in effect, an application for leave to appeal into a substantive hearing. I understand that and the amendment was not intended to achieve it.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>Although the Government have taken some care to avoid saying so, they are trying to create an internal appeal system within the tribunal itself in which, if the case arises in England, the judge of the High Court effectively gives leave to appeal from one part of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_30"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 30</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

tribunal to another panel or individual within the tribunal. It is a fairly ingenious way of handling the   issue. From the Government&#039;s point of view it has the advantage that, albeit the leave to appeal&#151;if one can call it that&#151;is given as part of the jurisdiction of the High Court, it is not in itself subject to judicial review.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Amendment No. 46 would save time because a judge   could say, &quot;Having looked at this matter on an <i>ex parte</i> basis, it seems to me that there is plainly something that needs to be looked at seriously&quot;. That would avoid the delay involved in having to refer the papers to the president of the tribunal and he or she having to read up the papers and come to a decision as to what is the appropriate form of the tribunal.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>However, I am also aware that, unlike the previous group of amendments, a refusal to accept these amendments will not lead to any injustice in the procedure. In those circumstances, I do not wish to press them further. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(1)   Subsection (2) applies where the appropriate court has made an order under section 103A(1), or a reference under section 103C(1), on the application of an appellant under section 103A.


(2)   The appropriate court may order that the appellant&#039;s costs in respect of the application under section 103A shall be paid out of the Community Legal Service Fund established under section 5 of the Access to Justice Act 1999 (c. 22).

</ul>

</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I was expecting a slightly more substantial speech from the Minister. However, I am happy that he should leave that until he responds to this amendment, which is grouped with Amendment No. 46A.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>We do not object to Amendment No. 46A and have not sought to do so; we welcome it so far as it goes. It will undoubtedly fill a lacuna if it gives the court which hears an application for an order to reconsider the power to order the payment of the costs of that application. The problem is that Amendment No. 46A does not go nearly far enough.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>Once the High Court has ordered reconsideration, it seems plain to us that legal aid should be granted for that reconsideration. The High Court will not order reconsideration unless there is at least an arguable case that there has been an error of law; nor will it order reconsideration if it is apparent that that error of law makes no difference because the case is hopeless on the basis of the facts or on some other legal issue.

</p>

<a name="40607-09_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>However, we believe that it is essential that the appellant&#039;s lawyer should know that if the case is reconsidered, he or she will receive legal aid for appearing in the case. Of course, if the lawyer in some way misconducted himself or herself by misleading the court and concealing material facts, he or she would be deprived of the right to legal aid anyway. But the Government are suggesting, basically, the extension of no win/no fee litigation to asylum and immigration cases.

</p>

<a name="40607-09_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>No win/no fee funding may be here to stay for civil   actions for damages&#151;that is an entirely different matter&#151;but it is completely inappropriate for litigation of this kind between an immigrant and the state, with terrible potential damage to the immigrant if he or she is wrongly sent home. I was horrified by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor&#039;s suggestion in Committee that &quot;success fees&quot;&#151;that is, an uprating of the fees that would be otherwise due&#151;could be paid where a decision is overturned on reconsideration. If an application is strong enough to justify an order for reconsideration, the appellant is entitled as a matter of justice to have the case presented by a lawyer who has been paid to do the job.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>Amendments Nos. 47, 48, 48A, 49 and 50 tackle this issue in two different ways: one way is through Amendment No. 47; the other way is through the remainder of the amendments. Amendment No. 47 seeks to remove the whole of the new Section 103D of the 2002 Act. Its purpose is to ensure that legal aid for applications and reconsiderations should be provided in the normal way, with none of the special restrictions imposed by the Bill.

</p>

<a name="40607-09_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>Amendment No. 48 is something of a compromise. It would retain new Section 103D but require the tribunal to make an order for legal aid unless it is satisfied that there were no reasonable grounds for making the application. It would eliminate all the issues we discussed in Committee about near misses. A   lawyer with reasonable grounds for making the application would not lose his or her fees on the grounds that the miss was not quite near enough.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>Amendment No. 48A would require the tribunal to give reasons for refusing legal aid. If those reasons were irrational, the decision could be reversed. Amendments Nos. 49 and 50 back up Amendment No. 48. They would remove the provisions for payment by results.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>We believe that the test&#151;and the only test&#151;for the   grant of legal aid should be whether there are reasonable grounds for seeking reconsideration. If there are reasonable grounds, it would be wrong to deprive the appellant&#039;s lawyers of the fees because they are unsuccessful when the reconsideration takes place.

</p>

<a name="40607-09_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>I find the attitude of the Government to legal aid in these cases extraordinary. They have failed to take into account measures that have already been put in place to curb the abuse of legal aid, which I recognise has happened in asylum cases. Such measures include the fact that decisions on appeal funding have been taken in-house by the Legal Services Commission since last April; the fact that nearly 100 poor-quality firms have had their <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_32"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 32</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Legal Services Commission contracts terminated; and the fact that a compulsory accreditation scheme of the Law Society will come into force in April of next year. Those measures are surely sufficient to justify treating legal aid for leave of appeal to the AIT in the same way as any other cases and for hearings for reconsideration.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>The Government have not so far said that criminal defence lawyers will be paid only in cases where their clients are acquitted, yet the wrongful refusal of asylum can have consequences even more damaging than a wrongful conviction for crime.
</p>

<a name="40607-09_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>The way in which the Government have treated the right to legal aid in this case is plainly wrong and it needs fundamental alteration. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="40607-10_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, I am deeply concerned about this issue. I am concerned about the principle to introduce, in due course, the no win, no fee arrangements. The noble Lord elaborated on that.
</p>

<a name="40607-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>The Government have it in mind to replace the Legal Services Commission with the judiciary in determining whether costs should be ordered. The judge would so order only if he decided that a case was either successful or a near-miss. Solicitors are therefore bound to be unduly cautious in approaching such matters.
</p>

<a name="40607-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>The system that is envisaged is likely to have deleterious effects. First, solicitors are likely to give up legal aid work in that field because they feel that they are unable to work at all, or properly, under the circumstances that are envisaged. Secondly, there is a by no means remote possibility of a conflict of interest between the lawyer, whose attitude is likely to be that he will act only if the application is almost certain to succeed, and the lay client, who will want the application to proceed if he has an arguable case. Why, therefore, should there not be representation in all arguable cases?

</p>

<a name="40607-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>Unmeritorious cases should not be publicly funded. I entirely agree with that proposition. That, in summary, is the view of the Government. However, do the Government not recognise that effective filters already exist? First, there is the Legal Services Commission, which imposes cost assessment audits, Quality Mark audits and peer review, where firms undertake immigration work, which is publicly funded. Secondly, the Legal Services Commission, rather than the solicitor, determines at present whether the case has enough merit and whether an appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal should be publicly funded. Thirdly, from 2005, the accreditation system will apply to all lawyers who practise publicly funded work in such cases.
</p>

<a name="40607-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>Complex issues of law and fact are the rule rather than the exception. To decide them, it is often desirable that the applicant should give evidence. Why should we find that unacceptable?
</p>

<a name="40607-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>Many sound claims are too often refused at the initial stage, where Home Office decision-making is often found to be wanting. Representation at that stage is therefore often indispensable.

</p>

<a name="40607-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>There is likely to be an increase in unrepresented applicants, however unmeritorious they may be, and the courts will be hopelessly overloaded. In such circumstances, the Government will incur, rather than save, costs. I therefore hope that my noble friend will think again about his propositions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="40607-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Newton of Braintree: </b>   My Lords, I indicated earlier that when the Council on Tribunals looked at some of the proposals, though it concentrated on Ulster in particular, it was concerned by a number of points of detail. This is another of them.
</p>

<a name="40607-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>I shall not attempt to speak with the eloquence of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, with his much wider knowledge of the operations of the legal profession, but it seems to be a matter of layman&#039;s common sense   that if public funding is to be dependent on the ultimate outcome, which is what appears to be envisaged, there must be a risk that lawyers will feel strongly discouraged from taking on cases that may be meritorious in the normal use of that term, but not 100 per cent certain of being meritorious. In the area of asylum and immigration, it is singularly open to question whether that is a proper path to follow.

</p>

<a name="40607-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>Being a natural seeker after the middle way, of the two amendments moved by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, I think that I prefer his compromise amendments to his complete &quot;throw out this bit of the Bill&quot; amendment, but I hope that the Government will look again at the issue.
</p>

<a name="40607-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>From our experience at the Council on Tribunals&#151;as was touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis&#151;there is considerable evidence that suggests that the absence of legal representation can extend the time and complexity of the hearing and make it much more difficult to handle matters in a manageable way. Any former Member of Parliament will know from discussions in his surgery that many complainants, claimants or applicants often find it difficult to distinguish the points that really matter from those that are not necessarily essential to the issue. Legal representation really can improve the smoothness and efficiency of the working of arrangements of that kind. With the best will in the world, I hope that the Minister will be prepared to take another look at the matter.

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="40607-10_spnew2"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Newcastle: </b>   My Lords, I too wish to ask the Government to give further consideration to these matters. They are of concern to all those noble Lords who have spoken today. While I am pleased that the Government have amended their proposals to allow for costs to be paid out of the Community Legal Service fund, I would like some reassurances about how that is going to work out in practice, especially in cases involving children and families.

</p>

<a name="40607-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>A no win, no fee approach puts children and families at risk from the unscrupulous or the faint-hearted, who may tell them that they do not have a strong enough case to take on, and that if they want to appeal, they must pay privately.

<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="40607-10_spnew3"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Newcastle: </b>   My Lords, equally it is becoming difficult to find good legal representatives for children and families. We need to remember that the best protection against incompetence or unscrupulousness is a sufficiency of good representatives. I am not at all sure that these proposals will enable that.
</p>

<a name="40607-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>My other concern is about a no-win/no-fee arrangement in this case. I am not aware of such a scheme operating in any other areas that are about fundamental human rights. That seems to be the basic point, which is why I fully support the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart.
</p>




<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="40607-10_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, the right reverend Prelate is right. I do not think that any of us can produce an example where human rights are at stake and where a no-win/no-fee proposal has been made, let alone introduced. I wish to refer to the representations that we and perhaps other noble Lords have received from the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;Where torture has been alleged it cannot possibly be in the interests of justice to allow the decision to challenge a flawed Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT) decision to rest on lawyers&#039; financial interests in the success of the case. This will prejudice those of our patients whose representatives are less able to bear the financial risk of proceeding even where a legal error of law is clear. This is particularly relevant given the Medical Foundation&#039;s current experience that quality firms are closing their immigration departments due to the recently imposed financial constraints&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40607-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>The Medical Foundation has drawn our attention to two cases. I will give the Minister the references in case he wants to look them up. The first is Neutral Citation No: CO&#150;2174&#150;00, which was heard on 21 November 2000 before Sir Richard Tucker. The adjudicator had rejected the applicant&#039;s claim for asylum mainly on credibility grounds. Mr Justice Tucker, however, allowed the judicial review application saying that he did not agree with the counsel who appeared on behalf of the Secretary of State that the adjudicator&#039;s findings of fact were sustainable. In his view they were not and the case had to be reviewed and should be taken before the immigration tribunal. The claimant was later recognised as a refugee.
</p>

<a name="40607-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>The second example is where a chairman of the tribunal determined an application for permission to appeal. The appeal number is HX/42009/2003, which took place on 8 December 2003. The chairman said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;An adjudicator is entitled to use his own experience in assessing evidence, including how scars might be formed but not to set himself up as an expert&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>In that case a decision is still awaited, but it is not clear how an adjudicator would come to have the experience necessary to make a forensic judgment, nor the extent <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_35"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 35</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of that particular adjudicator&#039;s medical knowledge, although he was permitted to attack the Medical Foundation expert who had written the report before him for failing adequately to explain her conclusion.
</p>

<a name="40607-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>The Medical Foundation says that it cannot predict whether those two cases would have been successful under the Bill&#039;s terms or how the courts would have made a decision on referring them back. It shows that no-win/no-fee is a gamble and that, although there are serious doubts about the way in which such cases were decided, no one has any idea whether the applicants would have had the right to pursue their claims if this system had been in operation.
</p>

<a name="40607-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>With the Medical Foundation&#039;s experience and that   of other agencies referred to, we are looking at a situation where the rights of asylum applicants who may have had the experience of torture will be seriously undermined. I am sure that your Lordships would not want that to happen.

<a name="40607-11_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, as a Member of the House with no legal qualifications who has not been involved with the process, this seems to me a matter of simple common sense. I shall listen with great interest to what the Minister has to say if he does not accept the amendment&#039;s principle. The Law Society&#039;s case, which it put before many of your Lordships, was well made by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. It seems common sense to me.
</p>

<a name="40607-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>My noble friend Lord Newton from his experience of the Council on Tribunals made it clear that often an appeal is more complicated and takes longer if there is no lawyer involved. To have a situation where a lawyer may not dare to take on the case or may not want to because it seems too much of a gamble is a great mistake.
</p>




<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="40607-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, we have considerable sympathy with the general approach of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in the amendments that he proposes, without necessarily agreeing with the specific approach that he takes in each case.
</p>

<a name="40607-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I have already indicated that there is a plain dissonance between the test for review that the Government have now adopted in the first amendment of the day and the criteria for furnishing legal aid in circumstances where someone meets it. That is a profound and inexplicable irrationality that goes to the heart of the Government&#039;s legal aid proposals.

</p>

<a name="40607-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>Moreover, I share entirely the view of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and many other noble Lords, that a conditional fee approach is wholly inappropriate to asylum cases.
</p>

<a name="40607-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>I should say at the outset that I am opposed to conditional fees altogether. I said so consistently during the debates in your Lordships&#039; House on the Access to Justice Act 1999. However, the objections to conditional fees are even more firmly based with <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_36"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 36</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

regard to public law; and, in particular, the human rights aspects of public law; and, especially, in asylum cases involving human rights issues.
</p>

<a name="40607-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>There are a number of reasons for that, some of which have already been canvassed by noble Lords. The first is that the outcome in asylum cases is particularly difficult to predict because of the central role that the issue of credibility plays. Yet a high degree of accuracy of prediction is vital for the operation of a successful conditional fee system.
</p>

<a name="40607-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>Secondly, in a conditional fee system, the client insures himself against losing a case so as to reimburse the solicitor for his expenses in the event of losing. An asylum seeker will be in no position to do that, but who will pay the insurance companies if they are not paid by the asylum seeker?

</p>

<a name="40607-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Perhaps the most fundamental objection of all is this: conditional fees are not appropriate to human rights cases, which require, as the judges have repeatedly reminded us in the High Court and above, the most anxious scrutiny. That, indeed, is the view taken to human rights issues with respect to every other public law matter in the country. In this respect, I find the Government&#039;s disposition particularly bewildering. They introduced the Human Rights Act to make Strasbourg remedies available in English law, in English courts; yet they are not now prepared to live up to these new responsibilities, which they imposed on themselves, by seeing them properly reflected in the legal aid system.

<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="40607-11_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, in responding to amendments moved by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, I shall speak&#151;and not before time&#151;to government Amendments Nos.   46A, 47A, 48B, 49A, 50A and 58A. In doing so, I shall also respond to Amendments Nos. 47, 48, 48A, 49 and 50.
</p>

<a name="40607-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>Amendments Nos. 47, 48, 48A, 49 and 50 are concerned with the provisions for new legal aid arrangements for the review and reconsideration process. Essentially, we are considering how to craft a new system that allows cases in which there are good grounds for there being a fault of law by the AIT to be properly considered by the High Court. We are not trying to reopen the situation, which I hope the House recognises took place, in which a substantial number of judicial review cases were brought on asylum matters to the courts without substantial merits, with the predominant aim of gaining time so that the asylum applicant whose case had not been found to have merit could defer his removal from this country.
</p>

<a name="40607-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>We should not fool ourselves: this is not the dilemma with which we in a liberal society are trying to grapple. We want applicants in whose cases an error of law has been made to have an opportunity for redress in the higher courts; we have listened to the House in that respect. However, we do not want to reopen a situation in which there is an incentive for the applicant to continue the case, since it is in his interest to string out the process for as long as he possibly can, as that will delay or perhaps even avoid the date when he can be removed. We want as well to avoid the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_37"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 37</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

situation in which the lawyer himself is incentivised to take cases without merit because he will suffer no pain as a consequence of doing so.

</p>

<a name="40607-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>While there have been cases that should have gone to judicial review&#151;and it would be foolish of us not to recognise that&#151;there have been very many cases without merit taken to judicial review, with considerable cost to the taxpayer and delay to the system. That has created the impression known to traffickers and others that when they get here the legal system in Britain&#151;which is so good&#151;means that they can string out their process and not be removed from the country. Therefore we are facing the question how we as a society, a Government and a House, can balance those two issues.
</p>

<a name="40607-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>Let me explain why we believe that we have got it right.
</p>




<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="40607-11_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that, considering the mechanisms that have been discussed by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, and particularly the fact that the LSC will now have the responsibility of determining whether a case has sufficient merit, the kinds of abuse that have occurred in the past will still continue if legal aid is provided?
</p>




<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="40607-11_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, may have thought that I was concluding; I was not concluding but only beginning my response. I hope that we shall have an opportunity to address that point.
</p>

<a name="40607-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>What we have done is to introduce an enabling power in new Section 103D to make regulations for a new legal aid scheme for the High Court review process and reconsideration by the tribunal. This will ensure that we focus legal aid on the most meritorious cases. Instead of the Legal Services Commission taking the funding decision, the power will be given to the judiciary to decide if legal aid should be paid in these proceedings. We are effectively asking lawyers to share the risk with the taxpayer when deciding whether an appellant should proceed with a review application. We believe that that will lead to lawyers giving a more rigorous examination to the prospects of a case succeeding. We recognise that good lawyers do that already, but that has not been universally the situation in our experience of asylum matters over recent years. This is not an attempt to remove those cases from the scope of legal aid, but a genuine drive to ensure that the focus of public funding is on deserving cases.
</p>

<a name="40607-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>Amendments Nos. 47, 48, 48A, 49 and 50 would reverse that aim, and would mean that it would be easier to get legal aid for reconsideration proceedings than the original appeal, where the appellant would at least have to satisfy the merits test for legal aid applied by the Legal Services Commission.
</p>

<a name="40607-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>As the Lord Chancellor said in Committee, the regulations constructed under the power will set out the detail of the scheme. Broadly speaking, we envisage that the tribunal will order legal aid to be paid in the following cases: in a case which has been successful and the original appeal decision has been reversed, or in a case which the judge has decided was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_38"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 38</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a near miss, which was meritorious and could have succeeded but did not. In such a case it can decide that it is right that there is a payment.
</p>

<a name="40607-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, for acknowledging that unmeritorious cases should not be publicly funded. A number of noble Lords who have spoken have been concerned about whether the provision might lead to lawyers ceasing to be prepared to take cases to the High Court in these circumstances. That is a perfectly proper and right question. The thrust is that if lawyers get paid only when they succeed&#151;and it is not perfectly possible to predict when they will succeed, for obvious reasons&#151;they will be under a strong disincentive to take cases.

</p>

<a name="40607-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>For those reasons&#151;and with no hint of feeling that that is anything other than proper&#151;we believe that a success fee should be paid and that it should be substantial. I shall not go into the exact arithmetic, because we have not come to a conclusion on that. What we want is a situation in which good immigration and asylum lawyers would know, in taking cases over a period of time, that if they exercise proper professional judgment in the interest of justice and their client&#151;

<a name="40607-11_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, I cannot see why the Legal Services Commission should not apply the usual standards which are applied in considering particular circumstances. After all, at the present time the Legal   Services Commission determines whether the applicant, plaintiff or defendant has a good legal case, and it can refuse or acknowledge that the matter ought to proceed. What is the essential difference between that situation and the one that applies in cases at the present time?

<a name="40607-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I give an undertaking to the House that when I have finished what I have to say and if I have not addressed certain points, I shall be grateful to receive interventions. However, I hope that the House will have patience with me until we get to that point of failure rather than assuming that I am failing on it already.
</p>

<a name="40607-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>I was seeking to explain why a success fee achieved the right balance in view of the fact that a lawyer would take on a level of risk on an individual case. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is right that it is not like a conditional fee agreement, which involves an insurable risk, and that it is unlikely that the appellant himself would be in a position to reimburse the lawyer in the vast majority of such situations. It stands to reason that that is the situation.
</p>

<a name="40607-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>We shall discuss the level of the success fee with the professions. Essentially we want to discuss what is likely to be the level of uplift on a fee that would ensure an adequate supply of good lawyers prepared to bring cases to review in this way. That is a consultation process that we cannot currently have, but it will be fundamental to crafting this accurately to get the balance right so that good lawyers will make judgments that they will take cases. They may lose on some but they will know that if they exercise good professional judgment they will get adequately remunerated over a period of time. We do not want a <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40607-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>I turn to government Amendment No. 46A, in conjunction with government Amendments Nos. 47A. 48B, 49A and 50A. This enables regulations to be made under Section 103D to make provision for the High Court   to order legal aid to be paid. In Committee, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor outlined this component of the proposals for new legal aid arrangements.
</p>

<a name="40607-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The High Court will also have the power to order the costs of an application under Section 103A to be paid if it orders the tribunal to reconsider its decision on an appeal or if it refers a case to the Court of Appeal. This proposal is important so that we can design the scheme flexibly. For example, if a case raises a question of law of such great importance that the High Court refers it to the Court of Appeal, it is appropriate that the High Court should have the power to order the costs of the review application to be paid. Government Amendments Nos. 47A, 48B, 49A and 50A are consequential to government Amendment No. 46A.
</p>

<a name="40607-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>Government Amendment No. 58A makes the regulation-making power for new legal aid arrangements in Section 103D subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee recommended that the regulation-making power should be subject to affirmative resolution and in Committee the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor said that he would bring forward an amendment to this effect.
</p>

<a name="40607-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>I now turn to the question of the noble Lord, Lord   Goodhart, about legal aid being paid only at reconsideration. The merits of a case will often come to light only when the case is fully tested and explored by the tribunal. The panel at the reconsideration will be best placed to order legal aid if a successful or near-miss application has been made. The High Court judge can order payment in exceptional circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40607-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, raised questions about the Medical Foundation cases. We are asking lawyers to focus on the fundamentals of cases and whether errors of law have affected the outcome of the cases. If they consider that a genuine case should succeed, they will be given legal aid if the case succeeds or is a near miss. As I signalled, the uplift mechanism will not deter them from taking cases that they consider have merit.
</p>

<a name="40607-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>The noble Lord also spoke about no win, no fee costs being unprecedented for cases affecting human rights. It is already the position that conditional fee agreements are used in relation to judicial review proceedings, which frequently include issues of human rights. I should emphasise that we are talking about public funding only, not cases that are privately funded.

<a name="40607-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, and other noble Lords raised the question of why the LSC&#039;s applied merits test is not good enough. Any LSC-applied merits test will delay the review and reconsideration procedure. The test applied beforehand is hypothetical. We consider it entirely justifiable for the test to be applied by judges at the conclusion of cases. Judges are best placed to make a proper judgment on whether cases had merit because they succeeded or because they were close enough, or that there were other circumstances that they judge appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40607-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>We are facing a real problem about how we get meritorious cases brought forward without over- incentivising the system so that cases without merit continue to be brought to appeal.

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>As I understand Amendment No. 46A, these reconsideration of legal aid provisions apply only where the court has made an order of recommitment to the tribunal or to a higher court.

<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="40607-12_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, I regard the Government&#039;s response to our amendments as deeply disappointing. I am also seriously concerned about some of the human rights implications. The Government are being illogical. They are not proposing to modify the present rules about the grant of legal aid for the first hearing before the tribunal. That is something that has undoubtedly been abused at certain times in the past, but I think that the Government recognise that, where a merits test is satisfied, it is necessary to grant legal aid for the first hearing before the tribunal. Of course, the number of first hearings is far larger than the number of appeals so <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_41"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 41</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that is the level at which the real cost is incurred and there   will be no real saving on that from any of these amendments.
</p>

<a name="40607-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>The Government are proposing to withdraw legal aid from only some cases of the making of an application and from cases of reconsidering following the making of an application where the application has been granted. We on these Benches are prepared to accept an amendment in a form that would mean that legal aid can legitimately be withheld in cases where there are no reasonable grounds for an application. What we find completely unacceptable is that legal aid should be withheld in cases were there is a reasonable ground for application, and not only withheld, but withheld retrospectively, at the end of the case, when the lawyer who has taken on the case has no guarantee whether that case is going to be successful.

</p>

<a name="40607-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>The Minister referred to the need for more rigorous examination by lawyers. We are now facing a situation where a lawyer will have to say to himself or herself, &quot;This case has a reasonable chance of success but it is not certain. I simply cannot afford to take that case without a guarantee of payment&quot;. Success fees are wholly inappropriate in order to deal with this situation. Success fees are about cases involving money. I perhaps go a little further than the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, but I would be prepared to accept success fees in cases where money is at issue. In those cases a lawyer can, and indeed should, say, &quot;You have a 50:50 or perhaps even a 55:45 chance of success but it will cost you far more money if you lose than you will get from it if you gain. It is not therefore in your interest, or in mine, to start these proceedings. Therefore, I am not going to take this case, which in the old days I would have taken because the test was whether it had a better than even chance of success&quot;. That sort of financial cost-benefit analysis is wholly inappropriate for asylum cases, as of course it would be in criminal cases.
</p>

<a name="40607-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>I am not suggesting that one can equate asylum cases with criminal cases completely. In criminal cases, it has long been accepted, quite rightly, that a defendant in a criminal case is entitled to be defended by a lawyer who is paid through legal aid and can expect the lawyer to put forward a defence which is seen to have no reasonable chance of success whatever. We do not go as far as that in asylum cases. We are simply saying that an asylum seeker&#151;someone who is an appellant in a case of this kind, seeking reconsideration&#151;should be entitled to have legal aid except in cases where there is no reasonable chance of success.
</p>

<a name="40607-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>This is an issue about which I and my noble friends feel very strongly. So far as today is concerned, we are in a bit of a practical quandary because the noble Lord, Lord   Kingsland, has made it clear that he is not at present in a position to support our amendments fully. It certainly seems to us, therefore, that the appropriate thing to do today is to ask the leave of the House to withdraw the amendment which I have moved in order to give an opportunity for further consideration of the matter in the hope of achieving a consensus. However, we would in those circumstances wish to bring this back. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_135"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 50C I shall speak also to the other amendments in the group. From my point of view, the crucial amendments in this group are Amendments Nos. 54A and 57A. Amendment No. 54A, which is kindly supported by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is very close to the amendment that he and the noble Lord, Lord McNally, have tabled.
</p>

<a name="40607-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>The issue behind this group of amendments concerns whether the new tribunal should have lay members on it. The existing tribunal does and normally sits as three, with one legal member and two lay wingmen. The new tribunal apparently will sit with only one legal member.
</p>

<a name="40607-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>Anyone who has an even passing acquaintanceship with asylum applications will know that the credibility of the applicant is more often than not the determining issue. Credibility is an issue of fact. Indeed, credibility in an asylum case is a particularly difficult issue of fact, both because it is based on evidence given by applicants born and brought up in a world alien in religion, language and culture from our own; but also because it is extremely difficult to get reliable documentary or oral corroboration of alleged facts. Yet it is crucial that the new tribunal is, and is seen to be, competent in reaching accurate final conclusions about credibility.
</p>

<a name="40607-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>That is so because the Home Office interview procedure is widely regarded as deeply flawed&#151;the statistics speak for themselves on this matter; because the Home Office is not an impartial forum and becomes a party to any later appeal; and because, most important of all, the new tribunal is to be the one and only occasion when the factual issues are heard, assessed and determined by an impartial forum. Review of its decisions are only on errors of law, and then only on the papers.
</p>

<a name="40607-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>So what steps have the Government taken to ensure that this impartial new tribunal is up to its task? The short and, indeed, long answer to that question is &quot;none&quot;. Indeed, they have made the chances of an objective assessment of credibility even less likely. There are at least three reasons for that. First, the new tribunal is not a tribunal at all. The Government have not kept the existing three-person tribunal and expunged the single-person adjudicator. They have destroyed the three-person tribunal and replaced it with a single member. If any noble Lords want further proof of that, they should simply look at the schedules. The basis of the new scheme is not the schedule to the   2002 Act on tribunals, but the schedule on adjudicators. Indeed, it is hard not to detect a degree of hypocrisy in the use of the expression, &quot;tribunal&quot;.

</p>

<a name="40607-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>Secondly, the arrangements for the new so-called tribunals are just plain wrong, because applicants are entitled to have the factual aspects of their case heard, fairly and impartially, and assessed properly. If the tribunal were dealing with a criminal matter, the person appearing before it would have their case determined by <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_44"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 44</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

tribunals of either three lay members in a magistrates&#039; court, or 12 lay members in the Crown Court. However, the consequence of making factual errors in an asylum case can be far graver than in any criminal trial in this country.
</p>

<a name="40607-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>Moreover, it is not only wrong of the Government to exclude lay adjudication from such tribunals, but plain foolish. The central object of the design of the statutory regime should be to make it sufficiently fair to discourage the courts from providing a parallel remedy in judicial review, as other statutory regimes have done successfully. One example is that of enforcement appeals. If the courts are not confident that issues of fact are properly dealt with by the system, they will permit judicial review on   grounds of either perversity or disproportionality, following oral argument on permission applications&#151;oral arguments that are denied under the proposed statutory regime.

</p>

<a name="40607-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>That third consequence is much less likely to be the case if the tribunal is composed of three members. I accept that having three lawyers would be extremely expensive; but, much more importantly, it would be much less desirable than having one lawyer and two lay members, with the selection of lay members geared to employ individuals with long experience of assessing character, a reasonable proportion of whom should come from the ethnic minorities to reflect the backgrounds of the applicants. That would vastly improve confidence in the fairness of the objective fact-finding procedure. In doing so, it would make the statutory regime impervious to judicial review.
</p>

<a name="40607-13_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I express some scepticism about the Government&#039;s motives on the matter of lay representation on bodies that have a mixture of fact-finding and legal duties. That mistrust is most colourfully manifested in the Government&#039;s attitudes to jury trials, as we saw in the great debates on the then Criminal Justice Bill last year. We have also seen attempts&#151;some successful&#151;to remove lay members from tribunals, such as the social security tribunals. There seems to be a growing lack of trust by the Government in the judgment of our citizens. Is that because they perceive that our citizens have a growing lack of trust in them? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="40607-13_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, three of the amendments in the group&#151;Amendments Nos. 54, 55 and 56&#151;are in my name and that of my noble friend Lord McNally. Two of the others&#151;Amendments Nos. 54A and 57A&#151;were tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and I have also put my name to them.
</p>

<a name="40607-13_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>There is enormous value in having some lay members of the tribunal. A purpose of many parts of the tribunal system is that it is possible to bring into tribunals that exercise judicial functions people who have practical experience, even if they do not have legal qualifications. Employment tribunals are a well known example. For the reasons very clearly expressed by the noble Lord, we think it of particular importance that the AIT should not be restricted purely to people with a legal qualification. Many lay people have the common sense, understanding of human nature and so on to make them at least equally good judges of fact as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_45"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 45</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

people with legal training. As the noble Lord explained, in very many aspects such judgment is particularly important.

</p>

<a name="40607-13_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>That is more the case than it would be otherwise because of the notoriously inadequate record of the initial decisions made by the immigration officers, of which a strikingly high proportion are overturned on appeal. We see no prospect of the standard of those decisions being substantially raised in the immediate future, although we hope that it will be a target in the longer run. Whatever our views might be if that standard were higher than now, unless it is substantially raised there is a very strong case&#151;it would remain in any event&#151;not only for the inclusion of lay members on the tribunal, but for saying that the initial decision of the tribunal needs to be taken by a panel of three. Then one or two lay members could be included on the tribunal, with a legally qualified chair. Again, that pattern is very   frequently adopted in other tribunals, such as employment tribunals.
</p>

<a name="40607-13_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>The amendments would very substantially advance the cause of justice. As the noble Lord said, where there has been a failure of justice by the tribunal, the consequences could be very serious&#151;more so than those of a wrongful criminal conviction. We are happy to make common cause with the noble Lord over all the amendments.

<a name="40607-14_spmin0"></a><b>The Countess of Mar:</b>  My Lords, I have resisted the temptation to speak on the subject throughout debates on the Bill. I reiterate that I am a lay member of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. One factor not covered in the debate is the amount of stress on the current chairmen of the tribunals, let alone the adjudicators. They have political and public pressures on them to do the job and get it right. In many cases, they work in isolation on case after case, and write up very often late at night. On many occasions, I can see the exhaustion in my colleagues&#039; faces. Occasionally, a legal member can go off the rails. If he is sitting on his own, that may not be picked up for quite a long time.

</p>

<a name="40607-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>I find it difficult to support my job in the face of the fact that the Government do not like it. At the same time,   Her Majesty&#039;s Government should consider the pressures that they are putting on these people. There is a backlog of thousands of cases, and the pressure is on to clear that backlog. It is very important to have even one lay member to support them, to discuss the case with them, and, as the noble Lord, Lord   Kingsland, made clear, to come to conclusions on the credibility of the applicant in the first place.
</p>

<a name="40607-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>We must remember that this is the only jurisdiction in this country that has the power of invoking the death penalty&#151;that is a very dramatic way of putting it. We can also impose on people an awful prison sentence. Some of the conditions in the countries that asylum seekers come from are appalling. One need only have someone who is very tired and not quite <br>&nbsp;<br>

concentrating to make a little mistake. A lay member may just be able to prevent such a mistake from being made.
</p>




<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="40607-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Newton of Braintree: </b>   My Lords, I am encouraged by the presence of my distinguished predecessor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell, to intervene briefly. I wish to quote from something that the Council on Tribunals, under the noble and learned Lord&#039;s chairmanship, said on an earlier proposal of this kind in its 1999 report. Page   11 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;We were troubled by the removal of the lay element from the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. Although we recognise that lay members may be unnecessary in cases concerned solely with issues of law, we believe that they have a valuable contribution to make when issues of credibility arise, particularly in asylum appeals&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>As it happens, and as the noble and learned Lord will certainly remember, that proposal was changed during the passage of the Bill and the Lord Chancellor&#039;s power to appoint lay members to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal at that stage was preserved. This is not a point to which the Council on Tribunals has addressed quite the same attention on this occasion. Being more preoccupied with some of the other matters that I have touched on today, and given its less than full enthusiasm for the proposed single tier in this area, it has focused on other things.

</p>

<a name="40607-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>In fairness to the Minister, we should acknowledge that the position is a little muddier in this area than has so far been acknowledged in this debate. The report published two or three years ago&#151;I have forgotten the exact date&#151;by Sir Andrew Leggatt, <i>Tribunals for Users</i>,   which underpins the Government&#039;s forthcoming proposals for reform in that area, pointed out that it was curious that lay members are in the second-tier tribunal and not in the first-tier tribunal. That is the opposite of what one would expect, and what we would urge, in most systems.
</p>

<a name="40607-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>I realise that the world has changed, because Sir   Andrew recommended a general two-tier approach to tribunals, which the Government have now rejected in this area. It was in that context that he made the following proposal, which I quote from paragraph 23 of his report:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;There should be a first tier immigration and asylum tribunal, within a separate Division, which should be the sole judge of issues   of fact. Complex factual issues are a regular feature of immigration and asylum cases, ranging from the circumstances of an alleged marriage or the obligations within an extended family abroad to the political situation in a country from which asylum is sought. Many cases would not be suitable for hearing by a chairman, even legally qualified, sitting alone and expert members should be used when appropriate at this level. In setting the qualifications for appointment to the tribunal, and to sit in particular cases, we believe&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>that is to say, Andrew Leggatt and his team&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;that special care should be taken to ensure that those selected bring relevant experience and skills to the decisions to be taken, such as knowledge of conditions in particular countries concerned, or of refugees&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>In the context in which Sir Andrew reported, he said that there should be a second-tier tribunal, which would consist of lawyers sitting alone&#151;that is to say, the more normal model.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_47"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 47</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I recognise that in one sense the world has moved on from the one in which Sir Andrew made those proposals. Nevertheless, the core of this is the argument that he sets out in the paragraph from which I have just quoted, which links very nicely with some of the remarks made in this debate about the nature of the decisions taken at what I will express in shorthand as the first-tier level. I have in mind the factors that need to be considered, the importance of credibility and the involvement of relevant experts&#151;that was the word he used; it was certainly non-lawyer participants&#151;in making those judgments of fact.
</p>

<a name="40607-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>It would be helpful if the Government could clarify why they have rejected this line of argument, which appears to have at least as much merit in the context of the single-tier proposals as in the context, which I acknowledge is different, of what Sir Andrew said.
</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="40607-14_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, I wish to reiterate a point that my noble friend Lord Kingsland made: the possibility of having lay members and an ethnic minority member, or perhaps two, to make the   process more credible in the eyes of the public and the asylum seeker concerned. Several noble Lords have pointed out that this is the one opportunity when the facts can be ascertained. It is an absolutely critical time for an asylum seeker. To extend the possible membership of the tribunal by making it possible to have a suitably experienced&#151;as the Bill requires&#151;ethnic minority member is a very important point that we should not forget.
</p>




<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="40607-14_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I wish to place on the record that I am well aware of the value that lay members have brought in the past in these matters, and of the value that they bring to tribunals in a range of circumstances, not least employment tribunals, as the noble Lord, Lord   Goodhart, indicated. As the noble Lord, Lord Newton, signalled, we shall shortly publish our proposals for taking forward Sir Andrew Leggatt&#039;s proposals, which I hope will pick up the essence of his approach. However, that is for another time.

</p>

<a name="40607-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>Amendments Nos. 54 to 56 have been grouped with Amendments Nos. 50C, 54A and 57A as they relate to the appointment of members of the asylum and immigration tribunal, and how the members are deployed within the tribunal. Amendments Nos. 54 to 56 when read together would mean that a person is eligible for appointment as a member of the tribunal if, in the Lord Chancellor&#039;s opinion, he or she had legal or other experience that made them suitable for appointment. The thrust of these amendments would be to retain the existing provisions in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 for the appointment of adjudicators with eligibility for judicial posts not based solely on legal qualification.
</p>

<a name="40607-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Amendment No. 54A is very clear that its purpose is to enable lay people to be appointed to the tribunal. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, tabled a similar amendment in Committee, which was not debated then.

</p>

<a name="40607-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>Amendment No. 57A is new and would require appeal hearings to be conducted by three member panels, unless directed by the president. Amendment No. 50C would <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_48"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 48</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

ensure that determinations made by panels composed of lay members would still be subject to review in the High Court.

</p>

<a name="40607-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>Let me seek to explain why we do not feel that these   amendments are appropriate. After considerable thought, as a product of how we craft a new single-tier structure, we have taken the decision to ensure that the judiciary in the new asylum and immigration tribunal are appointed on the basis of qualified legal experience, or, in the opinion of the Lord Chancellor, they have legal experience which makes them suitable for appointment.
</p>

<a name="40607-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>In setting out the reasons why we do not agree with the amendments, I will go back into history a little to explain how we have got to the current situation with the role of lay members in the appellate system.

</p>

<a name="40607-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>The existing two-tier appeal system was introduced by the Immigration Act 1971. Lay members participated in panels formed as part of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal, as appeals to the IAT could be made on the grounds of errors both of law and of fact. However, the system of appeal introduced over 30 years ago by the Immigration Act 1971 bears little relationship to the complex system that we have today.
</p>

<a name="40607-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>Compared to 1971, asylum and immigration appeals now raise many complicated legal issues that require close legal scrutiny and consideration. In these circumstances, a judge who has been appointed on the basis of legal experience is considered competent to conduct an appeal hearing on their own. However, it would be impossible to allow a lay member to conduct an appeal hearing on their own, and so this means they may be deployed only as part of a panel, as they are at present on the IAT.
</p>

<a name="40607-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>However, even within the IAT it has become open to question whether lay members can claim to be an essential component to panel determinations on points of law, especially since the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which restricted appeal to the IAT to points of law only. Lay members have made a valuable contribution to the IAT over the past 30 years or so, but these changes have diminished the role of lay members and placed them in an anomalous position&#151;a position that the Government have addressed as part   of their proposals for the new Asylum and Immigration Tribunal.

</p>

<a name="40607-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>The majority of cases in the new tribunal will be heard by a single immigration judge. As adjudicators do now, they will need to consider points of law and of fact, and   will therefore need to be legally qualified, legally experienced and competent to do this effectively. This rules out the deployment of lay members in this role, as their sole contribution to the decision-making process is restricted to matters of fact. It might be argued that lay members should be utilised in three-member panels, as is done now. However, in the new Asylum and Immigration Tribunal, the intention is that panels will usually be set up to hear only appeals that raise novel or complex points of law, or those that help to set authoritative case law for the tribunal. It goes without saying that the judicial bench hearing these appeals must be legally qualified.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_49"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 49</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-14_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The requirement in Amendment No. 57A that nearly all appeal hearings must be by three-member panels would, of course, also have a detrimental impact on resources and the speed of the appeal process. First, it would be wasteful of tribunal resources, as in the existing system just over half of appeals stop at the adjudicator stage, and only a minority of cases are ever considered by a three-member panel in the IAT. There is no need to have a panel for every case. Secondly, if the new tribunal had three-member panels within the faster times we expect, it would have to recruit many more new members, which would have to be paid for. Thirdly, if the tribunal were to keep to its existing resources, the number of appeal hearings it would be able to do per month with three-member panels would fall dramatically. There are some 56   lay members, and they are part time, sitting on average 40 to 50 days per year. That would inevitably lead to backlogs and delays. Lastly, in respect of lay membership within tribunals, the Leggatt report concluded that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;There is no justification for any members to sit, whether expert or lay, unless they have a particular function to fulfil&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40607-14_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>That is the essential thrust of why we believe that these   proposals are consistent with Andrew Leggatt&#039;s proposals, recognising, like the noble Lord, Lord Newton, that times have moved on.
</p>

<a name="40607-14_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>While lay members have had a role in the existing system, the Government have considered the needs of the new tribunal very carefully. We have concluded that the case for retaining lay members is no longer sustainable. To retain their services purely on the basis of custom and practice&#151;which is what these amendments call for&#151;would not be appropriate, courteous or right.

</p>

<a name="40607-14_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, about credibility, the future members of the IAT, adjudicators and legal members of the IAT are well able to assess credibility issues. They are trained and able to do so. The tribunal will be flexible; it will have both panels and single judges for cases. The tribunal is also well able to consider points of fact, that is, the purpose of the appeal when facts and law are considered together. If facts are not properly considered, that might amount to an error of law, and could be the subject of a review in the High Court.
</p>

<a name="40607-14_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>In the new IAT, the judiciary are able to assess facts, as I have signalled, and if expert advice is required, as referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, no doubt this can be requested. The low percentage of cases that result in the adjudicator&#039;s determination being overturned points to that credibility.
</p>

<a name="40607-14_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>On the point raised by the noble Countess, Lady   Mar, we are seeking to improve the quality of the tribunal through a new judicial structure that would allow the monitoring of individual members of the AIT. If a member made an error of law in determination, again that could be subject to appeal.

</p>

<a name="40607-14_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>I have touched on the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Newton, about Sir Andrew Leggatt&#039;s report. The central point is that he was describing what was appropriate for a two-tier system; we are discussing a single-tier system. I share the desire for diversity expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour. We are clear that that is subject to a merit test, as has been <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_50"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 50</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

signalled previously. The way to address that is to look at how to ensure that there is a pool of suitable, qualified lawyers available for appointment if they meet the merit test to be considered as judges in the new AIT structure.
</p>

<a name="40607-14_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>I hope that I have been able to explain why, with some sorrow, we feel that the contribution that lay members have made in the past has now come to an end as a consequence of the substantially different role that the AIT will perform.

<a name="40607-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, I am not sure whether to conclude that the Minister completely missed the point of all the submissions which have been made by your Lordships, or if he simply did not want to know about them. I will leave it to your Lordships to reach your own conclusions. I will not repeat my speech, although the Minister did not answer any of the central issues that I raised in my submission.
</p>

<a name="40607-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>I am most grateful to all noble Lords who contributed. I will, if I may, single out my noble friend Lord Newton of Braintree, who brought the telling argument of Lord Justice Leggatt to bear on the lack of logic of the Minister. The Minister seemed to suggest that, because the only grounds of appeal from the tribunal to the High Court are errors of law, the only people who are qualified to sit on tribunals ought to be lawyers. Yet the basis of all the arguments that have been deployed on this amendment this evening is exactly the opposite. It is because grounds of fact are not appealable to the High Court that we need to be confident that they will be properly determined at tribunal level. The Minister has simply not confronted that question, let alone answered it to the satisfaction of the Opposition. The noble Countess, Lady Mar, observed that this is the only tribunal that can send a person to their death because it does not find a story credible. That is particularly and conclusively telling.

</p>

<a name="40607-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>I want to test the opinion of the House. The first amendment in this group is Amendment No. 50C. Will the Minister accept that&#151;if by any chance the Opposition and our supporters should succeed in this Division&#151;Amendments Nos. 54A and 57A are contingent upon Amendment No. 50C? Will he accept that the group of amendments goes together in the vote?

<a name="40607-15_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, the issues have been widely canvassed in the debate this evening.

<a name="40607-15_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Kingsland </b>   moved Amendment No. 52A:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>After Clause 14, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_2"></a><br>
   &quot;REVIEW AFTER EXHAUSTION OF RIGHTS OF APPEAL


   Where a person&#039;s statutory rights of appeal have been exhausted with respect to an immigration decision, and where that person subsequently makes an application to the Secretary of State for his deportation to be stayed on the grounds that here has been a change of circumstances&#151;


(a)   if the Secretary of State decides that there has been no change in circumstances or accepts that there has been a change of circumstances but decides that they do not justify a stay of deportation, the applicant within 10 days of the decision may apply to a High Court judge or a judge of the Court of Session to review the decision;


(b)   the review shall be conducted on the papers save in exceptional circumstances;


(c)   the decision of the High Court judge or the judge of the Court of Session is final.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_146"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the reason for introducing the amendment is to try to make the statutory review scheme in the Bill comprehensive in such a way that it excludes the possibility of judicial review. We can only succeed in doing that if the statutory review procedure, throughout all stages of the asylum decision, is considered sufficiently fair for the courts not to exercise their discretion to use the judicial review remedies that our courts have so proudly developed over the past 40 years.
</p>

<a name="40607-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>I am trying to confront the following scenario: an asylum seeker has exhausted his statutory rights and is due to be deported. At some stage before his deportation, a new set of circumstances arises, say, in the country to which he is to be deported. There is a regime change. A benign regime is replaced by an autocratic and brutal one. In those circumstances, the asylum seeker, who is about to be deported, communicates with the Home Office. He says, &quot;My decision ought to be reviewed on the grounds that the circumstances of my case have changed since the final tribunal decision was made. The country to which I am to be deported is a country that will, if I go there, treat me at a standard below the standards required by English law&quot;.

</p>

<a name="40607-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>The Home Office considers such applications. In some cases, it has accepted that there is a change of circumstances and consequently has stayed deportation. But in other circumstances, it has either said that it does not accept that the circumstances have changed or that the circumstances have changed but not sufficiently to stay deportation. If it reaches one of those two latter decisions, the asylum seeker will often seek judicial review. As a consequence, the whole case, including all the issues that were raised during the statutory procedure, is rerun, to everyone&#039;s unnecessary expense and, in some cases, to the mental detriment of the asylum seeker.
</p>

<a name="40607-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>The amendment seeks to prevent all that by ensuring that where the Home Office decides that there has been no change of circumstances or that there has been a change of circumstances but that it does not believe that they are sufficient, the matter will be reconsidered by a High Court judge. It is not necessary to go back to the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_54"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 54</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

tribunal again. The only issue at stake is not the personal circumstances of the asylum seeker, but the factual situation in the country to which he is about to be deported. That can be swiftly, effectively, successfully, credibly and comprehensively dealt with by a High Court judge. There is no reason why his decision ought not to be final.
</p>

<a name="40607-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>In my judgment, if that amendment is incorporated in the Bill, it will succeed in achieving <i>de facto</i> what the Government sought, so clumsily, to achieve with their ouster clause; namely, to persuade judges who sit in the administrative courts considering judicial review matters on change of circumstances applications that judicial review is not necessary because an alternative and satisfactory statutory procedure is already in place. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_147"></a>
<a name="40607-16_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Russell: </b>   My Lords, I think that we all feel that it is in the initial stage of the asylum hearing where most of the worst mistakes are made. At the weekend, I was looking at the report compiled on behalf of the Mayor of London on the effects of Section 55 of the 2001 Act. It quoted an official from the Home Office who is used to hearing initial applications, who said, &quot;When I get an application from Afghanistan, I simply repeat one of the standard formulae from the country assessment. When I get tired of doing that, then I repeat a different sentence from the formulae about the country assessment&quot;. Afghanistan has seen quite a lot of changes over the past few years. If one is doing that, one is almost bound to be wrong and severely risks being totally irrelevant to the case under consideration.
</p>

<a name="40607-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>The number of mistakes that are made in that way is considerable: for example, the assertion that used to be made regularly under President Mobutu of Zaire. Under President Mobutu, opposition parties were allowed to flourish freely: well, so President Mobutu said. But President Mobutu is not granted and was never granted infallibility and it is not compulsory to believe him. One must question those assessments. One must question the picture of the country.
</p>

<a name="40607-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>I also very much took the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, about the drafting of a statute in such a way that it does not leave an opening for people to say those wonderful words of judicial construction: namely, Parliament cannot possibly have intended that. I think that the noble Lord would be wrong to suggest&#151;as he sounded as if he might be doing at one stage, but he probably was not&#151;that this is only a development of the past 40 years.
</p>

<a name="40607-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>One can take this back right through the centuries; for example, to the Dissolution of Chantries in 1549. It had a proviso which had the effect of providing that when the King bought chantry land he had to do feudal homage to one of his subjects. The court concluded there that Parliament could not possibly have intended that that should happen. On that occasion, I think that the court was right.
</p>

<a name="40607-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>My favourite example of Parliament not intending something was the Bologna ordinance, which laid down the death penalty for shedding blood in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_55"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 55</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

piazza. One of the judges went to the barber in the piazza, who cut the judge in the course of shaving him. He was put on trial under the statute. The court ruled that that was contrary to the intention of the statute and that the barber was innocent.
</p>

<a name="40607-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>Time spent here on getting the drafting of the statute right is likely to be time better spent than we realise. It will save a great deal of time later.
</p>




<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="40607-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </b>   My Lords, I support the amendment. Once the stage of a deportation order has been reached, everything has been looked at in due order and in proper circumstances. But if there is a fundamental change in circumstances thereafter, it is idle to say, &quot;Well, that has been decided by the earlier proceedings&quot;. By definition, the circumstances did not then exist. The intention, as set out by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, might almost have been made by him from the Front Bench since it admirably meets the intention so often reiterated by the Government that we must stop these endless appeals and judicial reviews. I do not think that they ever were endless, but that is beside the point.
</p>

<a name="40607-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>The amendment does that very neatly. The only improvement that I should like is a pure drafting matter, which is a point raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Mackay, at an earlier stage. Paragraph (b) of Amendment No. 52A states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;the review shall be conducted on the papers save in exceptional circumstances&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>I would like to know who will decide about the exceptional circumstances, but I assume it is the tribunal and the High Court judge hearing the quasi-judicial review application. But, obviously, it would enable the Government to make an application to the court that they may also be heard, and there might well be a cause for it. If the issue is whether there has been a sufficient change in the regime of the place where the deportee is to be sent, his evidence on the matter may be, not unnaturally, extremely one-sided. I would not want to see a repetition of the situation not many months ago when the Home Secretary complained bitterly that he did not seem to be able to appeal. I hope that the Home Secretary would be given every opportunity to have his say in these circumstances, but   even his say will not take very long. So the Government&#039;s main objective will be met as will the interests of justice.
</p>




<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="40607-16_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, in the specific example that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, gave for why he believed that this amendment was desirable, he talked about circumstances which, while not likely to be commonplace, are certainly possible&#151;that is, a regime change in a country from one which was basically benign and no real threat to the life and liberty of the asylum seeker to one which was hostile in general and posed a real and specific threat to the applicant. That is not commonplace but it is possible.
</p>

<a name="40607-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>However, in that situation there is a relatively straightforward way that the applicant or their solicitor would signal to the Home Office that they <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_56"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 56</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

wish to apply for asylum because the circumstances had changed suddenly and significantly, affecting their   liberty. In that circumstance the Home Office would make a decision about whether it was a new application for asylum, and, if so, consider whether it met the tests and should be accepted.
</p>

<a name="40607-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>If the Home Office, through IND, came to the conclusion either that it was not a change of circumstances, or that the change of circumstances did not justify granting asylum, then the applicant would have a right of redress on judicial review, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, signalled.
</p>

<a name="40607-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>While I respect that the noble Lord is genuinely seeking to persist in this&#151;no doubt that is the case&#151;in these particular cases judicial review is a more flexible remedy than a statutory right of appeal. Under the proposal, a person would have 10 days to apply, but, if a person applies with judicial review at the last moment, they are required to apply within three days. The amendment would make it harder to remove when there was not a meritorious case. There is also no means to stop the person reapplying again and again for the appeal to the High Court, or else a person would go to judicial review as there was not adequate remedy.

</p>

<a name="40607-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>I turn to some of the drafting points where this amendment is not appropriate. We do not believe it will be an effective solution or one that is necessary because a process for dealing with new representations made after appeal rights have been exhausted already exists, as I have summarised. The 2002 Act built on the one-stop appeal process first introduced in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The Act provides for one application, one decision and one appeal. This has broadly been a success. For example, an asylum seeker who makes a claim is required to provide all their reasons for wishing to remain in the country. If their appeal is dismissed, or they decide not to make such an appeal, but then later make new representations, those representations will be considered under paragraph 346 of the immigration rules to decide whether they constitute a fresh claim.
</p>

<a name="40607-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>If it is decided that the representations do not constitute a fresh claim, but rather that they are simply further representations on the original claim, the Secretary of State may maintain his original decision, so no new right of appeal arises. However, if the new representations are considered to be a fresh claim, a new decision, as I signalled, would be made by the Secretary of State which would give rise to a new right of appeal unless the case is certified under Section 96 of the 2002 Act. Certification under Section 96 may take place where a new claim relies on facts which should have been raised at an earlier stage. Clearly, that would not be the case in the situation advanced by the noble Lord. Certification prevents a further statutory right of appeal to the appellate authority or the courts, although it would be open to the claimant to bring a judicial review.
</p>

<a name="40607-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>So, whether the approach is a fresh claim or simply further representations, the applicant always has a remedy&#151;be it a fresh appeal right or the option of applying for judicial review.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_57"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 57</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


<a name="40607-16_time0"></a><h5>6.15 p.m.</h5>

</p>

<a name="40607-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>We also have concerns about the effectiveness of the procedure proposed in the amendment. It is flawed in a number of ways. It would not make provision for the other party to appeal to make representations. An <i>ex parte</i> paper review process is not appropriate in this context. Statutory review under Section 101 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act, and the proposed system of High Court review under new Section 103A, are used as a means of identifying whether an applicant has an arguable case that the decision on their case is wrong.
</p>

<a name="40607-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>If the High Court is of the opinion that there is an arguable case to be made, the appeal receives substantive consideration by the tribunal and both sides are given the opportunity to make written and oral representations. However, Amendment No. 52A would require the High Court judge to come to a final substantive decision without the benefit of representations from the other party.
</p>

<a name="40607-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>The amendment also leaves the grounds open to challenge the Secretary of State&#039;s decision. It does not restrict the ground, for example, to an error of law. The failure to restrict the ground of review would mean that the High Court would be reconsidering errors of fact and law. If matters of fact are permitted in the review, it would therefore risk producing something akin to the original appeal hearing in the tribunal, but one that is one-sided and being decided by an inappropriate court not best placed to test that.
</p>

<a name="40607-16_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>In addition, Amendment No. 52A would rule out the Court of Appeal involvement in the deportation process. The Court of Appeal plays an important role in establishing case law. But these are perhaps more technical points than ones relevant to the central issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. As I sought to address at the beginning, there are remedies available to the applicant, as there should be in the circumstances advanced by the noble Lord. If, despite there being evidence that a regime change had taken place, an IND official still made a judgment that that was not a new application, then the remedy of judicial review is there and we believe that that is appropriate in these circumstances.
</p>

<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="40607-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, I would like to express frankly to him my perplexity at his answer. We started the Bill in another place with an ouster clause. The ouster clause sought to oust judicial review from asylum decisions. The Opposition pointed out to the Government another, more satisfactory, way of creating a comprehensive statutory regime which is sufficiently fair to have the effect of ousting judicial review without actually saying it, from the beginning of the process to the end.
</p>

<a name="40607-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>Between Second Reading and Committee stage in your Lordships&#039; House, the Government withdrew the ouster clause. We are now told by the Minister that our attempt to create a comprehensive statutory regime, in the absence of an ouster clause, is insufficiently flexible because it does not have the flexibility of judicial review.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_58"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 58</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>So the Government have now shifted from a position which began, in another place, with wanting to oust judicial review altogether. Since then they have travelled all the way across the spectrum to say, now, in your Lordships&#039; House that, in some aspects of the asylum decision-making process, judicial review is preferable to a statutory regime because it is more flexible. All I can say to the Minister is: well, really. Where do the Government think they stand on the issue of judicial review?
</p>

<a name="40607-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>It was appropriate for the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, to raise one technical matter. During his response the Minister in turn raised one or two technical questions about my amendment. I think I had a signal from the noble Earl, leading for the Liberal Democrat Benches, that he would like to reflect further on this issue. In those circumstances, although I wish to bring the amendment back at Third Reading, for the moment I beg leave to withdraw it.
</p>

<a name="40607-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
</p>




<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="40607-17_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Kingsland </b>   moved Amendment No. 52B:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>After Clause 14, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_3"></a><br>
   &quot;APPEAL TO TRIBUNAL: PROCEDURE


(1)   Initial decisions by the Secretary of State on asylum application shall be made and notified to the applicant within six   weeks of the application being made.


(2)   Notice of appeal from the decision of the Secretary of State to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (&quot;the Tribunal&quot;)&#151;


(a)   must be made in writing,


(b)   must be lodged with the Tribunal within 14 days of the decision appealed against, and


(c)   must list all the grounds on which the appeal is made.


(3)   Within 14 days of receipt of the notice of appeal the Tribunal shall hold a direction hearing at which all parties to the appeal shall be present.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_152"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we have just dealt with the final stages of the decision-making process of asylum applications. This amendment takes us back in the other direction, to the beginning. We are told that one of the objectives of the Bill is to reduce delay. It is well known that one of the biggest causes of delay in the asylum system is the gap between the application for asylum made by an asylum seeker to the Home Office and the decision reached by the Home Office&#151;technically, the Secretary of State. This amendment would insert into the Bill a time constraint requiring the Secretary of State to decide on an asylum application within six weeks of it being made.
</p>

<a name="40607-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>It is my submission that the adoption of this amendment would make a far bigger contribution to resolving the problem of delay in the asylum system than the reduction of time available during the appeal process itself, to apply for a review, to a period of five   days. That is a minor point in the context of the overall problem of delay in the asylum process and I urge the Government to accept the amendment. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="40607-17_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I was almost fooled by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, in that I thought he was rising to speak. If I understand the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, correctly, this amendment is essentially a debating point to put pressure on the Government to ensure that the earlier <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_59"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 59</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

parts of the process are dealt with expeditiously. We are four-square with the noble Lord on that as a goal of policy. But we could not adopt such an amendment because the consequences would be ones which I suspect neither he nor we would wish to see.
</p>

<a name="40607-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>The new clause introduced by this amendment is concerned with both the initial decision stage in asylum cases and the appeal stage. Subsection (1) would require initial decisions on asylum applications to be taken and notified to the applicant within six   weeks.
</p>

<a name="40607-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is aware of how far we have moved since 1997. In that year, when we had the pleasure of inheriting the immigration and asylum situation, the average decision-making time was 22 months. By 2002 that figure, including decisions on backlog cases, was provisionally brought down to six months. We have since set ourselves a target to decide 75 per cent of new asylum applications within two months, a target that we look to be on course to beat, as well we should. Recently we have been deciding around 80 per cent of new cases within two months.
</p>

<a name="40607-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>We have also made massive inroads into the backlog. From a peak of over 120,000 cases, it is now below 18,100, and falling fast. So we have no difficulty in being open to public scrutiny on our ability to address cases, turn them around and crack the enormous backlog that had built up when we came into government. This is relevant because, as noble Lords know, if the wider world&#151;and in particular traffickers&#151;sense that the pace is slow and the ability to remove difficult, that feeds the business of the traffickers very powerfully indeed. Fast but fair processing is fundamental to providing an effective deterrent.
</p>

<a name="40607-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>Having said that, I do not see any merit in placing a rigid requirement in primary legislation stipulating that a decision must be taken within a specified time. In the majority of cases it is possible to decide claims quickly and fairly with efficient procedures, but there will be cases where more time will be needed if they are to be dealt with fairly&#151;such as where medical evidence is considered crucial or further explorations need to be made in, for example, the person&#039;s home country to see whether their claim is well founded. Alternatively, a short-term disturbance may arise, making it essential to put a brief hold on decision-making for that country.
</p>

<a name="40607-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>Under the constraints imposed by subsection (1) of the proposed new clause, we would be forced to take decisions without having the necessary facts at our disposal. The consequences would be that either we would make decisions without the relevant evidence&#151;and thus would not be acting fairly&#151;or we would fail to make decisions within the time-frame. I am not sure what consequences are implied by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in that situation. If the Government did not deal with applications within six weeks, would the applicants be granted asylum in all cases? I cannot believe that that is the thrust of his proposal. There are <br>&nbsp;<br>

better ways of ensuring that claims are decided promptly than the crude instrument of primary legislation.
</p>

<a name="40607-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>Rather than going into more detail at this point, I repeat that I am four-square with the noble Lord on why we have to keep up both the political and managerial pressure to deal expeditiously and fairly with asylum applications. We have made enormous progress over recent years, but there is still further to go. While not welcoming it, I respect the challenge laid down for us to achieve more, but I do not think that this is the way to do so.
</p>




<p><a name="st_154"></a>
<a name="40607-17_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the Minister&#039;s reply. I accept that progress has been made in reducing the time-frame between the application and the decision. I also accept that, at this stage of the passage of the Bill, this amendment is not word perfect. Clearly we would need to introduce a saving clause to deal with situations where a decision within six weeks was not genuinely possible.
</p>

<a name="40607-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>On the other hand, the Government argued strongly earlier this afternoon&#151;unsuccessfully, I am pleased to say&#151;that increasing the time available for making applications for judicial review from five days to 10   days would introduce a serious delay to the process. But compared with the kind of delays that we face in the initial stages of the asylum seeker&#039;s journey through the statutory system, the delays in the appeal process are trivial. The House has already expressed itself on that point.
</p>

<a name="40607-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>I submit that it would be desirable to have on the face of the Bill something along the lines of the amendment I have proposed. I accept that it needs to be more flexible than the straightforward six weeks proposed here, but I shall take the opportunity between now and Third Reading to give the matter more thought. I may reintroduce the amendment at that point. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40607-18_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McNally </b>   moved Amendment No. 52C:

<ul>

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_4"></a><br>
   &quot;IMMIGRATION DECISION PROCEDURE


(1)   Any interview with the applicant shall be conducted&#151;


(a)   by personnel experienced in interview techniques and trained in cross-cultural communication;


(b)   by personnel of the applicant&#039;s own gender if requested by the applicant.


(2)   An accurate, verbatim and legible written record shall be kept of any interview held under subsection (1).


(3)   The applicant may request the record be read back to him and to request his alterations be included or, if rejected, recorded.


(4)   Any decision on the applicant&#039;s claim shall be determined&#151;


(a)   by the same personnel as conducted the interview;


(b)   on the basis of up-to-date and accurate information on the applicant&#039;s country of origin;


(c)   after careful consideration of any medical evidence bearing out allegations of torture.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_61"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 61</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(5)   An independent inspector shall be appointed after consultation with relevant organisations&#151;


(a)   to report annually on the quality of decision-making in asylum cases;


(b)   to lay that report before Parliament. 


(6)   Section 14 shall not be enacted until and unless the independent inspector is satisfied that the quality of initial decision-making has been improved.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_156"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the tone of many of these amendments acknowledges that there is no easy fix for some of the dilemmas here. The Minister appears to recognise that the Opposition Benches are trying to be constructive in their approach, and certainly the thrust of Amendment No. 52C reflects that. I return to the tale of the Irishman who, when asked for directions, replied by saying, &quot;If I were you, I would not start from here&quot;. We suggest that, in a Bill whose main thrust seems to be to eradicate the overly cumbersome appeals procedure, it misses the more basic fact that the real fault in the system lies in the initial judgments.
</p>

<a name="40607-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>In 2003 over 64,000 initial decisions were made for asylum. Well over 16,000 of those were subsequently overturned. That indicates a massive waste of resources; it is massively unfair to claimants; and it damages public confidence in the system. In Canada only 1 per cent of initial decisions are overturned, which suggests that perhaps the Government have approached this whole problem from the wrong place and in the wrong way.
</p>

<a name="40607-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>We are encouraged in this approach by the opinion of the Home Affairs Select Committee, which said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;The real flaws in the system appear to be at the stage of initial decision-making, not that of appeal&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>The Constitutional Affairs Select Committee said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;we recommend that the removal of a formal tier of appeal should not be undertaken until it can be shown that there has been a significant improvement in initial decision making and the rise in the number of successful first tier appeals has been substantially reversed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>That would seem to be the sensible way to get this system right. As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has indicated, we do not ignore the Government&#039;s initiatives and attempts to improve the system. We welcome the widespread consultation that has taken place. We welcome the setting up of the Advisory Panel on Country Information, although it might have been better if the Government had taken advice from that panel before extending their defined safe countries. Nevertheless, there are good and well intentioned attempts to get this right. We also welcome the involvement of the UNHCR in conducting an audit to report regularly on the quality of initial decision-making.
</p>

<a name="40607-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>This amendment, however, puts forward some specifics to improve initial decision-making. We want to see better, more accurate, timely and impartial information relating to countries of origin. We want to see better expertise in relation to caseworkers. Time and again, those who have given evidence or briefed us have complained about the low quality of personnel involved in initial decision-making. That is not fair to the personnel involved and does not help in addressing some of the problems that we are concerned with.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 62</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>In process we want to see greater continuity of human contact between decisions at the initial and appeal stages. We also think that there are too many perverse incentives built into the system. Surely the main thrust is not in getting the decision fast but in getting it right. That is why we suggest that a little more investment at the initial stage will produce that result.

</p>

<a name="40607-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>We believe that there should be a better appreciation of medical evidence as it relates to allegations of torture, and available and adequate legal aid and advice at the initial stage.
</p>

<a name="40607-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>I hope that the Minister will see this as very constructive and, in terms of what both the Home Affairs and the Constitutional Affairs Select Committees have   recommended, as going right to the core of the problem&#151;rather than what the Government have tried to do in their meander through this legislation in both Houses&#151;to address some of the consequences of the imperfections at the initial stage. I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="40607-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>If there have been two long-running concerns regarding what happens in this area&#151;probably going back to the time of my predecessor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell, as chairman of the Council on Tribunals&#151;it is the quality of initial decision-making combined with something that has not so far been touched on in this debate, which is the   astonishing proportion of hearings before the adjudicators at which no one comes from the Home Office. There is no Home Office presenting officer&#151;known in the trade as a HOPO&#151;to present the Home Office case.
</p>

<a name="40607-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>Given the combination of question marks&#151;I put it no stronger than that&#151;over the initial decision-making, coupled with the fact that a surprisingly high proportion of hearings take place with nobody there to put the case for the Home Office, it is perhaps not surprising that the amount of overturning at the initial stage has been rather high.
</p>

<a name="40607-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>Whether or not that is a fair line of argument, there is one thing on which all would agree there is concern, whether it be the great committees to which reference has been made by the Liberal Democrat Front Bench, or the experience of the Council on Tribunals, or anybody who has looked at this. It is the need, whatever is done with the tribunal system, to improve the quality of initial decision-making and to make sure that the Home Office&#039;s case is sensibly represented when an appeal hearing takes place.

<a name="40607-18_para15"></a>

</p>

<a name="40607-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>In essence, I agree with the central thrust of what the noble Lord, Lord McNally, has said: we want the right decisions to be made in IND&#151;that is easy to say but not easy to do&#151;and for them to be made as expeditiously as possible. That is the aim of the policy and the aim of the process. We are committed to high-quality decisions being made in IND for obvious reasons; it will lead to a more robust system.
</p>

<a name="40607-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>We have introduced a range of measures to improve the quality of the decisions it takes. These include work   on identifying the right candidates for asylum casework; looking at additional ways of strengthening the training and development of caseworkers; having samples of asylum decisions quality assured by senior caseworkers and external assessors; extending the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_64"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 64</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

feedback we obtain from appeal decisions; and doing further work on the country information products and instructions we issue.
</p>

<a name="40607-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>While we consider the quality of initial decisions to be good we accept that more can be done and we are taking active steps in this area. In taking forward this work we are keen to involve outside help, as appropriate&#151;as we are doing, for example, with the UNCHR. However, I do not consider that primary legislation is the appropriate vehicle for this.

</p>

<a name="40607-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>Let me say a little more about what we are doing in regard to some of the specific issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord McNally. All asylum caseworkers attend a three-day intensive training course following their basic asylum training. After that, they have an opportunity to sit in on live interviews and the first interviews they themselves conduct will also be observed by a senior officer or an experienced colleague. There is also a certain amount of &quot;learning on the job&quot; as a typical asylum caseworker may conduct around 200 interviews during the course of a year.
</p>

<a name="40607-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>There is a substantial cultural diversity in the workforce of IND, which is desirable given the wide range of nationalities&#151;in excess of 150&#151;with which it deals. Wherever operationally possible, we offer an interviewer of the same gender as the applicant upon request. Where a request has been made in advance, there has been no difficulty in doing this. If the request is made on the day, we still do our best to comply.
</p>

<a name="40607-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>It is standard practice to keep an accurate, verbatim and legible manuscript record of the interview and to provide the applicant with a copy of the same at the   end of the interview. Under current procedures, the   interviewing officer has the discretion to allow a read-back of the interview to vulnerable applicants. Our experience is that the present system works well and that there is little demand for interviews to be read back generally. Any complaint about the accuracy of the interview record may be made after the interview and may also be raised at appeal if asylum is refused. We have received very few complaints about the conduct and the manuscript recording of interviews.

</p>

<a name="40607-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>In many cases the person conducting the interview will be the person who decides the claim. This clearly has some advantages. However, with caseworkers being absent on leave or training and with some caseworkers working part-time, it would be operationally inefficient for the system to be too rigid and to always have the interviewer as the decision maker. It is possible for a person who has not interviewed the applicant to reach a decision on the claim, given that he or she will have available the full interview record and the relevant background information.
</p>

<a name="40607-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>We recognise that accurate, balanced country information is vital to an effective system. As the noble Lord, Lord McNally, indicated, the 2002 Act established the advisory panel, and the UNHCR has cited the creation of the panel as an example of good practice. The panel&#039;s work has demonstrated that it is fulfilling its function in a robust and effective manner and the Home   Office is keen to respond positively to its <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_65"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 65</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

recommendations. With the assistance of the panel, we are confident that we can ensure that Home Office country material meets the highest standards.

</p>

<a name="40607-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>Careful consideration is given to medical evidence bearing out allegations of torture. We are delighted that   the Medical Foundation now provides regular workshops to asylum caseworkers to better equip them to interview victims of torture and to take proper account of medical evidence when reaching a decision on an applicant&#039;s claim.
</p>

<a name="40607-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>The other elements of the amendment relate to an independent inspector. We do not consider that an inspector needs to be appointed. As I have outlined, we have many measures in hand to improve further the quality of original decision making and we are involving outside bodies in that work where appropriate. We believe that the quality of decision making is good&#151;it has certainly significantly improved over the past seven years or so&#151;and we are satisfied that the new appeal structure will provide a robust, independent means of challenging adverse decisions.
</p>

<a name="40607-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>I turn now to deal with some of the other points raised in the debate. As to torture, our country reports reflect a wide range of information and sources, including Amnesty International, in regard to conditions in particular countries, and we take account of medical reports and reports from the Medical Foundation when assessing asylum claims. As to Home Office presenting officers, we wish to have presenting officers at as high a percentage as possible of appeals before the IAT, for the reasons given by the noble Lord, Lord McNally.
</p>

<a name="40607-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>We do not believe that primary legislation is the place for these measures. However, many if not all of them are proper goals of policy and of management and we are working to achieve them. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord McNally, will withdraw his amendment.

Judicial office holders are not employees. They are independent judicial appointees.

and AIT members fear that their terms of employment may deteriorate after commencement as a result of policy. Any change in terms and conditions is seen to be a threat to judicial independence.
</p>

<a name="40607-19_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>On a number of occasions, my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor has given assurances that the arrangements for disciplining and removing judicial office holders will continue to apply in the new single tier, but there is no need whatever to state that terms and conditions of employment may include provision for dismissal. That adds absolutely nothing to the existing provision, save to arouse fears that the Government intend to promote an adverse change.
</p>

<a name="40607-19_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>It is accepted that there is no longer any intention to include a requirement that members of the new single tier should comply with practice directions which are issued from time to time. I ask again if there is any compelling reason to go down the road of making express reference to dismissal at all. If the Government intend to embody in statute what currently happens, why is there any need to change existing law? I therefore hope that my noble friend will think again about this issue. I do not intend call a Division tonight, but I hope that he will think again between now and Third Reading.
</p>

<a name="40607-19_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 57D. It would simply delete the reference to &quot;supervision&quot; of judicial work and respect the authority of the Lord Chancellor in making rules for the new single tier. I know of no statute which contains provision for one judicial office holder to supervise another. If my noble friend can refer to any particular provision, I shall stand corrected.
</p>

<a name="40607-19_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>The judicial hierarchy requires an appellate judge to overrule the decision of a judge who is less senior if it contains errors of law. That ensures that modern judicial decision-making receives modern methods of management. There is every reason for the new single tier to operate on a more collegiate basis than is the case at present. Existing adjudicators work alone and under great pressure of time, but those are not reasons for introducing a power to enable or, worse still, to require one judge to supervise another or, to put it in another way, to compel one judge to be supervised by another.
</p>

<a name="40607-19_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>A collegiate atmosphere, discussions between judges, better training and personnel development of judges can be achieved without this unprecedented measure. Regardless of the Government&#039;s intentions, without an amendment, the Bill will be read as being inimical to judicial independence. In other words, we should not legislate to create something which we do not intend to apply. I beg to move.

noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis and the Council of Immigration Judges. It is surprising that so startling a provision seems to have received so little attention. As my noble friend said, had Schedule 1(3)(1)(c) ended with &quot;the terms of his appointment&quot;, we might have assumed that a member could be appointed on terms which included reference to the termination of his appointment, because that is what happens in many tribunals and happens already in this area. In a sense, it is the drafting which creates the problem by adding the words &quot;which may include provision for dismissal&quot;. That is what has occasioned my noble friend&#039;s anxiety. There is a constitutional eccentricity in stating so unambiguously that the executive should have an unqualified right to provide for the dismissal of a member of the judiciary.
<a name="time_15"></a>
<a name="40607-20_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40607-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>The Act of Settlement 1701 declared that judges&#039; commissions should provide that they should hold office during good behaviour. Certainly in the case of the senior judiciary there was a provision about how that was to be decided by an address from both Houses of Parliament. As I understand it, all members of the judiciary since have held office so long as there was no complaint about their behaviour.
</p>

<a name="40607-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>As my noble friend has pointed out, we now have a reference to &quot;dismissal&quot; taken from the vocabulary of employment law, not constitution law. A little earlier in our debate the noble Lord, Lord Newton of Braintree, made reference more than once to the Council on Tribunals, of which he is so distinguished a chairman, and to the fact that I was privileged to chair that council in the past. I wonder whether the Council on Tribunals has been consulted on this provision.
</p>

<a name="40607-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>I am throwing the question at my noble friend the Minister without having had an opportunity to warn him and of course I shall understand if he says he will let me know at a later stage. But it is a surprising provision that one would have thought might have occasioned some comment from those quarters.
</p>

<a name="40607-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>It has certainly led to a sense of shock among the existing adjudicators. Of course they already hold and vacate office in accordance with the terms of their appointment, including the duration of their office. But now we are told in effect that they are to be treated as employees.
</p>

<a name="40607-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>Of course I accept my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor&#039;s assurance that he has no intention to change the practice, but at present there is no certainty as to what the future may hold or who will decide on appointments and terminations. If it is intended that the present practice shall continue and that members shall continue to hold office during good behaviour, we are faced with the question that has just been asked by my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis: why change the vocabulary?

</p>

<a name="40607-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>The anxiety of the members of the tribunal is hardly alleviated by the provision that is the subject of Amendment No. 57D that members of the tribunal shall supervise others. Judges may be appealed, but if they are <br>&nbsp;<br>

to be supervised it is startling to find that they may be supervised by their peers&#151;I presume specific members among their peers who have been delegated for that purpose.
</p>

<a name="40607-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>Of course a collegiate atmosphere exists among adjudicators at the present time. They can discuss, but there is now a danger that this segment of the judiciary is beginning to feel its independence threatened. They find already, as the noble Countess, Lady Mar, pointed out, that targets are prescribed for their workload as though they worked on a conveyor belt; they feel that they have Big Brother looking over their shoulder; and they find that production targets are to be paramount even at the cost of the quality of their work. This has become a serious matter for some of them.
</p>

<a name="40607-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>We are not debating a word in a statute but a philosophy of judicial practice. Of course judges should be industrious like everyone else and of course immigration and asylum cases should be heard quickly. But if that entails appointing more tribunal members, that may be a price that we have to pay. In the long term it will be a cheaper price than destroying the independence and the confidence of that section of   the judiciary.

<a name="40607-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>Regarding Amendment No. 56A, we are aware of concerns that have been raised by the reference to &quot;dismissal&quot; in paragraph 3. The provision is there simply to ensure that the terms of appointment for a member of the tribunal can include provision for removal from office. It is already the current practice for adjudicators and members of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal that their terms of appointment include provision for removal.

<a name="40607-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>Why so? Why do it now? Although it may stretch credulity, parliamentary counsel felt that it would be beneficial to place the issue beyond doubt by using a suitable parliamentary opportunity to do so. In other words, it was felt desirable to give legislative clarity and to avoid any uncertainty that judges in appropriate circumstances could be removed from office.
</p>

<a name="40607-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>The process for investigating any complaint against a judge is one that we know well and, as your Lordships know, under the disciplinary procedures no removal can take place without the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice in England and Wales. The expectation of continuing to hold office during good behaviour is our custom and practice.
</p>

<a name="40607-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>With regard to dismissal versus removal from office, without wanting to excite too much optimism I shall reflect on the matter to see whether there is any benefit in using different terminology.
</p>

<a name="40607-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 57D, we are also aware of concerns raised about the power to make rules providing for the supervision of tribunal members in paragraph 20 of Schedule 2. The reference to supervision reflects our intention to develop an organisational structure that will provide judges with better access to support and guidance.
</p>

<a name="40607-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>The judiciary is a substantial body. There will be a judicial hierarchy. While individual judges have to make their own judgments on the facts before them without interference from anyone else, there is benefit in their being in a much more collegiate environment, which will be one of the aims of the tribunal.
</p>

<a name="40607-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>We believe strongly that experienced judges working with and passing on their expertise to less experienced judges will help to improve the quality of decision making in the tribunal. We propose that immigration judges should be supported by a tier of supervisory judges who will be available to offer advice and guidance, appraise performance, identify training needs and other similar responsibilities that do not impinge on judicial independence. I can say categorically that draft determinations will not be subject to amendment by senior judiciary prior to promulgation.
</p>

<a name="40607-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>As to the concerns that the briefing to the IAA   judiciary suggested that the terms of appointment could be amended to require compliance with procedure rules or practice directions, officials were considering whether the terms of appointment should include compliance with procedure rules and practice directions. It was floated with the intention of ensuring quality, consistency and accuracy in decision making. However, that approach is no longer considered necessary.
</p>

<a name="40607-20_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>I hope that I have gone a long way towards setting at rest the minds of my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis and my noble and learned friend Lord Archer of Sandwell. I invite them to consider withdrawing their amendment.

<a name="40607-21_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </b>  My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement on Iraq made in another place by my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary. The Statement is as follows:


</p>

<a name="40607-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_4"></a>&quot;With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a statement on political and diplomatic developments relating to Iraq.


</p>

<a name="40607-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_5"></a>&quot;Under a revised and accelerated timetable agreed on 15 November last year, and endorsed by the Security Council in Resolution 1511, full authority will transfer from the occupying powers&#151;the United States and the   United Kingdom&#151;in just three weeks&#039; time, by 30   June, to a sovereign interim Iraqi Government. That Government will be in office until 31 January next year, by which time national elections for a transitional government and constituent assembly are due to have been held. The transitional government and assembly will oversee, among other things, the drafting of a new constitution, with a view to its agreement and elections for a government on the basis of the new constitution by the end of next year.


</p>

<a name="40607-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_6"></a>&quot;To facilitate this process, the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, appointed Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi to nominate the interim Government. On 1 June, Ambassador Brahimi announced the appointment of Sheikh Ghazi Al-Yawar as the new president; two deputy presidents, Dr Ibrahim Jaafari and Dr Rowsch Shaways; and a new Prime Minister, Dr Iyad Allawi.


</p>

<a name="40607-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_7"></a>&quot;Dr Allawi&#039;s Cabinet was also announced on 1 June in a joint press conference with Ambassador Brahimi. Twenty-two of its 31 members are newcomers&#151;that is, not former members of the Iraqi Governing Council; and six of the 31 are women. In an address to the nation last Friday, Dr   Allawi identified his Government&#039;s priorities as the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty; security; economic revival; national unity; and preparing for elections.


</p>

<a name="40607-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_8"></a>&quot;Immediately following the announcements on 1 June, the Iraqi Governing Council dissolved itself and handed over its responsibilities to the new Government, including control of the 14 ministries already under full Iraqi authority. The remaining 11 ministries will be transferred to full Iraqi authority by 30 June, at which point the Coalition Provisional Authority will dissolve and the occupation will come to an end. I express my thanks to Ambassador Bremer, who has led the CPA, and the British representatives, Ambassadors Greenstock and Richmond, for their work.


</p>

<a name="40607-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_9"></a>&quot;The announcement of the new interim Government was the fruit of many weeks of wide-ranging consultations conducted by Ambassador Brahimi and his team. The result is, I believe, a competent, professional and broad-based Government acceptable to the widest possible range of Iraqis and reflective of Iraq&#039;s diversity. The new Government have been welcomed by the United Nations, the European Union, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_73"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 73</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

many governments in the region, and by key figures in Iraq, such as Ayatollah al-Sistani, the leading Shia cleric. I am sure that the House will wish to join me in paying tribute to the outstanding work of United Nations Ambassador Brahimi and his staff; in congratulating all the members of Iraq&#039;s new Government; and in offering our fullest support.


</p>

<a name="40607-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_10"></a>&quot;Meanwhile, Ambassador Brahimi has made recommendations for the membership of a Supreme Commission, to be formed within days to prepare a national conference to be held this July&#151;next month. This conference will include a diverse range of Iraqi voices in the political process, thus providing for the broadest possible representation. It is expected to elect an interim national council of about 100 members, whose role will be to promote constructive dialogue and national consensus; to advise the presidency and the council of Ministers; to monitor the work of the executive, including the implementation of laws; to have the power of veto over executive orders; and to approve a national budget.


</p>

<a name="40607-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_11"></a>&quot;The United Nations will be advising on the organisation of the national, regional and local elections which are to be held no later than 31   January 2005. We welcome the formation of an Iraqi   independent electoral commission to prepare for those elections, with UN assistance. The commission&#039;s members have been recommended by the UN; and I pay tribute to the work of Carina Perelli, Head of the UN Electoral Assistance Division, and her team, for making that possible.


</p>

<a name="40607-21_para19"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_12"></a>&quot;As the House will be aware, the United States and the United Kingdom have proposed that there should be a new Security Council resolution to facilitate the transfer of sovereignty by 30 June. Drafts have been under discussion in New York and between capitals for some weeks. These discussions with our Security Council partners have taken place in a constructive atmosphere. I hope that this process may be brought to a conclusion very soon.


</p>

<a name="40607-21_para20"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_13"></a>&quot;Key elements of the resolution affirm the full sovereignty of the interim Government, and give the United Nations a lead role in support of the political process.


</p>

<a name="40607-21_para21"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_14"></a>&quot;The mandate of the multi-national force is dealt with both within the context of the resolution and in an exchange of letters to the president of the Security Council from the Prime Minister of Iraq on the one hand and the United States Secretary of State Colin Powell on the other, on behalf of the multi-national force. The draft resolution provides that the mandate of the force will expire in any event by 31   December 2005; but the Iraqi Government will have a clear right to review or terminate it earlier if they so wish.


</p>

<a name="40607-21_para22"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_15"></a>&quot;The draft resolution and the letters lay down in some detail the nature of the relationship between the multi-national force and Iraq&#039;s own security forces, and state the need to reach agreement on fundamental security and policy issues, including <br>&nbsp;<br>

He asked that the international community endorse and support the Iraqi interim Government as quickly as possible; made clear his support for the resolution; and made a number of points about the provisions of the resolution, which are now being dealt with. The Security Council has been holding further discussions about the resolution over the weekend, and will resume those discussions later today in New York. A revised draft text is being circulated later today to Security Council members. As soon as it is, I shall lay it before the House and place a copy in the Library of the House of Lords.


</p>

<a name="40607-21_para24"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_17"></a>&quot;The biggest challenge which the new Government of Iraq will face is to build security. There will be those who will continue to seek to disrupt the transition to successful democracy in Iraq and to force decisions by the bomb, not the ballot box. But the Iraqi Government are firmly resolved to defeat the men of violence and we are resolved to help them to do so. The multinational force, including British troops, continues to work with the Iraqis to stabilise the country and to assist the process of reconstruction and political transition. The force is helping Iraq&#039;s own security forces to build their capacity. The Iraqi police force now numbers some 89,000 men, the Civil Defence Corps some 29,000 men, the border police over 8,000 men and the Facilities Protection Service some 74,000 men.


</p>

<a name="40607-21_para25"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_18"></a>&quot;I pay tribute to the courage and bravery of all those in Iraq who are working to build peace and democracy. The British troops of the multinational force, along with many British police and civilians, are giving them vital and courageous help. There will be some difficult times ahead, but the path to a free and democratic Iraq is now clear. The British Government will remain committed to helping the Iraqi Government and people to achieve that historic goal&quot;.

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

<a name="40607-22_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that we are all extremely grateful to the noble Baroness for repeating the Statement. Since we are looking at global affairs, I hope your Lordships will allow me to begin by paying the briefest of tributes to the former president of the United States, Ronald Reagan, who died yesterday. He helped to change the world for the better and did so by using his priceless gift of communication. He used the art of simple language to carry the world with him. That is an example that political leaders should always keep in mind.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>We warmly welcome the announcement of a new Iraqi Government in Baghdad and the appointment of the new president-designate and the prime minister-designate. We see them as their own men, dedicated to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_75"></a>

building a new Iraq after the nightmare past, and nobody&#039;s stooges or placemen. In our view, this is a clear step forward. Obviously while violence continues, as it sadly does, this arrangement refutes those who have been talking of the coalition&#039;s efforts so far as being doomed or in some kind of nosedive. Does not this new formation, this government-to-be in the next few weeks, provide the best chance of holding Iraq together and avoiding civil war between factions and tribes? In my view, it was never very likely anyway and was exaggerated by some pessimists.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>As for the draft UN resolution, we know that the main debate has been over the meaning of full sovereignty for the new Iraqi Government. I, for one, have never seen the question of control of the security forces, now to be relabelled the multinational force, as all that complex and difficult, provided it is made clear between the parties. The status of foreign troops in relation to the civil power after a period of occupation is not a new problem. It was managed perfectly well in Germany after the Second World War and in Japan and, very much more recently, in Afghanistan.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>The reality is that future security situations are bound to be unpredictable. We do not know what will work out. Surely these matters can best be handled flexibly, and by a suitable exchange of letters, which must obviously leave the operational chain of command with the military and its home country, while strategy and major events are discussed between allies. Allies are what the Iraqis now become under their new government. We should welcome that. Will the letters establish that sensible and practical relationship? We need to be reassured about that.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>We also welcome the setting up by the Iraqi Government of a new national security committee with members from both the Iraqi side and the multinational force side, the former coalition forces side, which should help this process.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Can the Minister confirm that the militias are now to be disbanded? I am not sure whether this will include the al-Sadr militia, which has been causing so much mayhem. Are the Iraqi Armed Forces to be reassembled and properly reconstituted? We recognise that disbanding them in the first place was a big American mistake. It seems to me that we did not raise a murmur of objection to it, as we should have done as coalition partners.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>More broadly, would the Minister agree that despite all the negative reporting, huge strides have been made in reconstruction, especially in the south, much of it with the able help of our brilliant and flexible Armed Forces? Would she agree that the constant predictions of disaster merely serve to undermine the morale of our troops quite unnecessarily when they are doing a good, but fiendishly difficult, job? Actually, I think that they are impervious to much of the chatter they hear. Will she rebuke those doom-saying critics robustly?
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>Finally, what proposals will Her Majesty&#039;s Government put forward this coming weekend at the G8 summit in Sea Island, Georgia, for a better and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_76"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 76</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

more structured dialogue, at an international level, between the leaders of majority moderate Islam and the Western world, for example on the lines put forward by my colleague, Michael Ancram MP, in a pamphlet today? Would it not be desirable, as he argues in his pamphlet, to set up a process of this kind so that united minds can focus not just on Iraq&#039;s future, but on making serious progress on the Israel/Palestine imbroglio, which continues to poison the whole region, as well as on combating the dangerous threats to stability in Saudi Arabia? The latest tragic outcome of that situation, the shooting of a BBC correspondent and the killing of his cameraman, which we deeply regret, are in the newspapers this very morning. Will she say something about these events in the Middle East and how they are to be addressed, since they are all part of the same jigsaw as are developments in Iraq itself and will help to shape the future of that country?
<a name="time_18"></a>

<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="40607-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, we on these Benches thank the Government for making this Statement and we hope that they will continue to keep both Houses well informed as this process continues over the coming months.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>We welcome the clear central role that the UN is now, at last, playing and the restoration of sovereignty to an autonomous government. After so many mistakes have been made, we hope that we are now on the right path. I wish to stress from these Benches that those of us who were very doubtful about the path to war and the justification given for war nevertheless feel that we all have the strongest of interests in getting it right now and in ensuring, as far as possible, that we leave behind in Iraq a coherent, credible and united national government.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>May I ask the Minister to explain a little what the full sovereignty of the Interim Government means? The noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, referred to the   parallel with the restoration of sovereignty to the Government of West Germany in 1955. That was very clearly a semi-sovereign state. Right up until 1989 it was governed by a whole set of agreements with the continuing occupying powers for some purposes.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>I must say that the presence of an American ambassador in the shape of Mr Negroponte, given his past as an ambassador in central America, does not give all of us full assurance that this will be allowed to be a fully sovereign government. Can the Minister assure us that, while this resolution has been being negotiated, the British Government have consulted fully with their partners in the EU as well as with the United States?

</p>

<a name="40607-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>Can she tell us a little more about the British role within the multinational force? Is it likely that the areas of the country that will be controlled by British commands within the multinational force will be extended, or is that not yet decided? Are we signing a separate status of forces agreement or is it covered by the exchange of letters with the US Secretary of State? Does that also cover British forces? Can she say a little bit <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_77"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 77</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

about what sensitive offensive operations are? I understand that Sir Emyr Jones Parry, our ambassador to the UN, said yesterday that the policy on sensitive operations would require the assent of the ministerial committee for national security. Is that also agreed both by the United Kingdom and by the United States?
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>May I ask, as we have asked on many occasions from these Benches, what is going to happen to the Iraq Survey Group after 30 June? Will it, as the British Prime Minister appeared to suggest the other day, continue its operations until it finds something; or will it, as David Kay suggested, accept now that nothing is going to be found and wind up its operations?
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>Lastly, I echo and agree with the noble Lord, Lord   Howell of Guildford, that this is a matter of concern to the entire region. Can the Minister assure us that there has been active consultation with Iraq&#039;s neighbours, including Iran and Syria, on the progress of restoring Iraq&#039;s sovereignty and stability? We are very conscious that Iraq&#039;s neighbours already have a degree of influence within Iraq. How do the Government see that fitting into what is now, I understand, called the &quot;broader Middle East and North Africa initiative&quot; which will be discussed at the G8 summit, and how do they believe the instabilities elsewhere in the region, in particular in Saudi Arabia and in Israel and Palestine, are to be addressed?

<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="40607-22_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I begin by associating myself with the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, about President Reagan. He was indeed a figure of enormous historical importance not only to the United States of America but to the West. As our newspapers rightly reflected this week, he did a great deal to change the tide of international relationships. We benefit from that today.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>I thank both the noble Lord and the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, for what I think were very supportive comments about the Statement that I repeated on behalf of my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, was right when he said that the new government who will be taking over&#151;they have indeed taken over already, given that the CPA is handing over and that 14 ministries have already been handed over with the other 11 following on 30 June&#151;stand the best chance of &quot;holding Iraq together&quot;&#151;I think those were his words&#151;in light of the way in which the representatives of different groupings have been brought together. I for one am very pleased to see that there is quite a lot of new blood among Ministers, and indeed a number of women among Ministers as well. The role played in all of this by Ambassador Brahimi has been enormously important, and the continuing role of Carina Perelli, the UN expert on elections, will continue to be of enormous importance into the future.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, asked me about the letters that Secretary of State Powell and the new Prime Minister Allawi have sent to the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_78"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 78</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

president of the Security Council. I agree very strongly with what the noble Lord said about the importance of flexibility in these arrangements. One is not going to be able to write out a blueprint, set it in stone and think that it is going to be able to deal with every eventuality that may arise. Both noble Lords will find copies of both those letters in the Library of the House. My right honourable friend made sure at lunchtime that both Houses would receive those letters.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>If I may, I should just like to quote from what Dr   Allawi said in setting out Iraqi consent to the presence of the multinational force:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;Until we are able to provide security for ourselves, including the defense of Iraq&#039;s land, sea, and air space, we ask for the support of the Security Council and the international community in this endeavour. We seek a new resolution on the Multinational Force (MNF) mandate to contribute to maintaining security in Iraq&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-22_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>That is a very clear statement from the incoming Prime   Minister about the need for the continuing MNF presence. In his letter to the UN he also set out the structures that will act as what he calls the,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;fora for the MNF and the Iraqi government to reach agreement on the full range of fundamental security and policy issues, including policy on sensitive offensive operations, and will ensure full partnership between Iraqi forces and the MNF&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-22_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>I think that that is an enormously important exchange of letters given that both were sent on 5 June and both set out the ways in which, on behalf of the MNF, Secretary of State Powell has stated the position, and the way in which that position has been requested by the incoming Iraqi Government. I hope that that gives a clear view on that point.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>The noble Lord asked also about militias. We understand that there has been movement on the militias today. I am not in a position to make an absolutely definitive statement about this, but as I left the Foreign Office earlier this afternoon, telegrams were arriving about the militias and the start of militia movement away from their aggressive stance. We hope that that will continue. At the moment we are on a watching brief to try to encourage that sort of movement. Obviously, it would be enormously welcome were that to be the case.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>I agree, of course, with what the noble Lord, Lord   Howell of Guildford, said about the importance of our British troops in and around Basra and the way in which they have operated in MND South-East. I have visited them on two occasions. Your Lordships do not need me to say it, but I say it none the less: they are an extraordinary example of peacekeeping at its very best and everything that we would expect of the way in which our troops operate when they deal with people in quite difficult local circumstances and quite volatile security situations. They deal with it with complete professionalism and competence.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>So when the noble Lord invites me to &quot;rebuke the doomsayers robustly&quot;&#151;I think those were his words&#151;I say that although I rebuke them robustly, it is a very good thing to hear them rebuked robustly by Members on the other side of the House. If I may say so, his statement was much more positive than that which I heard from his right honourable friend in another place earlier today.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_79"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 79</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-22_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>I think that the structure that we now have in place offers a very positive way forward. The noble Lord asked how we can translate this into what is happening elsewhere in the region. What is happening elsewhere in the region is of course very worrying in a number of different ways. The terrorist situation as it has developed in Saudi Arabia is causing enormous concern at the moment. I join him in sending condolences to the family of Simon Cumbers, the cameraman who was killed in Saudi Arabia yesterday, and to his colleagues and his friends. I join the noble Lord also in wishing Frank Gardner, the correspondent who was reporting at the time, a full and speedy recovery, although I understand that, sadly, he is quite badly injured.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>However, in all of this, let us not lose sight of the fact that the Tunis summit of the Arab League came forward with some very positive statements about the future relationships between the region and the West&#151;the EU and the United States of America. I think that a critical reading of the Tunis summit statement leads one to believe that we have a great deal on offer there with which we can work for the G8. I for one hope that we will take up some of the points made by the Arab League when we meet shortly at the Sea Island summit.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, was quite right. Whatever our differences, we all are now, I hope, working for a better future for Iraq. We are doing that with the active support&#151;the key and central role&#151;of the United Nations, something which I know the noble Lord and all his party have stressed to us throughout this dialogue&#151;although I am bound to say that I do not think that we on this side of the House needed any persuading on that; we were always very keen to involve the United Nations. However, I would point out to him that the European Union, which as we know was pretty well in disagreement over the initial action in Iraq, has very warmly welcomed the formation of the new Iraqi Government. I hope that we will see real progress on the question of the United Nations Security Council resolution.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>The noble Lord addressed the question of, &quot;how sovereign is sovereign&quot;. They are a sovereign government. There is a self-denying ordinance for the next seven months which that sovereign government have taken unto themselves, which is not to prejudice the position of an incoming elected government. That is not something imposed on the Iraqi Government who will be taking over on 30 June. They themselves have stated that they do not want to take decisions that in the longer term may prejudice decisions that can be taken by an elected government.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>The statement by Secretary of State Powell was made on behalf of the multinational forces. There will not be a separate statement from the United Kingdom. It may not have been crystal clear in the Statement, but it stated that he spoke on behalf of the multinational forces and dealt with the questions about the sensitive operations in relation to Prime Minister Allawi.
</p>

<a name="40607-22_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>After the handover of sovereignty to an Iraqi Interim Government, the Iraq Survey Group will continue its activities, to clarify our understanding of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_80"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 80</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Iraq&#039;s WMD programmes. The Powell-Allawi letters make that clear, and make it clear that it will be under the aegis of the multinational force. The ISG&#039;s operations will be Iraq-wide. There is no fixed schedule for the ISG to report further, but we look forward to seeing how those issues progress.

</p>

<a name="40607-22_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>I hope that I have dealt with all the points, other than the question of how much Iraq&#039;s neighbours were consulted. Let us remember that the United States of America does not have the sort of relationship with Iran&#151;nor indeed with Syria&#151;that we in this country do. I have discussed the issues on behalf of Her Majesty&#039;s Government with very senior representatives of the Syrian Government, and my right honourable friend the   Foreign Secretary has discussed them with representatives of the Iranian Government. However, everyone has not sat round a table discussing the matter in quite the way that the noble Lord implied. It was discussed at the Euromed meeting recently, and we have taken opportunities to try to make sure that we keep everyone&#151;not only those two countries, but other neighbours&#151;well up to speed on the developments that we hope to see come to fruition, which I am happy to say now are coming to fruition.

<a name="40607-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </b>   My Lords, will the noble Baroness give us some more information about how the present moves are being received by the different sections of the Iraqi public? We hear about the United Nations, but not how everything is progressing within the country. Also, has there been any improvement in the security situation? Will she assure us that neither of the main parties will withdraw troops&#151;indeed, that they should supplement troops&#151;until the situation is resolved?
</p>




<p><a name="st_188"></a>
<a name="40607-23_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, the security situation remains extremely volatile. It is important for noble Lords to remember that security is not at a dangerous level throughout Iraq, but it can erupt in a number of different places. We have discussed problems many times before about the Sunni triangle. Noble Lords will know about the difficulties in Najaf, which have been very different in character from those in Fallujah, but have none the less been highly disruptive. We have had some difficulties&#151;of a very short-lived nature, I am happy to say&#151;in Basra.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>The incidence of security problems currently runs at a somewhat lower level than it did a few weeks ago. However, I remind the House that my right honourable friend&#039;s Statement made it clear that we expect the next few weeks to be very difficult in terms of security. That is because there are groups who inevitably still look for opportunities to get their slice of the action. I hope that the announcement of a government will to some extent mitigate such activity. However, as the Statement made clear, many people still do not wish Iraq to be a success. For different reasons of their own, they would like Iraq to be a failure for the future. That is not what the Iraqi people want; it is not what the Government of Iraq want. We will support them in their endeavour.

<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>The noble Lord asks how everything has been received by the Iraqi public. I cannot tell him what public reaction has been so far, but I remind him that the recent opinion polls have shown that the Iraqi people want to end the period of occupation, which will come to an end on 30 June, and want to take control of their own affairs, which will happen on 30   June, and that more than 70 per cent of them believe that they will have a better future than they would have had under Saddam Hussein.

Will the 100 elected members of the interim national council have the power of veto over executive orders, as referred to in the Statement, relating to decisions taken by Iraq&#039;s own security forces&#151;decisions taken in conjunction with the multinational force? If they do not have that power, we may end up with a major row in the new interim national council.

They must sort it out on their internal basis. We may be able to add something more, because the Security Council resolution has still not been finalised; it is hoped that it will be over the next couple of days or so. The wording of questions around the precise nature of the relationship between the Iraqi Government and the multinational force is still under discussion. The Statement is very clear about the interim national council having veto over executive orders, as the noble Lord mentioned, but the detail of that is a matter for the Interim Government and interim national council to settle between themselves.

It is a great country with great potential, and we should put the past behind us.

<a name="40607-23_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his support, and I am glad that he had the opportunity to have that discussion with Dr Allawi. Of course security lies at the heart of the issue. If security is not improved to the point at which people feel that they can participate in civil society&#151;at which they feel that they can reconstruct their country&#151;the difficulties for Iraq remain enormous. As I indicated, I hope that the security situation is improving. I do not want to make dramatic claims because, as night follows day, there would surely be some reason to regret that in the next few days.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>Although security is vital, when I have talked to Iraqi interlocutors, I have also found them asking over and again why we cannot get out more positive messages about Iraq. Why it is that the messages about the reopening of schools and hospitals&#151;the fact that electricity and water supplies are working in many parts of the country with literally hundreds of thousands of new jobs for Iraqi workers being created as a result of reconstruction&#151;are not reported? My right honourable friend the Prime Minister said only this weekend that here is an economy that has recently imported 1 million cars. An economy that has imported 1 million cars cannot be struggling so badly. Indeed, those are positive messages.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, asked me to be more robust with the doomsayers&#151;but I shall not be alone in my robustness in dealing with doomsayers. I hope that many of your Lordships, including those on the Opposition Benches, will also be robust on these points. The Iraqis themselves feel that they are not getting a fair crack in the media. That is what it comes down to: they feel that they are not being recognised for the substantial steps that they have themselves made to reconstruct the country both politically and commercially. I hope that that will also change and that a more positive attitude will be adopted.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>I saw some coverage about the bounty offered for individuals; I think that it was bounty offered by individual militias for servicemen and servicewomen, whom I understand commanded a higher price. None the less, that is a reasonably contained activity that we need to ensure that we deal with very robustly. As for the question of NATO, in the short term, there is not a prospect of NATO taking over a role in Iraq. What we can do to help improve security in Iraq is to go on with what we are doing in Iraq&#151;namely, training their <br>&nbsp;<br>

police and their armed forces and ensuring that, as far as we can, we involve Iraq&#039;s neighbours in that process; indeed, many of them are already becoming involved.

<a name="40607-23_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Grocott: </b>   My Lords, as we are about to start the Second Reading of the Housing Bill, perhaps I may say a few words about timing. As your Lordships know, the normal rising time on a Monday is about 10 o&#039;clock; I fear that we are unlikely to hit that this evening. But we would not do too badly if Back-Bench contributions were restricted to eight minutes and the Front Benchers were to use their customary brevity and incisiveness.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>We should then manage to complete our proceedings within three hours, which is not too badly past the target rising time, considering that we have had a Statement and that we took rather longer than anticipated to deal with the immigration Bill. I repeat: eight minutes, my Lords.

<p><a name="st_194"></a>
<a name="40607-23_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Lord Rooker): </b>  My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. I assure my noble friend and the House that I will turn over a new leaf for brevity. It is Second Reading. It is the second most interesting Bill that I have introduced to the House in the three years I have been here&#151;the first being the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill 2001. It is full of good things, all of which we can discuss in detail in Committee.

</p>

<a name="40607-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>The Bill before us is improved. It is a large Bill: it comprises seven parts and 230 clauses. By consent and a Statement in the other place, which has been widely acknowledged, it has had good scrutiny&#151;not every paragraph and every clause, but, nevertheless, good scrutiny. More clauses are to be added to the Bill for reasons that I shall explain. We think that the Bill will create a better and fairer housing market and protect the most vulnerable people in housing. It contributes to the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s sustainable communities plan&#151; launched in February 2003&#151;which is a long-term programme of action backed by &#163;22 billion of investment.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>I shall briefly go through most parts of the Bill, but it will be a snapshot of each part and I shall not go into great detail, save for one area of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>We consider the private rented sector to be a key part of the sustainable communities plan. We want a vigorous and responsive private rented sector. The vast majority of private landlords are decent, responsible and professional. We will introduce licensing only where the risks are the greatest. The Bill will provide local authorities with new powers to license private landlords in areas of low housing demand and in areas suffering from anti-social behaviour, but they will not be able to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_84"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 84</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

go out on a spree, licensing willy-nilly for ideological or other reasons. They must be specific. That is made clear in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>As for houses in multiple occupation, the Bill will introduce mandatory licensing for larger&#151;that is, the highest risk&#151;houses in such occupation. They often exhibit some of the worst housing conditions in the country. Where management problems are widespread, local authorities can extend licensing to other, smaller houses in multiple occupation. There is a definition in the Bill; but, in certain circumstances, it is not practical enough to cover all of those at risk. As I say, where the management problems are widespread, there is a constraint and it is simply not possible to continue extending licensing for other reasons.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>Part of the Bill is quite technical. We will hold a briefing in this respect on Wednesday for Members of your Lordships&#039; House. It concerns the housing, health and safety rating system&#151;a new rating system that will replace the current housing fitness standard both as an element of the decent homes standard and   as a basis for enforcement of better conditions in the private sector. It will place health and safety at the forefront of a drive to improve housing conditions in all stock. That approach is welcomed by the British Medical Association, and others.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>It is quite technical. There has been much consultation, going back to July 2000. A range of about 29 hazards are to be considered. It deals with the property and is person-based, unlike the present system, which is only property-based. A fairly technical, but nevertheless, substantial consultation has been undertaken and reports and guidance issued. Obviously, we have more work to do on that between now and the time that the Bill is enacted.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>There are some modest measures to tackle exploitation of the right-to-buy option and to reduce the scope for profiteering, which have been widely welcomed; for example, we have extended the initial qualification period from two to five years and from three to five years the period during which the discount must be repaid where the property is resold.

</p>

<a name="40607-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>I have no doubt that one part of the Bill will have substantial debate in Committee&#151;it would be quite wrong to do so tonight&#151;namely, grants to non-registered social landlords. The intention of the Bill is to increase the supply of affordable housing by enabling the Housing Corporation and the National Assembly for Wales to provide grants for organisations other than registered social landlords. Basically, they will operate under the   same criteria as registered social landlords, such as the scheme standards and rents. The conditions set by the Housing Corporation will ensure that public money is fully safeguarded.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>I turn now to one part of the Bill in a little more detail, which concerns the home information packs. I hope that all of your Lordships tuned in to the &quot;PM&quot; programme this evening and listened to the feature on home information packs. I only caught the second part of it myself; I was not aware that it was on, because I was coming into your Lordships&#039; House to find out what was happening and what progress had been made.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_85"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 85</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>There is an issue, which is obviously one for substantial debate in Committee. Surveys show that almost nine out of 10 people are unhappy with the home-buying and selling processes in England and Wales. I emphasise that it is the &quot;processes&quot; with which people are unhappy. They usually love their solicitors and their surveyors and think their estate agents are the bee&#039;s knees. Overall, it is the whole process with which people can be quite unhappy.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>The high cost of transaction failure means additional cost to almost everyone involved in buying and selling a home. The main problem is that key information is not available until after the terms are negotiated. I suspect that noble Lords, and certainly Members of the other place, will know that, in some cases, people spend less time buying a house than they do when looking for a summer dress or a winter overcoat. That is the reality for some people.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>The home information packs will make key information available at the start of the process, because we think that it is nonsensical that key information is made available after the offers are made and accepted. We believe that it will make home-buying and selling easier, more transparent, more successful and, I must say, much less stressful.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>The pack system works well in other countries. A number of schemes already operate successfully here. There is some evidence on that, which we can deploy in Committee. Evidence shows that packs must be compulsory so that everybody benefits. At the genesis of the Bill, when it was part of my responsibility as housing Minister, I was very aware of the implications of making packs compulsory all at once, but there are substantial reasons why it has to be that way. I shall be more than happy to debate and deploy those reasons in Committee.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>Most transactions, although not all, involve chains, so delays affect almost everybody. One property in the chain marketed without a home information pack would negate the benefits of packs provided for all the other transactions. The Office of Fair Trading report makes it clear that those benefits are the most evident.

</p>

<a name="40607-23_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>The home information packs manifesto commitment was fully supported by the Consumers&#039; Association, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors and the major mortgage lenders. Buyers and sellers will negotiate from an informed position&#151;that is important. Any problems will be identified and addressed early on, before the sale is put at risk. The packs will help the seller and the estate agent to decide on a realistic asking price that reflects the true condition of the property, and will greatly reduce the risk of transaction failure, which in some areas runs as high as one in four or one in three, and the hassle of having to renegotiate terms.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>Packs will also shorten the period of uncertainty between the offer acceptance and the exchange of contracts. We are not legislating to eliminate gazumping, but the space available for gazumping will be shortened by the process in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>We do not think that there is a reason for a significant increase in costs. Apart from the home condition report, everything in the pack must be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_86"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 86</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

provided at some stage in the process now. Industry accepts that costs will generally be deferred until completion, and we genuinely see no reason why packs should prevent homes coming on to the market.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>Greater transparency will mean a significant reduction in wasted money. The estimate, which we can deploy in Committee, is that some &#163;350 million a year is wasted through failed transactions. But, not to put too fine a point on it, some people are making a living out of that waste. We expect the packs to be cost-neutral overall and to result in significant savings in many cases. The Government considered the then sellers&#039; packs at Second Reading of the Homes Bill in 2000 and have listened to the issues raised then. There are crucial differences between those provisions and the ones before us today.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>Several noble Lords present today expressed concern about criminal sanctions. That has been reconsidered and is now subject to civil sanctions. We have also followed the advice of noble Lords opposite for buyers to be able to recover costs incurred when obtaining documents that should have been in the pack but were not there.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>Other noble Lords raised concerns about the effect of the packs on low-value homes. We have taken powers in the Bill to deal with that in Clause 144(9)(c). The issue has been consulted on, and we believe that it is best left to the market to provide solutions. We look forward to hearing reports as the Bill progresses. I also have some personal experiences to share from the past   12 months in using this system for a property transaction.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>The pilot was carried out successfully. The home condition report will provide energy efficiency information required by the EU energy performance of buildings directive.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>We can concentrate today on the principle of home information packs. Concerns have been raised elsewhere about the practicalities of how they will be   implemented, but I offer this House the same assurance as offered by the Minister in the other place, Keith Hill. The Government will not introduce the packs before the necessary pieces of the jigsaw are in place. Much of the detail will be in secondary legislation. The target date for introducing the compulsory home information packs is January 2007. It is demanding, but we think that it is realistic and achievable.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>I shall outline briefly the other parts of the Bill. Part   6 introduces measures to tackle anti-social behaviour in social housing, to extend eligibility for a disabled facilities grant to all those who occupy caravans and to establish a social housing ombudsman for Wales. There are a few other provisions in the Bill that show that the Government have listened carefully to representations and responded.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>Many noble Lords have urged action to strengthen the rights of park home owners. My noble friend Lord   Graham of Edmonton, who lobbied me earlier on the matter, led a working party on park homes. We <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_87"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 87</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

do not have all the answers in the Bill, but we are delighted to report that the Bill now includes six key measures recommended by the working party.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>The Bill also provides for statutory overcrowding standards to be amended by secondary legislation. After the Bill had completed its passage in the other place, the Government announced their intention to add two further measures. Both have been widely welcomed and will be debated in this House. If I can, I shall bring forward proposals for Committee rather than wait. If I cannot bring them all forward, I shall present what is available&#151;certainly enough to have a debate on the issue.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>First, there is much support for measures to protect tenancy deposits. Twenty per cent of tenants say that landlords have unreasonably withheld their deposit. We will bring forward amendments to tackle this. We seek to guard against only the worst abuses; given the timescale, we cannot deal with everything. Tenants need assurance that their deposit will be safeguarded and that they will not face difficulties trying to enforce judgments, even in the small claims court.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>The other issue is empty homes. There has been a lot of support to allow local authorities to make empty homes management orders on long-term empty homes. There was a limited debate on the matter in the other place; we will have a much wider debate in this House. We consulted on the issue last year, so it is not new; we received a positive response. Now is the right time to legislate to deal with the hard core of long-term empty homes.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>Local authorities will be able to make management orders on empty homes similar to provisions already in Part 4, with certain modifications. This is not sequestration; it is not taking over the ownership of homes. The government amendments will set out the precise scope of intervention. The intention is to apply to genuine cases of housing vacancy. Of course we will build in the obvious exceptions, such as where the property is occupied, albeit irregularly. If further meetings are required after those held this week, we will be more than happy to offer facilities for those outside the normal Committee process.

</p>

<a name="40607-23_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>We are currently considering the 10th report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which has an impact in looking at the Bill, and we look forward to receiving the report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of your Lordships&#039; House. We will consider other government amendments as necessary. We have just given the committee a further memorandum.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>We have done much to create sustainable communities. It is a panacea; we have a lot to do, and these are very early days. That is part of addressing the supply-and-demand issues in the housing market, but we need to create a fairer and more efficient housing market. Some 1.5 million homes change hands; there may be 2 million marketed per annum in this country, so there are a lot of people involved and a lot of stress.
</p>

<a name="40607-23_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>There are people living in unsafe properties&#151;we know that from the occasional tragedies that occur, and we are trying to address that. I am not trying to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_88"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 88</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

short change anyone whatever. My noble friend Lord   Bassam will try to deal with as many points raised as possible when he replies to the debate. Certainly, we will have full and detailed debates in Committee, which I more than welcome. I commend the Bill to the House.

<p><a name="st_195"></a>
<a name="40607-24_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his explanation of the contents of this Bill, which by and large affects the greater control of the private housing sector. However, there is no legislation now in the housing arena that will not need to be judged against the background of Kate Barker&#039;s report and, of course, the sustainable communities policies. There are a number of provisions in the Bill that affect the supply of housing, as the Minister indicated in his last sentences.
</p>

<a name="40607-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>The introduction of home information packs and house condition reports has caused the most comment. That policy formed a significant part of the Homes Bill in 2001, but was dropped when it became apparent that there was so much opposition to it that the rest of the Bill, which dealt with homelessness, was in danger of being lost. In view of this history, it is interesting that the Government have returned to the fray in the   face, still, of considerable hostility from the professionals involved in the sale of houses.

</p>

<a name="40607-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>The potential of a licensing regime for houses in multiple occupation has also been around for some time, and some authorities are doing that on a voluntary basis. We do not deny that there are cases of appallingly managed housing in the private rented sector, but there are already many remedies available to local authorities if they are prepared to use them, through environmental enforcement, routine inspection, building and fire regulations. While not opposing the thrust of the proposals for licensing and registration of houses in multiple occupation, we are concerned at the amount of time this could take to introduce. The example of Scotland, where the scheme has still not been fully implemented, is not encouraging.
</p>

<a name="40607-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>The properties that will be encompassed by the licensing are important, as are the costs of both administration and licensing itself, and the definitions of houses in multiple occupation. That could, and does in the Bill, include flats or houses which are shared by young people, but might also encompass flats and houses for young people that in the course of their early working lives or student days are owned and let to them by one set of parents. We want to be careful that we do not put too many people into this registration.
</p>

<a name="40607-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>In a document published recently by the National Landlords Association, an analysis of fire fatalities in houses in multiple occupation concludes that even if legislation, such as that before us today, was in place, none of the fires analysed would have been prevented. The more prevalent factor seems to have been the vulnerability of the people in the properties, and this aspect may need to be looked at in more detail.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_89"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 89</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>The maintenance of a register of houses in multiple occupation is not controversial, but the provisions for the raising of standards by the introduction of the housing health and safety rating system needs more explanation, and I am glad to hear that there will be an   opportunity to discuss that outside the House. In particular, we want to explore in Committee how housing standards can encompass health conditions without their implementation becoming unnecessarily onerous. Grants for social housing to private developers, rather than, as at present to registered social landlords, even if administered by the Housing Corporation, is a new development. It raises questions about the assurances that will be available that housing provided in this way will be used for affordable housing, whether for key workers or others awaiting low-cost housing, the management of such housing, and whether it is intended that such provision will be largely for sale, shared ownership, or accommodation managed by the developer or a management company, rather than a registered social landlord. The Minister touched on the licensing of landlords for low-occupancy areas, which are clearly causing problems and concern. There are other concerns on the other side of this, and those relate to the clauses on anti-social behaviour and the impact that those might have on private landlords. We will need, if we may, to explore that further as well.
</p>

<a name="40607-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>The Government have already tinkered with the right to buy, by reducing the amount of the discount available in a number of local authorities. That situation has adversely affected, and will affect further, the possibility of selling local authority property and   creating, even in a small way, a greater social mix on estates. Where there are abuses of the current provisions they need to be addressed. So long as what is proposed does not turn out to be a further assault on the right to buy system, it will have our conditional support.
</p>

<a name="40607-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>Since the Bill was considered in the other place, the Government have announced their intention of introducing measures in the House to strengthen the law on the return of tenants&#039; deposits&#151;I was glad to hear the Minister confirm that today&#151;and to enable local authorities compulsorily to take over, license and let empty properties.

</p>

<a name="40607-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>While empty homes are an affront to those who have no home of their own, the definitions of empty homes will have to be carefully scrutinised. It is one thing to repair and bring back into use housing that has been left vacant for, say, structural regeneration purposes; but it is quite another where properties&#151;genuinely owned either as second homes or as pied-&#224;-terres of visitors from overseas, and vacant for considerable periods&#151;could potentially be classified as empty, but it would clearly be a travesty to do so. The details of these provisions will be all-important, and I recognise that the Minister has acknowledged that.
</p>

<a name="40607-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>There is one further matter that I will wish to raise as a possible amendment to the Bill, which lies within the park homes measures. I am conscious that these have been sought for a long time, and that the noble Lord, Lord Graham, in particular has fought long and hard to bring some semblance of security to those who <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_90"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 90</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

live in them. Indeed, one of the first debates I ever took part in from the Front Bench was on just this matter&#151;there were three of us in the Chamber altogether&#151;and it struck me then that it was extremely important.

</p>

<a name="40607-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>The same legal protections for security of tenure and freedom from harassment which this Bill brings forward need to be as applicable to those who reside in permanently moored houseboats. The problems are the same as for park homes, and while I know that discussions have taken place with the Minister, Keith Hill, they have so far not had any tangible results. I will table amendments to bring that matter forward for further discussion. I should declare here that some of the moorings are in Chelsea&#151;part of the borough in which I am an elected councillor, so I am putting that interest forward&#151;but by no means all of them; they are countrywide.
</p>

<a name="40607-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>The most contentious provisions in the Bill are those relating to home information packs and house condition reports, which the current Government apparently believe will speed up the sale of houses and reduce the cost. Evidence of both seems at present to be remarkably slim, despite the Minister&#039;s happy experience, which I know he is going to tell us about, if not today, then on some future occasion. There are more issues raised than we can even touch on today, but in Committee we will be moving amendments to ensure the packs are not compulsory, and that they do   not have to be produced on the first day of sale. We do not believe that these packs will be cost-neutral, and indeed at the moment the estimate of their cost comes to anywhere between &#163;600 and &#163;1,200. There are also great concerns about the length of the life of the information packs and about how often they will have to be renewed if, for example, a house is not sold at the   earliest moment. We will also wish to discuss the relevance of the packs to new properties that already have a 10-year builder&#039;s guarantee and to properties that are being auctioned.
</p>

<a name="40607-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>There are deep concerns about the whole regulatory process; about the difficulty of ensuring that there are sufficient properly qualified surveyors to carry out a survey that can be relied on not only by the vendor but,   especially, by the purchasers and the mortgage company; and about whether an NVQ is an adequate qualification, particularly where surveys are currently carried out by qualified surveyors. There are also concerns about the regulation and inspection regime required to ensure that standards are met and maintained and about how a reliable insurance scheme can be established to protect all parties from an incompetent surveyor.
</p>

<a name="40607-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>It is clear from the briefings that we have received that the Consumers&#039; Association is entirely in favour of home information packs and that practically no other body is. Already, we have had more discussions on those provisions than on any of the others, and they will justify considerable time and thought.

</p>

<a name="40607-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>We will also consider the desirability of providing a scheme for the registration of estate agents. Among the professionals involved in the sale of houses, estate agents are the only parties who are not regulated. Although few <br>&nbsp;<br>

may be unscrupulous, it seems iniquitous that those who deal with such an important area of someone&#039;s life&#151;the largest financial commitment that people are likely to make&#151;should not be the subject of some form of registration. Subject to our discussions, we will consider tabling amendments to implement it.
</p>

<a name="40607-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>This is an important Bill with a great many measures in it. We look forward to considering them in detail in Committee.

<p><a name="st_196"></a>
<a name="40607-25_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Maddock: </b>   My Lords, before I speak on this important Bill, I shall declare a few interests. I am a vice-president of the National Housing Federation and president of the National Housing Forum. I am also patron of the Empty Homes Agency and a vice-president of National Energy Action.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>We welcome many parts of the Bill and support many of the Government&#039;s aims. However, we have some concerns, which fall into two main areas. First, it is far from clear that many of the proposals for implementation will work. Some of the timescales are over-ambitious, and some of the systems over-complex. Secondly, there is a danger that some of the proposals will not achieve the aims and objectives of the Government.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>Part 1 concerns housing conditions, which is an area that certainly needs attention given the age profile of our housing stock and the very poor conditions to be found in some of the private rented sector. Nearly half of the households renting from a private landlord&#151;45   per cent&#151;live in accommodation built before 1919. More than three-quarters of private rented homes have interior or exterior faults; for example, roof leaks, faults to drainage components and damage to ceilings, doors, windows and wall structures.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>Although we welcome the new housing health and safety ratings system, we think that it may be inadequate to tackle disrepair in the following ways. It may make it more difficult to identify, evidence in court and enforce repairs through the rating system. It may not adequately cover a disrepair that causes inconvenience or misery to residents, but does not cause an immediate threat to health and safety. There are similar concerns to which we shall no doubt turn in more detail at a later stage.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>There was considerable debate in another place on the repeal of Section 190 of the Housing Act. Many people believe that that is a rather straightforward and effective tool for authorities to ensure that landlords carry out repairs. It can also be a useful tool as part of wider prevention strategies to prevent a less serious disrepair in a property deteriorating into a far more serious disrepair. Professional and local government bodies are concerned about that. There was considerable debate in another place. Again, that is something that we will pursue later.

</p>

<a name="40607-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>I have two other areas of concern in Part 1, one of which is the timescale that is given for people to put right a category 1 hazard. At the moment, the Government propose a five-year period. The Local Government <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_92"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 92</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Association favours three years. My honourable friend in another place suggested that perhaps it should be one year, but that there should be an ability to extend that depending on the circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>We would also like to see here and elsewhere greater emphasis on energy efficiency improvements. Dealing with climate change is the big debate at the moment. We know that reducing the amount of energy that we use is really important in that respect. I feel that in many areas the Government have been rather slow to respond to that. I hope that the Minister can assure us that the Government have done all that they can in this Bill to line up with other strategies to deal with energy efficiency: for example, their own energy strategy, the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act, the fuel poverty strategy and the Sustainable Energy Act. Those are matters that we shall also pursue later.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>Part 2 concerns the licensing of houses in multiple occupation. The last time that I discussed that issue in any detail was in another place regarding the Housing Act 1996. Indeed, the present Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, and I were both in another place at that time. I am only sorry that it has taken us so long&#151;seven years or more&#151;to talk about it again. I strongly support the measures in the Bill. Some of the worst housing in this country is houses in multiple occupation.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>However, the Government could be a little more courageous and ambitious. I should like to see more measures to give landlords a more positive role. Landlords&#039; organisations are anxious to be involved in   raising standards through their training and accreditation schemes. I know that the Government have been in discussion with landlords&#039; organisations on those matters and such schemes. Perhaps the Minister could comment on the Government&#039;s thinking and where they are in their discussions.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>We would particularly like to see a couple of areas changed, one of which is the definition of a house in multiple occupation. In his opening comments the Minister gave his reasons about why they were to apply only to buildings of three storeys or more with more than four residents. From my experience in Southampton, where I represented a ward that was close to the university, there were a lot of houses in multiple occupation. Many of the houses that had been converted into housing of multiple occupation were only two storeys, which also happens in inner city areas. Other organisations support us, including the Local Government Association, the National Union of Students and Shelter.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>As regards university students, the licensing of accommodation that is occupied by full-time students and run by education institutions, such as halls of residence, should be brought within the survey. There is evidence from the British Gas housing survey of   2004 that some of these buildings have considerable problems with damp and mould.

</p>

<a name="40607-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>The Bill will give further authority for local authorities to extend licensing in selected areas. We welcome this, but perhaps it should not be quite so restrictive as the Government have made it. As I understand from the Bill, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_93"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 93</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

where there is poor landlord management in areas of low demand, that is the area that the Government are trying to tackle. That should be widened. In other areas where there is bad management, even if there is not low demand, the local authorities should be able to step in. I heard what the Minister said in his opening remarks, that there would be possibilities to extend that in other areas for HMOs that were not three storeys.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>There is considerable detail in the Bill, in the areas that I have touched on, but a lot of extra detail will come through regulations and guidance. I already have here a very large pile and I am sure that there will be more. We have tried to find out exactly what is available now, and I would be grateful if the Minister would update us.

</p>

<a name="40607-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>As the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said, the most controversial part of the Bill seems to be Part 5 on home information packs. It certainly is for these Benches. But we are not alone in our criticisms, some of   which the noble Baroness outlined. The Law Society particularly feels that some of the new processes already in place are fairly satisfactory and that the packs will not help them&#151;they will not sit very well with new developments in the market.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>The National Association of Estate Agents is very   concerned about the proposed timescale for the implementation of Part 5. I welcome the Minister&#039;s reassurance that the Government will not implement it if it is not ready. That is very important because there are concerns about getting enough trained home inspectors.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>The House Builders Federation is also concerned about the shelflife of the pack. One of the interesting points it made was about the problems that it will create for frail and elderly people who want to buy homes, particularly being forced to have the pack upfront when they start, and the fact that it is compulsory. I am sure that we will discuss that in detail; I do not have time to go through all the objections, but we share many of the concerns on these Benches.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>Above all, we believe that the bureaucracy that will be set up will not achieve the Government&#039;s aim. The Minister shared with me his experiences of using that system; I shared with him my experiences of not having a system, and one going well and one not going well&#151;it was nothing to do with whether you had a pack.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>It seems to me that the one sector of housing in this country that really works is the private ownership section: where 70 per cent of people own their own home that does not seem to be the area that has the most problems&#151;but more of that later. My noble friend Lady Hamwee and I discussed that the last time we had a housing Bill here, and I am sure we will be doing it again. My noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury has very strong views on this; unfortunately he is not able to be with us tonight, but he hopes to take part later.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>We support the changes made by the Government in Part 6 on the right to buy. Over the years we have seen a huge erosion of the number of rented houses, particularly, which means that families in the social <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_94"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 94</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

rented sector often have to be put into flats. Quite frankly, some individuals have made enormous personal benefit from that: if they happened to be in the right place at the right time, they did very nicely, thank you. I do not begrudge them that, but we need to get the balance across the sectors.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>I am still concerned about rural areas. We ought to look much more carefully at how we deal with that. My noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer will touch on that in her contribution tonight. However, Members on these Benches have always thought that it is for individual local authorities to decide how to operate their schemes, which should be based on their overall housing strategies.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>Clause 186, covering grants for social housing, is an important provision that the Minister has already referred to, but which has been little discussed. It allows social housing grants to be paid to bodies not registered with the Housing Corporation such as private developers. It would allow unregulated bodies to bid for public funds to develop affordable housing. I understand that the Government believe that they may be able to get better value for money in this way, but can the Minister tell us what evidence backs that up? When my honourable friend in another place, Ed Davey, asked about average build costs in both the public and private sectors, the answer he was given by the Minister, Keith Hill, was that the average cost of a new building for social rent in England in 2003&#150;04 was &#163;116,000. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not keep comparable information on the private sector. I hope that we will be given rather fuller information than that when we come to discuss the clause.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>Questions need to be asked: whether private developers can build more cheaply; will standards suffer; can standards be enforced through contract terms; will there be cherry-picking from other projects, and what about the sustainability agenda? I am sure that we will pursue these matters at later stages.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>Some new issues have already been added to the Bill. Both speakers referred to the park home provisions. I was part of the group, along with the noble Lord, Lord   Graham of Edmonton, that pursued this matter. When I was a Member of Parliament, my constituency contained a huge number of park homes. They provide many advantages as homes for elderly people. The sites are secure and they take up only a small amount of land. However, they lack the kind of protection enjoyed by people in normal housing. I have sought for a long time to ensure that park homes become a part of mainstream housing. I pay tribute to the Minister, Yvette Cooper. She listened to the arguments, went away and did something about it. We particularly welcome that.

</p>

<a name="40607-25_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>Amendments will be tabled on two issues: to provide a statutory basis for tenancy deposit schemes and provisions to enable councils to compulsorily lease long-term empty properties. We support both of these proposals and we shall look at the details. I recall tabling amendments on deposit schemes to the Housing Act 1996. People have campaigned for a number of years, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_95"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 95</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and plenty of information is available from voluntary schemes that have already been set up. I hope that that will inform how regulations are formulated, and that those who are operating reasonable schemes are not compromised by new legislation.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>Last, but not least, I turn to empty properties. I have been involved in this issue since my earliest campaigning days and I am pleased that the Government are at last going to provide an extra tool for local authorities. Much good work has already been done. As patron of the Empty Homes Agency, I recall giving an award to South Somerset District Council for its good work, undertaken while my noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer was there.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>This legislation should be several Bills. Housing never   rises high enough up the agenda to get into the programme. Whenever a housing Bill comes along, everyone wants to add something to it, resulting in very complicated legislation. Despite what the Minister has   said, some parts of the Bill were not adequately scrutinised in another place. The Report stage was appallingly truncated.
</p>

<a name="40607-25_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>We support much of the Bill, but we want to improve the detail and throw out the unworkable in our quest for decent, affordable homes for everyone in our country.

<a name="40607-26_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </b>   My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the noble Baroness because she shares with me a deep interest in housing matters, based upon the same experience as mine. It has been 45   years since I started as a councillor, then a Member of Parliament and subsequently came to this House.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>I know that the Minister has his heart in the right place. He started by saying that this was the second most important, interesting Bill that he has dealt with. I cannot think of any other aspect of our lives more important than the possession of or ability to occupy a home.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>As a constituency MP in Edmonton in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s&#151;and, speaking to colleagues, their experience was a similar one&#151;night after night, one would listen to people who one knew were genuine but who had drawn the short straw. By virtue of circumstance they had found themselves living in either inadequate accommodation or in what in the old days would have been called slum accommodation. They were ready to be evicted; they were victims of circumstances, and it made my heart bleed. As I have told the House before, on two occasions I left my surgery on a Friday night, sat in my car and cried, because I knew that I could do nothing about it.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>The Minister and his colleagues should earn the undying gratitude of untold thousands if not millions of people for whom this Bill might be the answer to their problems. Over the past few months, the Minister and his colleagues have been persistent in making sure that this Bill has reached its present stage and, in particular, have come along later with provisions for park homes.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_96"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 96</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>I would like to say a word or two about the right to buy. I strongly opposed the right-to-buy principle when it was introduced, because I knew that in Edmonton there were thousands of homes built by direct labour, which were solid, reliable and well worth the money. Inevitably, however, with the prospect dangling in front of them of making &#163;5,000, &#163;10,000, sometimes &#163;20,000, it made it very difficult for people&#151;who had been desperate to get that house when they had been homeless&#151;not to capitalise on it.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>One of the things that has stuck in my craw over the past 20 years has been the argument put forward then: that people had the right to buy the house in which they had lived all their lives and in which they wanted to continue to live. We now see from surveys that 48  per cent or more of the people who exercise the right to buy immediately sell the property at a profit. This is a profit which takes the ratepayer and the taxpayer for granted. The party opposite has always said, &quot;We are not in favour of wasting ratepayers&#039; or taxpayers&#039; money&quot;. Yet the beneficiaries of the right to buy were being given a grant. All of a sudden, council tenants were specially selected people: people who deserved this opportunity.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>I have read the research papers in the Library and, without going into the detail, there have been an absolutely scandalous number of scams growing out of the right to buy. I do not know whether the Minister and his colleagues are able to stop them. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, was quite right that the right-to-buy principle will not be breached, but the manner in which it has been operated and abused needs to be tackled. I  suggest that the Minister should continue to try to deal with that.

</p>

<a name="40607-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>One reads the briefs that one receives&#151;and I have never been so well served in preparing for a Bill as I have been for this one&#151;and generally, of course, they are to be welcomed. As has been referred to, Which?, or the Consumers&#039; Association, welcomed the introduction of the Housing Bill. I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady   Hanham, said that they were the only ones who welcomed the Bill. Quite frankly, I do not know of anyone who does not welcome the Bill in general terms.

</p>

<a name="40607-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>Clearly there are some criticisms of the Bill&#039;s content and omissions, so the Minister should be under no illusion that it will have an easy passage in general. But I feel a great deal of warmth towards him and his colleagues because at long last they have been able to do something.

</p>

<a name="40607-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>Over the past seven or eight years the problems of   park homes have been debated. We first went to Hilary Armstrong, who set up a working party in a genuine attempt to help. Nick Raynsford, Sally Keeble, Keith   Hill, Yvette Cooper, my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer and my noble friend Lord Rooker have all played a part in keeping the ball rolling. As parliamentarians, we know that we have to be very lucky in respect of timing and opportunity, and I am very grateful to them. I am certainly grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, for her continuing support on the park homes front.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>Let me rehearse some of the provisions in relation to park homes which were spatchcocked into the Bill in the other place. It now requires a written statement of terms to be given to a prospective purchaser before the sale of a park home. That was not there before, but it is so simple. The Bill creates a power by which the Secretary of State can add additional implied terms to the agreement and repeal and vary those in the Mobile Homes Act. One of the things to my credit is that I am the only living Member who served on the Mobile Homes Act in 1983. I have lived to pay the penalty because everyone comes to me and says, &quot;What a rotten job you made of it&quot;.

</p>

<a name="40607-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>The Bill will also help to deter a site owner from unreasonably withholding approval of a prospective purchaser. It will remove the age of a home as a criterion for ending an agreement and give discretion to courts to adjourn termination proceedings on the grounds of the condition of a park home to allow for repairs to be carried out. And it brings protection from eviction to park homeowners up to that for tenants of houses, a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock. Park homeowners have felt inferior&#151;and certainly they were in terms of protection from the law.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>The Minister and his officials have had to be persuaded and pushed, but they have recognised the problem and I am very grateful. They have consulted about the model standards and will be undertaking some work on the statutory instruments in the Housing Bill which relate to park homes. It is the good news that we have been waiting for. If I knew how to   spell &quot;hallelujah&quot; I would say it properly. It is &quot;hallelujah&quot; for the people who live in park homes. We have come a very long way and we are very grateful to the Minister and his colleagues.

<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>The Minister can count on my support, not only in general but almost without exception. These aspects of living need the spotlight of Parliament turned upon them. It is our job to reflect upon and revise what was said in the other place; it will be put to good purpose here. I thank the Minister most sincerely for what he said.

<a name="40607-26_spnew3"></a><b> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </b>   My Lords, it is always a pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Graham, but if he will forgive me, in view of the time available, I shall concentrate on Part 5 this evening. Whenever we introduce major new regulations and regulatory requirements, with new regulators and inspectors usually following to monitor and police them&#151;I suspect that that will happen in this case too&#151;we need to be fully convinced that the benefits justify the costs and outweigh the difficulties involved and the burdens imposed.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>I readily agree that there are arguments in favour of the scheme. I have no doubt that there is much frustration and stress for both buyers and sellers because of some aspects of the present system. I do not think that the present system is a &quot;shambles&quot;, as the Minister in another place put it, but some of the delays and uncertainties could surely be eliminated or shortened.

</p>

<a name="40607-26_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>I attended the other day a seminar of an organisation called CHIPS, or Consumers Home Information Pack Supporters, in Portcullis House, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. I was particularly impressed by evidence provided by that organisation&#151;it has a voluntary scheme&#151;that in the period between the offer subject to contract and the completion and exchange of contracts, all the transactions in which those particular estate agents were involved were completed. There was no one-third drop-out rate in that period and transactions were completed much more quickly. However, it was a small sample.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>I was concerned about imposing a new cost on the seller, but I accept that most sellers are also buyers and benefit from that. I accept also that first-time buyers will benefit most from a scheme of this kind. However, a surprisingly large proportion are sellers only. I was struck by a sentence in the Government&#039;s regulatory impact assessment document, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;The cost of providing the pack could be added to the purchase price of the property being sold&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-26_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>That sentence was tucked away. It has not been shouted from the rooftops by government Ministers. The Minister made other points in favour of the scheme.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_99"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 99</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-26_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a>Therefore, I am prepared to consider the scheme, but as I looked further&#151;I was not involved in the original debates&#151;and considered both the Government&#039;s regulatory impact assessment document and the many representations that we have received on Part 5, many of my original doubts remained. My noble friend Lady   Hanham and the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, have already referred to some of them and the Minister is aware that this is clearly a major part of the Bill to be explored in Committee, but I shall refer to a few that most strike me.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>The Government originally announced the scheme in 1998. That was six years ago. In this rapidly changing world, six years is quite a long time. I was struck by a survey conducted recently by the Council of Mortgage Lenders, to which it referred in its submission to us. Research that it undertook last year highlighted the fact that there have been &quot;significant improvements&quot; in the past five years, with many more to come. We know that one of the main reasons for introducing Part 5 was the delays that occur between the offer subject to contract being made and the ultimate completion. There is much that is happening now that will reduce those delays anyway. The average 12-week delay should come down substantially due to the technological developments in relation to local authorities, mortgage lenders, the Land Register, the National Land Information Service and so on. The regulatory impact assessment states that those developments,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a>&quot;will enable search results to be delivered within minutes rather than days or weeks&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-26_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>Is not technology outstripping the original arguments?
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a>My next point relates to the key additional costs, which are quantified in the regulatory impact assessment. The major additional cost is the compulsory home condition report. The Government argue that that will replace the existing survey for many and therefore the cost will not be as great. However, the Consumers&#039; Association states on page 10 of its report to us:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;The HIP is a guidance document for people looking round a property and <i>caveat emptor</i> will still apply&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-26_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>I thought that was a very interesting sentence, but I suspect that that means&#151;the Government will have to make it clear in relation to HIPs&#151;that many people who currently conduct a search of their own will still wish to do so, so there is a considerable additional cost for them. More importantly, the Council of Mortgage Lenders states at various points in its representations that, as matters stand now, lenders will often still have to have a physical valuation of their own. That is one aspect of costs that has been underestimated.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>I am particularly struck by the fact that we cannot properly assess the costs until the outcome of what we know will be prolonged consultation on the details of the scheme. Clearly at the moment, as the Council of Mortgage Lenders and others have pointed out, many costs to lenders, local authorities and so on have been left out of the current cost assessment. I am doubtful about some of them; for example, I am sure that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_100"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 100</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

assumed cost to local authorities and the trading standards officers of &#163;2.2 million will be a considerable underestimate in practice.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>I am interested in who has the title to the home improvement pack because it is clearly relevant to who can be sued. Who owns it? I presume that it is the person who paid for it; or is it the home inspector, estate agent or lawyer? I would like an answer to that question, because, bearing in mind the Consumers&#039; Association&#039;s point about caveat emptor, there will be considerable issues. In particular, if there are concerns about the home inspector&#039;s report and it turns out to be inaccurate, can the home inspector be sued or how is the issue to be resolved?
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>The Minister in the other place made brief reference to a resolution of disputes procedure, as does the regulatory impact assessment document, but at the moment I am not at all clear what that disputes procedure and what the costs would be. I hope that the Minister will be able to fill us in with considerable details.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a>As has already been mentioned, home inspectors are a key issue. Is the qualification good enough at NVQ4? Clearly the Council of Mortgage Lenders does not think so, because it says that that level of training is significantly below that of a chartered surveyor. The problem is that if the lenders are to rely on the information collected within a home condition report for use in valuations and underwriting, they must be persuaded that the training and ongoing monitoring of home inspectors is of a sufficient standard, otherwise there will be additional costs.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a>The sufficiency of inspectors will clearly be crucial to a national compulsory scheme. Who will pay the costs of training? I was glad to hear the Minister guarantee that the introduction of this part of the Bill will not take place until he is fully satisfied that all the conditions are in place. One of them, critically, must be a sufficient number of fully qualified inspectors in place, taking into account that many are expected, indeed intended, to be part time.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a>One of the key issues in that context is insurance, which is a crucial part of the scheme&#151;and not only for consumers and lenders. No home inspector in his right mind should take on the job if there is not professional indemnity insurance. At this stage I understand that that issue is still unclear; indeed the Consumers&#039; Association is saying that if there is no clear indemnity for home inspectors, the Government must be insurers of last resort.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a>So one could go on. Many other points were raised by the noble Baronesses who spoke before me, but they are summed up in the Council of Mortgage Lenders&#039; point:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a>&quot;it is our view that a vast amount of work remains to be done prior to there being any possibility of successful implementation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-26_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>I was glad to hear the Minister say that he would not proceed with this part of the Bill unless there was an assurance that all the many areas of doubt and difficulty had been resolved. The starting date looks optimistic, but I hope that it will be possible for us to return to these issues not only in Committee and on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_101"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 101</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Report, but as so much will happen in regulations after the Bill becomes an Act. I hope that a revised and more realistic regulatory impact assessment available to both Houses is made before proceeding.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a>That leads me also to the conclusion that the Government should revisit the idea of a voluntary scheme. I did not find convincing the Minister&#039;s answer on that point in another place, nor was I convinced this evening. I can see that there are some difficulties in having a voluntary scheme alongside the home improvement pack scheme, but nothing like as many difficulties as with a compulsory scheme without all the problems that have been drawn to our attention having been satisfactorily ironed out.
</p>

<a name="40607-26_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>I suspect that a voluntary scheme would enable a home improvement pack to be tried and tested in the market place, which could be the best way.

<p><a name="st_201"></a>
<a name="40607-27_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend Lady Maddock said in her excellent speech that a housing Bill does not come along very often. Indeed, it does not; and it is perhaps with that in mind that I should like to share with the House and the Minister my extreme disappointment that this Housing Bill does nothing to address the issues of affordable housing in rural areas.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>The problem of affordable housing has been highlighted year after year, particularly strongly in 2002 and 2003, by the Countryside Agency, which felt that it was the most severe unaddressed problem facing rural areas. So far as I could see, the Government&#039;s only reaction to that has been to abolish the Countryside Agency&#151;or they are about to do so. However, the rural advocate, the last chairman of the agency, is shortly to join your Lordships&#039; House, so I hope that his voice will be added to those calling for action in this area.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>Last year, the agency underlined how serious the matter was. Since then, house prices in rural areas have gone on rising&#151;particularly in my own area of the south-west, by some 20 per cent a year, which I believe is higher than in many areas of the country. The supply of new-build affordable homes is pathetically, shockingly small. I hope to ask the Minister for some reasons why the Government have not only felt unable to address that problem robustly but made some moves that have been unhelpful.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>In almost any forum that one cares to go to&#151;whether local authority meetings or strategic partner meetings&#151;the issue of affordable housing comes up time and again. The Minister himself mentioned sustainable communities. Affordable housing is the bedrock that is needed for rural communities. Without those affordable homes, not only will the key workers be unable to live there but so will all those occupations that are not classified as key workers but which certainly are in a rural area&#151;whether they are car mechanics, plumbers, care home workers or taxi drivers.

</p>

<a name="40607-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>Without that sort of affordable housing, the community will fade. As young people cannot afford to buy in, there will be no babies, no children, no school, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_102"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 102</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and consequently much less of a community focus. Eventually we will end up with a cluster of individual households, which are not only less supporting but much more of a call on the public purse in terms of social services. Generations cannot stay together; older people are not there to babysit and child-mind in the towns where there are young people, and the young people are not there to carry out errands for the elderly people left in the rural communities. It will simply not be a sustainable community. The Government cannot claim to support sustainable communities while ignoring a swathe of those in rural areas, which simply will not be able to remain sustainable.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>The Bill addresses the issues of licensing houses in   multiple occupation. That is good&#151;indeed, it is essential. However, rural areas do not have many HMOs, although there is a need for HMOs and small flats in rural areas. It is not as though young people from rural areas suddenly go from being aged 18 to 28 with no intervening years; they go through the same process as young people in urban areas. They look to become more independent and to move out when they get a job&#151;only there is nowhere to go, except to move away to a large town or city. It is with some regret that I observe that the HMO part of the Bill will not have much relevance to rural areas.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>One of the least helpful moves that the Government made recently was, last year, to remove the local authority housing grant. It was removed almost overnight. The speed of the decision and the lack of warning made planning for its removal very difficult. I appreciate that it was not a large amount, but it was enough to allow local authorities to fund small village schemes, or part-fund with RSLs. Often that pump-priming response is what is needed to respond to the housing needs survey.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>When the Minister comes to say why the grant was abolished, I suspect that he will say that it was because it discriminated in favour of richer authorities. But even richer authorities in rural areas have hidden pockets of deprivation and they have those in housing need, which the strategies identify. That grant really helped. The Minister may say that that grant has gone to the Housing Corporation but has the total amount of money that it has to allocate increased by the equivalent amount of money or has the Treasury simply allocated less funding to housing overall? Clause 190 allows some grant to be given to private developers but I believe that this will not make up for the fact that local authorities themselves, which are the   democratically elected bodies tasked by the Government to respond to housing need, cannot do much about it.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>In the mid&#150;1990s, 2,500 homes per year were built in smaller villages with Housing Corporation funding and a further 2,000 with local authority grants. I believe that the figure last year was a total of some 1,750. I return to the fact that that is a pathetically small figure of the whole of England. I urge the Minister to give some thought to whether there should be something in the Housing Bill to give some cheer to rural areas. One area he might like to consider is exception sites: sites that would not normally get <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_103"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 103</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

planning permission but which can do so in a rural area when it is for affordable housing. They were first recognised in 1989. Since then some 4,000 sites have been brought into use. The Minister may say that that is not an issue for the Bill but I understand that his colleagues in the ODPM are thinking of a rewrite of PPG3, which would put the exception site policy at risk. I believe that, in the face of any other way of addressing affordable housing in rural areas, that would an extremely retrograde step. If it were abolished, a massive grant programme to buy land in rural areas would be needed and that is not a good way to use public funds.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>I would like to mention a couple of other issues. I am pleased that park homes are in the Bill. I could not agree more with the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, when she says that houseboat owners too need similar protection. I look forward to debating that issue further in Committee where I would also like to address the issue of homes for owners of genuine smallholdings, which have come under more and more pressure as the countryside becomes very precious.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>The Government claim that their aim is a living, working countryside. At the moment, it is a joke. One can work in the countryside but live in town or work in town and live in the countryside, if you are young, but it is very difficult to do both. I hope that the Bill will do something to address that situation.

<p><a name="st_202"></a>
<a name="40607-27_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Best: </b>   My Lords, I welcome the Bill, which contains a number of important changes for housing in the UK. I declare my interests as the chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust and I have long-standing links with many other housing organisations.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>Last week, I spent time with Jacky Peacock and her colleagues from the well respected Brent Private Tenants Rights Group. I listened in on the week&#039;s caseload of private sector tenants in need of advice and   support. There were cases of accidents in unsafe properties, cases of harassment by unscrupulous landlords waiting to gain possession of properties and many cases of landlords illegally withholding the deposits that they had collected from tenants. For example, an incredulous Australian returning home after working here in the health service was astonished to discover that his landlord systematically withheld tenants&#039; deposits of between &#163;500 and &#163;1,000. Such landlords know that tenants from overseas cannot wait for cases to be organised and heard in the small claims court some months later. Tenants who need to use their deposits to secure their next rented homes here can find themselves homeless, simply because landlords refuse to return their money. The recent addition to the Bill of new measures on tenants&#039; deposits to protect against exploitation of this kind is very welcome indeed.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a>I also visited a number of houses in multiple occupation last week, some of which will be subject to the new licensing arrangements. I have to tell <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_104"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 104</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

noble   Lords, and the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, in particular, that the evil slums of yesteryear are still very much with us. There was the woman occupying a single room at &#163;85 a week in the back addition of a house in Harlesden where the rain came through in three places. There was the hospital porter&#039;s miserable hovel above a shop in Wembley with cockroaches and plumbing that did not work. There was the couple in the house in Brent which had been shoddily converted into multiple &quot;apartments&quot; infested with mice and suffering from disrepair, condensation and mould growth. Harassment and intimidation of tenants who complain is only too common in this seedy end of the housing market.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>The landlords of these properties are a disgrace to the majority of respectable and sensible operators. It is good news that the Bill will introduce regulations to improve the position. But we know that exploitation is always likely when there are acute shortages. And we know from Kate Barker&#039;s excellent review for the Treasury that the shortages of homes at rents affordable to those on low incomes are set to grow worse if we cannot increase supply, not least in rural areas, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, explained.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>The private sector has much to offer to the middle market of those on the move or not yet ready or able to settle into owner occupation. But this sector cannot provide the answer for those who need decent homes at low rents, on a secure, permanent basis. Nor are those landlords who are investing in renting&#151;and &#163;40   billion has gone into the buy-to-let schemes in recent years&#151;currently building any extra housing. They are simply buying existing property, and that can add to inflationary pressures on house prices. That is why successive governments have funded the direct provision of extra social housing at present provided through housing associations.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a>That brings me to the proposals in the Bill mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, for paying social housing grant to house builders and developers&#151;grants which hitherto have been available only to regulated housing associations. In place of the current and very welcome trend to partnerships between house builders and housing associations, this approach sets the two groups into competition with each other. The idea is that increased competition will mean efficiency gains and secure more subsidised homes for the same amount of public money. As always, the Treasury is hoping for more for less.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a>I should be grateful for reassurances from the Minister on three points. The first is that there will be a level playing field between house builders and housing associations in the regulations on rents, security of tenure, tenant participation, redress through the housing ombudsman and so on.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>The second is that the increase in the value of properties that have been grant-aided will be locked into providing continuing social benefits in the future. The housing associations of today use the gains they   have obtained from the rising property values of homes produced in the past to borrow cheaply, to withstand losses on rents in the early years of new <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_105"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 105</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

schemes and to upgrade properties and provide important services to tenants. It would be a tragedy if the new arrangements for giving grants to house builders and developers meant that the benefits of rising property values were lost to social purposes and went instead to commercial interests and private shareholders.

</p>

<a name="40607-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a>Thirdly, reassurance from the Minister would be greatly appreciated on safeguards against house builders winning bids for social housing grant by building more cheaply, as they do for comparable properties for outright sale. It is possible to use less robust components in houses for sale, because homeowners are prepared to do their own maintenance and DIY, and because they under-occupy the premises, usually having a spare room, which means less wear and tear. However, in rented housing, lower quality means higher costs in the future. My fear is that if, on day one, house builders and developers appear to offer more for less, tempting the Housing Corporation to pass over public money to them, the gains may prove illusory in the longer term.
</p>

<a name="40607-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a>The Bill contains an array of important improvements for the UK&#039;s housing. In particular, I hope that it will help those worst affected by the bad practices of a minority of private landlords, and will in no way undermine the provision of additional, badly needed affordable homes through housing associations. I look forward to discussion of the details of the Bill over the weeks ahead.

<a name="40607-28_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde: </b>   My Lords, I, too, welcome the Bill. Like other noble Lords, I have received enormous amounts of briefing, the majority of which has welcomed the Bill. Of course, the devil is in the detail, as always. I also welcome the not unexpected statement from the Minister that he looks forward to a robust debate, because parts of the Bill will bring that.
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>There have been many contributions about the home information pack. Mine is probably one of the few voices in the debate thus far to welcome it&#151;it is a good thing. The fact that the Consumers&#039; Association is the only organisation to have welcomed it in no way discredits either the standing or the quantity of its briefing. It conducted a survey last October of more than 1,000 people who had bought their homes. The disgraceful figures to come out of that were that more than 50 per cent were unhappy with the transaction, 70   per cent felt that the estate agents had given them misleading information, and 82 per cent thought that the home information pack would be very useful to them. All that I have read has led me to one firm belief, which is total agreement with the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, that we should look at licensing or regulating the estate agency sector. It is the only group in the house-purchase chain that does not have either a professional or a regulatory backing.
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a>The issue of rural housing is very fraught. It is a real issue in rural areas, and I am sure that we shall have a debate on it. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, was a bit unfair to the Government, who have more than <br>&nbsp;<br>

trebled the number of houses built in rural areas since they came to office. So desperate are we to get houses built&#151;it is difficult to reach the targets&#151;that the Housing Corporation, with the Countryside Agency, funded the employment of 20 people for three years up and down the country looking for sites or buildings that could be converted for rural housing. Such is the commitment behind trying to improve it. I accept that it is nowhere near what is needed, but it is certainly much better than it was. It is unfair to criticise the Government as strongly as the noble Baroness did, but I look forward to the debate on the issue.
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a>I want to concentrate on Part 6. It has the rather innocuous title of &quot;Other provisions about housing&quot;, but I believe that it is part of the beef of the Bill itself. It is a substantial part of the Bill and deals with a number of areas, not least of which is disabilities. Because of time, I shall not speak on that subject; I think that my noble friend Lady Wilkins and the noble Lord, Lord Rix, will concentrate on that in their speeches.

<a name="40607-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_491"></a>Last year, I was asked by the Deputy Prime Minister to chair a group of what turned out to be 16 people, to look into how we could increase the number of people in this country who could afford to buy their own homes. Currently, 70 per cent do and 90 per cent would like to. How do we increase the market for low-cost home ownership? The Barker review is a major contribution to that. My review was submitted to the Deputy Prime Minister last October. It received nowhere near the publicity of the Barker review; it was not so high-pitched. However, I was delighted a few weeks ago to receive a letter from the Housing Minister, Keith Hill, confirming acceptance of the majority of the 45 recommendations in that report, many of which are in the Bill. I place on record my thanks to the Government for that.
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_492"></a>The Minister said in his opening address that some small changes had been made to the right to buy. That was a recommendation of my small working group, which comprised not only housing officials but private developers and a range of others outside housing.
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_493"></a>I welcome the changes in the Bill, but they do not go far enough. Among other things, the working group conducted a series of meeting with people who lived in rented property or had shared ownership&#151;part rental, part buying&#151;but who wanted to buy their own home. What came through was the unfairness&#151;they are so right&#151;of the difference between the discount in the right to acquire from housing associations and that given by local authorities. The blunt fact is that it depends where the dice falls for an individual: if you are in a local council house, the discount and what you   get is far better than if you are in a housing association property. We felt that that should be rectified. The Government have not done that; nor have they dealt with the variation between the regions. Nevertheless, I welcome without reservation Clauses   157 to 165, because they reflect my task force&#039;s recommendations. We want to see good value and improvement in affordable home ownership.

<a name="40607-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_494"></a>One of the other areas that the Government did not accept related to increased value when a shared ownership tenant of a housing association property sells and moves on. We wanted to see the housing association share of that profit recycled within affordable home ownership. I hope that the Government will look at that again.
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a>I welcome Clause 87, which deals with overcrowding. The standard was last set in 1935, I think; so the Government&#039;s commitment to review it is very welcome. It would be very helpful if the Minister could indicate the timescale for the consultation and what the Government are looking at on the issue of overcrowding. He might not be able to give the answer today, but perhaps he could do so during the course of the Bill. As with overcrowding, the issue of decent homes is so big that it must be dealt with in a timescale; you cannot do it overnight. It would be good to have within the Bill, which the Government intend to make active at the beginning of 2005, a timetable for dealing with overcrowding. That would certainly help local authorities. It would be helpful if the Minister could give some indication on that.
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_496"></a>Until last year, I was chairman of the Housing Corporation, so I welcome the Bill&#039;s updating of the   corporation&#039;s powers and the improvements on the present arrangements, but there is an omission. The Housing Corporation has the sanctions of either gentle persuasion or, at the other extreme, what I used to call the nuclear bomb&#151;statutory inquiry. It needs some intermediate sanctions by which it can bring housing associations along when they are not meeting the standards needed. Yes, you can put people on a board under supervision&#151;you have them there part time. It would be good to have intermediate powers and a special manager. I gather that the Treasury rejected that recommendation because a special manager would remove housing associations&#039; independence. However, that is not the case in Scotland, where the proposal has been accepted, so I question why we cannot have such provision here.

</p>

<a name="40607-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a>I fear that Part 5 replaces light-touch regulation with heavy-handed, socialist bureaucracy, which will at least lead to the stigma of a two-tier housing market. In Denmark, which the Government have often quoted as having home information packs, the size of the pack has risen from 100 pages to 800 pages. They have a small housing market in comparison to ours.

<a name="40607-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a>We have made little progress in the six years of discussion with the Government on the sellers pack, or home information pack as it is now called. The only notable achievement is to have moved them away from criminal penalties to civil penalties, and I welcome that. The idea of a home information pack is admirable. It is agreed that there is a need to speed up the housing market, but the Government&#039;s proposals are not a solution to our problems. Let us look at the cost. The Minster said that the alleged cost of aborted transactions is about &#163;350 million. We will come back to that on Report, but that figure is wildly out of date and it is misleading&#151;it is much less than that. However, the cost of a home information pack will add about &#163;650 million annually to existing selling costs. The average cost of a home information pack will generally be over &#163;600, or more like &#163;1,000 in London.
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a>As my noble friend Lord MacGregor pointed out, the regulatory impact assessment is a flawed document, as it does not take into account many of the additional costs. The Government have seen fit not to include those. The result will be that extra costs will go up, and some estate agents will be able to push up their fees as well. That happened in Denmark, where fees have practically doubled since the introduction of their equivalent of the home information pack.
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a>A home condition report is a pretty worthless document if it is not accepted by the mortgage lenders. The lenders will always want the right to commission their own valuation and survey. Contrary to what the Minister implied, the Council of Mortgage Lenders has not welcomed the idea of home condition reports. The survey has the wrong name; it is not a survey of a house, it is an inspection by a partially qualified person. That person will not be qualified up to Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors standards, and that inspection will not reveal any of they key information that a house buyer wants. It is a surface inspection; it does not look at the expensive things that are always hidden, the drains, the electricity, the gas, the damp, the subsidence. They are totally ignored, so it will not help in the way that the Government want.
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a>My noble friend Lord MacGregor also raised the question of surveyors and insurance. That is a huge problem. Let us look north of the Border, where a similar scheme is under way, except that it is voluntary. The whole scheme is grinding to a halt because the insurance companies are terrified of what will happen. At the moment, one gets a survey carried out by a professional. That person will probably be RICS certified, which will not be the case in the future. The survey goes to one person; that is one insurance claim. Now, the insurance companies will be faced with a home condition report going to perhaps 50 different people, all of whom can sue. That problem is by no means resolved yet.
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a>Let us look at the shelf life of the property. The Government state that the home condition report should not be more than three months old at the time marketing commences. At the moment, 25 per cent of open market sales take about six months, so that inspection will be at least six months out of date. Whose responsibility will it be to update that? In the <br>&nbsp;<br>

past few years, we have been used to a strong, bullish market. There is no question that that will end. By whatever means, the market will slow down, back to what it used to be when properties took a long time to sell. The home information pack will be out of date, the searches will be out of date, and the home condition report will be out of date. Having spent a vast amount of money preparing it for the beginning of the sale, whose responsibility is it to update it, and how are they going to find the extra costs? It is going to have a big impact on the housing market, far more than the Government give it credit for.
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a>There is also going to be a conflict of interest between the surveyor and the home condition report inspector. They can sit in the same office, at adjacent desks. If that home condition report has got to be accepted by the vendor and the purchaser, there is no way they should be allowed to be in the same building, and agents should not be allowed to own or take part in a firm that is producing home condition reports. There is too much of a conflict of interest, which would not be allowed in any other line of business.
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a>Let us look at the qualifications for estate agents. When the Minister is looking for a new job after the next election, he can set up an estate agency the next day and sell a &#163;10,000 house, or even a &#163;10 million house. He needs no qualifications, nor does he have to meet any threshold, but if he wants to sell &#163;100 worth of stocks and shares he has to go through every hurdle the FSA can produce for him. It is nonsense, and I strongly support my noble friend Lady Hanham. She knows I have been banging this drum for many years&#151;us estate agents need to be properly regulated, along with the rest of the financial sector.
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a>I want to ask the Minister what has happened to SAVA, that great institution that was launched with such a flourish. In 2001 the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, was telling us all about its goodness. Who owns it now? What happened to the house that was suddenly found among its assets?
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>The Minister has said absolutely nothing about how   he is going to monitor Part 5. What are the Government&#039;s plans for monitoring? How are they going to assess whether this has produced value for money and improved the market? How are they going to differentiate what the Bill does, as opposed to all the other changes that have been mentioned that are coming through in the housing market?
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>There are a lot of problems. I hope the Minister gives us enough time to debate this in Committee. We started today at 7.53 p.m., exactly the same time as we were allowed to start the Bill in 2001. I fear we are going to be horribly squeezed in Committee.
</p>

<a name="40607-28_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>At Second Reading in 2001, the Minister&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Whitty&#151;said that the seller&#039;s pack or HIP, as it is now going to be called, was going to be ready for 2003. Yet in July of that year the Select Committee looking at the draft Housing Bill in another place savaged the Government&#039;s proposals, and said that a great deal more work needed to be done before they could be introduced. They were not convinced that HIPs were going to solve any of the problems that the Government have identified.

If your office is in England or Wales, you will not be allowed to market the house. However, if you sell the house from Scotland or market it from France, you can tell everybody. If you have a multinational firm, it will be easy to let people know beforehand that a house is going to come on the market, which will be a civil offence in England and Wales. That is going to be a nonsense. Will the Minister clarify that if I was part of a multinational and I was based in Edinburgh, my other partner in England could not mention that a house was going to come on the market, but being in Scotland I could tell that to anybody in England? That is one of the many nonsenses that this Bill, as drafted, leads us to. We are moving into uncharted territories that need a great deal of examination.

<a name="40607-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rix: </b>   My Lords, I shall not detain your Lordships for long, but as the Disability Rights Commission&#039;s 14-page parliamentary briefing on this Second Reading includes Mencap writ large on the cover and as Mencap&#039;s <i>Housing Timebomb</i> report is quoted on page 3, I felt that, as president of that organisation, I should take this opportunity to say a word about access to housing for people with learning disabilities.
</p>

<a name="40607-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_513"></a>The policy discussions of recent years have highlighted what I might call the four key facts. First, most of the housing progress of community care over the years has done no more than replace hospital accommodation with community housing without adding to the total. Secondly, most adults with learning disabilities still live with their families, as they did before modern community care began.

</p>

<a name="40607-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_514"></a>Thirdly, accommodation is not enough. If people with learning disabilities are to live in their own homes in the community, they need&#151;to varying degrees&#151;support, as well as accommodation. Fourthly, we have invested rather a lot of resources and nervous energy in implementing and then scrapping and replacing models of accommodation and support, without focusing on what the person who is going to live there, and be supported there, actually wants. It is as if a surgeon were to work on the basis of doing a particular sort of operation, quite irrespective of what the individual patient needed or, indeed, wanted.

</p>

<a name="40607-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_515"></a>We need a housing policy that makes the best use of existing housing stock. Best use means appropriate to the needs of those who need the housing. In the case of people with learning disabilities, that means, in particular, catering for the needs of the very large numbers of people with learning disabilities now in middle life who are still living with elderly parents. For <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_111"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 111</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

some of that number, the right answer might be for the family home to be made more appropriate now to the changing needs of the parent or parents and the person with learning disability; that is, to put in extra support now and to plan for the person to carry on living in his or her familiar surroundings once the family who had made the house &quot;home&quot; have gone.
</p>

<a name="40607-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_516"></a>Physical accessibility is not an issue for many people with learning disabilities, whereas having a home of their own to access is. However, the more severe the learning disability, the greater the likelihood of there being associated physical disabilities. In addition, the longer people with learning disabilities live, the greater the likelihood that they, like the rest of us, will acquire physical disability.

</p>

<a name="40607-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_517"></a>My personal dream is of a housing and support programme which&#151;in place of the traditional approach of putting people where we think they ought to go and moving them when it is convenient to move them&#151;enables people to live where they want to live and to stay there as their disabilities increase, if that is their preference. Such a policy requires better assessment of needs and wishes, a starting point in those needs and wishes rather than our theories, registration of demand and of supply, flexible funding policies and speedy availability of the disabled facilities grant and other funding in order to maintain accessibility.
</p>

<a name="40607-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_518"></a>I have been partially reassured by the Government&#039;s response to the Learning Disability Task Force on the issue of funding in the Supporting People scheme. It is vitally important that that level of funding is sustained. However, I am still nervous, given the long history of housing benefit cutbacks, that promising housing policies will be retrenched the moment that it becomes clear that they will, for perfectly good reasons, cost rather more than had been originally anticipated.
</p>

<a name="40607-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_519"></a>It has been clear from the earliest days of trying to get that right for people with learning disabilities that a home in the community, with the support needed to live well in that home, is an essential prerequisite for being present in and participating in the community. There is more than one way of funding, managing and monitoring housing and housing support, but the valuing of people and the housing policies that are being developed offer a real prospect of getting it right this time, always provided, of course, as the good book says, that having put our hand to the plough we do not turn back.
</p>

<a name="40607-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_520"></a>When I read of the size of some new private sector developments, and when I notice that local authorities are still unclear how many people with learning disabilities are living with elderly parents&#151;let alone having plans for them&#151;I do worry that we might turn back and stumble and fall on the very brink of success.

<a name="40607-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   My Lords, I propose to concentrate my remarks on Part 5 of the Bill: 25 clauses containing important and desirable consumer-protection proposals whereby vendors provide home information packs, including home condition reports, whenever a house is put on the market.

<a name="40607-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_521"></a>To be most cautious, at least, I should declare an interest as an honorary life member of the National Association of Estate Agents. Though&#151;as other noble Lords have said&#151;that body seems to be officially opposed to the Bill&#039;s proposals, I think that the association is divided. Many members&#151;including its very well respected former chief executive, Mr Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy&#151;are very much in favour of Part 5.

</p>

<a name="40607-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a>Part 5 was fought over on several occasions during the passage of the Bill in another place, but I believe that in   this House we should support the mandatory requirements for home information packs because they are intended to make more transparent, more speedy and more effective what is&#151;it is commonplace to say&#151;the most economically important transaction that people make in a lifetime, and very often several times in a lifetime. Key information is to be made available at the outset of the process. Particularly because a house purchase is typically part of a chain with the vendor buying another home, and so on up the chain, I believe that opposition pressure in another place&#151;and from what the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, says, perhaps here too&#151;to make the whole idea voluntary would seem a worthless outcome of what the Government are trying to achieve because sales without packs would slow down the connected sales with packs.
</p>

<a name="40607-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a>It is not surprising that the Government&#039;s proposals have received warm support from the Consumers&#039; Association, because there have been so many instances where ignorance on the part of the purchaser about some vital aspect of the property&#039;s condition has meant that only when he commissions a survey&#151;usually at a very late stage of the transaction&#151;do the defects come to light. The first-time purchaser is particularly hard hit at present because he or she has to pay for such a survey upfront before he gets on the first rung of the property ladder.

</p>

<a name="40607-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a>It is even worse if the purchaser is unwise enough not to commission a survey of any kind before committing himself to a price that has been agreed on a false basis of the apparent superficial soundness of the property. Surely Part 5 is good news, for the first-time purchaser in particular. The vendor will provide and&#151;this is a partial   answer to some things that the noble Lord, Lord   MacGregor&#039;s said&#151;be legally responsible for paying for a home condition report with legal responsibility as well behind the wording, the assurances and the terms of that report.
</p>

<a name="40607-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a>At present, several prospective purchasers may each spend money on separate surveys of the same property, only to end up&#151;or at least most of them&#151;with an aborted transaction. The only profit is to the various surveyors who have undertaken the separate surveys.
</p>

<a name="40607-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_526"></a>The beauty of the Government&#039;s scheme&#151;I emphasise the word &quot;beauty&quot; before coming to the criticisms, many of them legitimate, at least in terms of queries to the Government made by the noble Earl and the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor&#151;is that when a vendor proposes to put his property on the market he commissions a survey and that is made available to every genuine intending purchaser.

</p>

<a name="40607-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_527"></a>That is a major cultural shift from the situation in which at present a purchaser makes an offer for a property on the basis not of what it is, with the reality of its imperfections as well as its good points, but on its superficial appearance and a spot of estate agent&#039;s hyperbole. It is not surprising that at present a high proportion&#151;many estimate as high as one third&#151;of all transactions fail when only at a late stage does a survey reveal what lies behind the false mask of the so-called particulars of sale.
</p>

<a name="40607-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_528"></a>Some noble Lords may recall an estate agent called Roy Brooks who operated during the 1960s. He never used hyperbole in his particulars of sale, rather he was blunt to the point of extreme frankness. He would refer to &quot;this rundown dump which is in need of extensive renovation&quot;. He was a successful estate agent, but sadly no other estate agent&#151;a rather unimaginative lot, I think&#151;seems to be bold enough to follow that example.
</p>

<a name="40607-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_529"></a>The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, and the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, raised a number of serious issues. It is impossible to cover them all this evening, but I am very glad that they have raised these important matters. Certain questions have to be answered by the Government. In so far as the Government did not respond to them fully in the other place, they need to be answered here. Among them is the costs, not only the overall cost of the new scheme but also the cost of each transaction. Also to be detailed is the recruitment and qualification of the inspectors. I mention the question of indemnity and the legal rights people will have if a home condition report turns out to be inaccurate. Those are important issues which I believe can be answered, even bearing in mind the Minister&#039;s important statement about the intention that the scheme should come into effect not tomorrow, but in 2007. I think that Part 5 is a worthwhile part of this Bill.

<a name="40607-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_533"></a>During the proceedings on the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill, the noble Lord, Lord Best, talked in considerable detail about the reasons why the Government should not take a formulaic approach for community gain on major developments. He was right, because the circumstances of each development are dramatically different.
</p>

<a name="40607-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_534"></a>If one considers that the Minister&#039;s right honourable friend in another place, the Deputy Prime Minister, wants to land the south-east&#151;which is my particular part of the country&#151;with another 400,000 houses, and   if one then considers that this will be major new development, some of it on brownfield sites but all   resulting in immensely enhanced values, that development, negotiated properly through the Section 106 system, will produce 20 per cent, possibly 30 per cent, of social houses out of the total number of units provided. My Lords, 400,000 houses at 20 per cent is 80,000 social housing units; at 30 per cent, it is 120,000.
</p>

<a name="40607-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_535"></a>These things are achievable. This is a huge sum. If the Minister&#039;s right honourable friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has his way and we get from the Treasury the additional million houses that are being talked about, it would mean vast numbers of social housing units being constructed across the country.

</p>

<a name="40607-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_536"></a>The issue I want us to touch on, however, is how such properties are paid for. There is the idea that the developer pays for them. There is a sense in which he does, of course. He will almost certainly construct the properties and in that sense he will pay for them. The housing does not come from nowhere; it has to be paid for. It actually comes from the original landowners, who are party to this negotiation and want to see the benefits of the money that they are putting back in the community going into their communities and staying there.
</p>

<a name="40607-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_537"></a>There is a little fly in the ointment here. It is the right-to-buy scheme. The one thing that those landowners do not want to see is the social housing that they enable to be created subsequently going out of the social housing sphere, possibly within five years, at a discount. These are, if you like, their resources. It is their payment to their community. I would like to think that housing in that situation should at any rate have a 20-year exemption from the right to buy.
</p>

<a name="40607-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_538"></a>One could also argue that, where land is given up in small communities for social housing&#151;small plots of five or 10 acres to provide social housing in towns and villages across the country&#151;by landowners who are prepared to <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 115</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

accept a very low value for their property in order to provide the housing that is required by their community, it is again important that the right to buy does not come into play. I know that there are ways over this. It can be done by charitable housing associations; it can be done by such things as shared occupancy, and so on. It ought to be clearly understood from the start, however, that this is an issue where the right to buy should not apply, at any rate for a time.
</p>

<a name="40607-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_539"></a>This Bill gives an opportunity for a clause of that nature to be added, so that this matter can be taken care of. In my view, if this existed it would make it easier to negotiate Section 106 agreements. It is something which can be done in detail in Committee, and I do not need to take more of your Lordships&#039; time.

<p><a name="st_208"></a>
<a name="40607-30_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Wilkins: </b>   My Lords, I greatly welcome the introduction of this Housing Bill and the opportunity which it gives us to tackle some of the barriers which face disabled people in finding accessible and affordable homes. I declare an interest as a patron of HoDis&#151;the National Disabled Persons Housing Service&#151;and as a member of the Joint Committee on the draft Disability Discrimination Bill.

</p>

<a name="40607-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_540"></a>I also declare my interest as a wheelchair user. While there have been enormous changes in the opportunities available to disabled people in the 40 years since I became disabled, the housing sector is an area which has been left in the shadows. For physically impaired people the lay-out of our homes can either enable us to live full and independent lives or it can disable us completely, making us dependent on other people for the very basics of our existence&#151;washing, eating, sleeping and going to the loo.
</p>

<a name="40607-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_541"></a>But it is not only about our lives in our own homes. The ability to go into other people&#039;s homes, to visit our friends and family, is regarded almost as a luxury&#151;and yet that ability is essential if we are to be fully equal participants in society. I have come to accept that none of my family or non-disabled friends has a home that I can get into without help. This is not because they do not care or are unthinking but because accessible housing stock is not available. This means that I can only ever be on the receiving end of their good will. If they are sick, I cannot visit them or take them a meal; if they go away, I cannot feed the cat or water the garden; if I get my neighbours&#039; post by mistake, I cannot take it to them. It is all that give and take of life that makes relationships equal.
</p>

<a name="40607-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_542"></a>I hope that I can convince your Lordships that equality of access to housing is an issue of basic human rights which provides the foundation for independent living and all manner of social and economic opportunities. However, for many disabled people it is a right denied. The evidence is shocking. One-quarter of wheelchair users are virtual prisoners in their own homes because of poor access and location; thousands of disabled children are living in homes which blight <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_116"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 116</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

their life chances, restrict their social development and cause their parents acute stress, back injury and sometimes loss of employment.

</p>

<a name="40607-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_543"></a>Many, many barriers obstruct disabled people&#039;s access to appropriate housing and independence. I suggest that this Bill and the forthcoming Disability Discrimination Bill together offer a critical opportunity to remove many of these barriers and address the growing accessible homes crisis.
</p>

<a name="40607-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_544"></a>The Joint Committee on the draft Disability Discrimination Bill, of which I was a member along with my noble friend Lord Rix, received a large body of evidence asserting the need for a more proactive approach to meeting the housing needs of disabled people by local housing authorities, public housing associations and the providers they fund.
</p>

<a name="40607-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_545"></a>There has been widespread concern&#151;which the committee&#039;s report, published on 27 May, strongly echoes&#151;that the draft Disability Discrimination Bill does not go far enough towards securing the right to a decent home for disabled people. We therefore recommended that the full Bill should include specific provisions preventing landlords and management committees unreasonably refusing consent to disabled people who need to make physical changes to their properties, including communal areas, in order to enjoy fundamental rights of access. Some 18,000 disabled tenants living in unsuitable accommodation report that they have been prevented making essential alterations or adaptations because their landlord has refused consent. I hope that the Government will feel able to accept the recommendation.
</p>

<a name="40607-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_546"></a>But the committee went further, endorsing calls from the National Housing Federation and the British Council of Organisations for Disabled People that premises which have been appropriately adapted to accommodate disabled tenants should be put on an accessible housing register as a way of systematising the supply of suitable accommodation to a suitable group of people who would be in need of it. This proposal is strongly supported by HoDis, which has pioneered the development of such registers, and by many other organisations. The Housing Bill offers the perfect opportunity to take this forward.
</p>

<a name="40607-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_547"></a>Despite the acknowledged shortage of housing built or adapted to various accessibility standards, when a property becomes available landlords frequently have difficulty in identifying someone who needs it. Social landlords are under some pressure to let empty properties quickly. Consequently, if someone whose needs match the equipment or adaptations in the vacant property is not identified within a couple of weeks, it will be let to someone who does not need the adaptations. Even worse, the adaptations, which could have cost several thousands of pounds, may be removed. This is a calamitous waste of resources.

</p>

<a name="40607-30_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_548"></a>A statutory duty on housing authorities to maintain databases of accessible or adaptable properties and of disabled people in housing need, and to use these to provide an information and matching service, would have a plethora of benefits. The number of empty properties would be reduced, along with admissions to hospital and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_117"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 117</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

residential care. Unnecessary spending on adaptations would be avoided and disabled people would be in a position to choose suitable accommodation much more quickly. Local authorities which operate such a service have achieved quite staggering savings and are in a position more accurately to map and plan for current and future levels of need.
</p>

<a name="40607-30_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_549"></a>Given the appalling lack of accessible housing, we must surely grasp this opportunity to make the best use of the resources that we have. The introduction of housing registers is one simple and effective solution, but given the competing demands placed on housing authorities, that will not happen without legislation. The Housing Bill could and should mark the beginning of a concerted campaign to remove some of the barriers to decent housing for disabled people. I trust that this opportunity will not be missed.

<a name="40607-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord   Borrie, pointed out that buying a house is one of the most expensive purchases that one makes in one&#039;s life. I shall approach it from the other direction: death, divorce and moving house are the most stressful events in a person&#039;s life. Presumably, the Bill seeks to make life easier and more comfortable for all those concerned. It is on the principle, on Second Reading, and not on the devil in the detail, as the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, said, that I would like to speak.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_550"></a>I was very impressed by the Minister when he spoke in the housing debate initiated by my noble friend Lord Lucas. At the end of that debate, as I was sitting on the steps of the Throne and watching both sides, he   said with supreme confidence that he would cut through bureaucracy and build some 920,000 houses and please everybody. The next day, it was reported that the cost of houses had gone up.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_551"></a>I have declared an interest as a director of a construction company which builds houses. We do Section 106 and Section 52 agreements; we do urban regeneration schemes and we build on brownfield sites. I have been a rather unsuccessful landlord and I have been reluctantly involved in enfranchisement and leasehold reform. I have sat in your Lordships&#039; House over the years and asked why we could not have one simple Bill that made it easier for us all.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_552"></a>I have been amused during the past week. Since your Lordships&#039; House scrutinises and improves legislation, the briefs began to arrive during the Recess. They came by e-mail when my machine was down. It told me that the service was not available and there was a red cross on the screen. In the end, I found that paper is not sent any more. When you receive the briefs on your e-mail system, you try to print them out, but the printer will not connect and there is no one to help in the computer office. You cannot find any paper and Dixons is shut, so one cannot get the brief. Therefore, I rang the department up, but most of them were not there. One answered on his mobile from the Test match and told me the score. I then realised that input into Ministers is quite difficult. We have a government who are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_118"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 118</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

willing to do what they possibly can in the housing sector to make things easier, more secure and better for people, and to build more houses.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_553"></a>When we turn to social housing, I think back to the Leasehold Reform Act. We had Smiths charities, which we thought were charities trying to help people have cheap houses. I think that they originally built houses for widows of pirates. We found that they were concentrating only on the maximum value that they could extract from their portfolio, complaining that leasehold reform was unfair to them. A few weeks later, they sold their portfolio to the Wellcome Foundation for the largest amount that they could get. I ask myself where are the great philanthropists such as Thomas Salt, Peabody and others, who, instead of giving money to political parties, set out to do things within a community, to finance, build low-cost and own houses, as good, respectful landlords, knowing that people would respect them as well.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_554"></a>I do not like the term, &quot;social housing&quot;. It is accommodation. Our previous debate brought me round to the belief that in rural areas, where only 10   per cent of the population now live, we should build more houses, yet my own attitude had been that we should not build any more in the rural areas because we will destroy the countryside. If one flies around in a helicopter, one sees the most enormously bad patches of land in rural areas. One sees farmers longing for some house builder to apply for permission to build on their land without telling them so as not to upset the local environmental lobby. The house builder would come back and say, &quot;I say, sir. We&#039;ve got some good news for you. We can get you planning permission for your house. We&#039;ll do a joint venture on your land&quot;. The farmer will say, &quot;I didn&#039;t mean to do this. I&#039;m a farmer. I&#039;m part of the community&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_555"></a>The building of a good house and home&#151;they are not necessarily one and the same&#151;is one of the duties of government. I look at the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, wondering whether he can be a Harold Macmillan. Harold Macmillan said that he would build houses every year and that was the most important thing. At the moment, building houses at the right price&#151;at the right cost for people&#151;is the right thing. How do you do it?
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_556"></a>We are not necessarily going about it the right way. Forty or 50 per cent of the costs of a house is often the land. There must be a way whereby under Section 52, Section 106&#151;or whatever we may call it&#151;that land may be put into the pot and the end price reduced, not instantly but for a long period of time because there are no land costs.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_557"></a>If we look at house builders, and I consider my own lot, we have to go out and spend maybe &#163;40 million per year to buy a strategic land bank in order to be able to keep building houses. How much nicer if in some areas the Government would sit down, as they do, with house builders and say, &quot;With our plan there are areas where we think it would be right, where there is a good local community and a council that wishes to have things&quot;.

<a name="40607-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_558"></a>Although it may be the voluntary sector, I believe that there is a will in the country for people in the commercial world to work that one out. I repeat to the Minister that buy-to-let is a moral and acceptable notion. Throughout Europe people are better off putting their money and savings into houses that they can let that may be passed on to children, family or those at universities.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_559"></a>I wonder whether we might think of a radical policy whereby those in retirement who buy homes may not be taxed on the income from them; a TESSA for houses or something of that sort. Ultimately, whichever way we look at it, we are talking about money. I could repeat the words of my noble friend Lord MacGregor and point out that there are not enough surveyors or people in the land who could undertake the work proposed in the Bill; and more than that, there is not enough insurance capacity in PI   insurance to permit that to happen.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_560"></a>Some of your Lordships may have had to help people who have had a survey that went wrong, with dry rot, deathwatch beetle, cockroaches and everything in the book. They turn to the surveyor on whom they spent &#163;1,000, and he says, &quot;It&#039;s not my fault&quot;, he disappears into the sunset, his professional indemnity insurance takes over and we hear no more about it.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_561"></a>I wish the Minister well because I believe that his heart is in the right place. The Bill may be over-bureaucratic, but during its progress let your Lordships make it work for once rather than all the previous legislation that has ended up half finished.

<a name="40607-31_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </b>   My Lords, I want to speak on Part 5 on the home information pack, in common with many of your Lordships. As the last on the list of the Bank Benchers after the 10 o&#039;clock watershed, which I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, for taking me safely past, I am glad that I am going to talk about something on which no noble Lord has touched on so far.

</p>

<a name="40607-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_562"></a>I should declare some interests, first, as chief executive of the Environment Agency, but also&#151;strangely enough&#151;as an honorary fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Those organisations are not of one mind on the issue, so I am probably free from the prejudices of either.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_563"></a>I commend the home information pack provisions in the Bill in principle. I believe that they can make a contribution to simplifying and speeding up the selling and buying process. More particularly, I want to consider two other important reasons for the home information pack being worthwhile pursuing and for a systematic examination of the details with a view to making it a practical possibility rather than thinking up every reason in the book for it not happening, as the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, did.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_564"></a>The home information pack and especially the home condition report are an opportunity for homebuyers to benefit from knowing about a range of material issues associated with the environment and the property in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_120"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 120</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which they are interested. The pack will have to contain information on energy efficiency. That has benefits for prospective purchasers in terms of the size of future utility bills but also for the impact that they will be making on climate change, the greatest environmental threat facing us all.

</p>

<a name="40607-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_565"></a>About one-third of total carbon dioxide emissions are associated with energy use and domestic energy use is one of the sectors that continues to rise. Homebuyers should also be enabled through the home improvement pack to know about other environmental issues associated with the property that they plan to buy; for example, it is vital that they understand their flood risk status. They need to understand what the flood risk to that property is, what can be done to alleviate it and what impact it will have on the insurance costs for the property.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_566"></a>Alongside the Bill, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is consulting on the content of the home information pack, which will be subject to secondary legislation. I encourage the Minister to include all the environmental data in it as material for a house purchaser; otherwise we are really asking house buyers to buy an environmental pig in a poke.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_567"></a>The pack is one of the few opportunities to influence the resource efficiency of existing housing stock. Very   simple steps may be taken to improve the environmental performance of homes, often at a very low cost. That is particularly true of water efficiency. Some parts of the south and east of England already have less water available per head of population than countries which noble Lords would regard as arid, such as the Sudan. There are big increases in house building proposed for those parts of the country, which will put even more pressure on water resources. We must make the housing stock more water efficient.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_568"></a>The Sustainable Buildings Task Force reported recently to ODPM and showed how water savings of up to 26 per cent can be achieved by installing more water-efficient fittings and appliances. Where water meters are installed, saving water also reduces bills by as much as 10 to 20 per cent. The information in the home information pack on the water efficiency status of a property should encourage householders to see water efficiency as an important issue and to take steps to increase the saleability of property by water efficiency measures, thereby reducing the impact on the environment and on their bills.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_569"></a>The home condition report could be an opportunity for water companies to promote water metering at change of occupancy, without the knee-jerk reaction that they fear at the moment&#151;unwisely, I sometimes think. That would mean that there could be savings for householders and for the water environment as greater water meter penetration happened automatically at change of hands.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_570"></a>There are opportunities for the future. It would be impossible in the near future for there to be a reliable eco-labelling system for existing housing stock, showing its environmental efficiency overall. However, work is going on with the Building Research Establishment&#039;s eco-homes standard, which could <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_121"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 121</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

make that a possibility in future. Will the Minister reassure me that the terms of the home information pack are drawn in such a way that there is an opportunity to include eco-labelling, or some sort of environmental kite-marking scheme in future?
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_571"></a>Buying a home is often one of the most financially important decisions that people make; it is also one of the most environmentally important decisions, determining some of the biggest environmental impacts that we make as individuals throughout our lives. The home improvement pack can help home buyers to reduce bills, can reduce their environmental risk and can protect the environment.
</p>

<a name="40607-31_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_572"></a>As the Minister said&#151;and certainly with respect to Part 5&#151;this is a good Bill with a lot of good things in it. I hope that I can encourage the Government to include even more good things, in the Bill itself and in the secondary legislation.

<a name="40607-32_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   My Lords, anyone who has gone door to door over the past few weeks, taking our party&#039;s wares around like some modern version of the travelling salesman, will have been reminded how varied is our housing stock and how varied is its condition. One cannot tell everything from observing the front of a house, although I have noted over many years that there is a preponderance of Conservative voters among those whose gates are shut. I challenge noble Lords to deny that!
</p>

<a name="40607-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_573"></a>Anyone who has managed to find a voter at home will have found, too, that the supply of housing is often very high on that individual&#039;s list of concerns. People who deliver leaflets often find that slips of paper from decorators and pizza companies have got there just before them. I have never actually seen a note from one of those who encourages a tenant to exercise a right to buy and then buys the house from the new owner&#151;but that is one of the abuses which I very much welcome being tackled in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40607-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_574"></a>One evening last week, I was asked by a carer, who was just leaving, not to disturb Mrs &quot;So and So&quot; because she had just been settled for the night. The house, which was divided into several units, had a disabled parking bay outside and a chairlift on the long flight of steps up to the front door. It looked to me like a very good example of the services working together to keep someone in her own home, making the best use of existing stock. The Disability Rights Commission has given us many ideas as to how the Bill can be tweaked to deal with the interests and, indeed, rights of disabled people, as the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, have reminded us.

</p>

<a name="40607-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_575"></a>Now that we have the Government&#039;s announcements about the tenancy deposit scheme and the empty homes management arrangements, I am happy that noble Lords from these Benches can be on the welcoming side of the line regarding the Bill. It will be our stamina, not programme motions or knives, that will determine the effectiveness of our scrutiny of it. Because so much of the Bill is welcome in principle, we are bound to spend quite a lot of time looking at the detail. Reading the Bill, it <br>&nbsp;<br>

struck me that definitions will be very important, as will the balance between primary legislation and what the Secretary of State can determine or change through regulations and orders.
</p>

<a name="40607-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_576"></a>I must say that I am finding it a little difficult to work out what has already been published in draft, a matter to which my noble friend has referred, but we can come back to the detail later. If the ODPM could produce a flowchart of what is an HMO within the legislation, it would be helpful. If it cannot produce a chart showing what falls within which bits of the Bill, that would prove the point of how difficult it might be for those affected by the Bill and those operating its provisions.
</p>

<a name="40607-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_577"></a>If the Bill is about protecting tenants&#151;and it must be&#151;then the number of storeys is not as relevant to the hazard as is being presented. Whether, at any given time, there are four or five occupants is another matter that we will have to look at. How long should one have to live with a hazard? These are points, among others, that the Local Government Association has raised. I   have been surprised that it has not also said that local authorities will need the resources to operate the Bill. I hope that that means that it has had all the right reassurances from Government but it would do no harm for them to be repeated in this House at some point.

</p>

<a name="40607-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_578"></a>Should scoring against ratings determine a judgment as to whether there is a hazard or rather inform that judgment based on qualitative assessment? Hope triumphed, as it often does, over experience and I was surprised when I found that the details of hazards are to be prescribed.
</p>

<a name="40607-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_579"></a>As to licensing, we have heard from the Council of Mortgage Lenders that it is concerned that investors should not be deterred or the buy-to-let market damaged. I am sure that they do not mean by that that bad landlords should be able to let unfit, in the broadest sense, accommodation. Like the noble Lord, Lord Best, having supported encouraging investment in housing, I am beginning to be concerned that it is pushing up prices and making things particularly difficult for first time buyers. I take the point of the CML about the complications of the proposal and the difficulties envisaged if different schemes operate in different areas.
</p>

<a name="40607-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_580"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, mentioned the position of parents of students who buy a property for the student and let rooms to other students. Perhaps, to put fears at rest, the Minister can tell the House the estimated cost of licensing for a good landlord. On the question of students, I have been far from convinced by the Government&#039;s arguments about excepting student accommodation. In a world of PPPs and PFIs, I do not think that one can rely on saying that universities are responsible public organisations; I do not deny that, but I do not think that it is relevant to this issue.

</p>

<a name="40607-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_581"></a>On reading the Bill, I found a number of matters not easy to understand. I look forward to exploring how the Bill interrelates with provisions elsewhere about antisocial behaviour. I hope that the Government can <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_123"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 123</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

convince us that this is not another example of a nanny government knowing best, and also convince us that licensing in designated areas will improve conditions and not confirm that area as undesirable, consolidating its reputation in a vicious spiral.
</p>

<a name="40607-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_582"></a>One of my first thoughts about the Bill was that the level of penalties against landlords in breach was pretty low for them to be an adequate deterrent. I then found, though, that the Secretary of State can uprate the level of fines for some offences if he considers that there has been a change in the value of money. I thought that that was a function of standard scales. I hope to explore just how all this will operate and whether the fines will be an adequate deterrent. Mind you, I then went on to read that the Secretary of State can confer jurisdiction by order on the residential property tribunal. So anything seems possible, I suppose.
</p>

<a name="40607-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_583"></a>On both the rent deposit schemes and empty homes management, we will have to see the detail, although my guess is that there will be heavy reliance on regulations, which is where the devils mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, may be. However, perhaps the Minister can tell the House tonight what consultation there will be on the detail of both of those matters.
</p>

<a name="40607-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_584"></a>One issue that has been raised but on which the Government have barely moved is the protection of houseboat owners and occupiers, to which both the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and my noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer have referred. I say &quot;barely&quot; because until recently there was no movement at all. Indeed, I have seen a letter from an official at the ODPM to a houseboat owner that was almost entirely about park homes. And then the official said at the end,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a>&quot;unfortunately the issues of harassment&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_585"></a>of houseboat owners&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;seem similar to that of park home owners, but there are important differences between the two tenure types . . .  I am unclear of the extent and nature of the problems with houseboats and whether statutory intervention would be justified is not clear. I hope this information is helpful to you in setting out the bill&#039;s provisions in relation to park homes&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_586"></a>I think the answer to the last sentence is, &quot;No, not very&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40607-32_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_587"></a>However, there is now a glimmer of light. In a more recent letter, Keith Hill wrote:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a>&quot;I am in no doubt that the plight of houseboat owners is no less important than those of mobile homes. Officials in Defra are looking into ways these problems can best be addressed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-32_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_588"></a>So I say to the Minister, can Defra and the ODPM please join up and find it in their hearts&#151;and if necessary by changing the Long Title of the Bill&#151;to &quot;spatchcock&quot;, to use the term used by the noble Lord, Lord Graham, the protection that the Bill extends to park home owners to houseboat owners and occupiers so that we do not have to hear tales of uncontrolled service charges levied by the licensors of moorings, charging for 25 years in advance, cutting off water and electricity in order to move a houseboat owner on, and so on?

</p>

<a name="40607-32_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_589"></a>As so often, there is far more in the Bill than one can hope to address at this stage, although the array of expertise available to the House and contributing to tonight&#039;s debate has meant that we have given it a pretty good airing. But for my final remarks I should declare an interest. I am still a practising solicitor&#151;although I have to say as regards conveyancing matters that &quot;practising&quot; is probably still the right term. But my real interest is in achieving the best for the consumer&#151;for both the buyer and the seller, not for the professional. So I take seriously the support of the Consumers&#039; Association. I take very seriously, too, its campaign to regulate estate agents, who are too often not clear who is their client.
</p>

<a name="40607-32_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_590"></a>Returning to the issue of home information packs, I take seriously, too, the concerns of the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Law Society, which the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, used to such great forensic effect. If the packs are to be useful and if they are to include a home condition report, that report must be acceptable to lenders for mortgage purposes.

</p>

<a name="40607-32_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_591"></a>At the time of the Homes Bill three years ago, I recall being very surprised to find that only about 30 per cent of purchasers arranged their own surveys. I suspect that part of the reason for that is their cost. By imposing that new requirement on sellers, very many of whom are also buyers, the Government will make things more difficult and more expensive. The Government are talking up a solution that is not a solution to the real problems of the time and complexity of assembling a chain of vendors and purchasers. My observations do not lead me to the   same conclusions as those of the noble Lord, Lord   Borrie.
</p>

<a name="40607-32_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_592"></a>I attach less importance to the packs than some but, if we are to have them, let us sort out their validity, their contents&#151;the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Young, were very useful on that&#151;their format, and questions of liability insurance and inspection. I am with those who want to make them voluntary. If they are as useful as is claimed, they will catch on very fast. We will have an interesting time at further stages of the Bill&#039;s passage.

<p><a name="st_212"></a>
<a name="40607-33_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   My Lords, it has been an interesting and constructive debate on an extremely important issue. There have been many valuable contributions from all parts of the House, and I shall endeavour not to detain the House too long at this stage of the evening.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_593"></a>The need for secure housing is one of the most crucial issues facing today&#039;s society. It is a basic right that those holding a position of influence&#151;like us&#151;must acknowledge and respect, and that those disadvantaged and alienated must expect. Housing has a fundamental impact on an individual&#039;s life chances. Put simply, without a stable home environment, both education and health opportunities are likely to suffer. Equally, employment prospects will be seriously affected. For people caught in the cycle of despair, access to housing is crucial in attempting to break free from its shackles. I have said that because I wanted to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_125"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 125</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

echo the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, and the noble Lord, Lord Rix. We very much support them on the issue of disabilities.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_594"></a>I fear that the Government have missed a valuable opportunity to bring about a real change and improvement to the housing sector. What could have been a progressive and forward-looking Bill is still rather undistinguished. What could have been a clear and insightful Bill is somewhat muddled and confused. Furthermore, the Bill introduces unwelcome elements that will do nothing to ease the current problems in the housing market. Indeed, the Government have taken the opportunity to load even more bureaucracy and burdens on almost everyone involved in housing, from the private individual who merely wants to sell their house, to the good landlord who will have to cope with additional form-filling.

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_595"></a>Paradoxically, there are also significant elements missing from the Bill. There is no mention, for example, of rural housing&#151;several noble Lords mentioned that, particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer&#151;and the particular problems of affordability in rural areas. We all know of those difficult issues. There is also nothing on the problems experienced in national parks, and nor is the issue of empty homes adequately dealt with anywhere in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_596"></a>I would like to turn in detail to some of the key issues in the Bill. The plan for mandatory home information packs is an unnecessary and ill thought-out measure, merely acting as a burden and additional stealth tax on the individual. It will do nothing to speed up the house-buying process. It has received criticism from all quarters except one or two noble Lords tonight. Although the issue of sellers&#039; packs has received the most attention, it is by no way the only contentious issue in the Bill. I must stress that in case the Minister thought that he would get off lightly in the scrutiny of the rest of the Bill.

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_597"></a>If the Government feel that transactions will be quicker and more user-friendly, with reduced gazumping and benefits to the consumer, we would like to hear more about that. However, we feel that the packs will do nothing to speed up property transactions, as purchasers will still more than likely wish to commission their own surveys, hence the proposals will simply duplicate the number of surveys undertaken, adding to the cost of selling one&#039;s home.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_598"></a>As my noble friends Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market and Lord Caithness have so adequately covered all the problems with that part of the Bill, and as we shall follow up much of what they said through amendments and scrutiny of the Bill, I need not say much more about that tonight, except that comparisons with Denmark and Australia are irrelevant as their processes and, especially, their volumes are nothing like those in England.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_599"></a>Furthermore, I am especially worried about the problems of the elderly. Much of our correspondence has come from elderly people. The introduction of such complex, expensive legislation with potential <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_126"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 126</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

legal problems has concerned many elderly and other disadvantaged people who could be dissuaded from moving until an absolute crisis point has been reached. Again, the issue was most adequately raised by my noble friend Lord MacGregor, who referred to those who sell a house but do not buy another one&#151;such as many elderly people. Those issues need to be scrutinised and queried as we examine the Bill.

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_600"></a>The Bill also seems to attack the principle of the right to buy by introducing restrictions in what the Government deem to be high-demand and rural areas.   We have doubts about the Government&#039;s real commitment to the scheme, but we are of course willing to consider and support any measures that stop naked abuse of it. We want an assurance that those restrictions are in no way likely to have a negative impact on people&#039;s ability to acquire property of their own.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_601"></a>The right to buy has allowed ordinary people who   would otherwise not have been able to do so the opportunity to own their own home. Perhaps the Minister would like to tell us what assessment has been made of the restrictions that have been introduced during the past year about the number of people taking part in the right-to-buy scheme. My noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith raised an issue that we shall pursue further in Committee concerning the right-to-buy scheme and private developers. We will consider that further.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_602"></a>The licensing scheme for houses in multiple occupation is also an important part of the Bill. Although we must be mindful of the balance between regulation and the proper protection of vulnerable citizens, we are concerned about the intrusion of officialdom into private residences, together with the resulting red tape and bureaucracy. We support the intent to bring a degree of order where genuine abuses are occurring. However, a balance must be struck that does not act as a disincentive to those who want to provide much-needed accommodation for rent, as several noble Lords have mentioned tonight. Also, would such a licensing scheme cover those in greatest need?
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_603"></a>The Bill would also allow local authorities to take and rent out property left empty. We have grave and substantial concerns about that aspect of the Bill, which gives rise to serious issues about the intervention of the state into the affairs of the individual. We will argue that hasty action by councils could cause distress where there is good reason for a property to remain empty temporarily, such as a family bereavement. We want to explore those issues further in Committee.

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_604"></a>On the additional provisions on park homes, surely, as my noble friend Lady Hanham and others mentioned, it   would seem sensible to include houseboat owners. Houseboat owners own their boats but not the mooring to which the boat is attached. The owners enjoy no rights <i>vis &#224; vis</i> the licensed moorings manager. Surely the Minister will agree that they are in a similar position to owners of park homes and should be included in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_605"></a>The Bill will give public money to the private sector for the construction of social housing. Does the Minister agree that such a step is being adopted merely to speed up the delivery of many more homes and an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_127"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 127</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

unwanted housebuilding programme in some parts of the country, including mine? Furthermore, questions need to be answered about the percentage split of social housing grant between the registered social landlords, local authorities and the private sector. What would happen were a private company using public cash to go bankrupt?

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_606"></a>Finally, I touch on the issue of fitness standards and the introduction of new housing health and safety rating systems. Although we can support the intent of such measures, I wonder about the cost of implementation for local authorities. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, there have been no guarantees about where that money might come from. Reports have suggested a figure of around &#163;5 million. Perhaps the Minister could assure us that they have sufficient financial resources and capacity to cope with such new responsibilities. We all know, and it has been said many times, that local authorities are given responsibilities without any cash. This is an opportunity to explore that issue.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_607"></a>This is a wide-ranging Bill covering many extremely important issues. We have major concerns, and we hope to improve on the Bill as it stands. As I said at the outset, it is a very important Bill. The Government&#039;s legislation is now under scrutiny and will go into Committee, when I look forward to working with my noble friend Lady Hanham.
<a name="time_38"></a>
<a name="40607-33_time0"></a><h5></h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_213"></a>
<a name="40607-33_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, this has been an excellent debate. Like my noble friend Lord Rooker, I think that this is one of the most interesting Bills that I have had the pleasure of spending time looking at and preparing for. From the wide-ranging comments made during what was a long debate given how late we started, I can tell that we will have fascinating debates in Committee, on Report and at Third Reading as we go through the detail of the legislation.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_608"></a>It was interesting to note the areas where there was consensus, where there was disagreement and where most of the disagreement was focused. It does not take a brain surgeon to work out that we ran into most criticism on the part dealing with home information packs. From what has been said, I can predict that we will spend a lot of time on that in Committee. That is fair enough. Having listened to the intensity and the detail of the questions on the matter, my noble friend Lord Rooker and I will deal with those as extensively as we can later, in the amending process. However, I will pick up some of the points raised during the debate.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_609"></a>The Bill is extensive; it covers a wide range of subjects relating to housing and the housing market. As such, it is part of a comprehensive action plan to create sustainable communities. We have set out our plans very clearly on several occasions. We have backed that with a marked increase in resources&#151;some &#163;22 billion. I think that I can fairly argue that there has been a positive step-change on the part of government in tackling the many different housing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_128"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 128</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

problems, north and south, that this country faces. The Bill is a part of that action plan to create sustainable communities and to raise housing standards.

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_610"></a>I want to begin with Part 1, which surprisingly attracted least interest and commentary. However, I pay credit to our colleagues on the Liberal Democrat Benches, as the noble Baronesses, Lady Hamwee and Lady Maddock, made important references to Part 1, and I shall come to their points. Unlike some of his Conservative colleagues, the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, also raised issues of concern; in particular, that relating to the cost of implementation for local authorities.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_611"></a>The current housing fitness standard dates back over 80 years, and there is agreement that it needs to   be replaced. Tackling health and safety issues in housing is an approach that looks at the impact of the property on the individual as well as at the state of the house itself. The Bill paves the way for that approach with a rating system. This will help local authorities to prioritise activity and to target properties where there are health and safety hazards, and where risks to residents are greatest&#151;that is its value. It will put those health and safety considerations at the front of the Government&#039;s drive to improve housing.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_612"></a>During the course of extensive scrutiny of the Bill, we have tried to pick up on many of the issues raised on that matter. One of the criticisms was that local authorities would not be able to take action to prevent houses falling into disrepair in future. We argue actually that local authorities will be able to take effective enforcement action where disrepair presents a risk to the health and safety of occupants. Of course, that will be a matter for local authority priorities. The housing health and safety rating system will become a useful evidence-based tool to tackle that range of problems.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_613"></a>From memory, it was the noble Baroness, Lady   Hamwee, who raised the issue of consultation on this section of the Bill. An unfinalised draft of version 2 of the technical guidance has been published by the ODPM and was posted on its website towards the end of last year. Research on version 1 of this guidance identified some practical difficulties. The comments made have helped us in the development of version 2. We will continue to consult on this, as we have already consulted on the enforcement guidance earlier this year. We are still considering responses to that, and we will be providing guidance for landlords before implementation.

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_614"></a>I remind the House why we are introducing licensing regimes. A vigorous and responsive private sector is an important part of developing sustainable communities, and it offers flexibility of tenure to a wide group of people, and a real and genuine alternative to owner-occupation and social renting. As my noble friend Lord   Rooker said, the majority of private landlords in this sector are decent and responsible people. Licensing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_129"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 129</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is important because it enables us to target and to improve the private rental sector and better promote its image. Good landlords will benefit from this scheme. They will not be tarred with the same brush as the bad landlords.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_615"></a>The licensing of houses in multiple occupation is an important part of our approach, and it has been welcomed notably by the Liberal Democrat Benches. Licensing will enable us to concentrate on management problems and the poor physical stock condition of many houses in multiple occupation. I do not think that anyone would pretend that this is a sector that can be left. Our aim is to use licensing to tackle poor management, and to identify properties where poor physical conditions will be targeted under   the rating system. As the noble Baroness, Lady   Hamwee, said, definitions will be important, and questions of definitions will no doubt come up in debates on that part of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_616"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Hamwee and Lady   Maddock, raised questions as to the extension of the licensing scheme to cover student accommodation. That was based on some experience that the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, had as a ward councillor. I recognise the issue, as it is one that affected residents in my city. Obviously, a range of measures can be used to tackle such problems, and the housing health and safety rating system, which will be used by local authorities, will be able to attack many of them. Licensing will tackle the worst problems, but in our estimation we need to get the balance right between protecting tenants and unnecessary over-regulation.

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_617"></a>I want to spend a little time on home information packs, because that was a large part of the debate this   evening. We had welcomes from the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, and concerned criticism from the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, the noble Lords, Lord MacGregor and Lord Hanningfield, and the noble Baroness, Lady   Hanham. I can best summarise their criticisms as saying that it would be better if we did not have this, but if we have to have it, it should be voluntary. The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, said that it was a good idea in principle, but perhaps not in practice. I understand the import of the questions that were asked. We have given a long time-frame for the introduction of this part of the legislation. I look forward to more extensive debates on the questions of detail that were properly raised this evening.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_618"></a>I recognise that there will be concerns about the practical implementation of the home information packs. I want to correct one profoundly wrong impression that was given in some comments this evening; that there is not support for this out there in the market and among consumers. Clearly, consumers welcome this. The trials that have been conducted, particularly in Bristol, showed that there is widespread and extensive support among consumers, and that people thought that it was a valuable and vital change to make.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_130"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 130</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-33_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_619"></a>As to the market itself, and those who are in the business of property transaction, there is support from   the Halifax Building Society and from TEAM Conveyancing, one of the largest groupings of independent estate agency firms. We have also had support for the scheme from the director of Legal Marketing Services, Andrew Knee. He was supportive of the HIP proposals, and he looked forward to the opportunities they represent. He made the point that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a>&quot;we feel it is important that the industry receives further clarification regarding the timing and implementation of HIPs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-33_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_620"></a>We all accept that, and we recognise that it is an important point.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_621"></a>Noble Lords questioned the cost and its impact. We do not accept those arguments. Some of the costs identified as being additional that have been criticised are actually costs that exist at the moment and will be defrayed by the implementation of the scheme.

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_622"></a>It is important to look at the experience elsewhere. The Danish experience and that in New South Wales give us encouragement. In the end, the home information packs will be widely welcomed by consumers. The cost implications are likely to be neutral, and there will be a benefit to those who receive the packs in terms of the way in which transactions are conducted. The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, made the point that market forces are important in this regard, and my guess is that they will dictate how costs will be met. I look forward to listening to more of the detailed comments that will come forward on this in Committee, because I recognise the importance of the issue.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_623"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Young, raised the issue of water efficiency. I can, I think, reassure her and say that flood risk information is one of the items that will be considered for inclusion in the home information pack as part of the standard search agreements.

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_624"></a>I shall move on to some of the other measures in the Bill, because they are important. There was extensive discussion of the changes we are intending to introduce to the right-to-buy provisions. We all recognise the important part that right-to-buy has played over the past two decades, and the Government remain totally committed to the principle of right to buy. This scheme has helped many thousands of ordinary families to realise their aspirations to own their own homes, and it   has helped to create stable and mixed-tenure communities. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, was concerned about the impact of the first range of changes that we made. I do not have that information here, but I am more than happy to write to him on that issue. We should move forward with the maximum knowledge and information about the impact of changes. The noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, supported the changes that we were making. My noble friend Lord Graham of Edmonton was also supportive, because of his concern about the impact of what he described as scams and abuses that needed to be tackled.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_625"></a>We are trying to mitigate some of the adverse impact of the way in which the current right-to-buy scheme works and its impact on the availability of affordable housing in some areas. It is for that reason that we wish to close off some of the exploitation of the current rules <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_131"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column 131</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to curb profiteering and tackle exploitation. My noble friend Lady Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde said that we should consider going further to curb some of the more adverse effects of right-to-buy. Of course, if it is right for us to make such changes, we will, but they must be targeted and proportionate. That, I think, is the plea that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, made.

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_626"></a>Some concern was expressed about the grants by housing corporations to non-registered social landlords. It is an important part of the Bill. Demand for affordable housing is outstripping supply, causing prices to rise, and we want to use grants to ensure that we increase the provision of affordable housing. In the past, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has given detailed information on that. No doubt, we will have to look at it more closely in order to assure colleagues and those who are concerned about the impact of those provisions, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord   Best, and the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_627"></a>We want to ensure that we have value for money. The new approach is designed to ensure that more affordable housing is made available to those who need it while securing maximum value for money for our housing programme. We will work closely with the Housing Corporation to ensure that appropriate checks and balances are included in the appraisal procedure so that the respective merits or bids for grants from registered social landlords and their new private sector competitors can be accurately assessed by the Housing Corporation. That will consider not only the upfront costs of each bid but also the long-term sustainability of the products on offer.

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_628"></a>A number of noble Lords referred to park homes. We should congratulate my noble friend Lord Rowlands on his part in keeping that issue at the forefront of people&#039;s thinking, as well as the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, for her long campaigning on that issue. Your Lordships will be aware that the measures in the Bill are designed to afford protection, which is the overall thrust of what we are trying to achieve. Quite rightly, a question was asked about houseboat owners. I can give an assurance that those who occupy houseboats will be covered and will have an equivalent protection. I hope that that satisfies that particular concern, which was raised by a number of noble Lords.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_629"></a>The issue of overcrowding was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Dean. We have included a provision that would allow Ministers to repeal existing standards and to empower, but not require, Ministers to set out overcrowding standards by secondary legislation. I can give an assurance that the Government will provide sufficient time and flexibility to consult widely and to consider carefully the way in which any changes to the standards should be made. We intend to use the consultation period to invite views on the role of national standards and the extent to which local authorities should have discretion to set their own local standards. We expect that consultation to take place during the summer.

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_630"></a>We gave an assurance that we would bring forward measures on tenancy deposit protection. The precise detail of that package is being worked out at present. Our intention is to legislate for the approval of schemes that will safeguard tenancy deposits. I am grateful for the support that we have had for that measure from the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, and the noble Lord, Lord Best, who rightly described the exploitation that takes place in some areas and, in particular, his experience based in Brent.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_631"></a>We attracted some criticism from the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, for our empty homes strategy. In his opening remarks, he suggested that we were setting about dealing with the problem in a completely wrongheaded way and that our measures would not be very effective. We have to start somewhere. We think that we are right to bring forward a scheme, which will be based, I have little doubt, on the best practice that many local authorities have already established in that sector. The noble Lord probably knows more about that than I do. Certainly, the leaseback schemes that I was familiar with as the leader of a local authority in the early 1990s were very effective. Of course, we will consult very carefully on that.

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_632"></a>Our intention is that local authorities will be able to make management orders on empty homes that are similar to provisions already set out in Part 4. We intend to make modifications to the Bill. Of course, we will table amendments in due course. That will provide us with the opportunity to have discussions in Committee. No doubt, we shall want to explore some of those issues in some detail with the Local Government Association and those interested in housing issues in particular.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_633"></a>Before I sit down, I should like to turn to accessible housing and the plea made quite rightly by my noble friend Lady Wilkins and the noble Lord, Lord Rix, for careful measures in that field. We recognise the importance of that range of issues. The plea for equality of access was one which I am sure all members of your Lordships&#039; House would wish to share. I look forward to the debate when amendments will be tabled for us to consider. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, argued perfectly properly for an opportunity for this measure to be given fair consideration.

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_634"></a>We do not at present favour the creation of a registration scheme because it will place a disproportionate burden on local authorities. Some local authorities already exercise such a register to deal with the range of subjects which the noble Baroness outlined in her comments.
</p>

<a name="40607-33_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_635"></a>In introducing this debate, the noble Lord, Lord   Rooker, set out how the Government are delivering their sustainable communities&#039; programme and the important part that housing plays in that. We have backed that with considerable additional resources and have put increased resources into all areas of housing, not least rural housing, which was raised by a number of noble Lords this evening, in particular by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. We have trebled the amount of money that we put into that sector. We intend to continue to invest in rural <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_133"></a>

housing and ensure that we provide housing through the social landlord route.

</p>

<a name="40607-33_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_636"></a>We are now tackling low demand and transforming failing housing markets through nine Pathfinder projects backed with &#163;500 million worth of market renewal funding. We are accelerating our new building programme where it is most needed. We are developing four growth areas in London and the wider south-east, which have the potential to deliver an extra 200,000 homes and over 300,000 jobs over the next 10   to 15   years. These are significant measures. This Bill will complement those measures.

</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40607-34_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon </b>   moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 2, line 44, at end insert &quot;and in the light of data supplied by the union in its application to the CAC which data must also be simultaneously transmitted to the employer&quot; </p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>The noble Baroness said: In speaking to Amendment No. 1, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 2, 9, 10, 32, 33 and 36. Amendment No. 1 is purely technical. It would facilitate the recognition process and enable the employer to comply with its obligations under the Act. Clause 3(2) requires the employer to supply the Central Arbitration Committee in a very short time&#151;five working days&#151;with details of the number of employees in various categories in various workplaces. However, some of those data will also have been supplied to the CAC by the union. The amendment would simply ensure that the data supplied by both sides matched.
</p>

<a name="40607-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>The data supplied by the union to the CAC in support of its claim for recognition and the definition of a bargaining unit are not confidential. The union should be prepared to see that it and the employer are both talking about the same thing. The amendment would ensure that there was no delay while a possible dispute about the catchment area of the claim was resolved.
</p>

<a name="40607-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>Amendments Nos. 2, 9, 10, 32, 33 and 36 all relate to the same issue&#151;namely, information that might be required by the CAC which might be regarded as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC2"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

confidential either by the employer or, as is possibly more likely, by the employee or employees whose personal details the union is seeking to acquire.
</p>

<a name="40607-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>Amendments Nos. 2, 9 and 33 are in identical terms. They would entitle the employer to withhold any information from the CAC&#151;and, hence, from the union seeking recognition&#151;which either the employer deemed to be commercially confidential or which might affect the security of the company or its employees. It is, I agree, less theoretically possible that information required in the course of the recognition procedures will be significantly commercially confidential. Nevertheless, that possibility exists. It is rather difficult to come up with an example because, like an elephant, it is impossible to describe, but you certainly recognise one when it comes in front of you.
</p>

<a name="40607-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>Every business is different and has different concerns and different interests. In the case of one business, the number of employees that it has or their locations in the different branches of the concern are matters that the employer, for sound reasons&#151;I stress, for sound reasons&#151;may wish to keep secret from his competitors. If there is a valid reason for doing so, there is no reason why the employer should be forced to disclose the information for the furtherance of the union&#039;s recognition campaign. I cannot accept that the matter would be covered by some implied duty of confidentiality on the part of the union.
</p>

<a name="40607-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>I certainly do not seek to impugn the integrity of any union in any way whatever. But, of course, unions, like everything else, are staffed by ordinary, fallible human beings, and an indiscreet piece of gossip, with no malicious intent at all, could do the damage that the employer was seeking to avoid with no adequate redress. However, of more serious concern is the situation of the employee whose details the union wants to obtain in order to contact him or her.
</p>

<a name="40607-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>In Standing Committee in the other place my honourable friend the Member for Huntingdon drew attention to the plight of some of his constituents who were employed by Huntingdon Life Sciences and who were subject to campaigns of vilification, intimidation and attacks on their homes and property, such as their cars, and physical assault by gangs of what one could only describe from their behaviour as a kind of terrorism. Not only that, but in one instance their families were similarly intimidated as well as the suppliers of goods and services to the company.
</p>

<a name="40607-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>Members of the Committee will recall the campaign against the export of live cattle and sheep&#151;a perfectly legitimate, even reasonable, campaign, but carried to excess by the intimidation of individuals. One can envisage similar forms of violent protest against individuals in support of other campaigns exceeding the normal rights of free speech and the legitimate rights and forms of protest. I shall certainly not catalogue them here, for fear of putting ideas into some heads, but, doubtless, your Lordships could compile your own lists. But that sort of personal violence in support of one cause or another is nothing new, especially when the protagonists feel that they are driven to desperation.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC3"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC3</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>I should like to draw Members&#039; attention to the fact that the companies registry now permits companies in cases that the registrar accepts as appropriate to withhold the personal details of directors or shareholders from the public register. That provision was expressly established with the case of Huntingdon Life Sciences in mind. However, the point is that if the shareholders and directors in any appropriate case are allowed to keep their personal details secret, why should the workers not be allowed the same right and privilege? I would have thought that that was the sentiment with which the unions would have agreed and accepted without hesitation.
</p>

<a name="40607-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>The Minister in the other place did not dispute the point made by my honourable friends in support of a similar amendment to this. However, the honourable Member for Gordon, went on to say,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;if the honourable gentlemen have a legitimate concern, the amendment needs to be more tightly drafted&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee D, 3/3/04; col. 21.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Well, my honourable friends and I&#151;and, indeed some employers in sensitive fields&#151;do have a legitimate concern and the Minister will, I am sure, be pleased to note that the amendment has been more tightly drafted to overcome the objection regarding who should decide whether the information is, in fact, commercially confidential or whether workers&#039; security is at risk.
</p>

<a name="40607-34_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>The answer to that is to be found in the second sub-paragraph of each of the three amendments. The Central Arbitration Committee itself will decide whether the case for an exception has been made out and the onus of proof will be on the employer to make that case to the satisfaction of the CAC.
</p>

<a name="40607-34_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>Amendments Nos. 10 and 32 relate to the right to privacy, which is now part of the law of the land, relating to employees. The first of those amendments requires the consent of the individual employees before their addresses are disclosed to the union. Undoubtedly, obtaining that consent may hold up the recognition process a little, but there is no case that I can envisage where there would be some dire urgency in the recognition procedure. The delay would probably be minimal&#151;for example, a simple note in the pay packet for those employees who still get them, or a notice in the factory to the effect that, &quot;The union wants your address and we will be required by law to give it to them unless you tell the management that you object&quot;. In other words, silence will imply consent. Bearing in mind that the direct marketing industry, of which I used to be a member, has a &quot;mail preference scheme&quot; that enables individuals to opt out of receiving mail order offers, it is only right that workers should be able to protect their privacy in exactly the same way.
</p>

<a name="40607-34_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Amendment No. 32 defines &quot;address&quot;. This is necessary as a result of modern means of communication. I propose that e-mail addresses should be excluded, because Members of both Houses have expressed concerns about unwanted e-mails or &quot;spams&quot;. I also exclude mobile telephone numbers <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC4"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC4</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

because that is another means of sending circular communications to people&#151;in this case, ones that might arrive with a loud, audible signal at an inopportune time. I have not sought to exclude telephone canvassing, because that is regarded as a legitimate form of communication in elections these days, and it is obviously up to the employee to make his telephone number ex-directory if that is what he wishes.
</p>

<a name="40607-34_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Amendment No. 36 is similar to, but slightly different from, Amendments Nos. 2, 9 and 32. Those amendments relate to the withholding of commercially confidential information or information which might have an adverse effect on the security of the employer or any worker. Amendment No. 36 relates to a slightly different category of information&#151;that which might damage the interests of the employer, the business or its workers.
</p>

<a name="40607-34_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>There is no purpose in my burdening Members of the Committee with a series of hypothetical examples. The addresses of employees, while not necessarily affecting security and the nature of who does what work in a company and where, and while not necessarily commercially confidential, might need to be withheld to prevent, for example, the poaching of workers or harassment. The detail is unimportant at the moment. The amendment simply plugs a theoretical gap in the other three amendments.
</p>

<a name="40607-34_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>None of the amendments in this group seeks in any way to wreck or nullify the recognition procedure. They are simply intended to provide an even-handed regime, whereby a union&#039;s right to campaign for recognition&#151;from which we do not, even for one moment, dissent&#151;is balanced against the legitimate rights of the employers and individual employees. Those are the rights to protect the employer&#039;s legitimate, commercially confidential interests, the security of the employee and the entitlement of the employee to privacy under the European Convention on Human Rights. I beg to move.
</p>

<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40607-35_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   I hope that the Minister will not feel tempted to accept this amendment. The noble Baroness herself said that &quot;commercially confidential&quot; probably did not apply to all the information contained in sub-paragraph 2. The amendment&#039;s wording gives the employer the absolute right to withhold any such information.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>It seems to me that the way in which these amendments are phrased gives an employer the opportunity to delay the recognition procedures. It is a loophole in the procedures which I do not think is a very good idea. The noble Baroness says that she is not against unions campaigning, and I am glad that she is not. However, it seems to me that if this proposal is accepted, it will have an inhibiting effect on campaigning by the unions. I am therefore not in favour of accepting this wording.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40607-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has explained, these amendments all relate to a concern about requirements in a number of the Bill&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC5"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC5</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

clauses for the disclosure of information, a matter which the Government, like the noble Baroness, take very seriously.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Clauses 3, 5, 15 and 18 all require the disclosure of information. The purpose of every one of them is not to allow unions privileged access to otherwise secret information. Their purpose is to ensure the sharing of information to enable better informed decision-making by the parties, the CAC and the workers. I am sure that Members of the Committee will agree that sharing information can help lead to agreement and to sensible bargaining positions, which can only be beneficial, in order to ensure that there is a smooth procedure and a positive dialogue between the parties. Conflict so often seems to result from the fact that people have not shared information adequately; they have misapprehensions and misunderstandings about each other&#039;s position and drift&#151;sometimes by accident&#151;into dispute.
<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="40607-35_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40607-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>A number of general principles have underpinned the Government&#039;s thinking in constructing these provisions. First, in accordance with data protection rules, under none of the affected clauses would the identity or home addresses of individuals be disclosed to the union. Clause 18 additionally ensures that evidence supplied by the union containing the names of individual union members is not disclosed to the employer.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Clauses 5 and 15 are therefore constructed so that the names and addresses of workers are provided only to the CAC, which passes them to an appointed independent person. The independent person will send out communications on the union&#039;s behalf. The union will not, therefore, gain direct access to the workers or their details under these provisions. Those details will be safeguarded by an independent and respected organisation in accordance with the data protection legislation.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>We have provided for direct disclosure to the union in Clause 3. The information to be disclosed is general information about numbers of workers, their categories and locations and nothing else. The Government do not believe that such information is ever likely to threaten either the commercial interests of the employer or the security of the business or of its workforce.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Furthermore, a number of the noble Baroness&#039;s amendments seek to introduce a procedure whereby the employers may apply to the CAC to withhold sensitive information. As I have said, the Government do not believe that the information required is likely to be sensitive in that sense. Putting in place an additional procedure and decision point for the CAC would therefore be unnecessary and simply create greater scope for mischievous employers to seek to delay the process.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>Therefore, I can understand and sympathise with the spirit in which these amendments were tabled, but I do not believe that they are necessary. The <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC6"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC6</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government have already taken steps to ensure that privileged or sensitive information is not placed in the public domain.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>What I have said applies to all the amendments in this group. With the Committee&#039;s permission, however, I shall touch on some key aspects of individual amendments, which I think are most important in the general case for transparency.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Amendment No. 1 concerns the duty on the employer, which is introduced in Clause 3, to provide basic information to the union about the characteristics of the workforce in the union&#039;s proposed bargaining unit. The amendment seems to deal with the practical difficulties which the employer may possibly encounter when fulfilling this duty.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>The duty introduced by Clause 3 applies only after the union&#039;s application to the CAC has been accepted as admissible by the CAC. A great deal of water will have flowed under the bridge before we reach that point. The union must have made a direct request to the employer for recognition, which might have been followed by a period of ACAS conciliation. Some dialogue between the union and the employer will have taken place in many cases, as well as written communication.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Only if that process fails to resolve the issue is the union entitled to make a formal application to the CAC for recognition. I should add that, under paragraph 34 of the statutory procedure, the union is already obliged to send the application to the employer as well. So, the second part of the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment which refers to this process is not needed because it is already there.

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>The CAC process of assessing the admissibility of a union&#039;s application involves various steps, and often includes an oral hearing and checks of union membership. The employer and the union frequently assemble and present additional information for the CAC to enable it to make this key decision. The process often teases out any definitional issues about the union&#039;s proposed bargaining unit. Greater clarity is achieved as a consequence of going through the process.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>All that shows that the employer will normally have all the information that he needs to meet the duty imposed by Clause 3 by the time a union&#039;s application reaches this point in the procedure. I do not think it could be said that it would create an extra burden on employers. They are not suddenly confronted with the matter for the first time and they are usually very well versed in the case at that stage. In addition, the clause already provides safeguards for the employer in so far as the information he provides must be as accurate,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;as is reasonably practicable in the light of the information in . . . [his] possession&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="40607-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>The amendment seeks to place a further limitation on the accuracy of the information that the employer must supply by referring back to the union&#039;s original application to the CAC. It is hard to see the practical advantage of doing that. The only piece of information in the application that is relevant to the employer&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40607-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>I made the point earlier that if there were any doubt about the issues that were involved, it should have been explored in detail by the parties and the CAC before the admissibility decision was taken. The CAC would already have taken a view on the definition of the proposed bargaining unit. The obligation on the employer is therefore to provide the data relating to the unit so defined.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 2, which would also amend Clause 3. As your Lordships will no doubt be aware, a similar amendment was tabled by the Opposition in the other place, as the noble Baroness said. She made the point, with which I completely agree, that this is technically a more proficient version of the amendment, indicating where responsibility for deciding the issue and the burden of proof should lie.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>In the other place there was a lengthy discussion of the case of Huntingdon Life Sciences where, regrettably, the workforce has been subject to the worst sorts of threats and abuse from militant animal rights activists and great public disquiet was caused as a result. If I might echo sentiments expressed during that debate, I suggest to your Lordships that the information which must be shared with the union would not, if it were to fall into the wrong hands, help similar groups to take this sort of action against employees. The information will not contain the names or home addresses of any workers. Moreover, the union will have just as strong an interest as the employer in ensuring that the security of its members is not put at risk.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>Having represented people working in life sciences and in some of the most controversial areas such as primate research in the university world, I know from personal experience that we went to the greatest possible lengths to protect members in that union context. Indeed, we held regular discussions with the Home Office and others to ensure that the members were protected. We would most certainly never, casually or in any other way, have placed any of our members at risk in any sense. I am afraid that knowledge about the whereabouts of people involved in this research arises elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>In practice, during negotiations over the bargaining unit this information is usually revealed by the employer in any case. The purpose of Clause 3 is merely to ensure that information is shared in a more systematic way and at the earliest possible moment.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 32. This goes to the heart of Clause 15 and the new paragraph 166A it would insert into the statutory procedure. Its effect is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC8"></a>

more or less to wreck the clause and to ensure that the Secretary of State would not be in a position to use the power contained in new paragraph 166A.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>The purpose of the power is in the future to enable QIPs to send union material to workers in the balloting unit by non-postal means. The amendment would make that impossible because it restricts the information which the employer must supply to the CAC&#151;and thereby the QIP&#151;to data which is relevant to postal communication only.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Clause 15 looks to the future. Its purpose is to enable communication to take place using new technologies. The clause gives a power to the Secretary of State to amend the duty of the employer so that he must provide a different sort of address to the CAC in addition to the worker&#039;s home address. This will enable the QIP to send communications by new means; for example, by e-mail.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>New technologies are developing rapidly. We have seen the rise in the use of mobile phones, text messaging and even video phones. That is why it makes sense to take a power now to provide for e-enabled communications in the future at a time when such communications will be accessible to all and will have proved their suitability for this sensitive purpose. This will allow us to give careful consideration to the appropriateness for this purpose of new technologies as they develop.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>We recognise that employers might have some concerns about disclosure of e-mail addresses to the CAC. In deciding when and how to exercise that power, the Government will have regard to those concerns. For example, we recognise that, as a matter of course, employers do not currently hold workers&#039; personal e-mail addresses; indeed, it may be unusual for employers to hold them at all. However, the situation is changing and that is why we are taking the power to be exercised only when we are satisfied that the duty to supply e-mail or other addresses will not place an undue burden on employers.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>It is as well to be cautious about such matters. I would not have predicted the extent to which new technologies are now in use had I been asked questions on the subject 10 or 15 years ago. However, because of the rapid development of technologies, we have all learned how quickly new technologies become commonplace in our working lives. Rather than being backward-looking, I hope that the explanation that I have given, although cautious, shows that we are trying to be forward-looking in a way that I believe we can all live with.
</p>

<a name="40607-35_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>I apologise for replying at length, but the noble Baroness has rightly been concerned with the necessity to protect the parties and the workers from disclosure of sensitive information without their consent. I hope that I have reassured her that the Government have given careful consideration to the matter. We have taken every care to ensure that no genuinely sensitive information must be disclosed by one party to the other. Where such information must be disclosed, it must be disclosed only to trusted independent bodies <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40607-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   I support the Government&#039;s projection of the amendment. There appear to be three good reasons, some of which have been mentioned. First, the noble Baroness said that she did not want to use imaginative hypotheses, but she did. There is no concrete case of the kind of thing of which she complained happening in the existing procedure. The two parties in the procedure, the people on the CAC, and the unions and the employers using the CAC have never said that. There is no sign that those, on either side, who operate the existing procedure want such a provision or that they believe that it would help.
</p>

<a name="40607-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>Secondly, there are remedies. As the Minister said, if there are problems of this kind, additional remedies are being put on to the face of the Bill to deal with them. Clauses 9, 11 and 16, which concern unfair practices, are designed to deal with any significant coercion, and they do that.
</p>

<a name="40607-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Thirdly, many of us have said for a long time&#151;even before we had this procedure&#151;that it is very good but it is very long and very complicated. In fact, the procedure for recognition is 80 pages long. We do not need a longer procedure; we need a shorter one.

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>As the Bill stands, the CAC is rightly required to take into account,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;the need for the unit to be compatible with effective management&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>However, this does not go far enough. It is possible to demonstrate that any size of unit, geographically situated within an enterprise, fits into the very broad description of being compatible with effective management. The CAC should be seeking out not the unit which is merely compatible with effective management but the unit which is the most compatible in the circumstances of the particular enterprise. That is the purpose of Amendment No. 3. It would have the effect of preventing manipulation by a union to establish a fragmented bargaining unit on the basis of where it has strong support within an enterprise.
</p>

<a name="40607-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The amendment would ensure that the bargaining unit was indeed more suited to the needs of effective management instead of possibly one unit in the country being under one regime and another elsewhere being under another. That would be the antithesis of effective management. Amendment No. 3 would ensure that the CAC factored the degree of effectiveness and the size, nature and geographic situation of the proposed unit into its calculations.
</p>

<a name="40607-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>Amendment No. 4 would take into account another omission from the proposed new clause. New paragraph 19B(3)(a) rightly instructs the CAC to take into account,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;the views of the employer and of the union (or unions)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>However, there is no indication of the weight, or even the relative weight, that the CAC should attach to each of the opinions.
</p>

<a name="40607-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>The CAC will be acting not merely in a supervisory or facilitating capacity in recognition proceedings; in the case of some of its decisions&#151;the nature of the bargaining unit, for example&#151;it will also be acting in a quasi-judicial capacity. While it will have to make a decision one way or another on any of the issues that it has to decide, and probably one or either side, or even both sides, may be unhappy with part of the verdict, it is essential that it should give equal weight to the views of both.
</p>

<a name="40607-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>There cannot be a presumption in favour of the unions any more than there can be a presumption in support of the status quo, which the employer may very well prefer. Each case must be decided on its own merits, based on its own individual facts, with no preconceptions or presumptions either way. The onus of satisfying the CAC must be shared equally by both parties.
</p>

<a name="40607-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>Amendment No. 5 seeks to remove the entirely superfluous word &quot;small&quot; from new paragraph 19B(3)(c), which at present talks about the desirability of avoiding &quot;small fragmented bargaining units&quot;. Not all fragmented bargaining units are small; the size of the unit should be irrelevant. The bargaining unit should be a reasonable one, consistent with what the Government call,

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>To sum up the reasoning behind these three very moderate, and I believe constructive, amendments, perhaps I may quote the Government&#039;s own words setting out the criteria to be applied over the constitution of a bargaining unit. In the White Paper <i>Fairness at Work</i>, the Government said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;Where there is disagreement over the bargaining unit proposed by the union, the CAC will apply criteria, including the need for effective management, existing bargaining arrangements and the desirability of avoiding fragmented units within an undertaking&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>The Government refer to &quot;fragmented units&quot; and not &quot;small fragmented units&quot;. The White Paper continued:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;Employers must and will be free to organise their business in the way they choose&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-36_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>I could not have expressed that concept any better myself. It is to give effect, as it were, to the Government&#039;s own stated objectives in the White Paper and their criteria that I have proposed these amendments. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40607-36_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   The problem with these amendments is that they do not take into account the fact that in a recognition claim of a kind which gets to the CAC, there is disagreement&#151;probably very sharp disagreement between the parties, otherwise it would not get to the CAC. The employer is resisting organisation. One factor used by the employer in such resistance is the definition of the bargaining unit. An employer who is resisting organisation, particularly compulsory organisation, through the legislation is bound to look for a bargaining unit concept which would minimise the number of workers who will vote for recognition. He is bound to want a bigger representation, so that more people who are unlikely to vote for recognition will be in the bargaining unit. There is nothing wrong with that; that is what industrial relations are about.
</p>

<a name="40607-36_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>Conversely, the union will be concerned to try to structure the bargaining unit in such a way that when the vote is taken&#151;if the vote is necessary; they might hope they may get 50 per cent and not have a vote&#151;it will get its 50 per cent. You cannot just dream all this away. This is what the parties will be seeking to argue. For example, when people restructure a constituency, the Conservative Party wants it to look like this and the Labour Party wants it to look like that because its party will get more votes. These are the facts of life.
</p>

<a name="40607-36_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>The Bill is trying to steer a way through the middle, not weighing too much on one side or too much on the other. I think it has done that very fairly. If you change the provision in the ways that are suggested, each change would strengthen the position of the employer&#039;s side. If it was not just an &quot;effective&quot; bargaining unit, but the &quot;most effective&quot; bargaining unit, you would never achieve it. Anything defined could be challenged and the employer could say, &quot;Well, I know a way it could be more effective than that&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40607-36_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>Similarly, on fragmentation, if every bargaining unit could be said to be potentially fragmented, there would be endless arguments about fragmentation. But <br>&nbsp;<br>

we have a fairly good balance in this legislation. It is no good one side coming along and trying to put special words in which could in general strengthen it in the debates before recognition. It is not a simple thing like that. It has to be a balance; and the balance is in the Bill.

I totally agree with what the noble Lord has just said, but he does not seem to understand that there is always disagreement in any dispute. In the courts there is disagreement in any dispute. Of course one side in this dispute wants a smaller bargaining unit and the other side wants to have, putting it simply, a larger representation on the bargaining unit.

<a name="40607-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Are we concerned to adjudicate at this stage on the strength or weakness of either case?

</p>

<a name="40607-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>As regards fair provision, surely the amendment secures fair provision within that fundamental concept. I may be speaking from the wrong side of the Committee, as I have only just arrived, but that does not really matter. I sympathise in many respects with the aspirations of the trades unions.

</p>

<a name="40607-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>I make a preliminary observation. In different ways the noble Lords, Lord McCarthy and Lord Campbell of Alloway, made similar points. This is an area in which there will be disagreements and disputes. The issue is how to deal with those in a way that is fair and even-handed on the basis of the exchange of the best possible information.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>As regards Amendment No. 3, the Government are well aware of the concerns of employers about the statutory criteria according to which the CAC must determine the bargaining unit in those cases where the parties are unable to agree a bargaining unit between themselves. Amendment No. 3 seeks to change those criteria so that the CAC must choose a bargaining unit which is not just compatible with effective management, but the most compatible with effective management. The Government cannot support that view. Currently, in those cases where the CAC must decide the bargaining unit, it first considers whether the bargaining unit proposed by the union is appropriate. That is right and proper. It is the union that initiates the process. It brings forward the idea of bargaining rights that it wishes to have recognised for certain groups of people. Inevitably, its proposal should be considered first.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40607-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>The CAC measures the union&#039;s proposed bargaining unit against the statutory criteria, the most important of which is the need for bargaining units to be compatible with effective management.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>The CAC will seek to ensure that the views of the employer on the appropriateness of the union&#039;s proposed unit are considered very seriously. The employer is, of course, permitted to argue that the union&#039;s proposal is inappropriate for some reason; for example, because it is incompatible with effective management. To illustrate its points, the employer can refer to other bargaining units that avoid the problems it may see in the union&#039;s suggestion.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>If the CAC finds that the union&#039;s proposed bargaining unit is not appropriate, the CAC formally considers alternatives, including any which may be proposed by the employer. It is not the case that the view of the CAC always flows in one direction. So far the data show that in a third of the CAC&#039;s decisions on the appropriate bargaining unit it has decided against the union&#039;s proposed bargaining unit as not being appropriate and has therefore provided an alternative proposal.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>The CAC&#039;s procedure was the subject of judicial review in the case of <i>Kwik Fit</i>. I do not know whether one should declare an interest if Kwik Fit has ever supplied one with tyres, but in case that is necessary, it has done so in my case. Therefore, I declare at least that much interest. The Court of Appeal found that the CAC had correctly interpreted the schedule. The Government are in agreement with that view. The <i>Kwik Fit</i> case did demonstrate, however, that there was some confusion about the procedure to be followed by the CAC in setting the bargaining unit. Clauses 1 and 4 of this Bill therefore seek to clarify this procedure, as the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, just said, in particular the role that the employer&#039;s evidence is to have in the CAC&#039;s deliberations. We want to ensure that all the parties are clear about the procedure the CAC will follow and how their evidence will be treated.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>However, we do not believe that there is a case for changing the criteria for an appropriate bargaining unit or the way these are applied by the CAC. Getting the criteria for the bargaining unit decision right was a crucial part of the settlement at the time of the 1999 Act. The 1999 Act struck a balance between the interests that were expressed at that time by the CBI and other employers&#039; organisations and the TUC&#151;a balance, at least certainly in the view of the CAC and others, that was held to be a strong and critical basis for the settlement that has been achieved. To require the CAC to choose from the alternative bargaining units placed before it the one most compatible with effective management would constitute a significant change to that balance. Candidly, I am not sure how it would ever arrive at a decision as people argued about them.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>In one third of cases where the bargain unit has had to be decided, the CAC has chosen the employer&#039;s or some other unit, rather than the union&#039;s. So while the union&#039;s proposed bargaining unit has been judged to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC14"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC14</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be compatible with the statutory criteria in a majority of cases, in a substantial minority of cases it has varied or taken a different view about the bargaining unit to be chosen. I think this demonstrates how the process creates a good balance.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>The amendment before us may go further than that, however. It implies that the CAC must choose the bargaining unit which is most compatible not just from those which are presented by the parties, but from all possible bargaining units. I would be loath to land the CAC with what I suspect would be an impossible and time-consuming task. It would have to satisfy itself that the bargaining unit could not be improved on even at the margins if this or that worker were added to or taken away from the bargaining unit. The permutations involved would be innumerable.

There is no single model for what constitutes an appropriate bargaining unit. Collective bargaining can be effective in the context of bargaining units of all shapes and sizes as the range of collective bargaining arrangements which exist all over the United Kingdom will testify. The Government are of the view that the statutory criteria are working well and strike the right balance and that it is not appropriate to make a change.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>Amendment No. 4 touches on matters similar to those we have discussed in Amendment No. 3. It would seem to reflect a concern that an employer&#039;s bargaining unit should be considered alongside that proposed by the union&#151;a point made again by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway&#151;and that they should be given equal consideration. For the reasons I have outlined, the Government do not believe that would be appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>However, that is not the effect of Amendment No. 4. The amendment would alter the criteria against which the CAC must test the union&#039;s proposed unit. It does not alter the fact that the union&#039;s proposed bargaining unit is accorded priority, in the sense that it was the first proposal, under the schedule. Furthermore, it amends those criteria in a way I have argued would be unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>Paragraph 19B(3) lists the matters, in addition to the need to ensure that bargaining units are compatible with effective management, which the CAC must take into account in deciding whether a bargaining unit is appropriate. The first of these is the view of the employer and of the union or unions. Amendment No. 4 would add that the views of each party should be given equal consideration.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>I believe that this is an unnecessary addition as it is already clear in new paragraph 19B(3)(a) that the views of the employer and the views of the union are to be given equal consideration by the CAC. The Government are not aware of any suggestion that the CAC has failed to take properly into account an employer&#039;s views when considering whether any given bargaining unit is appropriate. Of course, the CAC <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC15"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC15</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

may be more persuaded by the views expressed by one party, but that does not mean that it has not given each party&#039;s views due consideration.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>The Government acknowledge that employers may be uncertain of the role of their evidence in the CAC&#039;s deliberations. That is why new paragraph 19B(4) seeks to clarify that when considering the appropriateness of any given bargaining unit, the views of the employer, which must be taken into account by the CAC, include any alternative which the employer thinks appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>I turn finally to Amendment No. 5. The statutory criteria in the schedule for assessing bargaining units currently oblige the CAC to have regard to the desirability of avoiding small fragmented bargaining units within an undertaking. The new paragraph 19B of the schedule, inserted by Clause 4, repeats that obligation with no change in the wording. This amendment seeks to change that criterion so that fragmented bargaining units within an undertaking must be avoided, rather than small and fragmented units.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>The intention behind the &quot;small fragmented bargaining units&quot; criterion was to avoid the proliferation of small bargaining units within a single firm. This could lead to complicated and costly bargaining arrangements.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>However, it was recognised that there would always be specialist groups for whom a small bargaining unit was appropriate. Some of us will have seen them in professional life where a professional group has particular professional requirements. However, there is a group whose level of technical expertise and involvement puts it in a quite different marketplace for bargaining purposes from the generality of the people within the firm in which that group works.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>Insisting that there must be a single bargaining unit covering all workers in a given undertaking would prevent the establishment of sensible bargaining arrangements which reflected the natural differentiation between groups of workers of the kind that I have just instanced. Certain categories of worker may have quite separate interests and may be represented by different unions from those that represent the majority of the workforce.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>The criterion that small and fragmented bargaining units within an undertaking should be avoided allows the CAC to take into account the natural differentiation between groups of workers. At the same time, it respects the need to offset that against the inefficiencies of a single employer having to put in place excessively convoluted bargaining structures.
</p>

<a name="40607-37_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>The Government are of the view that to delete the word &quot;small&quot; from this criterion would compromise the provisions of the law securing that bargaining arrangements can respect the differentiation. The amendment would restrict the ability of the statutory procedure to put in place arrangements which reflect the real world of industrial relations.

That makes it far simpler because my own request&#151;it is a respectful request&#151;is that the Government should consider the very important principle contained within Amendment No. 1&#151;a principle which has arisen and to which I have already spoken. Inevitably, that amendment, even if not retabled by my party, would be retabled by me. It is a matter of fundamental principle and I ask that reconsideration be given to it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40607-38_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   Perhaps I may return to Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5. I listened carefully to what the Minister and, indeed, what my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, said regarding Amendment No. 3, in particular. I can foresee that it might be difficult to decide what was most effective rather than ineffective, and I shall read very carefully what the noble Lord said.
</p>

<a name="40607-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 4, I think that the Minister said that it is already stated in the Bill in the various places that he quoted that the opinions of both the union and the employer should be given equal consideration. I shall certainly look that up carefully. If that is so&#151;one has to go and look for it&#151;I would say to the Minister that it does not make any difference. My amendment provides a belt and braces approach and there should be no real objection to it.
</p>

<a name="40607-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>However, I have a difficulty in understanding why the Minister does not like Amendment No. 5. The White Paper, <i>Fairness at Work</i>, which went out for consultation, talked about the desirability of avoiding fragmented units; it did not talk about avoiding &quot;small&quot; fragmented units. Unless I misunderstood, the Minister said that sometimes it was important that the unit was small. The Bill talks about avoiding that kind of unit. I was simply attempting to delete the word &quot;small&quot; because, as I said when I moved the amendment, I thought that the size was irrelevant and the word &quot;small&quot; could be important. That is why I tabled an amendment to that effect.

&quot;19BA   If more than 25 per cent of the workers in a bargaining unit determined by the CAC do not wish to be represented by the union, they shall retain the right to negotiate separately from that union.&quot;&quot; </p>



<p><a name="st_25"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 6, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 7. Amendment No. 7 is a minor consequential amendment to Amendment No. 6, which necessitates the slight renumbering shown in the second amendment.
</p>

<a name="40607-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>The substantive amendment is to Clause 4. It states in simple, virtually self-explanatory, terms that in a bargaining unit established by at least 40 per cent of the workers requesting union representation, if another substantial group of 25 per cent do not want to be represented by the union, or to have terms negotiated by the union imposed on them, they should have the right to negotiate on their own collective, separate behalf.
</p>

<a name="40607-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>If 40 per cent of employees request union recognition, that is undoubtedly a substantial number, but if 25 per cent&#151;a quarter of the workforce&#151;want nothing to do with the union, that is also a substantial number. Theoretically, that 25 per cent could be another 40 per cent who wish to negotiate for themselves. They should have the right to express their own views to the employer in their own way in order to achieve their own objectives, even if they are different from those of the union. There is nothing to prevent an employer, at the end of negotiations, rejecting the deal wanted by the non-union employees on the grounds that, &quot;If it&#039;s good enough for the majority, it certainly ought to be good enough for you&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40607-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>It would be an equally valid argument if the employer insisted on the union deal on the grounds that, in words that the party opposite will undoubtedly recognise, the employer did not want the disharmony on the shop floor that would be caused by having a two-tier workforce.
</p>

<a name="40607-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>The amendment, if accepted, would also have the side effect of resolving an issue of which the Minister is well aware&#151;an issue over which his colleague in the other place, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, expressed some sympathy when Clause 3 was debated in the Select Committee. I refer to the plight of the Plymouth Brethren&#151;otherwise known as &quot;the Brethren&quot;&#151;who do not want to be involved, whether as employers or employees, with any organisation outside their own sect. It is certainly not for me to comment on their beliefs, which some people might find objectionable on <br>&nbsp;<br>

a variety of grounds. But they are a genuine, long-established sect and not one dreamed up for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of employment legislation. That has been their way for a number of years. Whether we agree with them or not, it might be right to countenance their somewhat isolationist views.
</p>

<a name="40607-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>The amendment would have the effect of accommodating their beliefs as well as killing another bird with the same stone&#151;that is, it would accommodate the more conventional views of a substantial part of the workforce of an enterprise who wanted to represent themselves rather than be represented by a specific union. The issue covered by the amendment is not merely one of counting heads. We are discussing not only the rights of a few dissident employees but those of a substantial minority&#151;at least 25 per cent of the workforce. As I said previously, that would be the minimum that could be considered, but the figure could be higher.

<a name="40607-38_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   It is becoming increasingly difficult to accept the bona fides of these amendments and increasingly difficult to take seriously the statement of the noble Baroness that she is trying to help and to clarify. It makes one ask whether the Conservative Party would, if it ever came to power, repeal this legislation if it is not able to frustrate it totally before then.
</p>

<a name="40607-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>It is amazing: we are to have the 10 per cent credibility test&#151;it is not suggested that that should be got rid of; we are to have the 50 per cent membership test; and, if you do not pass that, you can have the 50 per cent ballot test. We also have the 40 per cent turnover test and, as if there are not enough tests to get through, we now have the 25 per cent breakaway test. There could be a situation in which three-quarters, or slightly fewer, of the workers in the bargaining unit wanted the union to be recognised but it would be perfectly possible for 25 per cent to go away and form their own union.
</p>

<a name="40607-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>Most employers who are serious about this matter do not want to facilitate breakaway unions. If they are to recognise a union, they want it to be the one with the majority of workers in the defined bargaining unit and they want to negotiate with them. How on earth that could ever be spelled out on a series of ballot papers, I really do not know. If amendments such as this are tabled from the opposite side of the Committee, we cannot take them at all seriously.

</p>

<a name="40607-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>As we all know, the Bill is a compromise between the views of the TUC, which were put very forcefully to Her Majesty&#039;s Government, and the views of the CBI, which were put with equal force at Second Reading. If this were a football match, I suspect that the CBI would get away with, at best, a score draw and even possibly an away win. Therefore, I think that any further attempt by the Conservative Party to water down what, from my point of view, has been a very satisfactory compromise should be regretted.

<a name="40607-39_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   Before the Minister replies, I want to thank the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, for at least saying that he did not agree with the tone. I want to place on record that I very much objected to the tone when we debated the Grand Committee stage of the Employment Bill in one of the Committee rooms. That became extraordinarily unpleasant for me&#151;not because of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, or, indeed, at that stage, because of the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy. However, there were suggestions that I was obviously one of the bad Conservative employers and so on.

However, there is no reason why the union&#039;s position should be undermined because a minority decide that they want some sort of breakaway arrangement.

They would sooner have everything determined by ballot, an agreement negotiated, and then the collective bargaining conducted in accordance with the terms of that agreement.

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>I can see no virtue in making provision in legislation for what amounts to breakaway organisations on the floor of a bargaining unit. I hope that my noble friend the Minister will not feel inclined to give much consideration to the amendment.

</p>

<a name="40607-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are closely linked and I will take them together. Amendment No. 7 is a drafting and consequential amendment, which would be needed if Amendment No. 6 were accepted. I shall therefore confine the bulk of my remarks to Amendment No. 6, which contains the substance of the suggestions posed by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller.
</p>

<a name="40607-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>The amendment seeks to create an opt-out from the scope of a statutory recognition award where a significant minority of the bargaining unit would prefer separate arrangements to determine their pay and other terms of employment. Major principles are at stake in the amendment, which cuts across some of the essential pillars of recognition procedure as a whole.
</p>

<a name="40607-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>We have built a large number of checks and balances into the statutory procedure. In doing so, we have taken on board the genuine interests of all parties. As a result, the procedure has worked well, and people who have used it and spoken of it have tended to say that they found that it worked well&#151;irrespective of whether they were employers or union representatives.
</p>

<a name="40607-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>Recognition is achieved only after the union has demonstrated its case that the bargaining unit makes sense and that a substantial proportion of the unit favours recognition. For example, in recognition ballots, at least 40 per cent of the bargaining unit, plus a simple majority of the workers who vote, must vote for recognition in order for the union to succeed in its application. That 40 per cent threshold is controversial&#151;not least with the unions and with some who sit on our Benches in the House.
</p>

<a name="40607-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>However, it also has the great advantage of demonstrating that there is genuine and serious support for recognition to exist. It is only right and proper in any democratic process that the ballot result should be respected. The positioning of the amendment suggests that workers would be allowed to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC21"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC21</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

opt out of the recognition that would result if the union were successful in the ballot before it even took place. That may not be the intention of the noble Baroness, and we certainly would not want a situation in which parties were able to distance themselves from the outcome of an independent test of opinion that the ballot represents in advance of that test taking place.
</p>

<a name="40607-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>I am sure Members of the Committee will accept that if workers were allowed to opt out at that stage, it would not be right for them to vote in the ballot at all.
</p>

<a name="40607-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>But that appears to be what is achieved by this amendment. It allows workers, in effect, to opt out of the procedure. It is likely to destabilise bargaining arrangements and the democratic process by which they are established. It should also be noted that the Amendment does not seek to provide for the opposite circumstance where a minority of workers wish to continue to be represented by a union where the union is derecognised in respect of a larger bargaining unit. It seems to me that if the Amendment is motivated solely by a desire to respect the interests of minority groups, then it should also propose a converse right in respect of derecognition. I am not inviting that, I am just saying that that would have been the equity of the argument.
</p>

<a name="40607-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>We have heard, quite understandably, about the case of the Brethren, who object to collective bargaining on religious grounds. The Government take very seriously our responsibility to ensure that religious freedoms are respected in this country. Ministers have met with representatives of the Brethren and listened to their concerns, both in respect of the Bill and at the time of the 1999 Act.
</p>

<a name="40607-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>I accept that this is a very difficult issue. On the one hand, we want to respect the important freedoms of religious belief. Equally, we must respect the rights of workers to associate with one another in trade unions and to seek to be represented through their trade union. On balance, the Government take the view that allowing a minority of workers to opt out of the statutory procedure, even where they wish to do so on religious grounds, would inevitably damage the procedure as a whole. Therefore, we cannot accept the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40607-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>Of course, the drafting of the amendment does not restrict the right of Brethren workers to opt out. I am sure that most reasonable employers would wish to be sympathetic to the concerns of religious minorities among their workforce. However, I suspect that employers would not relish the prospect of having to deal with a multiplicity of overlapping bargaining arrangements simply because that is the preference of a minority of workers. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, as a useful shorthand for the problem that we would face at the very least, used the term &quot;two-tier&quot;. I am grateful for Thomas Jefferson&#039;s endorsement of it, but bringing it into a slightly more modern context requires us to think about the matter carefully.
</p>

<a name="40607-39_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>This proposal would potentially create two or more sets of bargaining units for the same types of worker. Two people doing the same job could be covered by two separate pay determination systems. One would <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC22"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC22</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be established for the recognised union and the other would be created for the minority of workers who would want to opt out. The paradox is that during the whole of the period that I was an active trade union negotiator, I faced employers who were very eager to ensure that the union side itself did not fragment in a way which meant that it would be impossible for them to achieve sustainable bargaining arrangements. They would frequently argue strongly and convincingly that unions, who did not always see eye to eye with one another, should, none the less, ensure that their efforts to reach a common bargaining position, common aims and a common bargaining process were put in place. There has been great encouragement from the TUC to try to achieve that kind of clarity and simplicity of operation, because of the benefits to all concerned. Sometimes a highly specialised group could not be fitted in, but, generally speaking, everyone wanted to avoid the problem that must inevitably occur where two people doing the same job could be covered by two separate pay determination systems. That way almost always led to conflict and a degree of chaos. I know that that is not the intention of the noble Baroness, but that is what would happen as a result of the amendment.

<a name="40607-39_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>I shall not continue at greater length, because I believe that everyone would recognise that what is being tested here was not workable in practice. In that light, I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40607-40_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   First, I thank the Minister for his explanation of why the Government would wish to reject the amendments. In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, I have a feeling that my noble friend said something similar in that he did not like the idea of a quota, a number, of 25 per cent. I think that the noble Baroness said that she did not understand where the 25 per cent came from&#151;or something like that. I was trying to say that it would have to be a substantial amount. If there were a majority, the noble Baroness said that that should be it. At the moment under the Bill it is only 40 per cent of those who have voted. That is certainly not a majority, but that is how it stands at the moment.
</p>

<a name="40607-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>Having said that, it is my duty to look at the Bill and if there are any items that need to be tested or spoken to&#151;the Government have no objection to my doing that&#151;the Government will answer accordingly. I do not believe that it is appropriate to say&#151;the Government certainly did not say&#151;that one hopes that the Conservatives will not repeal legislation in the future. The Government, whether a Conservative or a Labour government, will do what they consider best at the time. That does not mean that I should feel intimidated when moving any amendment that I feel needs to be considered.
</p>

<a name="40607-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>I read very carefully everything that takes place in the House of Commons, where many Bills are guillotined in such a way that whole sections of clauses are not discussed. In this House we are fortunate to have the freedom to raise any matter on behalf of the people of this country. I did not pluck these <br>&nbsp;<br>

amendments out of the air. The subject of the amendments has been mention to me by various organisations that have asked me to air them in Committee to find out the views of the Government. I have felt it my duty to do that and that is what I am doing.
</p>

<a name="40607-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>Interestingly, when the first groupings list was issued, Mr Makower had listed most of these amendments separately. For the benefit of the Committee, I grouped them so as not to waste time unnecessarily. I am sorry that I have had to take time now to explain that. On the first day in Committee it should have been clarified that I will not always be attacked when I table an amendment that I legitimately consider needs to be aired for whatever reason.
</p>

<a name="40607-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>It is interesting to hear a Minister in Committee say that he hopes that an amendment will be withdrawn because, of course, an amendment has to be withdrawn if it is not agreed to. So it is with pleasure that I withdraw it, but with not so much pleasure I shall consider the matter again and consider what the Minister has said.

<a name="40607-40_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon </b>   moved Amendment No. 8:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>Page 5, line 32, at end insert &quot;so long as the relevant workers have consented to the disclosure of that information&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak extremely briefly to Amendments Nos. 8 and 11 to the very important and significant Clause 5. The amendments relate to a different issue from the confidentiality amendments that we discussed earlier. Amendment No. 8 is a paving amendment, again qualifying the employers&#039; duties to supply information about workers by making it subject to the workers&#039; consent. We have already discussed that fully and I shall not take up the time of the Committee further at this stage. I have left the amendment on the record as a marker in case we have to return to the subject at a later stage.
</p>

<a name="40607-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>The substantive Amendment No. 11 provides a reasonable limit to what the union may say to those whom it hopes to represent as a result of the recognition process. Of course, the union must be allowed, without censorship, to make the case to the workers, but the fact is that this material will be distributed pursuant to the proposed new paragraph 19E(1) by what is called the &quot;appointed person&quot;. That gives the material the appearance of an officially sanctified communication and thus the appearance of veracity, no matter how contentious or how accurate it may be.
</p>

<a name="40607-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>I accept that these days communications from official sources are sometimes justifiably regarded by the public with a great deal of healthy scepticism. However, such communications in the recognition <br>&nbsp;<br>

procedure, while making the union&#039;s case as forcefully as is reasonably necessary, should indeed, and I believe must, avoid inflammatory and derogatory language.

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>Contrary to what some noble Lords think, the days of &quot;dark and satanic mills&quot; or the grinding of the face of the workers by wicked capitalists have, thankfully, gone.
</p>

<a name="40607-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>The amendment merely requires the unions to exercise a very small degree of moderation in the language they use, and gives the appointed person the power to ensure that they do so in any communication to which he lends his authority.
</p>

<a name="40607-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>I certainly cannot imagine that any responsible union would argue against the basis of this proposition, or indeed would think that it was not necessary. But on the basis of belts and braces, I think that it should stand. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="40607-40_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   I hope the noble Baroness will accept that I approach her looking for peace. I wonder whether she would agree that it would have been much better if the amendment had included a similar phrase about it not being right for any distribution of an inflammatory and derogatory nature about the union from the employer. Surely the provision should cover both sides. Employers can say inflammatory and derogatory things and they should not be allowed to, should they?
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="40607-40_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   I am rather puzzled about this. Perhaps I may ask a question. I do not know the answer, never having appeared before the tribunal. Is not the information given to the tribunal by the employers and the union confidential? Surely, it is not distributed to the press or public; it is information put before the tribunal, which has the privilege of confidentiality. If it contains derogatory or inflammatory material, that merely cuts against those who present it. Am I wrong about that?
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="40607-40_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon:  </b>  I cannot answer my noble friend on that point and perhaps the Minister can. But in answer to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, the amendment is to page 6, line 11. New paragraph 19E(1)(b) goes on to say,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;any information supplied by the union (or unions) to the appointed person&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>It does not talk about any information supplied to the employer. That is why I put down the question on that particular point. It may very well be that one needs to consider the whole thing in its totality. I am not saying that I would not; I simply say that I put it down there because that was the particular part I was dealing with as I went through the matter.
</p>

<a name="40607-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>I listened very carefully indeed to what the Minister said. I intend to withdraw the amendment in a moment, but before I do so he may wish to answer my noble friend while he has the opportunity.

<a name="column_GC25"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC25</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

good deal of the material, certainly in respect of Amendment No. 8, covers some issues which we have discussed. I re-emphasise on the distribution of information that there would be no question of materials being distributed more widely.
</p>

<a name="40607-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>Obviously, the communications that the union wishes to use to go through this process in order to advance its case is a right that is limited in nature. It is right that the union should send written communications to the relevant workers. The union will not send these communications directly; it will give them to the suitable independent person appointed by the CAC who will distribute them to the workers on the union&#039;s behalf. The employer must give the CAC the names and addresses of the relevant workers and the CAC would pass those to the suitable independent person.
</p>

<a name="40607-40_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>There is no question of a wider circulation. No doubt union members will be in direct contact with their union because unions obviously will retain the right to deal with, speak to and advise their members. That right is not interfered with in any respect by the procedures that I have described.
</p>

<a name="40607-40_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>The burden of the issues has probably been covered. The argument has been advanced&#151;I want to consider this very carefully&#151;that the independent person status may change the status of communication that is received by giving it more apparent authority. I suppose that there is a balance to be struck between ensuring that flaws in direct communication, which fly wholly outside the procedure and are potentially vulnerable to all kinds of defects as a result, is a worse outcome than someone receiving something and considering that it is a rather formal communication because it has come from an independent person.
</p>

<a name="40607-40_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>I make that point because the outcome of the whole process&#151;the receipt of materials, the ballot if there has to be one and so on&#151;appears to be one in which people will look hard at legitimacy; they will want to feel secure that the process has been set out in the proper detail; and they will want to feel that legitimacy has been achieved because the process has been worked through thoroughly.
</p>

<a name="40607-40_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>In that light I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, that I would prefer the procedure to take place with that step in it to secure appropriate validity in everyone&#039;s mind at the end of the process, as well as being the better option in the circumstances. That is why it is constructed in this way. I thank her for giving at least preliminary notice of her intention to withdraw the amendment. While I understand the nature of our procedures, none the less that is a courtesy that I respect.

<a name="40607-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 5 shall stand part of the Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="40607-41_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   I speak on this clause because of what I find to be a rather puzzling innovation. I refer to the suitable independent person, the SIP. It looks to me as though opting for a SIP is the introduction to the processes set out in the Bill which lead to recognition. Obviously, I welcome any procedures that make it easier for a union to secure recognition. There is no doubt about that.
</p>

<a name="40607-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>I should perhaps explain that I spent a substantial part of my union career campaigning for recognition. The union of which I was assistant general secretary was, and still is, a major union catering for white-collar employees in private industry and commerce. We recruited substantially in the finance sector. The employers at that time were not used to dealing with unions, except for internal house associations, which they had often been responsible for setting up themselves. When some of these house unions joined the union, the employers were often apprehensive and in some cases actively hostile.
</p>

<a name="40607-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>Obviously, the union sought recognition, but it would not have done so had it not already had a significant number of the staff in membership of the union. We set up union committees and union representatives were elected from within the recruited staff. Access to non-members was therefore not difficult. We issued material via the elected representatives and meetings were held, either on site or adjacent to it, to which non-members were invited and at which union officials were able to explain the benefits of union membership.
</p>

<a name="40607-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>Why, therefore, is the appointment of a suitable independent person required in order for the union to conduct communications with staff? A suitable independent person is clearly not in a position to speak for the union in the way that a union representative or official is able to. A suitable independent person will no doubt charge for services rendered and the charge, presumably, will have to be borne by the union. One can imagine the growth of new opportunities for entrepreneurial consultants of various kinds, all offering services. Is that what is envisaged? If so, why do we need it? I would be interested to know from the Government why it is thought to be either necessary or desirable.
</p>

<a name="40607-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>I repeat that I am in favour of anything that makes it easier for unions to achieve recognition and easier for them to communicate with non-union employees. I do not believe that we need this new type of official who will be a charge of the process. If unions have a real case for recognition, they already have a substantial presence and they are able to communicate with members and non-members.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="40607-41_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   My noble friend has made the case. She has said almost everything that we would want to say. However, I should like to draw the Government&#039;s attention to the Explanatory Notes. I, too, was mystified by the appearance of this character. He is not the same character who conducts the ballot; that is another superior person with a slightly different name.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40607-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>Paragraph 45 of the Explanatory Notes states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;Clause 5 inserts new paragraphs 19C to 19F after paragraph 19B (which is inserted by clause 4). At present, a union(s) may only formally communicate with workers during the period for a CAC ordered ballot&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>Unfortunately the term &quot;formally&quot; is not defined. The unions may only &quot;formally&quot; communicate, so I suppose they can talk to them&#151;make a telephone call&#151;but they cannot write a letter. It continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;Clause 5 provides a right for the union(s) to communicate with the workers in the bargaining unit&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>I take that to mean &quot;formally&quot;&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;from the point of the CAC&#039;s acceptance of the union&#039;s application&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>My first question is: what is this formality that you can do through this character that you cannot do for yourself? Secondly, has anyone asked for this provision? Have the TUC or the CBI asked for it? I cannot find out. Whose idea is this? Suppose a union communicated with the workers without creating and going through this character and said, &quot;We were only informal. Never mind, that is all right&quot;. Or suppose it said: &quot;Well, we communicated with our members&quot;. After all, some of the people in the bargaining unit, as my noble friend said, must be members of the union. Some might have been members for 20 years; some might be shop stewards. We are being told that they cannot be communicated with formally. What can this mean?
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="40607-41_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   Briefly, and for the sake of the record, I say that I wholly&#151;I have had little experience of this kind of affair compared with noble Lords who have spoken, but I have had some&#151;support the objection to this independent person. In a way it is an insult to the competence of the trades unions to manage their affairs as they would wish. I do not understand it at all.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="40607-41_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   I have only one tiny point to make about that. I leave aside the line about which the noble Baroness is concerned, that is the matter of the suitably qualified independent person; the parts the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, took from the Explanatory Notes about &quot;formally&quot;, although I have always understood that the notes were not exactly binding but were advice on the way; and the point made by my noble friend Lord Campbell. And, leaving those aside, Clause 5 is an important clause. It deals with unions&#039; communication with workers after the acceptance of an application. I would have thought that deleting the whole of the clause would wreck that particular part of the Bill. The reason I say that is because I do not understand&#151;but no doubt the noble Baroness or the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, could advise me&#151;why they did not table another amendment. New paragraph 19C(2) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;The union (or unions) may apply to the CAC&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>It does not say that it is obliged to. Perhaps an amendment could have been tabled to delete that without actually going to the length of wishing to <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="40607-41_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   That was my first feeling. The noble Baroness drew my attention to this. She asked me what I thought about the part about Clause 5. I said, &quot;Well, they don&#039;t have to apply if they don&#039;t want to. They only may do it&quot;. But, as the noble Baroness says, it leads in to certain advantages which you do not seem to get unless you decide to have this person. So there are advantages. They are being induced to go into this scheme, but I do not see why.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="40607-41_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   Perhaps I may explain to the noble Baroness why I put down the Motion to oppose the Question that Clause 5 stand part of the Bill. We are in Grand Committee. I wanted to voice my concerns about the clause to see what the Minister had to say about it. Obviously, the matter will not be pressed today as it cannot be in this Committee. The intention was to put on record my concerns about the SIP, what the position meant and to hear what my noble friend would say in reply. Then of course we can decide what to do further.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="40607-41_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I shall take up the invitation to explain how we think this piece of legislation operates. The first thing I must say is that we are dealing here with that element of the legislation which deals with the CAC process and its formal processes and not with the whole of the generality which is built up to a pattern of recruitment and there being sufficient members. Indeed, I know precisely what the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, means because I myself was trained in these matters of recruitment in the forerunner union known as ASTMS. So I recognise the points that have been made.
</p>

<a name="40607-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>Perhaps I may start by trying to answer the questions and then say more about the Government&#039;s intention in the clause. There were several important questions. The TUC supports Clause 5 and the extra ability&#151;and it is additional ability&#151;that it gives to unions to communicate with the workforce. It is not an alternative, but an additional ability. The union is free to communicate with workers by whatever means it sees fit. The use of the word &quot;formally&quot; simply refers to the access which the employer is obliged to facilitate as part of the formal procedure. So it is not a restriction or a want of trust. The point was made that it might be.
</p>

<a name="40607-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>I was asked why the union should not distribute its materials itself rather than through the qualified independent person who might add to the expense and complexity. The Government need to protect the disclosure of personal information to the union. It is likely that some individuals&#151;probably the minority, but who knows&#151;might be unhappy about the union knowing their home addresses. Their interests need to be safeguarded in that respect. Hence we have devised a role for the qualified independent person to act as a go-between.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC29"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC29</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>It is a fairly simple mechanism. It builds on the existing system of communication which is set out for use during the balloting stage, and it is not expensive to the union. Of course unions can continue to use their normal recruitment methods to support their recognition case. The procedure does not stop unions organising off-site meetings or issuing general invitations to the workers to attend through notices in newspapers, leafleting or any of the many methods that over the years trades unions have tried to use.
</p>

<a name="40607-41_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>The point really is about the statutory procedure. It already provides for unions to access the relevant workforce from the time when the CAC has arranged for the holding of a ballot. The access can take two forms. First, the union&#039;s written material can be sent to the workforce by the independent person appointed by the CAC. Secondly, unions are entitled to arrange workplace meetings.
</p>

<a name="40607-41_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>I emphasise, because we are already a little down the track since the 1999 legislation, that these arrangements have broadly worked satisfactorily in the view of the people who have used them. There have been few disputes about arranging access, and businesses have not been disrupted as a result. The workforce know more about the union&#039;s position and are better placed as a result to make an informed decision when casting their votes.
</p>

<a name="40607-41_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>Of course, this access is limited to the short period of the ballot&#151;usually about 20 days. It is also very late in that process. Ballots on average occur about 15 weeks after an application has been lodged with the CAC. Unions have argued that they should be entitled to some form of access at a far earlier stage in the process. They point out that employers have unfettered access throughout the life of an application and have many more weeks to put across their arguments.
</p>

<a name="40607-41_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>The Government see the force of those arguments. Clause 5 therefore provides arrangements which ensure earlier access for the union. This access will start at the point where the CAC accepts a union&#039;s application as admissible. That is a sensible point to require access. Everyone knows that the union&#039;s application is a &quot;runner&quot; at that point and that it meets the basic criteria of the procedure. Everyone can see that in a transparent way.
</p>

<a name="40607-41_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>Concern has been expressed on this point in Committee in the other place. However, I emphasise again that workers&#039; addresses would be seen only by the CAC and the independent persons. Communications would pass through them to the home addresses because that is the only way in which you can protect the confidentiality of home addresses. But it does not alter the rights of trades unions to continue to supply their normal communications.

</p>

<a name="40607-41_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>I believe that the clause therefore strikes a fair balance. Access takes place outside the workplace and so avoids disruption. It has no cost to the employer. The workers will receive and read communications in their own time. Most importantly, the clause recognises the need for workers to be kept informed about the recognition campaign that is being conducted in their name and on <br>&nbsp;<br>

which they will have the opportunity to vote later in the process. That is the right balance which historically has emerged. For those reasons I believe that the clause should stand part.

<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="40607-42_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   I seek some clarification on this. Is it right that all the clause does is to allow the union to apply to the CAC to appoint an independent person to handle these communications? Can a union not do that already? Is there anything to stop it? I am looking at the draft Bill. Is there anything to stop a union asking the CAC to appoint an independent person to handle communications? So far as I am aware, there is not. So, what is all this about? What is the necessity for this? Is it to fit it into some new form of rigid statutory procedure? If that is the object, it seems a fairly futile one.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="40607-42_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I do not think that it is a futile object. Several balancing objectives are in mind. I shall not go over them all again, but it seems to me that they are very important to the central thinking.
</p>

<a name="40607-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>First, this is the part of the procedure where the employer is required to take part. Before the employer is required to take part, everyone should know the ground rules on which they are taking part. Otherwise at some stage there inevitably would be people who scream foul.
</p>

<a name="40607-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>Secondly, the aim is to get material to every worker. It may well be that a small minority, a minority or even a majority of workers would prefer that their addresses remained confidential and were not handed to the union. This is a mechanism&#151;having a cut-out in-between&#151;for that purpose in the process. I think the bulk of the objections or the anxieties that they might have are fully answered&#151;I might argue that they are more than fully answered&#151;but they should certainly give rise to no apprehensions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="40607-42_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   I would like to know where they are fully answered. Is the Minister saying that they have been fully answered this afternoon? Where they should be fully answered is on the face of the Bill. For example, one of the issues that has given rise to concern is that new paragraph 19C(2) says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;The union (or unions) may apply to the CAC for the appointment of a suitable independent person to handle communications&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>That does not specify anything. Much of what the Minister has been telling us today has been about the advantages that would fall to the unions, because they could make the employer do such things. That is an advantage and it should be on the face of the Bill, whereas phrases such as &quot;to handle communications&quot; just give rise to worry.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="40607-42_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I think it is always as well to read the whole of a clause, rather than a few words from it. The words,

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>are precisely in the context of the process that I have described. That is the intention. Although it is not likely to be written into the text of the Bill, I have said <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC31"></a>

this afternoon that there is no intention of disrupting other kinds of communication between a union and its members, nor is there, or has there been at any stage in the work on the Bill, that intention.
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="40607-42_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   We shall see if the Minister will accept an amendment of that kind on the face of the Bill at Report.

That question was asked. It has no such power but the Bill establishes a duty on the employer to supply the addresses to the CAC and that is a necessary condition for the communications to take place. I have stated that in general terms, but that answers the final point that was raised.

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_1"></a><br>
   &quot;REQUIREMENT OF CAC TO ARRANGE FOR BALLOT


   In paragraph 22(4)(a) of Schedule A1 to the 1992 Act (duty of the CAC to make arrangements for a ballot in the interests of good industrial relations), after the words &quot;the CAC is satisfied that&quot; insert &quot;because of special circumstances&quot;.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_57"></a>The noble Lord said: As this is the first time I have contributed to this Committee, there are one or two preliminary remarks that I need to make before turning to the substance of the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40607-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>First, I need to mention that I am a member of the CAC&#151;a body of some 60 members. A dozen are independents who chair the panels on cases under the overall chairmanship of Sir Michael Burton. Two dozen are drawn from an employer&#039;s background and a similar number from a worker&#039;s background&#151;I am one of the latter. I guess that each of the wing members such as myself takes about half a dozen cases in the course of a year.
</p>

<a name="40607-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>I want to make it clear that I am not pretending to represent the CAC, which is obvious. On a separate point, there is actually no CAC policy on the matters that we are discussing, so there is no problem about that. The CAC would recognise the distinction between the technical matters upon which it is consulted, and policy matters, which are strictly for Parliament.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC32"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC32</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>A good example of the former&#151;a technical matter on which the CAC is consulted&#151;is the resources and other implications of the handling of cases under the information and consultation regulations, which we will be hearing about later, that will follow from the Bill and are, in turn, the result of the transposition of the EU directive agreed under the Social Chapter three or four years ago. However, the CAC is obviously not a principal player in the policy issues involved in the directive.
</p>

<a name="40607-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>To take another example, it is clear that on such issues as the cut-off of 21 or more workers for small firms, or the 40 per cent minimum yes vote in a ballot, the CAC does not take a view. There are other examples concerning the architecture of the recognition procedure, on which it does not take a view. I hope that that avoids any potential for misunderstanding.
<a name="time_6"></a>
<a name="40607-42_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40607-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>As has already been revealed in the contributions this afternoon, there is, happily, a great deal of information in the public domain on the experiences of employers and unions on the three years&#039; work so far. There have been annual reports, case reports on the Internet and statements from the TUC and the CBI on the review of the 1999 Act.
</p>

<a name="40607-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>Let me now address the specifics of Amendment No. 12. We are discussing the experience of applying the procedure for a union to seek that the CAC awards recognition without a ballot, based on being able to demonstrate that it has more than half of the bargaining unit in membership. The procedure set out in paragraph 22 of Schedule 1 to the Employment Relations Act 1999 is, I think, sufficiently familiar. There are three provisos, however, to paragraph 22(4) of Schedule 1 to the 1999 Act. Confusingly, it is called the 1992 Act, although it was not introduced by John Major or Mrs Thatcher or anybody of that party. That is a matter for the Public Bill Office. However, I will talk about the 1999 Act for convenience.
</p>

<a name="40607-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>The provisos are exclusively put forward, in practice, by the employer. The employer will have been the resisting party, obviously. If not, it would have made a voluntary recognition agreement. Having challenged at the earlier stage, under the headings of designation and the bargaining unit, the employer will turn to the small print in paragraph 22(4)(a), which indicates that, despite the 50 per cent test having been satisfied, the CAC may order a ballot if it can be demonstrated that it needs to order one,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;in the interests of good industrial relations&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>That time-honoured phrase, respected by everyone in this room, is questioned by no one. The problem is that the provision, as it stands, is rather hard to apply. Indeed, that is an understatement. Let me explain why.
</p>

<a name="40607-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>We have heard reference this afternoon to the judgment of Daniel. The CAC could be in that position, with the union saying that to insist on a ballot in these circumstances of demonstrably over 50 per <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC33"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC33</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

cent membership would be a provocation to good industrial relations. The employer, naturally, would say precisely the opposite.
</p>

<a name="40607-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>Panels of the CAC may feel that they are on uncertain ground, with judicial review looming over them, whichever way they decide on this time-honoured form of words. The fact that Parliament was perhaps not as clear as it might have been, in retrospect, means that the opportunity can and should be taken to clarify what really is behind paragraph 22(4)(a) so that it does not lead to deadlock.
</p>

<a name="40607-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>What are the weight and locus of the qualifications on the one hand, relative to the weight of the main substantive provision on the other? I submit, having looked at the history, that what was meant by paragraph 22(4)(a) was that some special factor needs to be adduced and put before the CAC&#151;a factor which must be convincing in some objective sense with regard to disrupting industrial relations. If that is the case, it needs to be spelt out.
</p>

<a name="40607-42_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>How can we find some test&#151;some wording&#151;which would help to ensure that it is convincing in an objective sense? I have put down these words to convey the meaning that there must be special circumstances. Let us see whether that is a good form of wording. It would not just reopen the earlier stages of the hearing when, for example, the employer was far from reconciled to the inclusion of managers in the bargaining unit and said that that would disrupt industrial relations. That had been decided by the agreement on the bargaining unit. By the stage under discussion, that would be water under the bridge. If that were not so and everything was up for discussion all over again, the CAC panel would simply be going round in circles.
</p>

<a name="40607-42_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>The words &quot;special circumstances&quot; may not be totally without difficulty. But anyone who wishes to make that point should be careful&#151;the only totally unambiguous way out of this would be to abolish the whole of paragraph 22(4). I know&#151;it is self-evident&#151;that my noble friend the Minister is not encouraging me to go down that road. Equally, I assume that he will accept that we need to sharpen up what paragraph 22(4)(a) covers.
</p>

<a name="40607-42_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>I have put forward this amendment in an endeavour to resolve the problem in a way that is as near to consensual as we can find. I beg to move.

The problem is that the words he proposes will not achieve it. If he were to use quite a simple concept and say that the CAC should be satisfied that arrangements should be made for the ballot in the interests of good industrial relations, he would put the exercise of discretion quasi-judicially within the CAC. That cannot be attacked on judicial review unless there is a taint of bad faith or quite exceptional unreasonableness. So I support the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="40607-43_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   The difficulty is that that is where we are at the moment, more or less. In paragraph 22(4)(a), the first qualifying condition is that,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;the CAC is satisfied that a ballot should be held in the interests of good industrial relations&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>As I say, it is the judgment of Daniel. We do not want to promote a philosophical discussion about the nature of industrial relations&#151;I am sure that that was not intended. It was meant to cover a case&#151;I suppose we can hypothesise about what such a case might be&#151;in which there was some very particular factor that meant that just to give recognition without a ballot would be very ill judged in the context and that to do so would require a pretty special set of circumstances. Copies of <i>Hansard</i> in 1999 show that that was what was intended. At present, the problem of judicial review is that it is very hard to pin down the basis on which the CAC can do its job. That is why I suggest that there have to be special circumstances.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="40607-43_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   With respect, if one inserts the expression &quot;special circumstances&quot; into the wording that I have suggested, one cannot do better because one cannot invoke judicial review. One is giving discretion to the CAC to exercise if it thinks that it is in the interests of good industrial relations and that special circumstances obtain. That is not a position which the High Court will investigate unless there is obvious unreasonableness or evidence of bad faith, and we are not concerned with bad faith with the CAC.
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="40607-43_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for endeavouring to be helpful. The problem of judicial review is not the only rationale for the amendment, although it is looming over the CAC on a number of occasions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="40607-43_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   If we look at paragraph 22 of Schedule 1 to the 1999 Act, it is clear that only one of these three qualifying conditions is necessary&#151;any one will do. In a way, it would be more logical if heading (a) came at the end, but it does not, because (b) is quite precise and refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;a significant number of the union members within the bargaining unit inform the CAC that they do not want the union (or unions) to conduct collective bargaining on their behalf&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>There could be evidence for that. You could count that. That is a specific case in which you might say that because of that evidence, a ballot should be held in the interests of good industrial relations.
</p>

<a name="40607-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>The qualifying condition in heading (c) is that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;membership evidence is produced which leads the CAC to conclude that there are doubts whether a significant number of the union members within the bargaining unit want the union (or unions) to conduct collective bargaining on their behalf&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-43_para3"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Heading (a), which refers to the CAC being satisfied that a ballot should be held in the interests of good industrial relations, seems to be an attempt to have a generalisation. There might be many cases&#151;(b), (c) (d), (e) and (f)&#151;which we do not want to put on the face of the Bill so we will have the general requirement that the CAC must be satisfied.

I cannot fault the logic of what has been said about renumbering the headings so that (a) comes after (b) and (c). It would be very helpful. In the spirit of what was intended in 1999, I am quite certain that heading (a) was not seen as a catch-all measure to drive a coach and horses through the provision.

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>When I read Amendment No. 12 during the Recess, I came to the conclusion that what I said at Second Reading was extremely important. We need a consolidating Act. The amendment refers to,

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>which I did not have with me. That schedule is to be found in the 1999 Act, which I also did not have with me. Now we are in debate on the Employment Relations Bill when all these issues arise. If an employee were trying to discover what his rights might or might not be in front of a CAC, it would be impossible to find any information in the framing of the provisions.
</p>

<a name="40607-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>Heading (a), one of the three qualifying conditions which allows the CAC to conduct a ballot, provides that the CAC must be satisfied that a ballot should be held in the interests of good industrial relations. If it is so satisfied, does it not make it somewhat easier than adding the words &quot;because of special circumstances&quot;? We may enter a difficulty over court cases and so forth. I do not believe that the amendment has got to the nitty gritty of what the noble Lord is seeking and it makes things more difficult. However, like other Members of the Committee, I shall listen to what the Minister has to say.

<a name="column_GC36"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC36</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in the difficult position of disagreeing with an employer who says that there would be negative consequences for industrial relations. It is a value judgment against the employer and that is not easy territory for the CAC.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="40607-43_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I thank my noble friend Lord Lea for his explanation and all Members who have taken part in the debate. There is a good deal of expertise in the Committee, which is always helpful on issues of this kind.
</p>

<a name="40607-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>The amendment reflects a concern that there are no guidelines for the CAC in applying the condition in paragraph 22(4)(a)&#151;the condition which allows the CAC to call a ballot of the workers in the bargaining unit where a majority of them are members of the union if it is satisfied that it would be in the interests of good industrial relations to hold a ballot.
</p>

<a name="40607-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>Up till the end of March 2004, unions had claimed majority membership at acceptance in 57 cases. The CAC saw fit to order a ballot in 11 cases where the union opposed the ballot on the grounds that it had a majority in membership. In eight of these cases, this was in whole or in part because the CAC considered that a ballot should be held in the interests of good industrial relations. So only in a minority of cases has the CAC exercised its power under the paragraph. The factors or circumstances which led the CAC to reach these decisions were very varied and it would not be truthful to say, &quot;There you are, there is a clear pattern&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40607-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I should add that there is no evidence to suggest that CAC panels have used their power freely or in a capricious or inappropriate way.

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>[<i>The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 5.49 to 5.59 p.m.</i>]

<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="40607-43_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I think that I had enumerated the cases and their outcomes, and was making the point that there is no evidence to suggest that CAC panels have used their powers freely or capriciously in ways that are inappropriate. None was presented throughout the review of the Employment Relations Act 1999. I am therefore far from convinced that there is a problem that needs to be addressed.
</p>

<a name="40607-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>Moreover, the amendment does not seek to define what should be considered as special circumstances for this purpose, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. I believe that it would be very difficult to do so. The climate of industrial relations in any workplace may be affected by a number of circumstances which are quite specific to that workplace. What counts as a reason to believe that a ballot would improve industrial relations in one workplace may well lead the CAC to the opposite conclusion in another, depending on the attitude of the workers and the parties involved, the recent history of industrial relations at the workplace, and so on.
</p>

<a name="40607-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The Government do not believe, therefore, that it would be appropriate or practical to place a limit on the circumstances which the CAC is able to take into account in reaching a decision on whether paragraph 22(4)(a) is to apply. I ought to emphasise that members <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC37"></a>

of the CAC, including, of course, the noble Lord, Lord Lea, are chosen for their industrial relations expertise. It is very real and very extensive expertise. The Government believe that they are well equipped to judge whether industrial relations are likely to be improved in any particular circumstance. And, of course, were the CAC to order a ballot in the interests of good industrial relations without sufficient grounds in a way that could be considered unreasonable, its decision could be the subject of judicial review, as we have already noted.
</p>

<a name="40607-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, said in relation to paragraph 22(4), in making these kind of judgments, it is possible to metricate some things. However, as regards industrial relations, it is impossible to metricate everything. Inevitably, some things will be matters of judgment about whether or not they help the relevant environment. Frequently when issues are discussed at ACAS, it is not a case of measuring something but of trying to find a balance in which everyone accepts that there has been a good industrial relations outcome. &quot;A good industrial relations outcome&quot; is one of the terms that is used frequently in the schedule and for very good reason.

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>In view of the broad range of situations the CAC may be asked to consider, I believe it makes sense to give it a broad discretion to take into account the circumstances it considers relevant in the light of its industrial relations expertise. Defining these circumstances would risk excluding matters which may well in some cases have a considerable bearing on the question of whether a ballot might improve industrial relations.

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>As regards the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, on producing another consolidation Act, I can well see the attraction of it. However, it is not standard practice to undertake frequent consolidations in legislation as they take up so much parliamentary time and absorb a large amount of the Government&#039;s legal resource. The case for undertaking another consolidation of trade union legislation has to be assessed against competing legislative priorities, although I acknowledge that it would be handy on occasion to reach for a single book to find the answers.

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Noble Lords make extensive references to the delicate balances struck in 1999. Those delicate balances go back years before then. As is well known, I was, wearing my TUC hat, involved in writing the report, <i>Your Voice at Work</i>, of which the matter that we are discussing was a principal component.

</p>

<a name="40607-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>It was never intended that panels should be put in the position whereby the easy way out&#151;everyone is human&#151;is to say, &quot;Let us require a ballot&quot;. That always sounds reasonable, but that was not Parliament&#039;s intention. It was not intended that whenever an employer says that there ought to be a ballot, that mantra should be accepted. I use the word &quot;mantra&quot; advisedly as who can be against good industrial relations? Who can be against having a ballot? However, the fact is that a ballot in many circumstances, not only from the union viewpoint&#151;one has to see the opposite argument too&#151;will involve the whole caravanserai of the hustings&#151;I shall discuss Amendment No. 13 in a moment&#151;and everything that concerns the manipulation of opinion.
</p>

<a name="40607-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>All is fair in love and war but I refer to a certain tendency on the part of employers. This applies exclusively to employers because obviously all three of the provisos that we are discussing are employers&#039; provisos, not union provisos, and will be deployed by employers. It would be a sad day if it were felt&#151;I believe that trade unions consider that this is the case&#151;that together the three measures undermined the 50 per cent membership provision and rendered it nugatory.

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>As has been said, the CAC is comprised of experienced people, but there are three people on a panel: one is independent, one represents the workers&#039; side and the other the employers&#039; side.

For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>After Clause 5, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_2"></a><br>
   &quot;REQUIREMENT OF CAC TO ARRANGE FOR BALLOT (NO. 2)


   In paragraph 22(4)(b) of Schedule A1 to the 1992 Act (duty of the CAC to make arrangements for a ballot), after the words &quot;on their behalf&quot; insert &quot;and the CAC is satisfied that the provision of the information was not initiated or induced by the employer&quot;.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_70"></a>The noble Lord said: This is another modest amendment&#151;it may be a mistake to make modest amendments&#151;to make explicit what I believe is Parliament&#039;s intention; namely, to make explicit a way of handling what is now an unintended loophole in the wording of the 1999 Act.
</p>

<a name="40607-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>Paragraph 22(4)(b) of Schedule 1 to the 1999 Act provides that the procedure for recognition without a ballot is subject to three different provisos. We discussed one of them a moment ago.
</p>

<a name="40607-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>This one concerns the scenario where it is alleged that a significant number of employees in the bargaining unit who are union members do not want union recognition for collective bargaining purposes and they write to the CAC to this effect.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC39"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC39</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>What is perplexing is that the consequence of the present wording is that any employer who does not want union recognition&#151;and that, let us remember, is 100.000 recurring per cent of employers in the case we are studying, or else they would have concluded voluntary agreements, as my noble friend has already pointed out&#151;is sorely tempted to go down the road of ghost writing letters or inspiring letters&#151;a road full of moral hazard. It is easy to see how this can seem attractive. An employer will identify one or two union members, have a quiet word in their ear about their prospects&#151;not too much need be said&#151;and get them to help with a letter or a petition. Everyone in this room will, I think, appreciate that this is light years away from what was intended by the authors of the 1999 Act. We talked of members who of their own volition were to inform the CAC that they did not want the union to represent them for collective bargaining purposes. Such letters, if any such emerged, were meant to be considered if written individually direct to the CAC and certainly not if written on employers&#039; headed notepaper or photocopied letters drafted by the employer with a space for the person to sign.
</p>

<a name="40607-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>It was never intended that such letters should be put in front of workers in a one-to-one interview&#151;a typical American technique&#151;accompanied by hints about the worker&#039;s future prospects, and then transmitted to the CAC. Hence the purpose of the amendment is to make it absolutely clear that information under paragraph 22(4)(b) should not be taken on board if it is initiated or induced by the employer.
</p>

<a name="40607-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>I know that the point could, of course, be made that if the union does not like this sort of interference with the views of its members, all it has to do is to agree to a secret ballot&#151;I refer to the discussion we had five minutes ago&#151;but that is a sort of blackmail and would be strongly considered a threat to good industrial relations on the part of the trade union.
</p>

<a name="40607-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>I wish to say a few words about confidentiality and the protection of human rights. I was interested to hear the earlier discussion in this regard. A balance has to be struck between the need for the CAC to validate information and the protection of individuals who could be victimised. We can all agree on that. However, the rights of the individual are not protected if the employer can demand to know who has signed a letter as a union member stating that he or she does not wish the union to represent them in pay negotiations.
</p>

<a name="40607-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>The fact that the union has, of course, already had to demonstrate its support through a petition&#151;that is a quite separate part of the procedure&#151;shows that we must be careful to use terminology with care.
</p>

<a name="40607-44_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>The form of words that I have put down makes it absolutely clear that the CAC will not take into account as evidence&#151;as purported evidence of the views of union members&#151;&quot;round robins&quot; initiated or induced by the employer. The elimination of such letters would be no more and no less than what <br>&nbsp;<br>

Parliament intended in the first place. I trust that there will be general support for this amendment. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="40607-44_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The first and third conditions of paragraph 22(4) give the CAC some discretion. There is no corresponding discretion for the CAC to judge, in the light of the evidence before it, the issues that my noble friend Lord Lea has just raised&#151;whether the information presented to it shows that a significant number of union members do not want to be represented in a collective bargaining arrangement by their union.
</p>

<a name="40607-44_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>As my noble friend said, unions have alleged in some cases that employers have asked workers to sign letters under duress in order to make the case for ending the collective bargaining arrangement and the recognition that goes with it. They claim that the wording of paragraph 22(4)(b) is problematic because the CAC cannot consider whether the information provided to it is a genuine expression of union members&#039; views or has been coerced or accumulated in some other way. This view appears to have been shared by at least one CAC panel. In the case of Brian Hewitt Construction Limited and the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation union, the panel&#039;s decision states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;It is manifest from the language in paragraph 22(4)(b) that the issue is simply whether the CAC is informed by a significant number of union members that they do not want the union to conduct collective bargaining on their behalf&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-44_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>The panel&#039;s decision continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;The Panel is of the view that the law makers did not envisage the condition being manipulated in the manner that the Company has done in this case. However, the Panel is constrained by the open nature of the wording of the paragraph&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-44_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>I do not intend to comment in any detail on any judgment of the CAC. However, when discussing the previous amendment, I said that the expertise of members of a CAC was a decisive factor regarding the CAC&#039;s judgment and jurisdiction. Therefore, I give weight to what a CAC panel has said. Clearly, however, this condition has posed difficulties for the CAC and the parties. As we have consistently made clear, the Government strongly condemn the pressuring or coercion of workers to sign anything or to make any statement against recognition. We equally condemn any attempt by a union to pressure workers to support it. Coercion is ruled out in either direction.
</p>

<a name="40607-44_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>We consider, therefore, that there may be value in looking at this question. We are not convinced, however, that my noble friend&#039;s amendment gets it quite right. We must ensure that we do not prevent an employer letting union members know that they can inform the CAC if they want an issue raised. Nor would we wish to prevent an employer from assisting a worker to do so, if that was the genuine wish of the worker rather than the result of coercion.
</p>

<a name="40607-44_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Unions also initiate petitions and letters of support from workers at other stages of the process. It is obviously important that both parties should be able to inform workers about the ways in which they can make their views known.

</p>

<a name="40607-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>As the noble Baroness said, the amendments seek to extend the period in which a worker may reasonably request a postal ballot because he or she will be absent from the workplace on the day of a workplace ballot. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC42"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC42</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

As drafted, Clause 7 states that the CAC must make arrangements for a worker who is unable to vote in person at the workplace&#151;because of matters relating to him or her as an individual&#151;to have the opportunity to vote by post if the worker concerned requests it far enough in advance of the ballot for this to be practicable.
</p>

<a name="40607-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>These amendments seek to ensure that such arrangements must be made where a worker&#039;s request is made far enough in advance of the end of the ballot. I respect, of course, the noble Baroness&#039;s intention which is to ensure that as many workers as possible have the opportunity to vote. Of course, we share that objective entirely. Indeed, that is why we introduced the right to vote by post for workers who are absent from the workplace for legitimate reasons, for example being on annual leave or having time off for public duties such as jury service.
</p>

<a name="40607-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>However, the amendments will not in the overwhelming majority of cases buy workers much time. A large number of workplace ballots take place on a single day. All the others take place within two days although we found one case of a ballot taking as long as three days. Therefore, we are not talking about a significantly extended period for the worker to exercise his proper right to participate in the ballot.
</p>

<a name="40607-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>Of course, these amendments may give workers who are unexpectedly absent on the day of the ballot, perhaps through illness, an opportunity to vote, rather than missing their one chance. However, this would mean that the worker was too ill to go to work but well enough to make his representation to submit a postal ballot before the close of voting, which, as I have indicated, constitutes a very limited period of time in most ballots.
</p>

<a name="40607-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>So I am not convinced that the amendment would deliver any significant benefit. It would, of course, pose some practical difficulties for the qualified independent person appointed to conduct the ballot. Under this amendment the QIP could not be sure, even on the morning of the ballot, who would be voting in person and who would be voting by post. This would unnecessarily complicate the QIP&#039;s job and inevitably delay the process.
</p>

<a name="40607-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>In any ballot or election there must be a cut-off for the sending out of postal ballot papers. Such limits apply in our public elections where we require persons to request a postal vote well in advance of election day. This is essential to ensure that the relevant authorities can keep track of how and when people are entitled to vote. It also ensures fairness so that no voter can gain advantage by voting after the majority have done so when a picture may already be appearing of how the various parties have fared.
</p>

<a name="40607-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>Of course, this does mean that some voters who wish to vote are unable to do so. As I say, I recognise the noble Baroness&#039;s intention to make it as feasible as possible for people to cast their vote. However, accommodating people who discover on the very day of the ballot that they cannot vote at the last minute is neither practical nor fair to other voters.

<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="40607-45_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   I am extremely disappointed with the Minister&#039;s answer to this simple amendment. Line 31 on page 8, Clause 7, states that the worker has,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;to be given the opportunity (if they request it far enough in advance of the ballot for this to be practicable) to vote by post&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="40607-45_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>The Minister commented that often the ballots are done in one day. I did not include the provision that they should request it far enough in advance&#151;it is in the Bill. I was saying merely that if the worker has to decide whether the request is far enough in advance of the ballot, he needs to know when the close of the ballot will be. That is important. If a postal vote is requested, why must it be far in advance? If it happens in one day&#151;one, two, three quick and it is over&#151;it is an extraordinary state of affairs.

</p>

<a name="40607-45_para22"></a>

<a name="40607-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>Important though a ministerial statements are on all occasions&#151;we all weigh our words with the greatest of care and no one is better at that than the present Secretary of State&#151;when the courts are looking at what Ministers intend, they are looking at something different from a response to an interjection in a winding-up speech. That is when a particular point is made and a Minister responds.
</p>

<a name="40607-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>It would not be on every occasion that we would think that all ambiguities could be avoided. Sometimes the question itself can be slightly misunderstood. We have all made that mistake. In any case, interjections are part of the cut and thrust of debate. Therefore, when the noble Baroness says that it is important that ministerial statements form part of our legislative process because Minister&#039;s comments are often partly taken into account in future judgements, that is on a more substantial basis than a response to an interjection from a Back-Bencher from whichever side of the House. It happens very much in the context of a statement introducing a Bill or, perhaps, at the final Third Reading stage when a considered position is put forward by a Minister.
</p>

<a name="40607-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>In this case a great deal is being made out of a small development. The Secretary of State was referring to Clause 7 of the Bill. The clause tries to permit as many people as possible to vote in recognition and derecognition ballots. It does that by providing for postal votes to be accorded to workers who are absent from work on days when workplace ballots take place. In this way workers on sickness or maternity leave or <br>&nbsp;<br>

staff on residential training courses can exercise their entitlement to vote. The objective of the clause is a laudable one to which we can all subscribe. Its effect is to reduce the number of unintentional abstentions during these ballots. The turnout, and therefore the broad representativeness of the ballot, should increase at the margin as a consequence of the provision.

</p>

<a name="40607-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>It follows that my right honourable friend&#039;s remarks do not imply that the treatment of abstentions will be changed, as the noble Baroness was kind enough to recognise. The Bill does not change the concept of abstentions and how they will be treated and that is not the intention behind the Government&#039;s proposals. When workers decide not to vote at all, the CAC&#151;as the noble Baroness agreed&#151;should not draw any inferences about such preferences. Under the current statutory procedure, abstentions have their normal meaning as votes that are neither in favour or against the proposition in question. I am grateful for a further opportunity to put on the record that that will remain the case. That is why the amendment has given us the chance to clarify what I believe has been a misinterpretation of what occurred in the other place. I consider the amendment to be unnecessary because it is not intended that any change should be effected in this matter.
</p>

<a name="40607-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>I should add that the Bill does not change the 40 per cent rule, either. We will debate separate amendments to be moved by my noble friends on the 40 per cent rule and we will be able to deliberate further. For now I am responding to this amendment and, I hope, with the assurances that I have given, that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw it.

<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="40607-46_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   That is an unusual answer. I made it clear that the Bill does not change the matter. But I also said that the issue was raised in the other place when someone asked the Secretary of State if she would please look again at these rules, because, in effect, they count abstentions as &quot;no&quot; votes. That was the precise point that was raised. The Minister did not shoot that down out of hand and simply said that it was an important point that the Government would look at during their review of the 1999 Act.
</p>

<a name="40607-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>If it was such an unimportant point, all that the Minister needed to say was to confirm that if someone does not vote it would simply mean that they had not voted.
</p>

<a name="40607-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>If they abstain, it would count as a &quot;no vote&quot;. That is not returning to my comments that it was not in the Bill, but I was talking about the interpretation that judges might put on the matter. I can tell the Minister that I have taken legal advice on that particular point. The Minister said that it would not be counted as something important. If that is the case, it would be extremely easy to put it on the record that I am correct&#151;that if someone abstained it would just mean that they had not voted and would count as a &quot;no vote&quot; with no other obligation.

I explained that, as I understood the position, there was no intention to make any change, nor could there be, as a result of an exchange in the other place between a questioner and the Minister. That would be fresh interpretation of the legislation, particularly as it is still passing through this House, and we have another opportunity to put it on the record that we do not intend to change the status of abstentions.

It can be that one is different from the other. That has happened in many cases. The Minister said that this is a trivial point and that it would not apply. It does apply in some cases and it is necessary to have the matter on the record for the sake of clarification. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>

<a name="40607-46_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>This new clause, which I suppose was an afterthought, because it was not in the original Bill but was in the Bill brought from the other place, introduced additional burdens on employers for when they are notified of the requirement to arrange a ballot on recognition. Employers have argued that these are extremely onerous and inappropriate and the Government have not given sufficient justification for this late insertion into the Bill. Certainly, they have not pointed to any case, event or practice that justifies it. However, the substantial amendments to the Bill introduced by the Government on 24 May go a long way, in my view, to meeting those criticisms, and I will revert to that when we discuss these government amendments.
</p>

<a name="40607-46_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>One specific issue in the new measures is the meaning of the words &quot;undue influence&quot; in new paragraph 27A(2)(f) to Schedule A1 of the 1992 Act. As an aside, that jumble of descriptions of the position of the paragraph shows what a nightmare jigsaw the current legislation is. I do not dare make another plea to the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, for an early consolidating Act.
</p>

<a name="40607-46_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>&quot;Undue influence&quot; is a legal term of art, with a specific meaning assigned to it by judicial decisions going back a very long time. I found one case decided by your Lordships&#039; House in 1857&#151;almost 150 years ago. That is the leading case, and the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Cranworth, ruled that the essential element of undue influence was &quot;coercion or fraud&quot;. The need for that essential ingredient has been followed in many subsequent cases. In 1885, the president of the probate and divorce division said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;To be undue influence in the eyes of the law, there must be&#151;to sum it up in one word&#151;coercion&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-46_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>Amendment No. 17 removes the inappropriate legal phraseology from the Bill and removes the temptation for some lawyer or other to try to suggest that normal reasoned argument or a moderate attempt at persuasion by an employer is somehow improper. It substitutes the plain simple concept that coercion is an objectionable and forbidden practice. With that word, there can be no argument as to what is or is not permitted.
</p>

<a name="40607-46_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>Amendment No. 18 to this same provision makes it clear what its objective is, and introduces an element of even-handedness between the employer and the union, since it proscribes using coercion to persuade a worker to vote either for or against the proposition. I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="40607-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>The amendments seek to narrow the scope of unfair practices and unfair practice provisions by replacing the unfair practice of using or attempting to use undue influence with coercing or attempting to coerce a worker so as to influence or persuade him to vote for or against any proposition.

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC48</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to make sure that I have that right. All I can say now is that it is more recent than Thomas Jefferson, and is therefore closer to my own life.
</p>

<a name="40607-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>I must confess that I find the formulation used in Amendment No. 18 a little difficult to grasp. It seems to conflate the concepts of coercion, persuasion and influence so that it would be an offence to attempt to coerce a worker so as to attempt to influence or persuade him. This seems more convoluted than I think was the intention, from what the noble Baroness said. I am not sure that the references to influence or persuasion add to the meaning. It would be simpler just to make it an unfair practice to coerce or attempt to coerce a worker to vote or not to vote a particular way. In addition, these amendments would create an imbalance in the schedule. Similar amendments would have to be made to Clause 12 to ensure that derecognition provisions mirror those for recognition.
</p>

<a name="40607-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>I should add that the amendment does not deal with the possible case, important in these situations, where a worker is coerced to abstain from voting. So I think that the amendment is defective, even in its own terms.
<a name="time_10"></a>
<a name="40607-47_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40607-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>However, let me address the noble Baroness&#039;s difficulty with the existing wording of the clause. It appears she is concerned that undue influence is too broad a concept. Undue influence is a term borrowed from the law&#151;the Representation of the People Act 1983&#151;prohibiting illegitimate campaigning in public elections. It is borrowed from that because its clarity is always seen to be the greatest when trying to determine whether someone is being induced to vote in a fair or unfair way.
</p>

<a name="40607-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>However, it also includes behaviours such as the threat to coerce or use force; causing or threatening injury, damage, harm or loss; and the impediment of the free exercise of the vote by fraudulent device or contrivance. Reducing the scope of this provision would mean, therefore, that activities other than coercion, but perhaps equally reprehensible activities, would not be caught. In particular, it is not clear that threatening behaviour would be an unfair practice under the procedure; nor would deliberately making false or misleading statements, impersonating another party or interfering with the voting process. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, would not wish any such behaviour to go unpunished under the statutory procedure; nor would she have intended that.
</p>

<a name="40607-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>We are aware that the stakeholders have been unsure about the meaning of the words &quot;undue influence&quot;. As we have made clear to them, attempting to provide an exhaustive definition of this term would limit the effectiveness of the unfair practices provisions in a way that no one would wish for or intend. We would inevitably miss some forms of improper campaigning, and experience in other countries has shown that, where parties are determined to intimidate, they can be very creative indeed in finding ways of getting round the law.

</p>

<a name="40607-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>We therefore need a general test that will catch all possible cases of intimidatory or similar behaviour. The term &quot;undue influence&quot;, which exists in other legal statutes and whose efficacy has been seriously tested, serves a necessary purpose and the clause would be poorer without it.
</p>

<a name="40607-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>The Government intend to produce a code of practice on unfair practices which will provide clear guidance to the parties on the meaning of &quot;undue influence&quot; and the kind of conduct it is likely to cover. We will of course consult fully with stakeholders on that code in draft.
</p>

<a name="40607-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>These amendments could potentially&#151;we believe that they would&#151;undermine the effectiveness of the unfair practices provisions. Therefore, I respectfully urge the noble Baroness to withdraw them and I give the undertaking that the code of practice should deal with these matters exhaustively.

&quot;(   )   It is not an unfair practice within the meaning of sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) if the union as part of its campaign for recognition sets out in general terms the benefits of union membership.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_91"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 19, I shall speak also to our Amendment No. 26 to Clause 12, with which it is grouped. Both amendments deal with a similar issue: the first concerns recognition and the second derecognition.

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>Obviously, the Bill seeks to prevent pressure being put on employees&#151;either by direct threat or in other ways&#151;to try to ensure a particular result. There needs to be protection against intimidation and, of course, against violence. In the Bill, the Government have been anxious to ensure that they are seen to be even-handed.

</p>

<a name="40607-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>The Government&#039;s own amendments, which we shall shortly be debating, seek to clarify this clause. They specifically refer to the inadmissibility of violence or the dismissal of any employee. I am sure that most people would agree with that.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC50"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC50</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-47_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>I think that those constraints are important, but a union seeking recognition and an employer opposing it are not in positions of equality. An employer holds all the cards. He can indicate in all kinds of ways that a pro-recognition vote would have devastating consequences. Therefore, the Government are right to spell out in their amendment that certain actions cannot be taken.
</p>

<a name="40607-47_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>However, as the wording now stands, it would be possible for an employer to claim that a union was in breach of the provisions in these clauses simply because it was setting out as part of its general campaign the benefits of union membership. The employer could make an application to that effect to the CAC, claiming that offers were being made to employees in order to get them to vote for recognition.
</p>

<a name="40607-47_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>Without an appropriate amendment to the wording of the Bill, the CAC could well feel that there was merit in such an application. Hence the wording of our amendment, which sets out clearly that it would not be an unfair practice within the meaning of the relevant sections of the Bill&#151;either in relation to recognition or derecognition&#151;if the union, as part of its campaign, set out in general terms the benefits of union membership. Of course, that is what unions do all the time. They produce leaflets setting out benefits for individuals, often including very important ones, such as access to legal aid and other individual benefits. That is part of a union&#039;s function.
</p>

<a name="40607-47_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>The TUC is aware of this and has already written to me to point out that, without an amendment, the CAC could very well have cause for action simply because a union had emphasised the benefits of union membership as part of its general campaign for recognition.
</p>

<a name="40607-47_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>I note that a code of practice will be produced and I am very pleased to hear about that. But it seems to me that, without something such as this on the face of the Bill, a difficulty could arise. A union rightly setting out in very general terms the benefits of union membership could, to some extent, have the whole recognition process interfered with by a reference to the CAC when that would not be necessary at all and, in any event, the union is simply setting out, as part of its general process, its benefits in order to attract members. I hope that the Government will see that the amendment has some merit. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="40607-47_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   This is one of the most important amendments that we are asking the Government to consider. In a way, it is a very simple matter. The problem has been that the word &quot;benefits&quot; has been confused with the concept of a &quot;bribe&quot;. A benefit is not a bribe and a bribe is not a benefit.
</p>

<a name="40607-47_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>Recently, as a result of attempts to reverse the consequences of the Ullswater amendment, we have been talking a great deal about bribes&#151;that is, bribes by an employer who tries to get people to leave a union by giving them certain incentives. We frequently said that employers were offering benefits, but they were offering a rather different&#151;indeed, a totally different&#151;kind of benefit from the kind that a union says it offers to its members and would-be members.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC51"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC51</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-47_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>Therefore, the whole idea of Clause 9, which concerns unfair practices in relation to recognition ballots, did not come about because of any specific bribes which unions gave, or were said to give, in order to get people to vote in ballots; it came about partly because of the benefits, which were really bribes, that employers gave to get people to leave a union.
</p>

<a name="40607-47_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>Nevertheless, we are not against Clause 9. We favour the clause and we think that all, or most of, the items in it&#151;those relating to coercion, undue influence and so on&#151;could, and therefore should, apply to unions but not benefits because, in this context, benefits are different. Perhaps a different word should be found, but that is not the solution that we are putting forward in our amendment.
</p>

<a name="40607-47_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>It is not only unions that use the argument of benefits. When a union is trying to gain recognition or membership, it says, &quot;We handle grievances; we handle discipline cases; and we have a legal service. We got this much for our members last year&quot;. It quotes its achievements. There is no reason why employers should not quote their own achievements when they struggle to get people to vote the other way in the ballot. They may say, &quot;Well, we gave you very good conditions. You are already earning more than most people who belong to trade unions&quot;. They say, &quot;We have an effective, adequate system of information and consultation that does not require trade unions&quot;. They talk about their benefits and say, &quot;If you join these unions, they will involve you in strikes and you will lose money&quot;. They put forward their argument for not having union representation and the workers and the workers&#039; union put forward their argument regarding the benefits of trade union representation. That has nothing whatever to do with the kind of things that we are trying to strike at in Clause 9. That is why the Government should listen to what we are arguing and take an interest in, and be concerned about, our amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>I start by emphasising that the way in which the clause is framed is rooted in electoral law. It seeks, on the basis of a very well tried system, to ensure that people are not subject to inducements or commit improper actions.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>My noble friends&#039; amendments seek to address concerns that have been raised by the TUC with respect to the definition of unfair practices contained in paragraphs 27A and 119A. The TUC has indicated that it is concerned with the wording of paragraph 27A(2)(a). It is eager to ensure that it should not capture general statements by a union about the benefits of recognition, or, indeed, any other benefits that a union may provide.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>The definition of unfair practices in relation to recognition ballots which we have set out in paragraph 27A(2) draws upon standards of behaviour for public elections as set out in the Representation of the People Act 1983. Paragraph 27A(2)(a) captures the offences of bribery and treating which are set out in that Act. Bribery is the offer of financial reward to a voter in exchange for his voting in a particular way, or for not voting at all. Treating is the offer of non-financial benefits.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>Paragraph 27A(2)(a) states that a party to a recognition ballot uses an unfair practice if he,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;offers anything to a worker entitled to vote in the ballot in return for the worker&#039;s agreement to vote in a particular way or to abstain from voting&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>I think we can all agree that bribery and treating of workers are practices which should be outlawed during recognition and derecognition ballots. Trade unions have, however, expressed concern that the wording of the provision may capture offers which will be legitimately made by a union in the course of a recognition campaign. For example, the union may wish to offer to deploy skilled negotiators who would push for negotiated improvements in terms and conditions if recognition were to be achieved.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>Let me make it clear that the Government are in complete agreement with the trade union partners that this sort of statement, made in the course of legitimate campaigning, should not be considered an unfair practice. We are seeking to protect workers, unions and employers alike from underhand attempts to influence the outcome of a ballot. In doing so, we have taken care to ensure that the parties&#039; right to engage in legitimate campaigning activity is not restricted. I use the word &quot;parties&quot; in the plural because it must be in the plural if this is to be a genuinely fair operation. Positive and responsible campaigning behaviour can only encourage participation and well informed voting choices. We intend to reinforce this in the code of practice.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>I mention the code of practice again because that is where we shall be able to set out detailed guidance for the parties on the sorts of statements which constitute legitimate campaigning, without trying to write a list, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC53"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC53</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which would never be an accurate or a fully exhaustive list, on the face of the Bill. There is no intention whatever to rule out statements of benefits.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>However, the Government&#039;s legal advice is that paragraphs 27A(2)(a) and 119A(2)(a) do not have the effect which the unions fear. Put simply, that is because in order to fall within the meaning of an unfair practice, an offer must be made in return for a worker&#039;s agreement to vote in a particular way or not to vote at all. In the Government&#039;s view, it is difficult to see how the offer by a union of benefits such as improved representation as a consequence of recognition being achieved could be considered to have been made in direct exchange for a commitment by an individual worker to vote in a certain way. We do not believe, therefore, that amendments of this nature are required. In any case, I am not completely convinced that my noble friends&#039; amendments would achieve the effect they desire. There are minor drafting points, as I know there always are at this stage so I shall not labour the point.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>The Government are involved in ongoing discussions with the TUC at both ministerial and official level. The TUC have helpfully provided us with detailed explanations of their concerns and we are giving those very careful consideration. Should our deliberations reveal any doubt that the unfair practices provisions circumscribe the freedom of either party to engage in legitimate campaigning activity, we shall of course consider bringing forward amendments at a later time. I hope that I have been able to reassure my noble friends about their concerns. I respectfully urge them to withdraw their amendments.

<a name="40607-48_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   The noble Lord has not been with us all that long, but we have been here so many times before. It is always said that legal advisers say that such matters will be in codes of practice, but they will never put them on the face of the Bill. It would be so much simpler if this were put on the face of the Bill. We do not necessarily want our words, but just give us some other words.

<a name="40607-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>The Government made up the matter about negotiation; the noble Lord knows that much better than me. If there is a recognition campaign and one is trying to get membership, one will not stop to say, &quot;You will have skilled legal advisers&quot;. That is very sophisticated. One says, &quot;We shall get you more money&quot;, or, &quot;Join this union and next week as soon as you have joined and we get recognition, we will put in a wage increase for another 10 per cent&quot;. That is a benefit. Some people may say that it is a bribe of some kind. So what? Cruel things take place and cruel things are said in such matters.

<a name="40607-48_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>It is no good having legal advisers saying that in sophisticated situations it will not arise. It will arise.

I am glad to learn that it is not the Government&#039;s intention to inhibit the campaigning that unions will do in pursuit of recognition. Of course, my noble friend Lord McCarthy is right. We want to see something on the face of the Bill. We are not wedded to our own words. This is Committee stage and this is a first stab. We tried this wording because we received from the TUC its views on the Bill. We did the best that we could at the time. That does not mean to say that we are wedded to the wording at all.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>We want to consider what has been said. I share the view that we would like something on the face of the Bill. We want it made very clear that if unions set out their stall when they are campaigning, and say, as my noble friend has said, &quot;We can do better for you than you can do for yourself; we are good at collective bargaining; we have a good legal aid system&quot;, and so on, that should not be seen as offering any kind of bribe to workers or giving any kind of excuse to an employer to head off to the CAC and complain that unions are utilising an unfair practice. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC56"></a>

</p>

<a name="40607-48_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>Clause 9 currently contains a power for the Secretary of State to provide by order for the consequences of a finding by the CAC that a complaint of unfair practices is well-founded. The Government signalled their intention to bring forward amendments in your Lordships&#039; House which would remove this power and put on the face of the Bill the remedies available to the CAC where it makes such a finding. I am pleased to present these remedies to the Committee in this group of amendments which provide the sanctions which apply where an unfair practice has been found to have occurred during the period of recognition ballots.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>Grouped with the Government&#039;s amendments is Amendment No. 21 tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, which amends government Amendment No. 20. For clarity I shall deal only with the Government&#039;s amendments and I shall respond to the noble Baroness when she has moved her amendment.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>The substance of the sanctions is contained in Amendment No. 20. The amendment deletes paragraph 27C, which contains the power for the Secretary of State to provide for the sanctions by order. It then adds new paragraphs 27C to F. Those provide that where the CAC finds that a complaint of an unfair practice is well founded it must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, issue a declaration to that effect. This signals clearly to the parties and, more importantly, to the workers in the bargaining unit that the behaviour in question was improper. If it considers it appropriate, the CAC may then issue an order against the party responsible&#151;whichever party it may be&#151;for the unfair practice to take such action as it considers reasonable to mitigate the effect of the unfair practice in question. In addition, it may decide that there should be a fresh ballot.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>If the party in question fails to comply with the CAC&#039;s order or commits another unfair practice after it has received the CAC&#039;s order, then a second sanction may be issued against it. Later this week we shall see the start of the European football competition, to which many of us shall pay great attention, providing that the timetable of the House makes that possible. That is a heartfelt appeal. I believe that I have just described a yellow card and a red card system. In this case, the red card which the CAC may choose to award, depends on which party has committed a second unfair practice. If it is the employer who has ignored an order of the CAC or committed a second unfair practice, then the CAC will be able immediately to issue a declaration that the union is recognised. If the union is responsible for a further unfair practice or for failing to comply with an order to take mitigating action, the CAC may issue a declaration that the union is not entitled to be recognised.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>This system is fair and workable. The CAC&#039;s ability to issue an order against a first-time offender ensures that the parties are given an opportunity to correct their behaviour. Should they fail to do so, however, this amendment provides for a strong sanction. I believe that this will act as a significant deterrent for any party contemplating furthering its own cause through illegitimate campaigning.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC57"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC57</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40607-48_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>There are two exceptions to this &quot;two strikes and you&#039;re out&quot; approach. I have now mixed metaphors&#151;one relating to football and the other to the United States&#151;for which I apologise. The first concerns violent conduct. British industrial relations are peaceful industrial relations, which is good to say, and for the most part the parties seek to resolve their differences through dialogue. However, we know from the experience of other countries that certain parties have had resort to the violent intimidation of workers. There can be no place for such conduct in a civilised society.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>The Government have therefore provided that, where a party is guilty of committing an unfair practice involving violence, the CAC will have the discretion to declare immediate recognition or declare that the union is not entitled to be recognised, even where it is a first offence. That would be a straightforward matter, quite apart from anything that may occur in terms of criminal law.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>The same will apply to unfair practices by an employer which involve the dismissal of a union official. A union official is defined at Section 119 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1992. As well as a full-time officer of the union, a union official is any person elected or appointed in accordance with the rules of the union to be a representative of all or some of its members, including representatives who are employed by the same employer as the members whom he represents. In other words, this category covers the lay representatives of an unrecognised union.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>The union&#039;s activist is normally vital to any campaign for recognition. He or she is the union&#039;s main point of contact with the workers and the main source of information about the progress of the campaign. Unfortunately, it is not inconceivable that a small minority of employers might seek to undermine the union&#039;s campaign by dismissing such a representative without justification. Unions allege that such behaviour has already occurred.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>It is not hard to imagine the effect that that will have on the workers in the bargaining unit. The message is clear: vote for the union and you risk the same fate. Of course, employers must retain the right to discipline and dismiss their workers where that is called for. These measures do not seek to interfere with that right at all. However, where such a dismissal is made with the intention of intimidating other workers and damaging the union&#039;s ability to campaign fairly, the Government believe that it is right that the CAC should be able to impose the strongest sanction. Again, we are sending a clear message that such behaviour will not be allowed to undermine the statutory procedure.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>These amendments have been designed to ensure that the CAC has sufficient discretion to ensure that it can take into account all the circumstances of the case before it. Cases where allegations of unfair practices are made may be complex, perhaps involving both claims and counter-claims about intimidatory behaviour. The context in which any unfair practice occurred and the behaviour of all the actors involved <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC58"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC58</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

will be important in determining what sanction is appropriate and, in particular, whether it merits the strongest sanction. Moreover, a formal sanction may not be required where the intimidatory behaviour has backfired and workers have effectively punished the guilty party at the ballot box. The structure we have provided will allow the CAC to take into account all the circumstances of the case in order to decide whether a particular sanction is appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>I draw the Committee&#039;s attention to the arrangements for the CAC to require that a further ballot be held. Where it finds that an unfair practice has occurred and the ballot has either closed or is already underway, it will be open to the CAC to order that a new ballot be held. The results of the first ballot may have been tainted in the eyes of the parties on both sides. We believe it is important that all the parties can have faith in the result of the ballot.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>That is why it is important that the CAC should have the ability to order a further ballot where the result is above suspicion. We do not envisage that the CAC would choose to re-run a ballot where the party responsible for the unfair practice had lost the original ballot.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>Amendment No. 22 makes it clear that, where the CAC exercises its discretion to call a second ballot, it is no longer under a duty to reveal to the parties the result of the first ballot. That is essential, otherwise it would taint the second ballot.
</p>

<a name="40607-48_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>Amendments Nos. 29, 90, 91, 92 and 93 make consequential amendments to others parts of the Bill and to the parts of the schedule which contain cross-references to declarations of recognition by the CAC to include declarations under the CAC&#039;s new powers. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>The Government&#039;s amendments to Clauses 9 and 12, introduced on 24 May, are intended to remedy deficiencies in the Bill following the Government&#039;s introduction of the concept of dealing with unfair practices in relation to recognition ballots in new Clause 9 and in relation to unfair practices in relation to derecognition ballots in new Clause 12.
</p>

<a name="40607-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>Subject to what I shall say in a moment about Amendment No. 21, I say at once that I appreciate the fact that the Government have implemented the promise that the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, made to me to introduce amendments to <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40607-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>The new amendments do, indeed, go a very long way to meeting those concerns. In consequence, I was able to withdraw what I considered to be my somewhat more succinct amendments on that subject. However, I believe that some further tightening up of the provisions would not go amiss, and I hope that the Government will consider what I am about to say with a view to further tweaking. I do not expect the Minister to make a decision about that today. However, if, at some stage, he would like to write to me, I shall be happy to receive a letter.
</p>

<a name="40607-49_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>I should like to see a union prohibited from relying on votes of persons who have been members for less than three months, who are in arrears with their union subscriptions or who have been made members of the union without paying any subscription. Members of the Committee who are members of a political party will recognise that that is a fairly standard provision&#151;at least, it is in my party&#151;to prevent a meeting being packed or a ballot box being stuffed.

</p>

<a name="40607-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>I say at once that I do not suggest that to take part in a recognition ballot an employee must either be a member of a union or must promise to become one. The Bill, and the previous Acts that it is amending, do not impose any such qualification on an employee before he can vote in a recognition ballot. If the Government are willing to accept the principle of this point, I certainly agree that they should simultaneously remove any possible misunderstanding or ambiguity relating to the matter. I think that it is clear but the noble Lord may not agree.
</p>

<a name="40607-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>The new paragraph and the Government&#039;s amendment should also make it absolutely clear that the decision about the existence of coercion or intimidation rests entirely within the discretion of the CAC. To avoid disruption of recognition procedures and litigation over possibly minor infractions by either side, the CAC should have the power to ignore it if it believes that any such activity is not significant to the outcome of the ballot.
</p>

<a name="40607-49_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>That brings me to my Amendment No. 21. New paragraph 29D(4) proposed by the Government gives the CAC power to close down the recognition procedure if it is satisfied that a union has been guilty of what sub-paragraph (1) of that paragraph calls an &quot;unfair practice&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40607-49_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>My amendment to the Government&#039;s amendment would provide that, if the CAC found itself obliged to impose that drastic sanction, the recognition process should not be restarted for a period of three years. That is identical to the period already stipulated by Parliament&#151;buried, I believe, somewhere in Schedule A1 to the 1992 Act, as amended by the 1999 Act, and referred to in the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lea, which follows Clause 10.
</p>

<a name="40607-49_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>It would be farcical for the CAC to dismiss the recognition claim because of union misconduct on Monday, only to find it starting it again on Tuesday. <br>&nbsp;<br>

For the sanction to have any meaning at all, it needs to be coupled with a suitable period of self-denial. For the union to avoid the sanction, which only the CAC can impose, it simply must not indulge in what the Government have defined as an unfair practice.
</p>

<a name="40607-49_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Triesman, wrote to me following my speech at Second Reading. He complained that the amendment tabled in the other place by my honourable friend the Member for North West Norfolk to deal with intimidation said nothing about intimidation of workers by employers. I agree with that criticism as I know my honourable friend would, had he been allowed to debate his amendment, which under the rules of the other place he was prevented from doing.
</p>

<a name="40607-49_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>The government amendment to Clause 12 covers the point. It gives the CAC the same sanctions over derecognition procedures if there is intimidation by employers as applies to unions in the case of the recognition procedure. The Minister in his letter to me mentioned union complaints of,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;evidence of this sort of behaviour by employers&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40607-49_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>I do not doubt for one moment that such allegations may have been made. I cannot, of course, comment on their validity. I certainly do not want to get into a tit-for-tat argument about who has done what. I place on record that I am sure that the Minister and the Committee are at one in deploring any bad behaviour on either side in this kind of procedure. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="40607-49_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   The amendment is directed at unions in particular, so that they cannot apply for recognition for a period of three years. Does the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, consider that the same provision would be appropriate to an employer seeking derecognition but failing to get it? Would he be ruled out on the same basis? Would an employer be unable to attempt derecognition for three years?
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="40607-49_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   The noble Baroness makes an interesting and probably correct point. I shall certainly consider that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="40607-49_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for the way in which she has made her point. It was conspicuously even-handed. I also apologise for the length of my comments in introducing the new raft of material. It would have been silly to deal with serious new material casually.
</p>

<a name="40607-49_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>Amendment No. 21 ensures that where the CAC has issued a declaration that the union is not entitled to be recognised because it has committed serious or repeated unfair practices, the union may not make a further application in respect of the same employer and the same bargaining unit for a period of three years.
</p>

<a name="40607-49_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>The amendment is not necessary to achieve exactly that result. The Government&#039;s policy is that where the CAC declares that a union is not entitled to be recognised on the grounds of unfair practices, that union may not apply for recognition for the same bargaining unit, or a very similar one, for a period of three years. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC61"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC61</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government believe that it is important that once an application under the statutory procedure has reached its conclusion, there should be a period in which industrial relations are allowed to settle without the risk of continuous disruption through repeated applications. In the negotiations which led to the settlement contained in the 1999 Act, it was agreed that three years is a suitable period of time.
</p>

<a name="40607-49_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>This policy is certainly not explicitly stated in Clause 9 because it is already provided for in the recognition schedule. Paragraphs 33 to 42 of the schedule set out the admissibility criteria which any application for recognition must meet in order to be accepted by the CAC. Paragraph 39 provides that an application for recognition is not admissible if the CAC has accepted an application in respect of the same or substantially the same bargaining unit in the previous three years (paragraphs 33 to 42).
</p>

<a name="40607-49_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>Paragraph 39 will also apply without any need for amendment where the CAC had issued a declaration that the union is not entitled to be recognised under paragraph 27D(4). Such a declaration may be issued where the union has committed a violent unfair practice or repeated unfair practices, or because it has failed to comply with an order of the CAC to take action to mitigate the effects of an unfair practice that it has committed.
</p>

<a name="40607-49_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>I should add that the three-year moratorium also applies in the case of derecognition, which was a question asked by my noble friend. I note that the noble Baroness has not tabled a corresponding amendment to government Amendment No. 27, but she was generous enough to say that it was an issue to which she would wish to attend. However, it is covered in the legislation. Where an employer&#039;s application for derecognition fails because he is guilty of committing unfair practices, a similar three-year moratorium will <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC62"></a>

<b>7 Jun 2004 : Column GC62</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

apply on further applications to derecognise the union. The same will apply to failed applications by a worker or workers.
</p>

<a name="40607-49_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>The Government have already ensured that there will be a moratorium on further applications where a party loses its case as a sanction for having committed an unfair practice. For clarity that is needed. I respectfully ask that the amendment be withdrawn, given the assurances that I have been able to give. I believe that we have made the changes that my noble friend Lord Sainsbury said we intended to make. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for reminding the Committee of that as well.

This will be the Government&#039;s seventh annual report (the first report was published in 1997).

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="40607-50_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  In response to the House of Lords Select Committee on Genetic Databases report, the Government made a commitment to carry out an investigation into the impact of current UK law and practice regarding patents for genetic sequences. I am pleased to announce that the Intellectual Property Institute (IPI) on behalf of the DTI has now completed this study.
</p>

<a name="40607-50_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The Government welcome the main findings of the study, which show that current UK law and practice regarding patents for genetic sequences is generally meeting the needs of those currently active in this research area. The study indicates that this is true for both public and private sectors.

</p>

<a name="40607-50_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>In its recommendations the study identifies two key areas that could be addressed, to improve the current situation further: reducing uncertainty about the extent of the patent research exemption; and improving the public perception of the patenting of biotechnological inventions.
</p>

<a name="40607-50_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>Work is now being undertaken to explore how best to take these two issues forward.

However these statistics are not reliable, as Iraqis often bury their deceased relatives without official notification/registration. This has been particularly true during periods of heightened conflict. The MoH does not therefore have accurate figures for civilian deaths or their causes for the past year. The MoH is gradually re-establishing standard practices and procedures, although these are basic. In the longer term the Iraqi Interim Government may be able to evaluate the causes of civilian deaths and injuries.

We fully support the efforts of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to end permanently the use of forced labour. Burma&#039;s general system of preferences trade privileges were suspended by the EC in 1997 in response to our concerns over forced labour in country.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"></a>Discrimination against Christians in Sudan tends to present itself in bureaucratic obstruction. Cases of harassment of Christian religious leaders have been reported, though these often appear to focus on political rather than religious activities. The case for &quot;persecution&quot; against a particular religious group is however less clear: southerners of all religions have suffered from mistreatment, while many thousands of Christians worship freely.

<p><a name="wa_st_13"></a>
<a name="40607w02_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   The subsidiarity mechanism in the draft constitutional treaty forces the European Commission to reconsider any legislative proposal which one-third of national parliaments consider breaches the principle of subsidiarity. In practice this will make it very difficult for the European Commission to ignore the strongly held wishes of one-third of national parliaments&#151;or indeed for the Council of Ministers to do so if it later came to consider the legislative proposal.

<a name="40607w04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   The Convention rights, set out in the Human Rights Act 1998, specify the circumstances in which the fundamental rights of the individual may be limited or qualified according to the rights of others, the interests of the wider community and national interests. It is the Government&#039;s policy that rights should be approached in this balanced manner.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_39"></a>What is the basis, including the immigration assumption and the method of its calculation, for the Treasury assessment referred to by the Prime Minister in his speech to the Confederation of British Industry on 27 April, that the United Kingdom&#039;s economic growth rate would be some 0.5 per cent lower for the next two years if net immigration were to cease.  [HL2951]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_40"></a>
<a name="40607w05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   The basis of the Prime Minister&#039;s statement that &quot;economic growth would be almost &#189; per cent lower over the next two years if net migration were to cease&quot; lies in the Treasury&#039;s trend growth assessment, as explained in recent Pre-Budget and Budget Reports and the paper <i>Trend Growth: Recent Developments and Prospects</i>, HM Treasury, April 2002, published alongside Budget 2002. Net inward migration contributes to economic growth by adding to the population of working age and hence labour supply. Treasury assumptions about growth in the population of working age are informed by recent data and Government Actuary&#039;s Department projections. Latest data for net inward migration show that it contributed 0.4 percentage points to growth in the population of working age betwen 2001 and 2002.

<p><a name="wa_st_45"></a>
<a name="40607w05_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   All HM Customs and Excise detection staff include products of animal origin in their frontier responsibilities. Their strike force detection teams are part of Customs&#039; wider strategy to deter and detect illegal products of animal origin from entering the UK. These four new teams have increased Customs&#039; ability to deploy in larger numbers, less predictably and with greater impact. This means that the numbers tackling a particular threat are not static but are regularly reviewed against the latest assessments of risk.

In addition Customs made a number of seizures in freight and postal traffic that had originally entered the UK by air. In their spring report (Cm 6224) Customs reported 9,571 seizures in total in the period 1 April&#150;31 December 2003.

</p>

<a name="40607w06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_37"></a>The international representatives&#039; grant aid programme (IRGAP), operated by UK Sport, was set up to assist international postholders with the travel and subsistence costs they incur while attending scheduled meetings of their international federations. Standard estimates for the costs of travel to, and subsistence within, a country are the basis of grant calculations for the grant that postholders receive. Senior postholders will receive between 75-100 per cent of the estimated costs of any particular trip as a grant, depending on the priority. A grant (G) is calculated according to the following formula: G = P [&quot;T + D + (S x N)&quot; - &quot;C + K&quot;], where travel costs are (T), the distance rate (From &#163;0&#150;&#163;100) depending on which part of the UK the journey starts (D), the daily subsistence rate (S), the number of days a meeting lasts (N), cash subsidies provided by the international federation (C), accommodation or in-kind assistance provided by the host (K), the grant allocation percentage determined by UK Sport (P).
</p>

<a name="40607w06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_38"></a>It should be noted that a significant number of international representatives do not receive grants because their international federations and/or meeting hosts subsidise all the travel and subsistence costs either in cash or in kind. In those instances, the individual is not eligible for IRGAP grants.

<a name="40607w07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   Under the current energy market, there are strong incentives on generators to deliver the power they are contracted to deliver. Wind generators are no different from any other generators in that they have to enter into contracts in the knowledge that their capacity may or may not be available at any given time. Since, by its nature, wind power is intermittent, wind generators have to deal with intermittency, but similarly other generators will seek to enter into contracts that cover them in the event that their plant is unavailable, for example because a technical problem suddenly occurs.
