<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Knight of Collingtree </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What welfare payments will be available for persons entering the United Kingdom from the 10 new European Union countries after 1 May; and how these provisions compare with those offered by other European Union countries.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  My Lords, we will amend the relevant legislation so that nationals from the A8 states who are in the UK but who are not in work will generally not have access to income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, state pension credit, housing benefit or council tax benefit. On the second part of the Question, member states' schemes are different from each other&#151;provisions for EU nationals, newly arrived from another member state, will depend on the nature of that state's scheme.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that there is strong support on this side of the House for a system which welcomes people here who intend to work and to become good citizens while, at the same time, deterring those who seek to gain welfare benefits only? Is the noble Baroness sure that the system which has been announced will do that? How will the second category of incomers be recognised at the airport, for instance? How will they be checked on and how will they be sent back if they are not doing the right thing? Surely they can disappear. Are there not already unknown thousands of illegal immigrants whom the Government cannot locate, check or return?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Baroness's opening statement. The whole thrust of the Government's policy is to make a distinction between those who are in work&#151;benefits follow the work&#151;and those who are not so that we are not attracting those who seek to come here merely for benefits. The noble Baroness and I agree on that. On her second point, someone who is now working illegally, often undercutting wages and operating in dangerous health and safety conditions, will now be able to register, come on to the open market, pay his taxes and national insurance, and contribute more fully to the economy.

<P>

<a name="40224-01_para0"></a>The noble Baroness's third point was about people turning up. That is not the issue: people have a right to come here as visitors, tourists, and so on. If such people with no attachment to the labour market apply for benefit, they will not be so entitled.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   My Lords, in the absence of a statement from the DWP, will the Minister say whether yesterday's Statement applies to tax credits, including child tax credits? Will she confirm that there will be no appeals process and give us the time-scale for the implementation of these proposals?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, tax credits are a worker-related benefit. They are currently available to French and German people working here, UK citizens and other people coming in under the A8 scheme. On appeals, the key decision is the right to reside. Obviously, benefit decisions are appealable in the usual way, but the Home Secretary said yesterday,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We will not need an appeals system under the rules".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 23/2/04; col. 29.]

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40224-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Kilclooney: </B>   My Lords, as the new regulations apply to the 10 new applicant members of the European Union, and two of those countries are members of the Commonwealth, will citizens of Cyprus and Malta have their present rights of access and employment in the United Kingdom reduced as a result of joining the European Union?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, we have made a decision that Cyprus and Malta would be excluded from this derogation on three grounds. First, they are very small&#151;I think the population of Malta is about 400,000. Secondly, their level of prosperity is broadly similar to our own, only a little below it; and, thirdly, as the noble Lord has acknowledged, we have historic connections to those countries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, I asked the noble Baroness a question yesterday to which I failed to get a reply. We were told that a person unable to support himself will lose his right of residence and will have to return home. What legal power will the Government have to remove such a person?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, we would normally expect to deport a person only if, for example, he were a threat to national security, engaged in anti-social behaviour, and so on. As I indicated earlier, such people would not have a right to benefit if they were not in work and, if they had no right to benefit, why would they remain? Therefore, there is no need to get into the heavy end of deportation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spnew8"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I ask that as a perfectly serious question, my Lords. People working in the black economy will now, as I indicated to the noble Baroness, be able to come into the mainstream economy and work. If, however, they have no means of self-support and they <P>


<a name="column_109"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 109</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are not, as a result, eligible for benefits, then why would they be here unless they were doing something such as thieving, in which case we would be within our rights to remove them on the grounds of anti-social behaviour.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, in his Statement in another place yesterday, the Home Secretary said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For two years, possibly longer, we will require accession nationals to be able to support themselves".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 23/2/04; col. 24.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-01_para1"></a>
I am grateful to the Minister for putting flesh on the bones of that remark. Why, then, did the subsequent press release say that this state of affairs would persist for only one year? Who is right?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I do not know to which press release the noble Lord is referring, but people who come here to jobs confirmed by the permit system that they will be using will have, after 12 months' continuous employment, the right to income-related benefits. Perhaps the noble Lord is referring to that information in the press release. However, those who have no attachment to the labour market during the two-year transitional period&#151;which I understand we have the right to extend for a further five years&#151;would not have the right to any benefits at all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend clarify a matter that puzzles me? I thought that the main point of joining the European Union was the free movement of labour. In that case, where does the concept of work permits come from if the European market is to be efficient? Surely, labour in the European Union should simply move to where it is most productive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, that is entirely right. Yesterday, the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, made the point very tellingly. We have something like 500,000 vacancies in this country, which she said were particularly in agriculture and the hospitality trades. I checked the figures and there are indeed something like 160,000 vacancies in the areas that she mentioned, so she is absolutely right. We want and need that labour. It will enrich our economy and society, and those labourers will be entitled to corresponding work-related benefits. We are not seeking to attract to this country people who have no intention of working and who come here primarily because our benefits system appears to be more attractive than the regime experienced at home.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My Lords, the Government are determined that Cambridge University's decision will not damage the ability of the UK to remain a world leader in medical research into diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and into strokes. We are exploring ways to ensure that the university can continue its important work in neuroscience. The Government support the need for biomedical research involving animals in line with the stringent conditions laid down in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. We are also firmly committed to the protection of those scientists and research staff undertaking this vital work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Given that the main reason for the decision was the estimate by Cambridgeshire police of the cost of laboratory security, what steps will the Government take to enable universities that carry out a great deal of this research to manage risks such as those posed by animal rights terrorists? How will the Government ensure that the necessary medical research into immunology, which requires work to be done on primates, will be continued in this country?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, clearly the decision about the particular situation in Cambridge was for Cambridge University to make. However, I have already had a meeting with the MRC and the Wellcome Trust to examine alternative ways to expand and develop the world-class neuroscience research taking place at Cambridge. We are also looking at how we can ensure that the facilities for this expanding area of research are available on a national basis. I have met the Director General of the Research Councils, the head of the MRC, Colin Blakemore, and Mark Walport of the Wellcome Trust to initiate work in this area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours: </B>   My Lords, on the question of primate rights, has my noble friend had a chance to examine the work of Sue Savage Rumbeau and Duane Rumbeau in Atlanta, Georgia, which shows that primates, and apes in particular, are capable of intelligent communication with the use of voice synthesisers? If that is the case, does it not have implications for this whole policy area?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I do not know about that research. As far as using animals or non-human primates for this work is concerned, I direct the noble Lord to the report by the Select Committee of this House that considered this very question and came up with three conclusions:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"1. The view of the Select Committee is that it is morally acceptable for human beings to use other animals, but that it is morally wrong to cause them unnecessary or avoidable suffering . . .  2. There is at present a continued need for animal experiments both in applied research and in research aimed purely at extending knowledge . . .  3. Toxicological testing in animals is at present essential for medical practice and the protection of consumers and the environment, as it often provides information that is not currently available from any other source".

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 111</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-02_para1"></a>Having said that, I will certainly look at the research although, from my rather limited knowledge of this area, what is being suggested is rather unlikely to be the situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, given that my Select Committee report to which the Minister referred also suggested the establishment of a national centre for the pursuit and development of the 3Rs with a view to reducing the amount of animal experimentation, what progress has been made towards the creation of such a centre since we last debated the matter in October?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, we are very supportive of that idea and I hope within a few days to make an announcement of our plans.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, could the Minister tell the House tell us whether there are any statistics on, or whether any information has been collated about, the number of people who oppose experimentation on animals for medical research&#151;and, indeed, of that number, how many are prepared to take the medicine and receive the medical procedures that result from that testing?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, it should always be pointed out that the number of people involved in the harassment and violence is in fact rather small. The great majority of people in this country are very supportive of work in this area, when they know about the stringent regulations of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Whether those people who resort to that violence and harassment take medicines, I do not know; it is quite likely that they do so, regardless of the fact that major medical advances in the area require work to be done with animals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the work being done at the Yerkes primate centre in Atlanta, Georgia. Would the Minister agree that it is precisely because of the development of the primate brain that work on such animals, with the appropriate precautions, is essential for the improvement of the treatment of diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and many more? In that circumstance, will he ensure, as seems to be implied by his Answer, that such work is protected in the United Kingdom?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Yes, my Lords, it is quite clear that such work is necessary, and necessary for the very reasons that the noble Lord mentioned. It is an essential part of studying diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's that primates are used. We in this country are world-class leaders in neuroscience, and I am absolutely determined that we shall continue to be world-class leaders in that field. Therefore, we shall take all the action that we can to support that work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How many deaths due to fire occurred in 2003; how many of these were in private residences and how many were in other buildings; and, of the latter, how many buildings were fitted with a sprinkler system.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister   (Lord Rooker): </B>  My Lords, the latest figures available for the United Kingdom are for the calendar year 2002, when in incidents attended by the fire and rescue service there were total deaths of 578, of which 443 were in dwellings and 25 in other buildings. There was a total of 64,635 fires in dwellings. A water sprinkler system was present in 22 of those fires. There were 40,537 fires in other buildings, and a water sprinkler system was present in 691 of those fires.
<P>

<a name="40224-02_para2"></a>For the avoidance of doubt, so that I am not accused of misleading the House, earlier today very provisional figures were published for the financial year 2002&#150;03, but I thought it best to use the figures that we had already prepared for this Answer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. Is he aware that the Answer that I was given when I raised the matter of sprinklers in relation to schools on 7 January has been acknowledged as wrong by the Lancashire Fire Brigade, which plays a leading role in the National Fire Sprinkler Network? That brigade wrote to the Minister at that time on that question. We were told that sprinklers would not have saved a particular school, whereas the sprinkler people say that it definitely would.
<P>

<a name="40224-02_para3"></a>Does the Minister agree that, whatever numbers have died, there would have been fewer deaths if sprinklers had been available? Would they not be particularly important in buildings where people are so vulnerable that they are incapable of getting themselves out, such as in the Scottish incident? I hope that the Minister will not tell me that that is a devolved matter, as it is the principle that I am talking about. A number of people have died very recently in those circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I shall not hide behind the point that it is a devolved matter, because the figures that I gave were United Kingdom figures and this is a UK issue. Our thoughts are with the families of the victims of Rose Park. However, I cannot say any more about that matter because there is an ongoing inquiry into it.
<P>

<a name="40224-02_para4"></a>In April 2001, a research project was funded and organised by the predecessor department to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for the Building Research Establishment to consider fully the effectiveness of sprinklers in residential buildings across the piece. It is quite clear that in many situations sprinklers would be <P>


<a name="column_113"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 113</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>useful, particularly when people are vulnerable, whether in homes for children, the elderly or disabled people, and higher-risk houses such as houses in multiple occupation and very tall buildings&#151;including, obviously, high-rise flat developments.
<P>

<a name="40224-02_para5"></a>The building regulations are being reviewed and, probably next year, a provisional consideration will be put forward. In 2006, an approval will be made of the document. Those regulations are reviewed on a regular basis. Those issues must be taken into account, as will the new system of the abandonment of fire certificates in favour of a risk-based system relative to the particular premises, which will be much more useful in those circumstances than the present arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Harrison: </B>   My Lords, would my noble friend agree that there is now very powerful evidence that sprinklers in schools are cost-effective, especially if installed at the time of refurbishment or refenestration? Would he also acknowledge that the problem of schools with considerable roof voids can be tackled effectively with the installation of sprinklers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Yes, my Lords, that is self-evident. The issue will be part and parcel of the review of the building regulations that will take place. The research that has been funded has already been published on the ODPM website and will shortly be in the Library. The research occupies a large volume&#151;I think it is 700 pages&#151;but people can get a CD and look at it. A lot of work is being done on the issue, which will inform the new building regulations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Greengross: </B>   My Lords, I have long been very concerned about fire doors. Many people dislike them; many frail people cannot shut or open them properly, and therefore leave them open, which negates their value. Have the Government or the Health and Safety Executive, for example, investigated alternative fire prevention methods, or will they do so? That is a matter of some urgency, given the comments that the noble Baroness and the Minister have made about recent events.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040224/text/40224-03.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has raised an interesting point, because the issue is how to prevent fires in the first place. Lots of steps can be taken. I should have thought that that was a matter for the building regulations, although one problem with such regulations is that they usually apply only to new premises, so we must consider the stock that we already have. However, under the new system, when there is a risk-based assessment for a particular building, it will be open to the fire service&#151;in the example given by the noble Baroness, for example&#151;to insist on self-closing doors being fitted, so that there is no issue about keeping the doors open or the doors being too heavy for the elderly and vulnerable people to open. That negates the issue of a fire certificate, which was a piece of paper that gave people comfort but did not necessarily mean that they were safe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister satisfied that there is enough regulation concerning <P>


<a name="column_114"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 114</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fire prevention in student accommodation, both in halls of residence and in smaller houses in multiple occupation? I ask that because I believe that there are exemptions to the housing regulations in relation to student accommodation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, as I said earlier, that kind of premises would probably be a house in multiple occupation. People are vulnerable in such houses for lots of reasons, and we know of many fires that have happened in those circumstances. That is an issue that this House will debate, as the other place is debating, in the Housing Bill that is passing through it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister consider repeating the valuable publicity campaign, drawing the attention of newcomers in the domestic field to the fact that throwing water on a fat fire turns it into an inferno? That is little known, and the knowledge could save many lives.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Yes, my Lords, the department will obviously consider that suggestion, and it is an ongoing campaign. It is generally speaking the case that fire is dangerous and kills, but in many cases it is the smoke that is actually the cause of death. The smoke is highly dangerous&#151;to victims and firefighters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister tell us what the evidence is of decreased mortality or lesser danger in houses with smoke alarms in them? It is much easier to introduce a smoke alarm than to introduce a sprinkler system, particularly in a private house.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I cannot. All the figures that I have given come only from fires attended by the fire and rescue service. For example, if there are loads of sprinklers that are effective and put a fire out, the fire service does not get called and the fire is not included in the figures. The figures are assembled only for fires, whether malicious or accidental, attended by the fire and rescue service. They are updated constantly, which is why even the figures that I have given for 2002 are marginally provisional. Every single death certificate and inquest result is checked back to ascertain the actual cause of death. There is a problem in that one cannot always be precise about the figures from every fire; so only the fires attended by the fire and rescue service are included.

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 115</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Government the prison population remains unacceptably high. We now head the league table in western Europe and are overtaking Portugal in this particular process. Does the Minister agree that 60 per cent of those who leave prison reoffend within two years and that we now imprison twice as many women as we did when Labour came to power? Does he also agree that we need less rhetoric about how prison works and that we should make more use of non-custodial alternatives?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, of course I agree with the noble Lord that it would be much better for sentences to be served in the community. However, it is for the courts to determine sentencing and where someone should be sent. We have to bear that very important consideration in mind. If a crime is sufficiently serious and it is right to send people to prison, then of course they must be sent to prison. That is what the public expect; they expect to be protected. The Government have taken many initiatives to expand other alternatives to prison. The noble Lord has been among those who have praised us for doing exactly that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Corbett of Castle Vale: </B>   My Lords, I commend the Minister on the extra effort that the Prison Service is putting into dealing with some of the causes of reoffending by people within a couple of years of their release from prison. However, given that more crime is alcohol related than drug related, can he explain why there is no specialist, ring-fenced, accredited alcohol treatment programme in prisons in England and Wales?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, there are accredited programmes for dealing with alcohol and drug abuse and those programmes have been very successful. I think that the Government should be congratulated on the level of investment they have put into the health service within the prison estate, and on their initiatives to try to encourage people on release to be free of drug and alcohol abuse&#151;factors which obviously have an impact on the rate of re-offending.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Laming: </B>   My Lords, although sentencing is a responsibility of the courts, the courts nevertheless need to be reassured that the probation and aftercare service is being developed to make non-custodial sentences and aftercare attractive and effective propositions for courts. Do the Government have a robust strategy to develop the probation service?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, we have set up the National Offender Management Service, which brings together the probation service and Prison Service considerations to which the noble Lord referred, so that we have a coherent, cohesive and all-through service. The Government have also taken the important step of setting up the Sentencing Guidelines Council so that advice and guidance are available to the judiciary in the process of sentencing. We think that that will help ensure a better geographical spread <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>within sentencing strategy and ensure that, where there is a conviction, the sentence is most appropriate to the crime.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew14"></A><B> The Earl of Dundee: </B>   My Lords, the Minister may give the impression that these prison figures are acceptable. Does he agree that current trends threaten to increase them even further? At what higher level, therefore, would he regard such figures as unacceptable?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, it is not for me to make a judgment on what is or is not acceptable. It is the Government's job to provide and ensure that there is adequate provision for those who are quite properly sentenced by the courts and sent to prison. It is also for the Government, as I said earlier, to ensure that an adequate range of sentences is available to the courts so that they can deal most appropriately with the lesser-order criminal activity and offences. That is exactly what we have done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew16"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Manchester: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that there are only 600 places left in our prisons? Will he explain to the House what are the Government's plans when that limit has been reached?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, as I understand it, as of today the prison population is about 510 below the total usable operational capacity of the prison estate. A number of changes are being implemented at a number of establishments to make available more places for prisoners. These adjustments will mean a rapid increase in usable operational capacity, by about a further 350 additional places. In the longer term we want to reform the correctional services&#151;an objective in which we have been aided by the advice and support of Patrick Carter. We are trying to provide a range of more effective options for sentencers. There is always proper planning for contingency measures and an examination of other opportunities for safely increasing the capacity of the prison estate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that Schedule 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, inserted by the Home Secretary as his reaction to being told that he could play no further part in the sentencing of murderers, results in sentences for all serious offences increasing by at least 50 per cent? If he does accept that, what estimate do the Government give in relation to what the figures will be as a result?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that we accept the noble and learned Lord's assertion. I therefore do not think that I could make a useful prediction based on that assertion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-03_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend accept that one objective of penal policy must be effective rehabilitation? Does he not therefore agree that one of the grave consequences of the overcrowding is that it is very difficult to do all the work that the Prison Service would like to do in the cause of rehabilitation? Does he not further agree that the pressure of numbers in <P>


<a name="column_117"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 117</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>prison, coupled with the fact that many people in prison are mentally sick and should not be in prison at all, is leading to an unacceptable level of deaths in custody?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040224/text/40224-04.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I think that one should begin by saying that any death in custody is unacceptable. No one wants to see suicides in custody. The Government, and particularly the Prison Service, take the matter extremely seriously. Staff are trained to deal and cope with exactly those sorts of problems. A risk assessment programme is in place where it is thought that a prisoner might self-harm.
<P>

<a name="40224-04_para0"></a>The noble Lord is right that there are stresses and strains within the Prison Service; no one would want to gloss over that fact. However, the Government are investing much more in education within the prison estate. By the end of January 2004, the prison system, including public and contracted prisons, delivered 34,792 basic skills awards against an original projection of just 30,000 for that year. I think that that emphasises the fact that we are expanding educational activity in prisons, which is very much in line with the expanded budget for education in the Prison Service.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, do the Government have an explanation for why we have a much higher prison population per capita than any comparable western European country? Is it that we are more wicked, or the system more vindictive, or what?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I do not know whether we are more wicked or not. I like to think that, by and large, we live in a liberal, peaceable community. However, when people offend they must be dealt with and they must face the full consequences of the law. I think that we all accept that fact.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   My Lords, referring to the Minister's reply to the right reverend Prelate, does he not agree that the definition of "usable operational capacity" is the maximum safe overcrowded&#151;I repeat the word "overcrowded"&#151;capacity of the prison estate? In view of that, what assessment has the Minister made of the effect that sentencing policy, both currently and over the next 10 years, is expected to have upon the prison population in England and Wales? How has any such assessment affected the Government's building programme?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, we have made very careful assessment of the likely increase in the prison population. However, it is notoriously difficult to be precise in these matters. Some estimates last year suggested that we would have a rather larger prison population than we currently have, but that has not turned out to be the case. Following development of the building programme, by 2006 there will be operational capacity of 78,700 prison places. Statistics are notoriously easy to misinterpret but one good and, I thought, rather cheering statistic on which I alighted in my briefing indicates that the number of young people in prison is now 1 per cent less than it was this time last year, <P>


<a name="column_118"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 118</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and that for juveniles aged 15 to 17 the figure is some 5 per cent less than the comparable figure for last year. That indicates to me that the Youth Justice Board is doing very important work and provides greater optimism for the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Stern: </B>   My Lords, the Minister will be aware that the number of women in prison has increased by 67 per cent since 1997. Of the 4,500 women locked up, more than half report a background of domestic violence and more than a third have been sexually abused. Does the Minister consider that putting those women in prison for the minor crimes that they have committed serves justice and reduces crime?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, it is hard to make a sweeping assertion that all of the women to whom the noble Baroness referred&#151;it is obviously extremely unfortunate that they are in prison&#151;are in prison for minor offences. I have no doubt that they will have been properly convicted by the courts for offences that merit a period of time in custody. While those women are in prison of course it is right that, following an assessment, correctional programmes are put in place which deal with the very many problems to which the noble Baroness referred. During my visits to female establishments within the Prison Service I was most impressed by the quality of the work that was carried out in particular to deal with matters such as self-harm, abuse, drug abuse, and so on. It is such work that we need to invest in to ensure that people do not reoffend and can usefully lead a valuable life outside prison.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the figures are double what they were in the 1980s when I served as prison Minister and that we regarded that as disgraceful? What sense of urgency is there in overcoming the problem of reoffending? How do the Prison Service and the probation service establish that no prisoner leaves prison without a means of support and shelter so that he is not driven immediately into crime again?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, as I have said on many occasions, it is for the courts to determine whether it is right for someone to go to prison. Of course, in sentencing they will act on the information that is before them to determine whether a sentence is appropriate. While prisoners are in prison it is right to establish&#151;this is what we try to do&#151;an appropriate programme of education so that prisoners can usefully lead a life outside prison that will enable them to keep free of crime and becoming involved in new crime. We are not complacent about the issue of recidivism. It is part of our determination to ensure that rates of re-offending come down.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe: </B>   My Lords, as regards the increased investment that this Government have made in the treatment of prisoners with alcohol and drug-related <P>


<a name="column_119"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 119</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>problems, can my noble friend assure us that there is a proper tracking system in place to ensure that if re-offending takes place a linkage is made with any treatment that has been given previously so that we can then assess whether the treatment is working effectively or not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord asks a very pertinent question. For that very reason the Government decided to embark on a more coherent strategy linking the Prison Service and the probation service so that when offenders are released from prison they have the opportunity to receive counselling, advice, guidance and referral to the services which try to get to the root of their alcohol or drug abuse problem and thereby reduce the level of reoffending. That is one of the areas in which we have invested heavily over the past few years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that many women prisoners have a high incidence of churning about and movement from one prison to another, therefore increasing the social damage incurred by their imprisonment in separating them from their families? Have the Government looked into the possibility of trying to return the large number of female drug runners or mules who are in prison in this country&#151;they come mostly from the Caribbean islands&#151;to the countries from which they originate to finish their prison sentence there because that particular section of the prison population has increased very rapidly in recent years?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness puts her finger on a very pertinent problem. My understanding is that there has to be a prisoner transfer agreement in place between this country and the country from which the so-called drug "mule" has come. Therefore, certain issues need to be examined in that regard. This is something that we keep very carefully under review in terms of policy and it is a matter that we are obviously considering at all times.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware&#151;this is a short question&#151;of what happens to those prisoners who are seriously mentally disturbed but cannot be sectioned because they are untreatable and are sent from one prison to another? What happens to them? Is he aware of the problem?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the problem. I have visited a number of health centres within the prison estate. I am well aware of the difficulty to which the noble Lord refers. The Prison Service tries to develop an appropriate programme for each individual. That is obviously given very high consideration when dealing with the health, particularly the mental health, of each individual prisoner. However, it is not an easy <P>


<a name="column_120"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 120</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>problem to deal with, particularly as at various points of a prisoner's sentence he or she has to be moved from one establishment to another.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, how many girls under 17 are in prison and how many of them are pregnant or have babies?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to your Lordships' House as that is not in my key statistics list. However, I am more than happy to try to find out those figures, write to the noble Baroness and share them with your Lordships' House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Clark of Windermere: </B>   My Lords, is not making more use of community service awards one way of reducing the prison population? Can the Minister give us an assurance that magistrates in England can confer community service awards on people who reside under different judicial systems such as the one that applies in Scotland?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-04_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I shall have to think about that question. If the noble Lord will bear with me, I shall probably have to write to him precisely on how that might work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I should like to repeat a Statement on the British citizens detained at Guantanamo Bay which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="40224-05_para5"></a>"Agreement with the United States Government on the return of five of the nine UK detainees was reached on Thursday last, 19 February. Although the House was in recess, I judged that it was only fair to the families of all nine detainees that they should be informed immediately. We therefore made every effort to contact the families and their parliamentary representatives and I made a public announcement late on Thursday afternoon. I could not report to the House yesterday as I had to attend the General Affairs Council in Brussels.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para6"></a>"The attacks of 11 September 2001 were the most appalling terrorist atrocity the world has ever seen. They killed more than 3,000 people, including 67 British citizens. In response to those attacks, a coalition of countries came together to launch a military campaign against Al'Qaeda and its Taliban supporters to remove them from their strongholds in Afghanistan.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para7"></a>"In these operations thousands of individuals believed to be Al'Qaeda or Taliban fighters, or their supporters, were detained by coalition forces. The vast majority of these individuals were released. But those who were deemed to pose a substantial risk of returning to the conflict&#151;to date, around 800&#151;were sent by the United States to its naval base in Guantanamo Bay to be detained and to be questioned about their knowledge of Al'Qaeda activities. As a result, valuable information has been gained which has helped to protect the international community from further Al'Qaeda and related terrorist attacks.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para8"></a>"The Government have been in frequent and regular contact with the United States authorities concerning the British detainees at Guantanamo Bay. From the outset, the Government have sought to ensure their welfare and have actively encouraged the US Government to resolve the position of the British detainees. British officials have visited Guantanamo Bay six times. We have kept their families and Parliament informed of the detainees' circumstances and of developments.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para9"></a>"In July 2003, two of the British detainees were designated by the United States authorities as eligible to stand trial by United States military <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_122"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 122</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>commissions established to prosecute the detainees. The Government made it clear straight away that we had concerns about the military commission process. Consequently my right honourable friend the Prime Minister asked my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General to discuss with the United States authorities how the detainees, if prosecuted, could be assured of fair trials which met international standards.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para10"></a>"The Attorney-General therefore held a number of discussions with the United States authorities about the future of the detainees. In parallel, the Prime Minister has talked to President Bush. I have discussed this matter on many occasions with US Secretary of State Colin Powell; and extensive discussions have been held between British and United States government lawyers and officials.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para11"></a>"These discussions have involved many complex issues of law and security, which both governments have had to consider carefully. Although the discussions have made significant progress, the view of the Attorney-General was that the military commissions, as presently constituted, would not provide the process which we would afford British nationals.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para12"></a>"Our discussions with the United States authorities are continuing. In the mean time, as I announced last Thursday, we agreed that five of the British detainees will return to the United Kingdom. They are Rhuhel Ahmed, Tareq Dergoul, Jamal al-Harith, Asif Iqbal and Shafiq Rasul.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para13"></a>"These men will be flown home to the United Kingdom in the next few weeks. The House will understand that it would not be right to disclose the operational details at this stage. The police have, however, established links with the families so that they can be informed of developments.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para14"></a>"The police have confirmed that once the detainees are back in the United Kingdom, where there are grounds under the provisions of the legislation, the five men may be arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity. Any subsequent action will be a matter for the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. It would therefore not be appropriate to comment further on their particular cases.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para15"></a>"But I would like to emphasise two points here. First, the police have said that they are investigating all the detainees thoroughly and individually, in the normal way, including the circumstances which led to the men's detention. Every necessary step, including prosecution if appropriate, will be taken to protect national security.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para16"></a>"Secondly, the detainees will be treated in the same way as anyone else suspected of committing a criminal offence, in accordance with UK law. The process has built-in safeguards and is subject to independent scrutiny to ensure that all individuals are treated fairly and properly. It includes access to lawyers.
<P>
</UL>

<a name="column_123"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 123</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para17"></a>"We shall continue our discussions with the United States authorities on the situation of the other four British detainees. They are Feroz Abbasi, Moazzam Begg, Richard Belmar and Martin Mubanga.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para18"></a>"There are a range of security and other issues which we and the Americans are considering in respect of these four men. As a result of our talks, US legal proceedings against Mr Abbasi and Mr Begg were suspended in July and the US said that the men would not be subject to the death penalty. This remains the case.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para19"></a>"Our overall position remains that the detainees should either be tried in accordance with international standards, or they should be returned to the United Kingdom. We shall continue to work to resolve their position. I will of course keep the House informed.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para20"></a>"The Government remain determined to work with our allies around the world to defeat the scourge of global terrorism. Terrorists seek to deny the most basic of human rights&#151;to life, to security, and the right to go about our daily business free from threat and harm. We will continue resolutely to defend these rights through a robust and determined approach to combating terrorism and its networks of support wherever it is to be found".
<P>
</UL>
<a name="40224-05_para21"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_time2"></a><H5>3.27 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for repeating the Statement and I should make it clear that on these Benches we are glad that some progress is at last being made in sorting out the complex issues behind both these detainees and the others at Guantanamo Bay.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para22"></a>We appreciate&#151;as others have not always done&#151;that from the earliest days in the Guantanamo situation the world has been confronted with a unique situation in human history and international affairs, where the individuals concerned were apparently deliberately participating in the stateless pursuit of terrorism, with the aim of killing, injuring and maiming non-combatants; and had placed themselves far outside the international law of war and outside recognised categories of behaviour or offence. So it was understandable that at the outset their status was bound to be ambiguous and that gap had to be filled by the concept of unlawful combatants.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para23"></a>But that time has passed and the situation must now be cleared up. Today's Statement raises a raft of important questions. First, the Home Secretary, Mr Blunkett, has told the media that none of the five named by the Minister and who will be released by the US authorities,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"represents a security threat to the British people".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-05_para24"></a>
Well, aside from that being a somewhat premature and improper judgment, many people want to know how the Home Secretary knows that&#151;before investigations have been completed by the police and before questioning has taken place. Is it not absolutely vital in the interests of national security that each case should be rigorously examined and fully assessed to see whether there is <P>


<a name="column_124"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sufficient evidence to justify proceedings? It is essential that the circumstances and causes of the original detention must be established.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para25"></a>It is, of course, for the prosecuting authorities to decide the nature of any charges, but has anyone considered whether charges for treason would be appropriate if those concerned can be shown to have taken up arms against British forces and the British Crown? I know that this morning the Foreign Secretary dismissed that as "a hare", but was he right to do so, given the uniqueness of the circumstances? Should we not keep our minds open on that aspect? What will happen to the five individuals when they arrive here? Will they be held in custody when they touch down or will they be allowed home while being investigated prior to possible arrest? Can the noble Baroness tell us something about that?
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para26"></a>As to the other detainees&#151;the four left behind&#151;first, what is the difference between the five transferred here and the four retained at Guantanamo Bay? Do those four constitute a threat to our national security when, according to the Home Secretary, the other five do not? Will they go on to face the proposed military tribunals, which two of them were already beginning to face before the process was previously stood down? Are we satisfied that those procedures meet the international standards in which we believe? I do not consider that earlier we were so satisfied. Therefore, are discussions continuing about their fate and the way in which they are to be handled?

<a name="40224-05_para27"></a>The Foreign Secretary said this morning that the new threats that the world faces were not only unique but were not anticipated. That is quite wrong. From the dawn of the information age, it was obvious that global protest and terror would be given new organisational impetus, and many of us said so at the time. If one adds suicide readiness to the lethal brew, we have the present completely predictable combination of threats to our open and highly vulnerable societies which we have never before experienced. In a sense, the feared rendezvous between new miniaturised and hideous weapons and methods of slaughter and the agents of terrorism has already arrived. Everyone is now in the front line and exposed to terror initiatives and the terror resources of often small cells or individuals, who can reap the most horrifying damage on our normal and everyday lives.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para28"></a>Of course, we want this country to be&#151;it has to be&#151;the champion of the rule of law, but that law must arm us to be able to address the new threats and the new terror and to protect our citizens and not handicap us from doing so. There must be a balance between established notions of law and doing our utmost to ensure people's security. That is the balance that we want to see maintained both here and, ultimately, in the treatment of all the other detainees remaining at Guantanamo Bay.

<A NAME="40224-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches welcome this robust Statement&#151;and we interpret it as a robust Statement. We welcome, in <P>


<a name="column_125"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 125</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>particular, the confirmation that the Attorney-General's view is that the military commission, as presently constituted, would not provide a process that we would find acceptable for British nationals. We also welcome the clarification that investigations on the returnees will be conducted "in the normal way" with detainees treated,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in the same way as anyone else suspected of committing a criminal offence",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-05_para29"></a>
under UK law. Those are extremely important points.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para30"></a>I understand that, on Friday, Trevor Kavanagh&#151;an extremely well connected political journalist working for the Sun&#151;said on Jeremy Vine's programme on Radio 2 that he had been told by senior Cabinet and security sources that the five were to have security surveillance for the rest of their lives once they returned from London. I do not know whether the Minister has any information on that report.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para31"></a>We recognise the effort that the Government have made to represent the British case to the American authorities. One has to say that if the situation had been reversed and the British authorities had been holding American nationals in a similar way, we can imagine the outcry that would have come from Washington.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para32"></a>I regard the behaviour of the Bush Administration in relation to Guantanamo Bay over the past two years as, in the strictest sense, un-American. I speak as someone who used to study and teach American politics in American universities, and I used to teach the United States constitution as the epitome of the rule of law. What we have seen from the Bush Administration over the past three years has been a falling away from the principle of the rule of law, both within the United States and internationally. We have seen the Geneva conventions ignored; we have seen, as the Statement said, the behaviour of the United States falling well below international standards; and we have seen the unacceptable legal void of Guantanamo Bay.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para33"></a>Will the Minister confirm that prisoners are not being held at Bagram and Diego Garcia? There have been repeated reports in the US press that some prisoners have been held at Diego Garcia. Again, I should welcome the Minister's confirmation that that is, and remains, without foundation.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para34"></a>We recognise that we have seen patient and quiet diplomacy by British officials and Ministers at the highest level. We should like an assurance from the Government that, if necessary&#151;that is, if patient diplomacy is not enough&#151;they will resort to public protest if that is the only way to ensure that British citizens receive appropriate treatment after two years or more in American custody.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para35"></a>Lastly, I repeat and strengthen the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Howell. We heard about five detainees being returned. Two are being subjected to trial under certain guarantees, but we still do not know what will happen to Richard Belmar and Martin Mubanga. Can we be told what will happen to the eighth and ninth suspects?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, first, I thank both noble Lords for the welcome that they have given the Statement. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that we particularly welcome the context in which he started his comments. However, I think it is only fair to say that none of us envisaged the possibility of two armed aeroplanes being flown into buildings in the way that occurred on 11 September. That was a dramatic shock to the international community.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para36"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, asked a number of questions. I hope that I made it clear in the Statement that I cannot go into the detail of the operational issues relating to the return of those who have now been identified to be returned to the UK. However, I can reassure the noble Lord that each case will be looked at on an individual basis. It will be considered rigorously and properly to ensure that all that should be done is done.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para37"></a>I note the noble Lord's comments concerning the statements made by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary. But, of course, the Home Secretary was correct because, following the investigations, either these individuals will be arrested and dealt with if they form a threat or, if the evidence does not justify such an act, they will not. Therefore, in those circumstances, our protection of national security will be maintained.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para38"></a>Before questioning by the police, the individuals will be examined to see whether they are medically fit to be interviewed. They also have a right to access to a defence lawyer. They can be questioned for an initial period of 48 hours, after which a court must approve further detention. Detention is, of course, a matter for the police. The men were interviewed in Guantanamo Bay by the security services on matters relevant to national security and not for prosecution purposes. Therefore, the decision will and must be left to the police authorities acting on any appropriate and proper advice given to them by the Crown Prosecution Service.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para39"></a>In relation to the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, about whether there are people being kept at Diego Garcia and elsewhere, the US has confirmed to us that there are no such detainees. Of course, we rely on that assurance.
<P>

<a name="40224-05_para40"></a>I can give an assurance from which the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, may derive comfort. We have not changed our approach about the necessity to comply with international standards in relation to these men and we shall not do so. It is of some comfort that the acuity and persuasiveness of what we have managed to do has enabled five detainees to be properly returned. The noble Lord rightly said that legal proceedings were commenced in relation to two others, which were put into abeyance pending our discussions. Our discussions have not concluded. We are assured that nothing will be done until those matters have been concluded.

<FONT SIZE=3>have been made, over a very long period of time, to ensure that this totally unacceptable situation, in breach of the rule of law, is now beginning to be corrected. I am glad that she confirmed that further investigation, and as I understand it considerations of prosecution, will follow our usual independent system for all our citizens. Has that been made quite clear to the American authorities? Lastly, as regards the last four, what steps will the Government take&#151;I am sure that some steps are being taken already&#151;to try to get legal access to those who remain behind?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble and learned friend for his congratulations. In particular, I warmly welcome the congratulations made in relation to my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General among the others who have worked so hard and assiduously on this issue.
<P>

<a name="40224-06_para0"></a>We have made clear our position about the process that will be adopted by us in relation to the return of these men. It has been made absolutely clear to our American colleagues that the process of our law will operate in relation to them in exactly the same way as it would operate in relation to any other British citizen. That matter is clear between us. We have continuously taken advantage of our ability to have consular visits to the British men detained in Guantanamo Bay. I can assure my noble friend that we believe that we have seen our detainees more frequently than any other nation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Morris of Aberavon: </B>   My Lords, I did ask about legal access.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, the issues in relation to the trial, maintenance and how those matters will be dealt with continue to be matters of discussions of the most robust nature between us and our American colleagues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </B>   My Lords, I have two very short questions for the noble Baroness. Under the current law, how long can the five be detained without being charged? Secondly, has she any information as to when the United States Supreme Court might reach a decision on the legality of the detention at Guantanamo Bay?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I can tell the noble and learned Lord that a terrorist suspect can be held under the Terrorism Act for a period of 14 days. The suspect must then be charged or released. The suspect must be released at any time beforehand as soon as the investigating officers become aware that the grounds for detention no longer apply. I can reassure the noble and learned Lord that all those debates in relation to the Terrorism Act in which he participated so energetically will bear fruit in relation to these detainees.
<P>


<a name="column_128"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-06_para1"></a>The noble Lord also asked about the Supreme Court. I am not able to give him an answer. If I am able to, I shall, but that is within the ambit of the American authorities. I am not aware of whether they have a timetable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   My Lords, while I acknowledge and welcome the strong statement that has been forthcoming from the Attorney-General, in particular about standards of trial required to meet international acceptability, does the Minister acknowledge that opinion within the United States is by no means fully supportive of the administration and that federal district courts have found Guantanamo detentions to be unconstitutional? Are the Government prepared to make it plain that quiet diplomacy is the method that they prefer, but that if unconstitutional actions are pursued against American or other citizens, we should regard it as an unfriendly act, and not one that we would be prepared to conceal within quiet diplomacy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I am aware that there is a very wide debate in the United States on this issue. I am also aware that that is a matter of hot debate and contention in the United States. I can confirm that I have that understanding.
<P>

<a name="40224-06_para2"></a>As to the quiet diplomacy, we believe that the robust diplomacy that we have exercised has borne fruit. Of course, we shall continue to pursue it and we hope that we shall have similar success in due course.
<P>

<a name="40224-06_para3"></a>I should just say to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, that a note has arrived from the Box which indicates that the Supreme Court is due to rule at the end of June.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, I, like others, have the most profound respect for the work that my noble friend and her colleagues have been doing in this context. Like others, I have particular respect for the work done by the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General, not least in the way that he has publicly sustained the need, to which my noble friend referred, to see the protection of the rule of law as part of the stand against terrorism and the need not to concede to terrorists the victory of having undermined our commitment to the rule of law. Would she therefore accept that as close allies and friends of the United States, while putting our commitment to our own citizens at the top of our anxiety, we have a responsibility to argue that what is wrong is Guantanamo Bay? There are a lot of people remaining in Guantanamo Bay who are not British citizens. The principles that we are arguing apply for our citizens apply every bit as much for them. We look to the United States, as our close friend and ally, to redress what is wrong with the whole arrangement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, noble Lords will know that even among the very best of friends there can be differences of view that have to be respected and understood. I remind my noble friend that the United States of America suffered a grievous <P>


<a name="column_129"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>blow and sometimes when one is badly wounded it takes a little time to grow confident. The role of friends is to be resolute in standing by their side in times of difficulties but also to point out where the differences lie. That is the role that Her Majesty's Government have played and shall continue to play for the foreseeable future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, the Minister stated that the prisoners were to be returned here within a few weeks. Is there a reason for the delay?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, there is not any reason for delay. However, for operational reasons it would be inappropriate for me to be more specific as to when.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister and the Government for their efforts on behalf of individuals who are soon to return to this country. My first question follows that raised by my noble friends Lord Wallace and Lord Maclennan on the view of the Attorney-General in relation to the due process of law in the United States. What would be the Government's position if the US Government do not provide a due process acceptable to the British Government? Do they have a plan B?
<P>

<a name="40224-06_para4"></a>My second question relates to the statement made by the Minister that the five men may be arrested. The due process of law in this country entitles them to legal advice and lawyers at the time of arrest. These people have gone through severe trauma and have been subjected to a tremendous amount of pressure over a long period of time. I am not here to determine their guilt or innocence; that is for a court of law to decide. However, surely, access to lawyers must be provided to those people the moment they arrive in this country so that they are properly informed as to what is likely to happen to them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, that is why I said as clearly as I could that they would have to be medically fit and have access to lawyers when they arrived. I hope I made clear that I agree with the noble Lord that access to legal advice is a right which they are entitled to be offered and to exercise if they so choose. I reassure noble Lords that that is understood. Nothing will be done in relation to these detainees which differs from that which we would all expect to be done to any other British citizen.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes: </B>   My Lords, assuming that the prisoners are returned to this country within a reasonable period of time, can the Minister tell the House what their status will be when they arrive here? Will they arrive back as prisoners or suspects or be placed under arrest? I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, they will be brought back and will remain what they are now; that is, British citizens. When they arrive, the police will <P>


<a name="column_130"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have to determine whether to investigate and whether to prosecute. It is the same position that any one of us would be in if we were in a similar situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the Government on the extent to which they have constantly referred to the need to observe the due process of law. Is there not a slight risk of hypocrisy entering this approach in view of the ouster provisions in Clause 10 or 11 of the asylum Bill, which prevent any application for due process in regard to decisions under that Bill? Even the suggestion that there has been a lack of jurisdiction is not to be permitted to be dealt with by the courts. A ring of steel has sought to be inserted in regard to that Bill so that the courts cannot in any way interfere with the decision made under its provisions. Is there not just a hint of hypocrisy entering into this subject if the Government continue to support those provisions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, we would say, "no". I understand the temptation the noble and learned Lord has to conflate the two debates, one on asylum and the other on what should happen as regards prosecuting or investigating an offence which refers to a British citizen. When the Bill reaches this House no doubt we shall have the delight of debating those provisions at length.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-06_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Sandberg: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell the House why the Americans appear to be so uncomfortable with their own judicial ability to try people in the way that they would normally be tried? I can understand the terrifying attacks that were made on them but, with the very well organised and historical links of the American judicial system I still do not understand why they feel they have to go outside it in this case.

<A NAME="40224-07_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I cannot speak for the Americans and it would be improper for me to do so. All I can say is that I have made plain what is the British position.

<a name="40224-07_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, at the start I shall apologise for my voice. I hope that it will last as I have quite a lot of speaking to do today.
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para5"></a>As noble Lords will recall from Committee, the amendment would require that the Government put on the face of the Bill a measure to ensure that regional spatial strategies include statements of community involvement. We had a worthwhile discussion on the <P>


<a name="column_131"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 131</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment on the first day in Committee but it was somewhat overshadowed by the vote immediately preceding it.
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para6"></a>What was particularly interesting was how much we all agreed. We agreed on the principle of the aim of the amendment to ensure the involvement and consultation of communities in the process of revising regional spatial strategies. We also broadly agreed on the practicalities, although we did not discuss that in much depth. Thus, the only point of difference that remained was the question of how much detail would be on the face of the Bill. That is the particular point that I want to pursue today.
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, stated that the Government would guarantee community involvement in the RSS process by detailing the requirements of consultation in regulations; that is, secondary legislation. Our attention was also drawn to the draft planning policy statement on regional planning, PPS11, which sets out what a regional consultation should look like.
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para8"></a>However, as helpful as the Minister's replies were&#151;we were grateful to receive a detailed list of all the relevant bodies that the regional planning body must consult&#151;the fact is the Minister could not justify the Government's reluctance to put this measure on the face of the Bill. Specifically, he was not able to justify the Government's position on two related questions. Those were and remain, first, why are the Government putting in Clause 18 a statutory requirement for local planning authorities to prepare statements of community involvement and yet are legislating for such a requirement for regional planning bodies only via secondary legislation? Secondly, why do the Government resist such a small number of words which would demonstrate their commitment to democracy at all levels of governance, especially when they have embraced the aim of the amendment?
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para9"></a>I regret to say that the Minister's responses to those questions were less illuminating than is customary for him. For that reason I am trying to be as clear as possible in asking those questions again. I do not dispute that most of the details of how to secure community involvement in the RSS process are best left to guidance and regulations. Nor do I dispute that the regional spatial strategy will be quite different from the local development plan and therefore will require different processes in its preparation, including the process of securing community and stakeholder participation. But accepting these two points in no way lets the Government off the hook.
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para10"></a>Despite the fact that we have made some strong progress in terms of the Bill's provisions regarding accountability, I believe that we should still be seeking to give the proposed changes much more robust democratic credentials. The proposed system needs to be less top-down and more bottom-up.
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para11"></a>This short amendment will go a long way towards achieving that aim. It would help emphasise and guarantee the continued centrality of democratic engagement to the planning system in this country. The message to regional planning bodies would be <P>


<a name="column_132"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clear: regional planning may be less local than structure plans or local plans, but as a process it is no less obliged to secure meaningful involvement.
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para12"></a>As I previously said, according to research conducted by the Local Government Association, 95 per cent of planning authorities said it would not be easy to secure meaningful community involvement in regional planning. Thus, given the obvious concerns of the community of professional planners about how community involvement will be achieved, it is vital that the Government send the signal that securing community participation is an essential part of the regional planning process.
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para13"></a>The amendment is nine words long. Thus, we can hardly be accused of overburdening the Bill with unnecessary detail. I think we all agree that securing meaningful participation will represent a positive aim for the new system to try to achieve. If we value this as highly as I think we do, and as I think we should, a statement of community involvement must be included in the RSS and this must be legislated for on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-07_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, our Amendment No. 31 is in this group. We very much support the approach taken by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. We have chosen, however, to try and express the issue in Clause 6 and at somewhat greater length than has the noble Lord&#151;although I recognise that that is not always a matter for congratulation in this House.
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para14"></a>Our amendment proposes that not only must the regional planning body prepare a statement of community involvement, but before it does so it should also consult people whom it thinks have an interest in matters relating to the development and use of land within its region, and it states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The statement of community involvement is a statement of the authority's policy as to the involvement in the exercise of the body's functions under",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-07_para15"></a>
the relevant sections of the Bill. The Minister is likely to tell us&#151;because he will be consistent&#151;that the amendment is unnecessary; that it is covered in regulations; and that we should not put more provisions on the face of the Bill. In Committee, he said that such an amendment would not add value. I accept that it might not add value to the Government's policy and aims, but I believe that it would add value to the legislation.
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para16"></a>If the Bill when enacted lasts for as long as have previous major pieces of legislation regarding town and country planning, this Government are unlikely to be the Government for the whole of its tenure.
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para17"></a>The draft regulations require the regional planning body to consult such of the "general consultation bodies" as it considers appropriate and, indeed, require a statement on consultation. The "general consultation bodies"&#151;and they are bodies and not individuals&#151;are voluntary bodies, which represent racial, ethnic and national groups in the region, different religious groups, the interests of disabled <P>


<a name="column_133"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>persons and business interests. I suspect that that is not a catchall. I wondered first about amenity groups, but I daresay they come within voluntary bodies.
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para18"></a>What about, for instance, education? The Minister may say that that is not a spatial matter&#151;at any rate not at regional level. But I wonder whether that is actually so, especially when one thinks about higher and tertiary levels and skills training, and, as I have said, the provision relates to bodies and not individuals. There seems to be no place in this thinking for individuals to contribute.
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para19"></a>We are keen that the new planning arrangements and their outcome are, to use the jargon, "owned" by the communities, which they should be designed to serve. The communities, of course, are made up of individuals who may express themselves sometimes through bodies but at times as individuals.
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para20"></a>The Government may know that they will always require a statement in such an approach, but do not trust the local authorities to provide a statement of community involvement without including it in primary legislation. So, do they trust all future governments?
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para21"></a>I know that it is not easy to collect and collate views at regional level, but planning requires a lot of public trust; and the more remote it is the less is the trust. I have referred to the draft regulations, but I think that the annex to the consultation paper is splendid in this regard on community involvement. It states that "community" means,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"all those who have an interest in and a contribution to make . . .  individuals as well as local authorities and bodies representing various interest groups. [It means] more than the provision of information and the invitation to respond . . .  It should mean the opportunity to participate in shaping the RSS revision".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-07_para22"></a>
It continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The benefits of this include giving the community an element of ownership"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-07_para23"></a>
I did not realise when I previously used the term that it was actually in the consultation document&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"thereby increasing the chances of successful implementation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-07_para24"></a>
The paper says that community involvement,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"should be project managed in the same way as the rest of the RSS revision process, to which it is integral".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-07_para25"></a>
It talks about identifying the anticipated resource cost, the responsibilities for managing the process, and so on.
<P>

<a name="40224-07_para26"></a>Today we had the announcement of the consultation on the new PPS1&#151;Planning Policy Statement 1. The news release from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"PPS1 also makes clear community involvement in the planning system is crucial".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-07_para27"></a>
I am sure it does. I admit to not yet having read the draft that has been released. It continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Effective community involvement requires processes for informing peoples about policies and proposals in good time; enabling communities to put forward their own ideas and participate in developing proposals and options; consultation on formal proposals; and feedback".

<FONT SIZE=3>
That expresses the issue beautifully, so let us have it in the Bill.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040224/text/40224-08.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, I hope that my noble friends will take very seriously the issues being put forward. For me there is an issue of joined-up political thinking. Currently, we are spending a good deal of time in this House considering how we can re-engage a wider proportion of the electorate in the political system&#151;making the voting processes more accessible; and trying to get a higher participation in those processes.
<P>

<a name="40224-08_para0"></a>It is difficult to think of many issues that affect more people more significantly than planning issues in terms of the whole character of the area where they live. I believe that what is sometimes referred to as the alienation of the public about the political process is, in fact, a feeling that, in the end, it is not worth trying to do anything because, inevitably, the powers that be will prevail. Considering all that the Government are doing in other spheres, I cannot conceive that they do not believe deeply that it is very important for people to feel empowered and able to be significant in the evolution of policy. To relegate how that is to happen in this context to regulations seems to me to miss an opportunity. To have on the face of the Bill the fact that community engagement and involvement can be an important part of a democratic society would have provided a stronger position.
<P>

<a name="40224-08_para1"></a>I accept the Government's commitment in that direction and their intention. I do not accuse them in any way of bad faith. Therefore, if there is a vote on this amendment, I shall not vote against the Government. However, I feel sad that an opportunity to include, in very specific terms, a statement on the face of the Bill that reasserts the importance of the community in this crucial matter is being missed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I fully accept the reason for returning to this matter. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, politely said that in Committee the subject came up just after a vote&#151;the first defeat of the Government this year. I have here all the arguments that I rehearsed in Committee, which clearly did not impact in any way on the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, or my noble friend Lord Judd, so I shall not use any of those. I shall turn to the last page of my brief.
<P>

<a name="40224-08_para2"></a>It goes without saying that we are absolutely committed to proper community involvement and consultation in regional plan making. We remain to be convinced about adding to the Bill in the way that the amendments propose, but in view of the depth and substance of the debate today, I shall take these amendments away and seriously consider whether we can find a way of meeting the desire. My noble friend said that trust is a key point and that the powers that be always get what they want. I shall take the matter away and return at Third Reading with something that will satisfy the House.
<P>


<a name="column_135"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-08_para3"></a>There has to be a test: whether the powers will provide additional safeguards, generate more community involvement, and restore or improve the trust of people. We believe that we have in place means to do that in a secure way&#151;we have been sincere throughout. In view of today's debate and the fact that I have no arguments other than those that I used in Committee, it would be superfluous to use them again because they did not make an impact. I do not think this will cost us a great deal but it could have a major impact. Therefore, we shall take the matter away, give it serious consideration and hope to satisfy the House at Third Reading.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that answer and the noble Lord, Lord Judd, for his support. As I said, there appears to be much agreement on this matter, and very few words to add to the Bill, but they would give much reassurance to many people in what is, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, a new planning system that one imagines will last a long while. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will return with something quickly as we shall want to consider our strategy for the future. I accept what he has said today, but I hope that we do not have to wait until Third Reading. Perhaps he could let us know the Government's thinking before we get to Third Reading. If he can give me that assurance, I will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I am conscious that in the past few days I have flooded noble Lords and colleagues with paperwork, trying to answer the points that they made previously. Part of the motive was to avoid long speeches at Report stage, and part of it was to give information and explanation of issues that were raised in Committee and to give advance warning of what the Government propose to do with amendments as far in advance as possible. Naturally, that applies to what I have just said regarding the community involvement in relation to the two amendments in this group.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40224-08_para4"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="40224-08_time0"></a><H5>4.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield </B>   moved Amendment No. 2:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 10, leave out "must set out" and insert "shall have regard to"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-08_para5"></a><P>

<a name="40224-08_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, on this amendment we revisit the Government's justification for the policies that the regional spatial strategy will contain. As before, this amendment would change the nature and content of the regional spatial strategy. The RSS would have regard to the Secretary of State's policies rather than simply setting them out. We believe that the amendment is necessary because if the Government are determined to establish regional planning in the form of regional spatial strategies, they must allow RSSs to be fully owned by regional planning bodies.
<P>


<a name="column_136"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-08_para7"></a>As I have said previously, it is not unreasonable to interpret Clause 2 as conceiving a regional spatial strategy as nothing more than a planning document which sets out the Secretary of State's policy agenda for a particular region. The amendment is aimed at freeing up the regional planning bodies via regional spatial strategies from being simply the mouthpiece of Whitehall policy. The amendment addresses the concern expressed by many interested parties that unless there are changes to the way that regional spatial strategies are established in legislation, there will be no space for local accountability as planning policy is implemented on the ground.
<P>

<a name="40224-08_para8"></a>Of course, we recognise the importance of the Government's role in giving strategic leadership to the planning system. We do not understand why the RSS must set out the Secretary of State's policies in relation to the development and use of land within a region. Why can it not set out its own policies while having regard to the framework of national policy? Is it not obvious that if one is to set up regional planning bodies, they should be accountable for their own policies rather than for the Secretary of State's policies?
<P>

<a name="40224-08_para9"></a>It is vital that we bolster the capacity of regional planning bodies to respond to local conditions. At the moment this legislation simply fails to recognise the enormous differences and variations between and within regions in current land use and development and future needs. As it stands, Clause 2(2) would lead to the accelerated fossilisation of regional spatial strategies because they would constantly have to keep up with the rate at which new demands emanate from Whitehall in order to satisfy the requirement to set out the Secretary of State's policies.
<P>

<a name="40224-08_para10"></a>If the Government are serious about devolving power to the regions and about devolution, how can they square that with a policy that makes regional planning bodies, even after the establishment of elected regional assemblies, simply the agents of Whitehall and Westminster? Not only is democratic accountability being sucked out of the system by transferring powers upwards, away from counties, but it also leaks out at the regional level. As I said, regional planning bodies may find themselves accountable for policies that they do not support and over which they can exercise no control.
<P>

<a name="40224-08_para11"></a>In the brave new world of devolution and elected regional assemblies, one cannot simply transfer the old accountabilities on to the new regional structure. The regional spatial strategy should not be a vehicle for simply setting out government policy; it should be a strategic vision that meets the planning needs of local communities. Their elected representatives should agree it. Of course regional spatial strategies will still have to have regard, as I said before, to the Government's priorities, which is accepted. The amendment maintains that important dimension.
<P>

<a name="40224-08_para12"></a>The amendment ensures that regional spatial strategies are permitted the necessary flexibility to respond to conditions in their areas. It would go a small way towards restoring a better balance between local accountability and central control. By establishing <P>


<a name="column_137"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regional planning bodies' ownership of the regional spatial strategy and removing a key mechanism by which the Secretary of State can exert total central control over regional planning, the amendment reasserts the principle of democratic accountability as being fundamental to an effective planning system. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-08_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches support the amendment. I looked back to see what the Minister said on this issue in Committee, and I must say that it was a little difficult to relate his remarks&#151;which were to a group of amendments&#151;to this point. I confess that I have struggled with this subsection and whether by altering it we would in any way affect the potential vacuum to which the Minister drew our attention at the last stage, if the regional planning guidance did not morph straight into the regional spatial strategy. I do not think that that is so, but it is significant that the provision is in Clause 2, which is essentially the clause that sets us off down the road of regional spatial strategies and will remain in there. This is the Secretary of State top-down from the top of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40224-08_para13"></a>Our concern is to get the right balance of observance of national policies, so there is an issue of the extent to which they can be debated, given the form that they take. We must get the balance right between national policies and local and regional interests. I include localities and local areas because they must be in conformity with the regional spatial strategy. The interests run all the way up and down society.
<P>

<a name="40224-08_para14"></a>This is the Secretary of State top-down from the top of the Bill. We made that point time and time again, probably to the point of tedium, at the last stage. The fact that we will not make it on every amendment this time does not mean to say that the issue has gone away. We support the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that I followed what the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said. There seemed to be an assumption in what he said about devolution that this was the Secretary of State always getting his own way. I will make this absolutely clear&#151;under our present governance arrangements, the Secretary of State has regional planning policies. He is accountable for them both now and under the changed system. However, if there were elected regional assemblies cutting out this function, the Secretary of State would not need any regional spatial policies. The issue of devolution means that you remove completely the Secretary of State's role&#151;it would be for the regional planning body. This assumption that it is the Secretary of State all the while, even with devolution, is simply not true. If there has been a misunderstanding about that, I apologise. I obviously did not explain it clearly in Committee, but that is the reality. This is not an issue of the Secretary of State running riot.
<P>


<a name="column_138"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-09_para0"></a>Furthermore, when the regional planning bodies prepare revisions of the regional planning guidance now and of spatial strategies in the future, under the present arrangement&#151;without an elected regional assembly&#151;because they know better than Whitehall, if they wish to depart and divert from national policy and make the case for that in the examination in public, they are free to do so. Obviously, Ministers who then reach a view on the final form of the policies must take into account the case made in the panel report. It would not be possible, even if the examination in public came down in favour of the regional planning board deviating from national planning policy, for the Minister to then say, "No, I have got my own policy". That would be an unreasonable, irrational approach by the Minister, which would be subject to my learned friends in judicial review.
<P>

<a name="40224-09_para1"></a>There is an underlying assumption in this amendment and in both the speeches that we have just heard that this is the Secretary of State laying down the rules and laying down the laws, whether or not there is devolution. That is simply not the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, why does the Secretary of State then have the power to override the inspector's report in Clause 9(6), where the Secretary of State if he thinks fit can strike out any provisions in the RSS that the inspector has agreed on the submission of the RPB?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, yes, but as I have just said&#151;we are talking about two different sets of circumstances here. If it is the case that there are devolved elected regional assemblies, the Secretary of State will not have any regional planning policies anyway. There will not be anything at the centre for the Secretary of State to have. The way in which the Bill is drafted covers both those sets of circumstances. Whether there are elected regional assemblies is a matter for the people to choose, initially in the three regions that we have all talked about, later this year. The fact is that he would not have a role to play, because he would not need any regional spatial policies in the first place, because they would be in the ownership of an elected regional assembly.
<P>

<a name="40224-09_para2"></a>I make that absolutely clear, in case there is any doubt about this at all. We do not think that this is a straitjacket approach, which is the view that has been raised about the negation of democracy. That simply is not the case. The planning bodies still have the freedom to set it out, and I am not looking at a particular part of the Bill, but the Secretary of State cannot act on a whim or a hunch. He must act rationally. If he does not, he is subject to challenge in the courts. He cannot simply dismiss reports or dismiss evidence. I have given an example. If the panel report came out in favour of a departure from the national plan that the regional planning body had made, it would be difficult in those circumstances, unless they were most exceptional, for Minister to override. Their decision would have to be made in the light of the panel report. It is not a question of them simply dismissing this. Therefore, we do not think that this amendment is necessary.
<P>


<a name="column_139"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 139</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-09_para3"></a>I have a couple of paragraphs that would be worth putting on the record, for the avoidance of any doubt later on, and for those who follow our proceedings. It will only be a short one. I have made the point that the two arguments in the two speeches are based on a false premise. Our fundamental approach is that the regions need planning policies that are specific to the circumstances in each region. The provisions in Clause 2(2)&#151;which is what this amendment seeks to change&#151;specify that regional spatial strategy must set out the Secretary of State's spatial strategies. This has been described as a straitjacket and a negation of democracy. It has also been argued that it is inconsistent with the provisions in the Bill that provide for the first regional spatial strategy for each region to be such regional planning guidance as the Secretary of State prescribes. There is another debate about that later on, so I will not go into detail.
<P>

<a name="40224-09_para4"></a>We must be clear about the relationship between the Secretary of State's national planning policies and the regional spatial strategies. Clause 6 requires regional planning bodies to have regard to national policies in preparing a draft revision of a regional spatial strategy. That relationship is also true of the regional planning guidance. We want the regional planning bodies to articulate in the regional spatial strategy the spatial vision of what the region will look like at the end of the period of the strategy. That vision will be unique to that region and will not replicate other regions or be a subset of the national picture. The regional planning bodies will have the freedom to set out the policies that will work in their region to turn the vision into reality. The national planning policies are there to provide a framework, not a straitjacket. As I have said, in the case of devolution, where there is an elected regional assembly, if it is playing that role and that is its intention, the Secretary of State would not need any regional spatial strategies anyway. Game, set and match. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. As always, he is beguiling in his answers and tries to confuse the issue. He was crafty in his reply.
<P>

<a name="40224-09_para5"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, we do not want to keep repeating throughout Report stage that the Bill is top-down, instead of bottom-up, and that the ODPM seems to be the only planner in the country. I was grateful for the Minister's answer. There were two scenarios: one with an elected regional assembly and one without. The Minister spoke about both, and it was interesting to hear what he said about the situation if there were an elected regional assembly. Going by what he said, he should not mind at all if the words in the Bill were changed from "must set out" to "shall have regard to". He gave an answer that I could have given, so we must test the feeling of the House on the issue.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield </B>   moved Amendment No. 3:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 11, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-09_para8"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(2A) The RSS will set the spatial framework for the strategies of the regional development agency in its region."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-09_para9"></a><P>

<a name="40224-09_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, with this amendment we return to the issue of how the regional spatial strategy will fit and interrelate with other strategies in the region. Although our amendment makes reference only to the strategy of the regional development agency, because of the importance we attach to the relationship between spatial planning and economic planning, we are certainly not precluding ourselves from supporting the idea that the regional spatial strategy should provide the spatial framework for other regional strategies.
<P>

<a name="40224-09_para11"></a>The draft PPS11 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is essential that the regional spatial strategy both shapes and is shaped by other regional strategies".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-09_para12"></a><P>

<a name="40224-09_para13"></a>As a bland statement of how regional strategies would relate to one another in an ideal world, this would be clear and uncontroversial. However, given that this is not the case&#151;I think here particularly of the examples put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, when we discussed this previously&#151;we are concerned that the Government's policy is based on little more than wishful thinking. To that extent, we are arguing for a more robust approach to this issue by the Government. By extension, we do not believe that regulations would adequately demonstrate the Government's commitment to regional spatial strategies being truly spatial frameworks.
<P>

<a name="40224-09_para14"></a>In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, indicated that I supported the idea of a hierarchy of regional strategies, with the regional spatial strategy being pre-eminent. That was an understandable interpretation of my arguments, but my intention with this amendment is less concerned with establishing hierarchies than it is with bringing a bit of realism to the Government's thinking on this issue.
<P>

<a name="40224-09_para15"></a>Let me be clear. This is not about regional planning bodies controlling what regional development agencies can do. It is simply a question of recognising the potential for conflict between the two and ensuring that the regional spatial strategy is exactly that&#151;regional, spatial and strategic&#151;which it will not be if it does not set the spatial framework for the strategies of the regional development agency in its region.
<P>

<a name="40224-09_para16"></a>As it stands, the Bill is silent on how all these various regional strategies will relate to each other. That seems to me to be a recipe for confusion. Furthermore, regional strategies are not automatically supportive of and <P>


<a name="column_143"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consistent with one another&#151;a point, as I have said, well illustrated by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, in Committee.
<P>

<a name="40224-09_para17"></a>If we are to have RSSs, it is important that the different regional strategies are integrated and co-ordinated and that provision is made for this in the Bill. If it is left to guidance, the mechanism by which we can deliver joined-up policies at the regional level will remain unclear and will not be subject to proper debate in Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40224-09_para18"></a>The drawing-up of planning responsibilities from counties to regional planning bodies in this Bill reinforces the importance of having one overarching spatial framework at the regional level. I do not believe in the utopian vision that all the regional strategies are somehow reflecting and correlating with one another. I think that there will be more conflict than the Government believe there will be, and it is only right that the professionals on the ground know where they stand when it arises. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-09_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, we support this amendment, as we did in Committee. My noble friend Lady Maddock, who spoke then, referred to the draft PPS11 which states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is essential that the regional spatial strategy both shapes and is shaped by other regional strategies".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-09_para19"></a><P>

<a name="40224-09_para20"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield has referred to this&#151;that we were seeking to put the regional spatial strategy at the top of a hierarchy. That is not so. What we are seeking to do is to set a spatial framework for other strategies which are not in themselves spatial, or not primarily spatial. He said that the regional spatial strategy&#151;going through all this is rather like trying to say "she sells seashells"!&#151;takes forward the regional housing strategy; that the regional transport strategy is part and parcel of the regional spatial strategy; and that, if there is an inconsistency, there will be an opportunity to iron it out. He said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The documents are published; they are there for consultation. In a sense, the other regional strategies get pulled into the spatial strategy and that is the overriding driver for it".&#151;[Official Report, 20/1/04; col. 998.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-09_para21"></a><P>

<a name="40224-09_para22"></a>That, my Lords, makes the case.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, the argument is a very major but a very simple one. Basically, the whole planning system is intended to see that the country and the countryside are not wrecked. Ultimately, it is the spatial strategy which must take that very long-term view. It is absolutely right that other developments do fit in with it. That is why I strongly support this amendment.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para0"></a>There are plenty of examples of where there have been desirable regional goals which actually would be very harmful in the long-term interests of the country, but I will not take the time of the House listing them. I hope that, by accepting this amendment, we will be enshrining the long-term future of the countryside.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, could I take up with the Minister a question which I raised by means of a <P>


<a name="column_144"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 144</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Written Question on 12 February? That is, the mismatch between the policy of the Home Office on burial law in the 21st century&#151;which suggests that an assessment should be made of community needs every 10 years&#151;and the draft PPS11, which provides that the regional spatial strategy should develop a strategy for the region of at least 15 years.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para1"></a>In her reply, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For planning purposes, the provision of land for burial is currently considered to be a local, rather than regional, land use issue".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-10_para2"></a><P>

<a name="40224-10_para3"></a>She also said that the consultation paper which has now been issued by the Government,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"seeks views on whether the provision of burial grounds should be linked to the local core strategy development plan, outlined in planning policy statement 12: local development frameworks. Such plans should cover a period of at least 10 years".&#151;[Official Report, 12/2/04; col. WA 174.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-10_para4"></a><P>

<a name="40224-10_para5"></a>The provision of land for burial is already a serious problem in many areas of the country, and may become more so in the future when many of the minority communities in this country want to stick to burial rather than to move towards cremation. Therefore, demographers should be able to predict what is the regional requirement for burial grounds over a period of 15 years, and that should then feed into the local development plan.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para6"></a>That is a case where a regional framework is needed and where the Government's consultation paper on burial law and policy in the 21st century has got it wrong. It is not meshing correctly with the current proposals for legislation in the planning field.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I have to admit that I have not come briefed on burial law, but I am pleased to note that there is a consultation paper. Therefore, this is a matter on which Ministers have not made a final decision.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para7"></a>On the concern expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, about protecting the countryside, the regional spatial strategy is that under which the plan-led system protects the countryside. Anyone would think that everything had been hunky-dory up to now. I can remember looking at some figures when I was at MAFF: in a six-year period in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a quarter of the hedgerows disappeared. That changed the face of the countryside. People may say that everything has been okay up to now, the countryside has been protected and the Bill is wrecking things, but that is far from being the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-10_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Is there an interest to declare, my Lords?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-10_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, surely the Minister realises that the hedgerows disappeared because a grant was offered by MAFF for their removal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I am simply saying that the idea that everything has been hunky-dory up to now <P>


<a name="column_145"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 145</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the countryside has been protected is nonsense, as that one point shows. I deprecate that, anyway. I was talking about the late 1980s and early 1990s, by the way, when the despoliation of the countryside was obviously financed by the previous government, although I do not want to go into that. I am simply making the point that the countryside has not been protected up to now.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para8"></a>I digress because, by and large, as we said in Committee, we are very supportive of the amendment. The principle expressed in it has our strong support. However, as with one or two other areas, at this point, we do not think the Bill is the right place for an imprecisely defined statement. Whether it could be refined, I do not know&#151;I am not making any commitment.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para9"></a>We think it absolutely right that the regional spatial strategy should set the spatial framework for the regional economic strategy, but this is part of a two-way process. The spatial strategy needs to be shaped by the regional economic strategy as well as shaping it. We think that the way in which the amendment is drafted implies a hierarchical relationship, with the regional spatial strategy at the top. We do not think that is the right way forward. Perhaps we are misunderstanding the purpose, but our view is that the way in which the amendment is drafted would create a hierarchical relationship.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para10"></a>The regions need a joined-up approach; the regional spatial strategy and the regional economic strategy both serve a different role and function, but the one helps create the other. The relationship between the regional planning body and the regional development agency should properly be one between equals. That would not be the case if we accepted the narrow wording of the amendment. It can be a relationship in which there are different points of view reflecting the different purposes of the strategies, but that does not mean that they will necessarily contradict one another.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para11"></a>It is essential is that these bodies&#151;and, indeed, the other bodies that have to work together drawing up key regional strategies&#151;work together to develop a shared understanding of the issues, objectives and opportunities in a particular region. It will be different in each region, as we emphasised in draft planning policy statement 11 on regional planning. This is already happening: in Yorkshire and the Humber, for example, joint stakeholder consultations events were organised by the regional planning body and the regional development agency during the recent review of both strategies.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para12"></a>From a practical point of view, people on the front line are making a reality of things. We do not think we need such a provision in the Bill, as it would give a hierarchical view. The amendment is simply not needed, certainly not in its current form. Therefore, I hope the noble Lord will withdraw it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his answer. I shall reflect on his comments about the hedgerows. It is a classic example of what we are <P>


<a name="column_146"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concerned about in the Bill. The Secretary of State at the time had so much power that he could remove the hedgerows. If we gave any Secretary of State as much power in this planning legislation, bizarre things might happen in the future. The Minister has given a classic example of why we are trying to change the Bill. He has made our arguments about the Secretary of State for us, and we will remind him of that throughout the remainder of the Bill's proceedings.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-10_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, you can trust this Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-10_spnew9"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-10_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I will give an example, my Lords. First, that happened not under this Government but under the previous one. Secondly, there are 30,000 more hectares in the green belt today than we inherited from the previous government in 1997. We need no lessons in that respect&#151;we have a good record.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-10_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I am sure the Minister will accept that the Secretary of State at that time thought he was doing the right thing, but future generations have reflected on that. There should have been more debate about it at the time, which is what we want to ensure in this Bill. We want to make certain that no one can do anything without a good debate, considering the various points of view before arriving at any planning policies.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para13"></a>I do not want to create any hierarchies&#151;that is not the purpose of the amendment. In my own region, the potential development of Stansted airport is a tremendous economic factor in the eastern region, but it must be tied in with the planning and spatial strategies.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para14"></a>The Minister seems to agree that bodies must work together to make the various strategies happen. I hope that he will reflect on this before Third Reading, as we need clarity before finalising the Bill, and that we can have a further debate on it then. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para15"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-10_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield </B>   moved Amendment No. 4:

<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-10_para16"></a><P>

"(3A) The RSS must include sub-regional plans for all parts of the region in accordance with geographical boundaries defined by the RPB.
<br>
(3B) The sub-regional plans referred to in subsection (3A) shall be prepared by the authorities falling within section 5(1) if their area or any part of their area is in the defined sub-region."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40224-10_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we return to a major set of amendments that are concerned with ensuring that counties and other strategic planning authorities have a stronger role to play in the planning process.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para18"></a>Although I welcomed the Government's concessions in Committee on the role of county councils and other authorities, fundamentally I do not believe they have gone far enough. I think I am supported in that belief by many of your Lordships, by most interested outside organisations and by planners.
<P>


<a name="column_147"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 147</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para19"></a>Amendment No. 9 would put on the face of the Bill a statutory role for strategic planning authorities in the formulation of sub-regional strategies for their area. It is slightly different from Amendment No. 4, and certainly more extensive.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para20"></a>Throughout our deliberations, our approach has been to attempt to make the best of a bad job. We do not believe that the proposals brought before the House in Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill will improve the planning system.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para21"></a>One of the main areas of concern identified in earlier stages of debate, in this House and the other place, has been the wide gap between regional spatial strategies and local development. There is a yawning void created by removing structure plans from the process. It will create a serious problem for effective sub-regional planning and the co-ordination of transport, housing and infrastructure at the sub-regional scale.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para22"></a>The Government have attempted to paper over the crack by proposing that regional spatial strategies should include policies for sub-regions, but it is doubtful whether these will be sufficiently detailed to provide more than broad guidance about development strategy at the sub-regional scale. Furthermore, because they would be produced as an integral part of the regional spatial strategy, there will be a lack of flexibility about when the sub-regional policies can be updated. The fact that there will not be comprehensive coverage will leave some areas without a clear sub-regional strategy to guide development and infrastructure investment. In my own county, we have the Thames Gateway, with clear strategies&#151;we have the developing M11 corridor, with possibly more houses to be built up the A12 than anywhere else. Clearly there will be no sub-regional strategy for these areas, and it is a recipe for chaos.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para23"></a>The draft PPS11, on which the Government have been consulting, stresses that planning issues are not necessarily contained within county boundaries. The point becomes doubly evident at the district scale. There are many examples&#151;I think particularly of some in my own country of Essex, such as Harlow, where the expansion of a largely urban district, with tightly constrained boundaries, can take place only in adjoining districts. These will not necessarily be included within the main sub-regions identified at RSS level. How will authorities plan the development of such areas in a joined-up way without some form of sub-regional planning? 
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para24"></a>Clauses 28 and 29 provide for adjoining local authorities to produce joint local development documents and for joint committees to be established to assist that process. However, I am sceptical about how many districts will voluntarily join together to produce local development documents on a joint basis. The provisions in this Bill for joint local development documents will not plug the gap in sub-regional planning. Simply put, the proposals do not grasp the full range of sub-regional planning nor the way it is delivered on the ground.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para25"></a>We have already had much debate about the way in which this Bill marginalises county councils from the planning process, despite the fact that they are <P>


<a name="column_148"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 148</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsible for the majority of local services in two-tier areas, some of which are crucial to the delivery of sustainable patterns of development&#151;highways and transportation being the most prominent. However, the Government recognised that, and we welcome amending the old Clause 4, which is now Clause 5, to give county councils a statutory role to advise the regional planning body on the preparation of RSS, although we still believe that the Government underestimate the importance of the role of county councils in strategic planning. I am sure that we will return to this issue later today.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para26"></a>I now return to the point of Amendment No. 4. The Government's amendments in Committee did not adequately address the crucial role of county councils in sub-regional planning. The purpose of this amendment is to plug the gap at sub-regional level by providing for the preparation of sub-regional plans, led by the strategic planning authorities as part of the RSS. It should not be interpreted as an attempt to reintroduce structure plans by the back door. That is not the intention. Nor would it undermine the pre-eminence of the regional spatial strategy. The procedure can be flexible and efficient and will not add another tier to the process. It would give a clear and appropriate strategic planning role to county councils and other strategic planning authorities at sub-regional level. Ultimately, from my own experience, I am absolutely positive that the amendment would help the Government's own objectives for sustainable communities&#151;no joke.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para27"></a>Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 would further strengthen the strategic planning authority role. It is important to reiterate that there will be no intervening fully democratic level of planning in this country between the district level and the Secretary of State unless we have elected regional assemblies all over England. That looks extremely unlikely to happen&#151;I hope that it does not&#151;at least in the short term. We have an enormous structural gap in the planning system between districts and regions. Ministers must recognise that this will not tend to lead to effective planning. Perhaps they think that they will be able to continue to rely on the strategic authorities for sub-regional planning support. That is not the case. Although there is a statutory role for sub-regional planning, the reality is that many authorities will shed staff that they can no longer afford in order to fulfil the Government's requirements. That would be a disaster.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para28"></a>The Minister gave us his assurance that county councils would not lose any money whatsoever, but they are losing their role in writing county structure plans, in sub-regional planning and associated responsibilities. Surely, there will be a gradual downgrading, even if it is not yet envisaged. That would be a disaster, because capacity in the planning system does not currently lie in the regional chambers or Government Offices. The strategic expertise, technical know-how and wealth of experience in strategic planning is based, not surprisingly, at strategic authority level. To disperse and get rid of that pool of expertise&#151;which, as it currently stands, the Bill would surely do&#151;would be a terrible <P>


<a name="column_149"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 149</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>waste of one of the most valuable resources in our planning system, and would hinder the Government in their objectives in delivering sustainable communities.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para29"></a>I hope that the Minister will recognise that the success of sub-regional planning will be vital to achieving many of the demanding targets that the Government have set within their overarching sustainable communities policy framework. A statutory sub-regional dimension needs to be written into the Bill's provisions. As I said earlier, we doubt that the provisions for joint committees in Clauses 29 and 30 go far enough in this regard.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para30"></a>The strategic planning function of county councils is a precious resource. We cannot support legislation that treats the bulk of planning expertise in this country as an afterthought to local government reorganisation. The amendments ensure several problems with the legislation are addressed. They will strengthen the effective delivery of sub-regional planning, help preserve some measure of accountability within the proposed new system in the event that Clause 1 is eventually removed from the Bill, and offer more opportunities for public involvement. They will make the system more bottom up and less top down, will mean that counties will be less handicapped in integrating their transport, waste and minerals plans and will ensure that the capacity and expertise of the existing system are not lost. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40224-10_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, again, we are pleased to be able to support this amendment. We tabled an amendment at the last stage that drew attention to the importance of work at a sub-regional level. Our amendment was perhaps a little less prescriptive than this one and therefore a good deal less forceful. The criticisms of that amendment were that we&#151;the criticisms were voiced by the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, but meant to refer to all of us&#151;could not afford to see a proliferation of plans under the guise of sub-regional strategies that are poorly integrated and serve only to create confusion and uncertainty, which I understand. The various amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, meet that criticism, both providing for sub-regional plans to be put into place and providing for how they get there. That is an important part of the programme.
<P>

<a name="40224-10_para31"></a>I do not think that it is necessary to weary the House by repeating arguments for the importance of a sub-regional as well as a regional approach. Common sense and noble Lords' experience in their own areas make it immediately clear that a gap or lacuna between the regional and district levels does not work well in practice. We support the amendments.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-11_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, I support the group of amendments moved by my noble friend Lord Hanningfield. In Committee we probed the Government's intention to make the present RPGs into a statutory format as regional spatial strategies. If the RSS is to be mandatory as far as local authorities are concerned, it is essential that the current tiers of local government should contribute to the formulation of sub-regional planning and that this co-operation <P>


<a name="column_150"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 150</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be stipulated in the Bill. It is not good enough for the RPB to make arrangements for county councils and other nominated authorities to enable them to discharge the appropriate functions outlined in Clause 5.
<P>

<a name="40224-11_para0"></a>Amendment No. 9 changes the balance somewhat and makes the preparation of the RSS more inclusive for county councils and local authorities at the formulation of sub-regional plans. In the same way, it is important for the bodies mentioned in Amendment No. 10 also to have a role to play in the review and monitoring of the implementation of the RSS.
<P>

<a name="40224-11_para1"></a>If the regional spatial strategy is to reflect local areas correctly&#151;the Minister has already identified that it is important that the local area is properly considered&#151;it is vital that county councils and the other authorities nominated in Amendment No. 9 are included at an early stage of the preparation of the strategy. Therefore, the making of sub-regional plans is an integral part of the process. They will be a subset of plans for the region, but important for all that. Therefore, I support the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I am a bit surprised by the tone of the speeches on this issue. I believe that I am as well briefed as I can be, but I have seen nothing from the County Councils Network, for example, to say that it was dissatisfied with the major changes that the Government proposed to the Bill at Committee stage, which have now been included. As far as I know, the Local Government Association stands by its statements welcoming wholeheartedly the changes that took place. Nobody has referred to any specific note, letter, submission or representation, and I am not aware of anything from the county councils. I do not know whether this is a private enterprise operation on behalf of the bigwigs from local government who see their role under threat&#151;although as I have repeatedly made clear, it is not under threat&#151;or whether there has been full consultation with the rest of local government. I do not know, as nothing has been said in the three speeches that we have just heard, whether this measure is required and desired by the county councils in addition to the measure that the Government placed in the Bill at Committee stage. I am not at all clear why the amendment has been proposed.
<P>

<a name="40224-11_para2"></a>I should also say, before I begin my response, that the Government are not responsible for the grouping of the amendments, and there is no way in which Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 could ever be considered consequential on Amendment No. 4. I am grateful for the wider debate, and all that, but there is no doubt about it: the new clauses in Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 and Amendment No. 4 deal with totally different things.
<P>

<a name="40224-11_para3"></a>I shall give the Government's response, but I should be very grateful if in the future we could be told if an issue has arisen from the County Councils Network, as it would obviously help us. Frankly, we would like to know about it, as we have been trying to listen to people. This has been an issue since the Bill was published and since the Green Paper; I fully accept <P>


<a name="column_151"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that. It is of key importance, and we believed that in the amendments that are now part of Clause 5 we had gone some considerable way to satisfying people&#151;and had in fact satisfied them&#151;on the issues that have been raised.
<P>

<a name="40224-11_para4"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said that she did not want to put everything on the record. Indeed, we might as well just say, "Let's get to the vote", as it probably does not make a blind bit of difference what I am about to say. However, because I believe that the Government have a good case, I am determined to put the full note on the record, just for those outside this place. I feel a bit aggrieved about this proposal being introduced when there were no complaints following Committee stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the Minister would like me to answer that point now. As a member of the County Councils Network, I have been made aware of all the negotiations that went on for several months. As I have said repeatedly, we welcome what the Government have introduced into the Bill, but it was not what the County Councils Network wanted in the beginning&#151;it wanted much more. I am aware of the negotiations that went on, and what the County Councils Network and the LGA started off with was far more than what is proposed in this amendment. The amendment, which I shall explain again later, is totally supported by every county and every strategic planning authority that I know. It is where we wanted the negotiations to end rather than where they have ended. I repeat: we welcome the Government's amendment, but it is not exactly what we wanted.
<P>

<a name="40224-11_time0"></a><H5>5.15 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I hope that I have made it clear that I sincerely respect the role of the noble Lord in the county councils, as he is the leader of a major county council. However, he put a caveat on what he said, when he remarked that the amendment was supported by everyone he knew. In due course, I should like to know how far that goes. Is this the final frontier? Is this it, or do those outside want more? They may say to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, "Well, you tried, but you didn't go far enough as far as we're concerned".
<P>

<a name="40224-11_para5"></a>As I have said, the Government have not received any representations in this regard, although the negotiations went on not just for months but for the best part of a year and a half. However, I shall plod on with my brief, irrespective of the consequences.
<P>

<a name="40224-11_para6"></a>Amendment No. 4 would require the regional spatial strategy to include sub-regional plans for all parts of the region and for these to be prepared by such county councils, metropolitan district councils, unitary authorities and national park authorities any part of whose area is covered by the sub-region. Anyone would think that sub-regional strategies did not already take place. The classic example is the south Midlands/Milton Keynes area. That has a sub-regional strategy, covering as it does several district councils, two and a half county councils and touching as it does on the boundaries of three regions. A sub-regional strategy is taking place, so <P>


<a name="column_152"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 152</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>there is no problem in that regard and no problem about it taking place after the Bill becomes an Act. There is not an issue over sub-regional plans.
<P>

<a name="40224-11_para7"></a>Regional spatial strategies will contain a new emphasis on sub-regions. As draft planning policy statement 11 makes clear, where sub-regional strategies are being drawn up, we would expect those authorities with strategic planning expertise in the area to take the lead on, or participate in, that work. However, we expect sub-regional strategies, in the sense of parts of the region having a distinct set of policies, to be the exception not the rule. Surely, that is a fair point. The whole point is to have sub-regional strategies where they are actually needed. The south Midlands/Milton Keynes example is a good one, and I have no doubt that others could be given. The Thames Gateway is another obvious example of where there is a sub-regional strategy, as again it covers three regions and two county councils, plus the GLA. Where they are needed, they can take place now and will be able to take place when the Bill is passed, but not all over the country&#151;that is simply not needed.
<P>

<a name="40224-11_para8"></a>We do not want to see a proliferation of plans, under the guise of sub-regional strategies. The noble Lord said that he did not want the structure plans back, but that is the underlying theme in proposing the amendment and making the kind of speeches that we have just heard. They imply that county councils want to continue their role, so there should be three levels of plan-making. That is what we are seeking to avoid. A two-tier planning system will be much easier to understand, and the ownership of the plans will be absolutely clear and unambiguous. That is very important. Otherwise, when we are faced with a strategic policy deficit, then sub-regional strategies will be prepared to deal with the specific growth or regeneration needs of an area. The three-tier system, which is what is being proposed in the amendment&#151;let us make no bones about that&#151;constrained as it has been by administrative boundaries, has sometimes failed to tackle sub-regional issues that are now for the first time beginning to be looked at in the revision of regional plans. The three-city area of Nottingham, Leicester and Derby in the east Midlands is just one example.
<P>

<a name="40224-11_para9"></a>Amendment No. 9 is a new clause that would place a duty on county councils, unitary authorities, metropolitan district councils and national park authorities to advise not only regional planning bodies but also the Secretary of State and local planning authorities about strategic planning matters. The amendment would place a duty on those authorities to formulate sub-regional planning policy and provide for them to work jointly with other authorities or the regional planning body to do so. I hope that I have covered the sub-regional issue under Amendment No. 4. I would only add that we expect local authorities to work together under arrangements with the regional planning body to formulate sub-regional strategies for their area when they are needed. That includes the county councils. There is nothing in the Bill that restricts that happening. It can happen now and it will be able to happen under the Bill when it is passed.
<P>


<a name="column_153"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 153</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-11_para10"></a>We see no added value in county councils, metropolitan district councils, unitary authorities or national park authorities advising the Secretary of State on strategic planning matters as well as the regional planning body. Those authorities will make their voices heard anyway, through the regional spatial strategy revision process, and influence its outcome. It does not make sense for them to advise the Secretary of State independently of this. It would only result in more red tape, more paperwork, more cost and more bureaucracy. That is what is being proposed in the amendments&#151;let us be quite honest and open about that.
<P>

<a name="40224-11_para11"></a>The unitary, metropolitan district councils and national park authorities will be local planning authorities under the Bill and would be required to advise themselves under the amendment, while the role of the county councils in advising local planning authorities is already clearly defined in draft planning policy statement 12 and the regulations. There is also the option of the county council becoming a member of a joint committee to take on the role of preparing a local development document.
<P>

<a name="40224-11_para12"></a>Amendment No. 10&#151;the other new clause&#151;would require the regional planning body to take advice from county councils, unitary authorities, the metropolitan district councils and the national park authorities on the preparation, review and monitoring of the implementation of the regional spatial strategy in relation to each region. The reappearance of this amendment is very surprising. The fact that it still refers to authorities in Clause 4(2) and not Clause 5(3) indicates that it has probably slipped through the net. It is a leftover from Committee stage. It seeks to fight old battles which the Government have in many ways accepted by our amendments in Committee. The amendment mirrors almost precisely what the amended Clause 5 already provides for. So we simply do not think it is necessary. Noble Lords have decided that the Government's concessions do not go far enough. However, as I said at the beginning, by no stretch of the imagination are Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 directly consequential on Amendment No. 4.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that response. I think that everyone now accepts that we will have reasonable spatial strategies with planning policy being done at regional level. As the leader of Essex County Council, I am very much involved in the issue on a daily basis and, like the Minister, I want the system to work. If we are going to have an eastern regional policy, I want it to work.
<P>

<a name="40224-12_para0"></a>I do not like to give examples from my own county. However, as I said in my initial remarks, Essex has both the A12 corridor and heavy congestion in Chelmsford. We are trying to establish a park and ride system in Chelmsford which involves several district councils and the development of the A12. It is not a matter for the regional spatial strategy but will involve several districts and Essex County Council. We are trying to ensure that the Bill provides the capacity to create sub-regional planning policies and the strategies <P>


<a name="column_154"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 154</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to deliver. The county council has just completed the biggest single PFI road project, on the A130 from Southend to Chelmsford. That is of no interest at all to Norfolk, Peterborough, Suffolk and Cambridge. The new system will have to provide the capacity to deliver such developments.
<P>

<a name="40224-12_para1"></a>I am sad that the Minister thinks we are trying to handicap such a capacity. We are trying to improve the situation by enabling the new regional system to deliver such developments. We accept that that is going to happen, and we are trying to make it work. Earlier, I quoted the example of Harlow, which, if it is to expand, will have to expand into other districts. That case might involve a UDC because it concerns the M11 corridor. I could cite other parts of Essex, such as Haven Gateway, from where the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, originates, which is one of the most deprived areas in our county. I have a lot of time for that area. We need a strategy for it, but it is not covered by a government initiative.
<P>

<a name="40224-12_para2"></a>If we are going to improve our communities, the new legislation will have to provide the capacity to deliver it. These regions are very big and will not be interested in the matters I have mentioned&#151;projects such as park and ride schemes covering several districts and roads joining one town to another. I am trying to be helpful and to make the system work. I see the whole system failing because a two-tier system&#151;from the top of the region to the district&#151;will not work. There needs to be capacity in the middle to deliver the Government's objectives. I am trying to help them do that in the Thames Gateway, the M11 corridor, and at Stansted airport. I am trying to make the new system work. I think that this provision must be on the face of the Bill. I therefore wish to test the opinion of the House.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee </B>   moved Amendment No. 5:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 16, at end insert "unless the conflict concerns a matter of fact in which case the fact shall prevail"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-12_para5"></a><P>

<a name="40224-12_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 5, grouped with Amendment No. 65, relates to the same point with regard to the regional spatial strategy and the local development document. This new point occurred to me on re-reading the Bill after the last stage. In both relevant clauses there is a provision that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if to any extent a policy set out in the RSS"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-12_para7"></a>
or the local development document&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"conflicts with any other statement or information in the RSS the conflict must be resolved in favour of the policy".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-12_para8"></a>
I have no quarrel with the general proposition. However, if the statement&#151;or "information" to use the word in the subsection&#151;is a matter of fact, then the fact should prevail rather than policy if policy is based on an incorrect fact. That is the thrust of Amendments Nos. 5 and 65. If the conflict concerns a matter of fact, the fact shall prevail. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, having listened to the noble Baroness, I come to the conclusion almost <P>


<a name="column_157"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 157</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that it is an amendment in search of a problem. I am not sure I understand the aims of the noble Baroness. I should be interested to hear some examples. I cannot see how a policy will conflict with a fact as they are two different beasts.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para0"></a>The relevant provisions&#151;Clauses 2(4) and 17(5)&#151;make clear that statements of policy in the regional spatial strategy or local development documents have precedence over background material. We probably all agree with that as a principle. The reference in the Bill is to avoid wrangling about the precedence of different paragraphs.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para1"></a>The amendments seem to imply that policies will be drawn up in complete contradiction to "facts" contained in the regional spatial strategy or the local development document. I cannot see how that would happen. Policies have to be based on evidence. That is one criterion for soundness. A policy divorced from the facts would not survive the examination.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para2"></a>The draft regulations on local and regional planning both draw a distinction between the policy and the reasoned justification for it. This is intended to make clear the policy matters which would provide the framework for development control decisions; and to make sure that the local development document has some explanation of and justification for the policy.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para3"></a>The draft guidance says that the reasoned justification is kept to the minimum necessary to provide the context. In a situation where there was some issue with a fact, it would be given weight as a material consideration. We cannot, of course, fetter the Secretary of State's discretion by saying that this will always be the case but it seems likely that the fact would outweigh the policy. I suggest that it would be irrational for a policy to prevail if it were based upon a proven inaccuracy and would be open, therefore, to challenge.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para4"></a>For those reasons, I do not think that the amendment works or is necessary. Having heard my remarks, I hope that the noble Baroness will reflect further and agree to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-13_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I shall read the Minister's remarks. However, he seems to be saying that the Secretary of State should not be fettered even if he got it wrong. All I seek is to ensure that there is no elephant trap in this part of the Bill. If the Government do not consider the amendment necessary, I shall not pursue the matter. However, I was apparently opaque in my introduction. The "information" which might be in conflict with a policy would be based on fact. It could contain&#151;no one is perfect, not even the people in the ODPM who have written the RPG&#151;something which purports to be true but is not.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para5"></a>In his reply the Minister said that the matter could be sorted out&#151;that is obviously comforting&#151;and that it could be dealt with at an examination in public. However, the long and the short of it is that I am trying to help. I am not trying to undermine what the Government are trying to do here. If they are content that there is no problem, I do not want to push the matter any further. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40224-13_para6"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield </B>   moved Amendment No. 6:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 1, leave out subsections (5) and (6).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-13_para7"></a><P>

<a name="40224-13_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the aim of Amendment No. 6 is to remove the power of the Secretary of State to make the existing regional planning guidance, or parts of it, part of the regional spatial strategy and so part of the development plan without going through the procedures outlined in Part 1 of the Bill. The removal of Clause 2(6) is consequential.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para9"></a>We had an extensive discussion about this issue in Committee and since then some or most of us may have seen the letter from the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, detailing the way in which RPG will be transmogrified into RSS. However, we believe that if the regional planning body is to become responsible for ensuring the regional spatial strategy is issued, implemented, monitored and eventually revised, it must have considerable input in the preparation of the initial RSS. The Bill before us should reflect that principle.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para10"></a>The issue is more than symbolic. At the heart of it, and as the Bill stands, we have the Government saying that in order to prevent a vacuum in regional planning arising in the transitional period, the Secretary of State will convert so much of the regional planning guidance into the regional spatial strategy. We do not wish to underestimate the importance of that argument. It is important for local plans and communities to have a strategic context within which they operate. However, we do not believe that the Government have sufficiently justified the distinction that is drawn in the Bill between the Secretary of State deciding what will be in the initial regional spatial strategy and the rigorous procedures to be followed by the regional planning body when revising the RSS. We believe that the consultation process for RPG is inadequate.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para11"></a>I should like to move on to the related amendments. The Bill contains a procedure for the preparation of revisions to the regional spatial strategy. Clauses 6 to 12 assume that there is a regional spatial strategy and that the responsibility of a regional planning body is to prepare a draft revision. However, a procedure for adopting a regional spatial strategy is also necessary for two reasons&#151;one is practical, the other is one of principle. The practical reason is that the Bill does not put in place a regional spatial strategy by some other means. Under Clause 2(1) there is to be a regional spatial strategy. However, there is merely a power to make regional planning guidance the regional spatial strategy for a region in Clause 2(5). Even if that power remains, it will not necessarily be exercised. Furthermore, the existing regional planning guidance may be inappropriate as a regional spatial strategy. A regional spatial strategy is, after all, different. The Government intend it to be part of the development plan. They intend more weight to be attached to it and they intend local development plan documents to be in general conformity with it. The draft planning policy statement 11 on regional planning says that these documents are intended to be more specific. Therefore, there needs to be a procedure to create a regional spatial strategy from scratch.
<P>


<a name="column_159"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para12"></a>The point of principle is that regions should be involved in preparing the regional spatial strategy. There is a clear procedure for revisions: regional planning bodies prepare draft revisions, a sustainability appraisal takes place, an examination in public can and usually would be held, the Secretary of State has to consider the report of the panel and can make changes to the draft revision, giving reasons if he does so.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para13"></a>If the procedures are necessary for revisions, they will be even more necessary for the preparation of a regional spatial strategy. The absence of proper open, democratic and fair procedures for the preparation of regional spatial strategies cannot be justified by administrative convenience.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para14"></a>Amendment No. 19 assumes that Clause 2(5)&#151;allowing the Secretary of State to prescribe that part of existing regional planning guidance is the regional spatial strategy&#151;remains, but caters for the possibility that it is not exercised. Amendment No. 20 would apply if Clause 2(5) were removed from the Bill. Without these amendments there is a lacuna right at the beginning of the Bill, which represents a serious democratic and procedural deficit.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para15"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 42. This amendment seeks to remove the Secretary of State's power to apply part of regional planning guidance as a revision of the RSS. Surely if regional spatial strategies come into force, regional planning guidance will no longer apply. If that is the case, why does the Bill make provision for such a retrograde power?
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para16"></a>Although, as my previous amendments have shown, we oppose the process, we can follow the logic as regards the provisions in Clause 2 with regard to the adoption of parts of regional planning guidance as the regional spatial strategy for a region.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para17"></a>Clause 10(8) allows for the Secretary of State to provide for a completed process of regional planning guidance that corresponds to one that needs to be done for a regional spatial strategy to have effect as a revision of the RSS. It does not make sense that the two processes are occurring in parallel. Either we have regional planning guidance or we have regional spatial strategies. With this subsection and those that I have just dealt with in Clause 2, we have the situation where the Secretary of State decides what is in the first RSS and also what can be a revision to it. That is a top down, nationalised planning system, as we have said before.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para18"></a>What is the status of the regional planning guidance once the regional spatial strategy is in place? Unless the Government are planning on updating regional planning guidance even after we have regional spatial strategies I should have thought that this would be an unwise and backward looking step.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para19"></a>I am also concerned that this provision allows the Secretary of State to bypass the procedures in place that hold regional planning bodies accountable, including examinations in public. That is particularly worrying. We have said a lot already about the democratic deficit, so I shall not detain the House on this point. However, I wanted to register my concern.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para20"></a>Nevertheless, in Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, reassured noble Lords that subsections (7) and (8) are meant to apply only during the early transition period when RSSs come into force. Could this not be made clear on the face of the Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, helpfully suggested? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-13_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, Amendment No. 21, which is included in the group of amendments that we are discussing, stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Maddock. As we know, regional planning guidance morphs, or, as the noble Lord said, transmogrifies into the regional spatial strategy. However, I am not sure that that is quite accurate as what changes to start with is the title and not the substance.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para21"></a>I go off at a slight tangent to say that the noble Lord referred to a letter from the Minister. I have copies of two or three letters but I do not think that I have one of that particular letter. I may be missing something in terms of explanation from the Government but I shall check with the Minister's office tomorrow that I have everything that has been sent out.
<P>

<a name="40224-13_para22"></a>Under the Bill the duty of the regional planning body is to revise what started life as the Secretary of State's regional planning guidance. Therefore, it seems to me that it will always be at heart the Secretary of State's guidance or strategy. The amendment suggests a way of giving ownership&#151;to use the term again&#151;of the first major piece of work, the regional spatial strategy, to the regional planning body. I have provided that rather than requiring it to undertake a revision, it should replace what it inherits and put in place a regional spatial strategy which, as I say, would be its own. The drafting is a little inelegant. I have words in parenthesis by way of definition simply to avoid a great many amendments that would otherwise be required to other parts of the Bill if I were to be totally consistent. The Minister will gather from that that I do not intend to press the measure today. However, it is a point at least worth putting on the record.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040224/text/40224-14.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I am somewhat surprised to see Amendment No. 6, but it goes to the heart of our purpose. The consequences of this group of amendments would be extremely wasteful. Those people outside the House, working in the field, would be extremely annoyed if the amendments were passed. They are designed to ensure that the first regional spatial strategies are prepared by the regional planning board rather than converted from the regional planning guidance; and to rule out any work on revisions to regional planning guidance being carried forward under the new system. We do not see a case for that change either in principle or practice.
<P>

<a name="40224-14_para0"></a>It is worth repeating that every regional planning guidance that is to become a regional spatial strategy has been prepared in draft by the regional planning body. There has been extensive consultation and examination in public on each. When the Secretary of State has proposed to make changes to the regional <P>


<a name="column_161"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>planning body's draft he has consulted on those changes. That regional planning guidance is eminently qualified to become the first regional spatial strategy. We have made clear that regional planning guidance that has not been through an examination in public will not become a regional spatial strategy&#151;that is RPGs 3 for London, 3a for strategic views in London, 3b and 9b for the River Thames and 9a for the Thames Gateway.
<P>

<a name="40224-14_para1"></a>Scrapping those documents that have already been prepared would not benefit our regions or communities. Perhaps that is part of a plot. It would take at least two years to prepare a regional spatial strategy from scratch. During that interval there would be no regional policies. There would be no framework in which planning could take place, with massive uncertainty and the risk of conflict between one area and the next.
<P>

<a name="40224-14_para2"></a>I fully accept that the first regional spatial strategies will be of differing ages and we expect them all to be revised over the next few years. A duty to prepare revisions, rather than starting with a blank sheet, will not mean that regional planning bodies have less freedom to come up with policies for their regions. I hope I made that clear in my comments on previous amendments. A revision could be radical, taking in every aspect of the strategy, or it could be more limited&#151;for example to reflect a change in national policy on a specific issue.
<P>

<a name="40224-14_para3"></a>As I said in Committee, in every region outside London work is continuing to revise all or part of the RPG. In some regions such as the south-west that work is at an early stage. In others, the revision is nearly complete. For example in the west Midlands, the Secretary of State's proposed changes to the draft revision of the RPG have been published. The final document is due to be published in the summer.
<P>

<a name="40224-14_para4"></a>Amendment No. 42 would mean that all the time and resources put in by the regional planning bodies, those who had participated in consultation and the examination in public would all have been wasted. That is what would happen if the amendments were accepted. I thought that in Committee&#151;and we are talking about a transitional process&#151;this was accepted as a way forward. It probably took a while for the penny to drop, as I was questioned by colleagues in the House, but I though that that was our plan; namely, to move from one system to another by converting the existing guidance into the regional spatial strategies.
<P>

<a name="40224-14_para5"></a>There has been concern that people might not recognise that the mechanism can be used only for the transition&#151;this is the beginning and is a one-off. The point is that the Bill is structured so that, from commencement, the regional planning body and the Secretary of State will have duties relating to the regional spatial strategy. In effect, the Bill abolishes regional planning guidance&#151;a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and I hope that it answers one of his questions.
<P>

<a name="40224-14_para6"></a>It follows that it is the steps in relation to the preparation of regional planning guidance that have been taken before the commencement that could be <P>


<a name="column_162"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>treated as steps in connection with preparing regional spatial strategy. We fully expect the Secretary of State to use the power to prescribe that most regional planning guidance will become regional spatial strategy. The Bill effects that from commencement of the part which establishes regional spatial strategies. Once the regional planning guidance no longer exists there will be no further opportunity for work to be done on it and, therefore, no opportunity for it to count as a step in the preparation and publication of the revision of the regional spatial strategy.
<P>

<a name="40224-14_para7"></a>I sincerely hope that that was a practical and reasonable explanation of the consequences of the amendments and why we would be mortified if they were put into the Bill. Imagine the waste of effort&#151;I would not like to be the Minister or the Shadow Minister who had to go around the country explaining why people had just wasted a couple of years of their time. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, would follow the footsteps of his new party leader who was in the west Midlands the other day&#151;a key area for the next general election. He just wants to tear up everything that they have proposed, just at the end of the process into which they have put all their work and effort. All the people who contributed in public evidence are virtually being told, "Well, nothing you did or said has counted". That would leave the region without any regional strategy for two years, because the process would have to start all over again. That cannot be a practical proposition and I do not believe that noble Lords will push the matter; indeed, the noble Baroness said that she would not do so in any event.
<P>

<a name="40224-14_para8"></a>I shall repeat my earlier comments that, while the grouping is not for the Government, Amendments Nos. 19, 20 and Amendment No. 21, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, are not consequential on Amendment No. 6. I hope that all the amendments will be withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-14_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, I had not understood that the amendments needed to be consequential to be grouped. As he said, mine was not consequential. Could the Minister clarify his comments? At the beginning of his reply he talked about the work on the regional planning guidance having been done in conjunction with the regional planning bodies. As they do not yet exist, will he confirm that he means the regional chambers, which are now in most cases called regional assemblies? We need to know precisely what he is referring to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, no&#151;I hope I am right. As far as I know, the chambers are the regional planning bodies. The conversion was such that the chambers now carry out the function of regional planning bodies. They will have had a role in the work that has been taking place to date. I accept that those who have existed for a long time&#151;a couple of years&#151;may have pre-dated part of <P>


<a name="column_163"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that, but the bodies have been involved ever since. As I understand it, the regional chambers or assemblies became the regional planning bodies in April last year.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that answer. We do not wish to create a vacuum. We are concerned about the regional planning guidance being merely transferred into the regional spatial strategy. While there have been examinations in public and much work has been done in some areas&#151;and I accept the point about the west Midlands being further ahead than other areas&#151;we are still concerned that there is not the same rigid scrutiny in developing the first RSS, which will then be revised. That is our point. The Government are changing the regional planning guidance into the regional spatial strategy, which only then can be revised. We would have liked more input, scrutiny and work done on the original RSS.
<P>

<a name="40224-14_para9"></a>Noone wishes to create vacuums. However, this is an area that will need continued examination before the passage of the Bill is completed, to make certain that in the first RSSs there is sufficient scrutiny and involvement in their creation. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment today.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-14_para12"></a><P>

<a name="40224-14_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment would remove the duty on regional planning bodies to prepare an annual report for the Secretary of State on the implementation of the regional spatial strategy. In an earlier reply, the Minister talked about bureaucracy, paper and many other things, and that is the point of this amendment.
<P>

<a name="40224-14_para14"></a>We do not believe that the amendment would somehow sabotage the important process of reviewing and monitoring the implementation of the regional spatial strategy. We accept that a regional planning body should be monitoring and that it should, if necessary, be in a position to report on how a regional spatial strategy is being implemented. Subsections (2) and (3) of this clause more than satisfactorily make provision for that.
<P>

<a name="40224-14_para15"></a>As the Bill stands, Part 1 applies only where elected regional assemblies are established. I recall that, in the context of another debate, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said that in such a scenario the RSS would not set out the Secretary of State's policies but the policies of the region. That has been repeated today. Presumably the same logic applies to any reporting structure. Therefore, RPBs should, in effect, report to their constituents rather than to the Secretary of State.

<a name="40224-14_para17"></a>Reporting requirements may seem to be a fairly standard item in new legislation but very often the importance attached to them distorts priorities and undermines their achievement.

<P>

<a name="40224-14_para18"></a>As I have already mentioned, subsections (2) and (3) more than sufficiently cater for the statutory duties of a regional planning body. Furthermore, the regional planning body should have the autonomy to decide when and how it reports to central government. The Secretary of State has so many reserve powers that I am sure that would not inconvenience him too much. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40224-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I think I have a good answer to this one. The requirements in the Bill and the regulations do not pose a new burden and therefore everything that we have just heard does not apply. Every regional planning body has submitted an annual monitoring report or statement for 2002&#150;03, either in draft or final form, covering almost the same ground as they would be required to cover in future under the Bill and the draft regulations.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para0"></a>Therefore, the requirements in the Bill and the regulations are not a new burden. We are enshrining good practice&#151;for example, by specifying that the regional planning body must report on problems and possible solutions as well as providing data. The better annual monitoring reports&#151;I do not want to single out any boards&#151;already do that. In addition, we want a common timetable so that timescales can be properly compared. The regions themselves, as well as other people with an interest in this matter, would want that. I repeat: this is not a new burden; we are trying to enshrine good practice in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I accept what the Minister says, although I should have liked him to deal with the point that I raised concerning the duty being one of informing the constituents of a region rather than the Secretary of State about what the regional planning body was doing. As the Minister said, there is no new burden, but I should still have liked the line of communication to be downwards to the people of a region rather than always being upwards to the Secretary of State. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40224-15_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of the amendment is to moderate the Bill's language. As it stands, this subsection places a duty on regional planning bodies to give advice to other bodies if they believe that will aid the fulfilment of the regional spatial strategy.

<P>

<a name="40224-15_para4"></a>In Committee, we touched upon this matter briefly and the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said that he was happy at all times to look at the language of our legislation. Therefore, we return to this subsection now because the language matters. By definition, the word "must" is prescriptive and we should like the Government to be less prescriptive regarding what the regional planning body does. On the other hand, the word "may" gives the regional planning body choices.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para5"></a>The word "must" seems to put the onus on the regional planning body to second-guess who would want or need advice. That would lead to the planning body constantly having to identify any new organisations to which to give advice. That would add considerably to their workload as there would also have to be some kind of protocol or process to determine what type of advice should be given to what kind of organisation. Should the advice be unsolicited? Do they have any powers of enforcement if the advice is not taken up?
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para6"></a>Therefore, we suggest that it would be more desirable to permit regional planning bodies to tender advice. That would enable a far better working relationship between all the parties involved. The word "may" fits much better with the rest of the wording and with the substantive context. As a symbol of trying to inject some discretion and autonomy into the Bill, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-15_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, I wish to speak to Amendment No. 18, which is grouped with Amendment No. 8. The purpose of Amendment No. 18 is to ensure that all district councils are consulted and informed about the activities of the regional planning body. The provision of housing will be a very important element of the regional spatial strategy. The district authorities are the housing authorities, and the directly elected district councillors will draw up local housing strategies.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para7"></a>Given the importance which I believe we all attach to the provision of more affordable housing&#151;I know that the Government are putting much energy into that&#151;it seems to me absolutely vital that we do not lose this link in the new planning arrangements. I hope that, even if the Minister does not consider this to be the appropriate way in which to put the provision into the Bill, he will accept that it is very important, particularly in relation to housing. This is the one thing which I believe slips through the net in the Government's arrangements here, and I hope that the Minister will understand the point that I am trying to make in my amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the Bill and the associated regulations and guidance try to strike a balance between requiring the regional planning body to involve and consult others where that would add value while avoiding the construction of an empty consultation apparatus that benefits no one. Our view is that the two amendments fall either side of that line.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para8"></a>I believe that I can dispose of Amendment No. 8 by saying that we consider the concern about the word currently in the Bill to be unfounded. The regional <P>


<a name="column_166"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 166</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>planning bodies have not said that it will create any difficulties for them. I should have thought that, that being the case, together with the fact that they are operating out there now, it would be better to leave the matter alone.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para9"></a>Amendment No. 18 would require the regional planning body to keep informed and consult all district councils in two-tier areas in its region. We do not consider that to be sensible. It runs the risk of creating additional bureaucracy, which achieves very little beyond what the existing arrangements provide for. Indeed, it is a more onerous requirement than that placed on county councils at present.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para10"></a>Through their membership of the regional planning body, many district council representatives will be taking part in the key decisions that are made as the draft regional spatial strategy emerges. The draft regulations in Part 1 of the Bill already make district councils statutory consultees both before and after the draft revision of the regional spatial strategy is published. Therefore, the regional planning bodies will be able to enter into arrangements with district councils under Clause 5(4) of the Bill to undertake work on their behalf.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para11"></a>The district councils will, through their service delivery responsibilities, be key players in implementing the policies in the regional spatial strategy, particularly, as the noble Baroness said, in relation to housing. The regional planning body will be very wise and will need to maintain a dialogue with district councils if that is to be achieved. That is why we believe that both amendments fall either side of the line that I drew at the beginning and, therefore, I hope that noble Lords will not proceed with them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I thought that the Minister might be able to give a little on this amendment but obviously he cannot do so. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40224-15_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment builds on the amendment moved by the Government in Committee, which provides a role for county and unitary authorities. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said earlier today that, although those amendments were welcome, they only go so far. They provide for the regional planning body to seek the advice of county and unitary authorities in its region. The term "seek advice" differs from "consult". "Consult" has an element of listening to advice, even if it will be disregarded and discarded. One of the characteristics it should have is feedback to the points that have been made during the <P>


<a name="column_167"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 167</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consultation. So thinking about how the seeking of advice would work, I want to be absolutely certain that the regional planning body would do something with the advice. My amendment proposes that the RPB publishes its response to that advice and, where it does not accept the advice, it does not go ahead until there has been a period&#151;four months may or may not be the right period&#151;so that the regional planning body and the authority in question can discuss the matter on which the regional planning body does not take the advice of the county or the unitary authority. I hope that that is clear. It is intended to add a very important step to the process, to add flesh to the amendment that the Government proposed and your Lordships accepted in Committee. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-15_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, we support this amendment. We discussed the relevant government amendments in Committee. I shall repeat that they were welcome, but they did not go as far as the LGA would have liked initially. It should, of course, have commented before but the LGA and the County Councils Network forgot the processes that the House of Lords goes through before a Bill is completed. They did not realise that there is a second democratic process and that it would all be debated further. They are aware of that now.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para17"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, adds some transparency to the amendment that the Government tabled in Committee. I hope that, in a spirit of taking matters forward, the Government will be able to accept this. It makes some sense with their initial amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-15_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I understand the thinking and the spirit behind this amendment. However, I have come to the conclusion that it is overly prescriptive. I feel that if the noble Lord and the noble Baroness were looking at this just from a local government point of view, they would probably think that this is not user-friendly but an onerous, unwieldy and bureaucratic burden.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para18"></a>The amendment creates a requirement on the regional planning body to publish its response to all the advice it receives from those bodies with a statutory advice-giving function under Clause 5. If it does not accept any of that advice in full then it must not proceed until after four months have elapsed. During this period the regional planning body and the authority must discuss the matter.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para19"></a>An amendment of this kind has serious practical consequences. In our view, it would drain time and resources and would not add to an effective planning system at regional level. The regional planning body will receive and consider vast volumes of advice from county councils, metropolitan district councils, unitary authorities, national park authorities and so on as it prepares draft revisions of the regional spatial strategy, keeps it under review and monitors its implementation.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para20"></a>Not all those pieces of advice will be consistent with each another. What one county council thinks should happen in respect, say, of a hierarchy of town centres for <P>


<a name="column_168"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 168</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>retail development may be at odds with what the neighbouring county council thinks should happen. Two districts with retail centres that are in need of freshening up might enter into a friendly dispute through the regional planning process. I can think of several cases in my experience where exactly that might happen. No doubt the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, with his vast experience at county council level in Essex would think it very strange if he agreed with his colleagues in Suffolk or Norfolk. The viewpoints may be valid, but they are going to provide conflicting advice. The role of the regional planning body is to weigh up the differing advice it receives and to make a balanced judgment based on all of it.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para21"></a>It cannot be sensible for the regional planning body to publish a response to every single piece of advice that it receives. It would be hugely resource-intensive. Advice will often be better considered in the round rather than on a case-by-case basis. If the regional planning body has to hold up the revision of the regional spatial strategy for four months each time that it does not accept in full a piece of advice that it receives, it could take for ever to get agreement or to get to the stage of an examination in public. I do not think that that is in keeping with the aspiration, which I think that we have all shared during the course of the Bill, of ensuring that plans are up to date.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para22"></a>The regional planning body is in the lead in preparing the draft revision of the regional spatial strategy. It must make judgments between competing viewpoints and not try to accommodate every piece of advice that it receives. The regional planning body will be answerable for the content of the draft regional spatial strategy at the examination in public.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para23"></a>When the regional planning body submits the draft revision of the regional spatial strategy to the Secretary of State, it must also submit a statement setting out who it has consulted, how it has consulted them, the main issues raised and how these have been addressed in the draft revision. The decisions that the regional planning body has made, based on the advice that it has received, will be open to scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para24"></a>The regional planning body cannot simply ignore the advice that it receives. Both the regional planning body receiving the advice and the authorities providing that advice are under an overriding duty to act reasonably. If the regional planning body fails to take proper account of the advice given to it by county councils and other councils&#151;district, parish or town&#151;or national parks and so on, it could ultimately be subject to a legal challenge for failing to act reasonably in the circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40224-15_para25"></a>We argue that the accountability and transparency is there. We do not think that this is a helpful additional extra burden. We think that it will slow the process down. The purpose of this legislation, in part, is to ensure that we have a planning system that is transparent, fair, effective and efficient in its operation. We do not think that this amendment guides us in that general direction. I hope that, having heard that and in view of the <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-16_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, this is one of those occasions when the Minister has really convinced me of the rightness of my argument.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para0"></a>I am not sure that I have managed to get everything down. He said that the amendment is overly prescriptive and a burden; I could have been much more prescriptive. He said that it would be a drain on time and resources; I shall discuss resources later. He said that it would be a drain on time; is four months so much time in the context of work that is setting the strategy for a region, on which the local development documents will be based and which will affect major planning decisions for the region? It seems to me that four months is not a great deal of time and is certainly not in the disaster area, which seemed to be suggested.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para1"></a>The regional planning body will receive a lot of advice from the authorities, which will be inconsistent. Surely that supports and, indeed, makes much stronger the case for responding publicly. There is much less need to explain in a transparent fashion why you are not following advice if the advice is consistent, unless you are ignoring all of it. The role of the regional planning bodies is to weigh up and make a balanced judgment, but they should do so in a public fashion. The Minister said that they cannot ignore the advice.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para2"></a>I appreciate that this is Report stage, so perhaps this needs to be pursued afterwards, but as he spoke it occurred to me to ask how the public and the county and unitary authorities will know how the advice has been considered and weighed against other advice. Will that be by public document, which will go to the regional planning body and is subject to the current local government access to information arrangements? I realise that that is something which perhaps I should know. Given the new freedom of information provisions which will shortly come into force, it may be that the situation will change in any event. All of this needs to be public. It is a matter of public interest.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para3"></a>The regional planning body will be answerable at the examination in public. It seems to me that what I suggest would help rather than hinder the EIP. I thought that the Minister was going to say that the regional planning body would be answerable to the Secretary of State.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I think that the noble Baroness may be missing the point I made. The regional planning body has to submit its statement to the Secretary of State. It will be clear from that with whom it has consulted and how it has consulted, and the documents will be open to scrutiny. I do not see that that will be a closed process. I am not sure what it is that the noble Baroness seeks that is not already there.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-16_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, it may be open to scrutiny and examination when it is too late to do <P>


<a name="column_170"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>anything about it, although that did not seem to be the thrust of what the Minister said when he referred to the examination in public.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para4"></a>Finally, the Minister is concerned that if there were tiny differences, every piece of advice would need to be set out in full. It is quite normal and usually adequate, provided that the job is done fairly thoroughly and conscientiously, for reports in response to consultations to state, "On such and such an issue there have been concerns about the following, which fall into the following categories" and to set out the competing arguments. I do not think that what I suggest goes quite as far as the Minister's response seemed to assume.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para5"></a>This is an important point and clearly there is a difference between us. For that reason, and because of the access to information point which occurred to me as we were debating this, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage, but it is something to which we may want to return.

<P>

<a name="40224-16_para9"></a>The amendment takes us back to a point which I raised in Committee, which is to be certain that in giving advice under the Government's new provisions in Clause 5 the authority has the power to do so. The Minister stated:

<a name="40224-16_para10"></a>
I have only just noticed that attached to the notes I had on the last occasion are some unfamiliar pages with a sticker attached stating, "Brief, Lord Rooker". I do not think they cover this point. I doubt that there is anything there that did not appear in Hansard.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para11"></a>I am pushing the point in the hope that we can get a rather fuller response than, "It's okay, don't bother". The counties and unitaries are required to give the regional planning body advice as to the exercise of the regional planning body's function to the extent that the exercise of its function is capable of affecting the exercise by the authority, county or unitary, of any function that it has; in other words, the exercise of the authority's function.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para12"></a>I asked in Committee what were the functions in question and whether, indeed, they could be spelt out in a fuller way so that there is no doubt that the counties and unitaries have the power to give advice, which is distinct from the duty under the Bill. I apologise for being rather technical on this point but I said before that we are concerned that there should not <P>


<a name="column_171"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>be elephant traps here. It would be very helpful to have something fuller than the single sentence that we heard last time round. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness. I shall try to give a fuller explanation and perhaps that will comfort her more.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para13"></a>The amendment would provide a power for county councils to give advice on matters not caught by Clause 5(2) but which relate to the county council's area. The noble Baroness said in Committee that she was concerned about the reference to the functions of county councils in Clause 5(2) or the functions of other authorities in Clause 5(3), and that the worry was that some might see this provision as restricting the advice the authorities could give.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para14"></a>I shall try again to reassure her. The trigger for the county council or any other authority to have to give advice is that one of its functions is directly or indirectly affected. I think that that is a fairly wide definition. Off the top of my head I cannot think of an example where the authority would have no duty to give advice on a matter that affected its area.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para15"></a>It is important that we refer to the functions of the authority not its area because the latter would be too restrictive. The exercise of an authority's functions may be affected by proposals in an emerging regional spatial strategy relating to areas beyond the authority boundary. For example, the provision of new housing on one side of the boundary would in all likelihood have implications for schools and transport on the other. We do not want the asking for and the giving of advice to be restricted by narrow geographical provisions in those sorts of circumstances. So, if that example gives a flavour of how we see this issue, I hope that it is helpful.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para16"></a>Clause 5(2) is a broad provision. Having explained how we see it working, I hope that the noble Baroness will see that there is no need for Amendment No. 11A. We are trying to be helpful; we see the point she makes; and we think that our definition is broad enough to capture the issues and concerns to which she alluded.

<a name="40224-16_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to speak to Amendment No. 12 standing in my name. I feel that I owe the House an apology for the rather tortuous course I have pursued on this matter and should give an explanation on what I have been trying to do.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para20"></a>As I may have to make some rather severe remarks towards the end of my intervention, I should perhaps explain where I come from in the form of a declaration of interests. I live in the Suffolk Coast & Heaths AONB. On retiring from public service in 1987, I had the good fortune to be made a member of the regional committee of the National Trust for East Anglia, where I spent nine fascinating years. I am now a vice-president of the Council for National Parks. My main activity, and that of my wife, is to be the Suffolk branch of the CPRE, of which she is a vice-president and the planning member for the county. I operate in a very auxiliary role in that connection.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para21"></a>When I tabled an amendment in Committee, I was principally concerned with the difficulty of getting the conservation boards in the AONBs to act in a coherent way. When these boards were first set up under the CROW Act, it was difficult for the county councils to find the time and money for the meetings and the places to hold them. If that was difficult for us, it was much more difficult for other AONBs where the number of local authorities represented on their conservation boards was numerous. I recently counted these. I found that in three areas of outstanding natural beauty there were no fewer than 12 local authorities. As a matter of interest, they were the Kentish towns, the High Weald and the Cotswolds. That was the purpose of my amendment. I have since discovered that things are working much better.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para22"></a>However, my amendment was not well expressed; my speech was clearly not well understood; and I noticed when the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, rose to reply, that the text from which he was reading assumed I was aiming at something much wider; namely, for the magnification of the local planning authority's role in this new planning system. That was not my intention.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para23"></a>So I drafted a different amendment, which I thought I had tabled by fax to the Public Bill Office on Saturday. It restated the principles on which the legal status of protected landscapes operate; that is, in a national park, the national park authority is responsible and in the AONBs it is the conservation board's duty to advise the new regional authorities being set up how that should operate.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para24"></a>By some strange method in the transmission a gremlin got into my fax. The result is the amendment on the Marshalled List, which is not particularly relevant to my purpose. My aim is that the protected status of these areas of special landscape interest should be preserved. There have been some rather disquieting developments, to which I shall refer.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para25"></a>I begin with a general word of caution. The Bill will make far-reaching changes to the planning system, extending into the distant future. The novelty is the new regional planning authority and the huge responsibilities that it will have. Sometimes, the authority may be inclined to give priority to other <P>


<a name="column_173"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 173</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>aspects of policy, such as employment or the growth of tourism, and the protection of landscape may seem of lesser importance.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para26"></a>We have recently had an experience in west Wales which has heightened my concerns. It was intended to build a large tourism centre extending from rural Pembrokeshire into the Pembrokeshire National Park. The matter came before the National Park Authority for it to reach a decision. It decided that it could not approve this permission. It had hoped its decision was final, but this turns out to be a matter of devolved responsibility in Wales. So it was taken to Cardiff and Cardiff voted it through. I am concerned that this problem might be replicated elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para27"></a>My concerns are heightened on reading an official press release from Defra issued in the name of Mr Alun Michael, the Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The headline is, "'Conservation Is Not Enough'&#151;Minister Sets Out Living Community's Challenge For National Parks". It gives a full text of what the Minister said, including that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"conservation of itself is not enough; we want a living countryside",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-16_para28"></a>
and so on.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para29"></a>It occurred to me that it would be right to look up the text of the existing legislation both for the national parks and for the AONBs. I shall confine myself to the national park test, which is to be found in the Environment Act 1995. Section 62(1) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In exercising or performing any functions in relation to, or so as to affect, land in a National Park, any relevant authority shall have regard to the purposes specified in . . .  this Act and, if it appears"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-16_para30"></a>
this is important&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that there is a conflict between those purposes, shall attach greater weight to the purpose of conserving and enhancing the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the area comprised in the National Park".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-16_para31"></a>
The next paragraph reads:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For the purposes of this section . . . 'authority' means&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-16_para32"></a> (a) any Minister of the Crown,
 (b) any public body,
 (c) any statutory undertaker, or
 (d) any person holding public office".
So, it would seem that the Minister, Mr Michael, has transgressed as regards the terms of the Act in our statute book.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para33"></a>I suggest to your Lordships that there is a fundamental problem; namely, how should these specially protected landscapes function in this new scheme? If the Government wish to change the protection that they now enjoy, the sensible thing would be for them to introduce an amendment to the Act which I have just quoted rather than to issue policy planning guidance that appears to transgress it at the edges.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para34"></a>I regret having to make that criticism of the Government because both noble Lords, Lord Rooker and Lord Bassam, have been extremely kind and helpful to me. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, wrote a very nice letter on the remarks I made at the last stage. <P>


<a name="column_174"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 174</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, I feel that the issue is of some seriousness and that we should address it head-on. I do not intend to call a Division today as I think that further reflection is required and other noble Lords might be interested in taking part in the debate. But this is a significant matter which we should not overlook.
<P>

<a name="40224-16_para35"></a>Of course, as a former civil servant, it would be possible for me to go so far as to advise the noble Lord how he might reply to this intervention. I think that the first thing a civil servant would say is, "Well, you have raised an entirely hypothetical question. Get lost. It's not real". The example I have quoted suggests to me that this is not a hypothetical question. We have an example and we should make up our minds about the matter. We need to consider the issue further and I shall be very interested to hear what other noble Lords and the Minister have to say. I beg to move.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I will see whether I can get further and better particulars to answer for Defra because I am not fully up to speed on that, although I take the spirit in which the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, has spoken to his amendment. I shall start by giving him the modern-day Civil Service version in reply to his amendment, which I suspect is probably no different to his day.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para0"></a>The amendment would add area of outstanding natural beauty conservation boards to the list of authorities in Clause 5(3) of the Bill with a statutory advice-giving role on the review, monitoring and preparation.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para1"></a>The authorities in Clause 5(3) are singled out to advise the regional planning body because they have expertise of strategic planning and, in the case of county councils and unitary authorities, they are responsible for delivering major services. The area of outstanding natural beauty conservation boards would have neither that experience nor the responsibilities, so it would not make sense to add them to the list.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para2"></a>I emphasise again&#151;I hope I did in Committee&#151;that the Government attach great importance to ensuring that areas of outstanding natural beauty are protected through the planning system. We also expect area of outstanding natural beauty management bodies to play an important role in the new planning arrangements; for example, as partners in developing a sub-regional strategy for their areas, where that is appropriate. I take on board what the noble Lord has said because in Committee he expressed concern about insufficient collaborative working. Since then he has obviously taken further advice and he has referred to the detailed letter from my noble friend Lord Bassam covering that issue.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para3"></a>The area of outstanding natural beauty management bodies are, of course, principally comprised of local authority representatives. One must remember that. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 provides that where area of outstanding natural beauty conservation boards are established, at least 40 per cent of the members must be drawn from local authorities and at least 20 per cent from parish councils. In the Cotswolds and the Chilterns, where conservation boards are currently being established, it is proposed that local <P>


<a name="column_175"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 175</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authority representation, as I believe the noble Lord implied, will be substantially higher than 40 per cent. Local authorities are and will continue to be at the heart of the management of areas of outstanding natural beauty.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para4"></a>The fact that local authorities are so strongly represented seems to me to be the best safeguard that they will take the work of areas of outstanding natural beauty seriously. If, as has been suggested, that is not always the case, we cannot really provide in planning legislation for a change of attitude.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para5"></a>It appears that further and better particulars have not arrived. I shall reply to the noble Lord by letter on the points that he has raised. I shall do that as quickly as possible, in case he wants to take advice on this important issue and return to it at Third Reading.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bridges: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, and I look forward to receiving his letter. I shall then consider what further action to take. It occurs to me that I might provide him with a rather more graphical explanation of the problem that I foresee. Let us suppose that the north-eastern regional authority decides that it needs to promote tourism to encourage employment and income in the region. It may consider that it would be excellent to have a large tourist centre adjacent to Hadrian's Wall in the Northumberland National Park. I believe that that kind of activity would be wrong, given the terms of existing legislation which protects the national parks. When the Minister replies to me, he may have that example in the back of his mind&#151;an example of the kind of thing, that with the best intentions in the world, might go wrong.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para6"></a>Landscape protection is terribly important in our country. When I returned from serving abroad it was always such a delight to visit an area of outstanding natural beauty to see how unchanged it was. They are some of the great treasures of our country and we should not destroy them for rather menial, current activities without very good reason. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield </B>   moved Amendment No. 13:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 3, line 1, leave out "may" and insert "shall"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-17_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40224-17_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this group of amendments ties in with a strengthened role for strategic planning authorities. As I have delayed the House for some time on this matter already today, I shall endeavour to be brief. I shall speak first to Amendments Nos. 13 and 14. They strengthen the statutory duty of county councils, metropolitan, unitary and national park authorities beyond the government amendments to Clause 5. We have talked about those several times today. They actively assist in the regional planning functions of the RPBs. We want to go further than giving those authorities a statutory advisory role. The authorities will have to carry out the <P>


<a name="column_176"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 176</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>functions for their areas on behalf of the regional planning bodies. Only that will be sufficient to ensure an effective planning system.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para10"></a>Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 are very straightforward. The first deals with ensuring that where authorities have undertaken functions of regional planning bodies and have incurred expenditure in doing so, they will be reimbursed. We discussed that in Committee and did not receive a very satisfactory answer. The power must be statutory. It is only best practice to make it legally watertight. The Minister said that the authority could tell a regional planning body to go away and return with a better offer if the cost of work was not adequately reimbursed. I believe that that would be too casual. It sends out an unwelcome message that when it comes to paying local authorities for the work that they do on behalf of regional planning bodies, such payment is optional or voluntary.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para11"></a>Presumably, in the funding arrangements for regional planning bodies, they will receive funding to carry out their functions. It is clear that, where those functions are performed by another authority on their behalf, the funding should be transferred to the relevant authority. Any other approach would be unsustainable. We would like to see the Bill as clear as possible on the principle of payment.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para12"></a>Amendment No. 16 deletes subsection (6) of Clause 5 and would remove the prohibition on a regional planning body arranging for an authority to carry out the functions in Clause 6(6) on its behalf. Those functions are publishing a draft provision to the regional spatial strategy, preparing the report of the sustainability appraisal of the proposals in the draft provision, publishing any further documents related to the draft revision required by regulations under Clause 6(5)(b) and submitting those documents to the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para13"></a>The aim of the amendment is to permit more flexibility in the system. It may be necessary for a regional planning body to delegate all or parts of those functions to local authorities in order to match up the right expertise to the right work. That would simply be pragmatic. It may become a helpful support mechanism in the transition period if regional planning bodies have that option available to them.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para14"></a>It would still be the regional planning bodies' choice whether it wanted to delegate any part of those functions to other authorities. The RPB would still have ownership. To leave them with no choice demonstrates once again central government interference that actually stifles devolution. I would have thought that all assistance between authorities and regional planning bodies should be encouraged. If we are to have a regional planning system, perhaps regional planning bodies will need as much help as possible. We on this side of the House feel very strongly about pushing the Government a little further on provisions for strategic planning authorities in the new planning system. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-17_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, our amendment to delete "may" and insert "shall" is Amendment No. 15. <P>


<a name="column_177"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>That concerns the reimbursement provision mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. As he has reminded the House, the Minister said that if the regional planning bodies' proposals were inadequate to cover the cost, the local authority could tell them to go away and return with a better offer. Perhaps the Minister could tell the House on what basis a local authority could say that. It probably would not say it in quite those terms; there are more formal ways of putting such matters. What legal basis would a local authority have for saying that? After all, authorities have a duty under earlier parts of this clause and I am sure they would not want to avoid exercising that duty. Here we are simply talking about "fair's fair" and if that is so, the balance of legal weight needs to be similar on both sides.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the amendments are somewhat familiar, as noble Lords have said. They deal with the basis on which the regional planning bodies make the arrangements with local authorities for those authorities to exercise the regional planning bodies' functions. The Bill provides a clear statutory role for authorities with strategic planning expertise in advising regional planning bodies. These amendments cannot then be needed to give counties and others a statutory role in strategic planning.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para15"></a>We have been clear that if the sort of partnership arrangements that we want to see are to work well, they must be entered into voluntarily. Unwilling partners will not be well placed to carry out effective regional planning. The regional planning body has an important job to do for its region. This is likely to be best done by arranging for others to carry out some functions on its behalf.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para16"></a>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 would leave the regional planning body unable to carry out its responsibilities and would most likely be fatal to strategic planning at the regional level. The local authority is not obliged to enter into arrangements with the regional planning body. These are voluntary&#151;they can refuse. One assumes that the financial arrangements must be part and parcel of the agreement.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para17"></a>We heard that a power not a duty to pay sent out an unwelcome message, but this is to overlook the interests in the real world of both the regional planning bodies and the local authorities. If it is not in the local authority's financial interests to enter into an arrangement unless the regional planning body provides some funds, it will say so, and it will not enter into the arrangement. There will be no payment where this is what the regional planning body and the authority agree to as part of agreeing the arrangements. These are adults; they are professionals. They ought to be able to come to voluntary arrangements that include the necessary reimbursement where required.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para18"></a>We heard that the regional planning body should be able to arrange for an authority to publish a draft revision and submit it to the Secretary of State to give more flexibility, as Amendment No. 16 would provide. Our position on this is clear, and I will repeat it. Prohibition on a regional planning body for arranging <P>


<a name="column_178"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 178</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for an authority to carry out the functions in Clause 5(6) on its behalf is vital to guarantee true regional ownership of this key regional strategy.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para19"></a>I have made this point since Second Reading. To get clarity of ownership we must reserve certain key functions for the regional planning body. The regional planning body must take final responsibility for the draft revisions to the regional spatial strategy, the report of the sustainability appraisal and any other documents required by regulations. That is the reason that this amendment is not acceptable. It goes to the heart of what we are trying to do here, and undermines it. I do not say that in a pejorative sense, but that would be its effect.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para20"></a>On Amendment No. 17, I will repeat what I said in Committee. The words, "must be taken to be", rather than, "shall be"&#151;that is the arrangements under Section 101 of the Local Government Act 1972&#151;are used because a regional planning body is not a local authority. They were used for that reason alone. The wording in Amendment No. 17 would be right only for arrangements between local authorities, and because the regional planning body is not in law a local authority, that would not be the case.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para21"></a>We find Amendment No. 26 difficult to understand, but we assume that the intention is to refer to subsection 5(3) not subsection 4(2). I made this point on an earlier amendment, where there was clearly a carry-over from Committee stage in the drafting of colleagues' notes. If this is the case, the amendment would place a duty on county councils, unitary authorities, metropolitan district councils and national park authorities to assist the regional planning body in preparing a draft revision of the regional spatial strategy. We are a bit surprised to see the amendment re-appear.
<P>

<a name="40224-17_para22"></a>In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said that the purpose of the amendment was to provide county councils and unitary authorities with a statutory role in the preparation and revision of regional spatial strategies. Clause 5 now does that. That was part of the government arrangements and negotiations with the Local Government Association and the County Councils Network, which clearly have not gone far enough, as indicated in our debate earlier this afternoon. I have no doubt that we will hear more about that in due course. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendments.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-18_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, in his comments on Amendment No. 15, the Minister referred to the reimbursement subsection (5) in terms of the arrangements that are the subject of subsection (4), immediately above it. There is a difference between us because since subsection (5) was drafted we have added subsections (1) and (2) to the clause. When I was talking about the legal basis on which an authority could say, "Get lost until you make me a reasonable offer", I was referring to that part of the clause. The Minister may have been referring only to what was there originally when this part of the Bill was drafted. <P>


<a name="column_179"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 179</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It is worth making that point now, because it may at least be worth considering whether it needs to be tweaked.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I will take further advice on that, and if need be I will write to the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, we have been over some of this ground before, but I want to go back to it again. We have now changed the Bill considerably since its original inception, and we hope that it will stay somewhat changed when it becomes ultimate planning policy. No one is disputing the ownership of the RSS. The policies will belong to the regional planning board. We need total clarity about payment as we complete the stages of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40224-18_para0"></a>Obviously, the regional planning body will need other bodies to help it in its work. The Minister has accepted that. It will need other local authorities in the region&#151;the regions are all very big&#151;unless it is going to have vast empires of staff. There are not enough planners in the country to do that. Therefore, there will need to be collaborative systems of drawing up the regional planning strategies. There will need to be clarity about payment, not just taking the best offer that comes along, which was rather jokingly talked about in the early stages. We will listen, and we will read what the Minister says. Perhaps he would like to clarify the situation before Third Reading. We will read what has been said in Hansard. No doubt we will come back to these issues at the Bill's next stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40224-18_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 24. Grouped with the amendment are Amendments Nos. 23 and 25, which stand in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield.
<P>

<a name="40224-18_para7"></a>Amendment No. 22 requires the regional planning body to get on with revising the RSS to make it its own, not more than three years after the commencement of Part 1. Amendment No. 23, which we also debated in Committee, proposes a five-year period. I am not sure whether that means every five years, although that seems to be the basis on which the Minister responded to the amendment the last time around. I am not clear that that is what is intended.
<P>

<a name="40224-18_para8"></a>This is another way of seeking to tackle the issue of who owns the regional spatial strategy and to move smartly towards it being the work of the regional planning body. However, I take the point made earlier this afternoon that the regional planning guidance was by no means divorced from the regional planning <P>


<a name="column_180"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bodies, as they exist at the moment. As I understand it, despite what the Minister said, they are not "Regional Planning Bodies" under the terms of the Bill; they are regional assemblies that have had that job given to them. They are not regional planning bodies as designated by the Bill; the Bill has not been enacted, so they cannot be.
<P>

<a name="40224-18_para9"></a>We identified the three-year period because the Minister said on the previous occasion and repeated today that it would take at least two years for a revision. I am not seeking to knock out the regional planning guidance, but I am saying that we should get on with the successor work within a time frame that the Minister seems to think reasonable.
<P>

<a name="40224-18_para10"></a>The second of our amendments would delete Clause 6(2). I cannot for the life of me understand why the regional planning body has to give notice to the Secretary of State that it intends to prepare a draft revision. That seems to be prescription of the highest order. We have been exhorted so many times to think about what things would be like in reality, and it seems unreal to think that the regional planning body might operate in such privacy that it would tell nobody&#151;certainly not the Secretary of State&#151;that it was dealing with a draft revision. We want to get the situation on an even keel with the other things that we have been talking about. I do not see why the Bill needs to be so prescriptive here, so I thought that I would indulge in a whinge about the Secretary of State's overweening and unnecessary role in some cases, of which this is an example. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I shall not move Amendments Nos. 23 and 25 today. There were substantial answers on the previous occasion. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reply to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, today, and we can reflect on the issues before the final stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I shall also try to keep it brief. Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 fish in essentially the same pool. No doubt, the noble Lord will listen to what I have to say about them. The amendments tackle the same issue.
<P>

<a name="40224-18_para11"></a>We want to move as quickly as possible to put in place regional plans that are genuinely spatial and provide an effective statutory framework for delivery through local plans and ensure that they are kept up to date and timely. The issue is whether it is necessary or helpful to legislate for that. In my view, it is not essential to put that into the Bill. We already have in place a system that means that regional planning guidance now and regional spatial strategies in the future are regularly revised as needed by regional planning bodies. We do not need to prescribe a fixed timetable in legislation.
<P>

<a name="40224-18_para12"></a>In aid of that view, I cite something that my noble friend Lord Rooker referred to earlier, when talking about revision. The west Midlands has the oldest current regional planning guidance. Believe it or not, it dates back only to 1998. As, I think, my noble friend <P>


<a name="column_181"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 181</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Rooker suggested, a revision is in process and will be issued shortly. In every region, full or partial revisions are already under way or are being planned. We simply do not have a problem with out-of-date regional plans being allowed to gather dust that might make such an amendment necessary.
<P>

<a name="40224-18_para13"></a>Requiring a revision of the regional spatial strategy&#151;I assume that the amendment refers to a comprehensive revision&#151;at least every five years is too prescriptive and would be unhelpful. The regional spatial strategy looks at least 15 years ahead and addresses a wide range of issues and policy areas. A comprehensive revision is therefore a major exercise in terms of time, money, expertise and other resources. It is a major commitment. We would expect a comprehensive revision to take nearly two years from the process kicking off to the end of the examination in public. We do not want, by prescribing a fixed five-year revision cycle, to compel the regional planning body to spend what we might say is half its time revising the whole regional spatial strategy. A fixed review cycle would reduce flexibility and potentially create unnecessary work.
<P>

<a name="40224-18_para14"></a>Amendment No. 24 would remove the requirement on the regional planning body to give notice to the Secretary of State of its intention to prepare a draft revision of the regional spatial strategy. The noble Baroness was honest enough to say that it was a whinge, and I reckon that I recognise a whinge when I see it. Fair dos to the noble Baroness: I understand where she is coming from. It is not an over-onerous requirement. The regional planning body and the Government Office will, in any case, discuss when revisions need to be prepared and the sort of topics that they should cover. Although the final revision of the regional spatial strategy remains the Secretary of State's document, it is right in principle that he should be notified when the regional planning body intends to prepare a revision. My guess is that that would help in the planning of workloads, and so on, and enable the Government Office and the Secretary of State to understand where the process is at a given time, which is probably useful. I can understand the whinge, but it is not an over-burdensome issue, and we should not detain ourselves with it at this level.
<P>

<a name="40224-18_para15"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will be happy to leave things as they are. I think that I have covered the points that were raised, and I hope that my responses will find favour.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-18_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, what I said on Amendment No. 24 was a whinge, but it was a question as well. I suspect that, were the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, in opposition, he might think that this was a good point to ask Members of the House to take a little exercise, just to make the point. I shall not do so. The Minister made the best of a bad job, but those two lines should not be in the Bill. They are nonsense.

<a name="40224-18_para16"></a>I hope that the Minister will understand that, with Amendment No. 22, I was not proposing that there should be a triennial revision. The confusion about the quinquennial revision arose from one of the amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, which was not spoken to.

<a name="40224-19_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the amendment would ensure that, in any revision of the regional spatial strategy, all relevant strategies drawn up by local authorities in the region were taken into account. I do not like the phrase&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Judd, used it this afternoon&#151;but it is about "joined-up government". It is about recognising the importance of the bottom-up approach; many of us have criticised the Bill because we think that it is too top-down.
<P>

<a name="40224-19_para4"></a>There are four areas of strategy listed here&#151;transport, housing, economic and other regional strategies&#151;but many of the three areas of transport, housing and economic strategy are key to sustainability in this process. We have had long debates about sustainability and there will undoubtedly be more debates at this stage. However, if we are serious about sustainability&#151;and we are discussing defining it in the Bill and how difficult it is&#151;it is important to expand in the Bill where we can, to ensure that we are looking at it carefully.
<P>

<a name="40224-19_para5"></a>Shortly before I came down to the Chamber, I opened a letter from the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, which enclosed the consultation paper on planning policy statement 1. In that letter he emphasises the importance of sustainable development. In the document he also emphasises the need in planning policies to pursue proactively the four aims of sustainable development; namely, economic development, social inclusion, environmental protection and a prudent use of natural resources in an integrated way. The various strategies we have listed here will certainly assist in making sure that that happens. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I want to make it absolutely clear that there is no difference between us on the need for the regional planning body to have regard to these strategies when preparing a revision of the regional spatial strategy. That is subject to two qualifications. The first is that there is no intention to have separate regional transport strategies. These are an integral part of regional planning guidance at present. Draft planning policy statement 11 makes it clear that, in the future, the regional transport strategy should be an integral part of the regional spatial strategy.
<P>

<a name="40224-19_para6"></a>The second qualification is to the proposed obligation to have regard to all other regional strategies. In fact, listening to the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, I have just rewritten her own amendment. If the first three paragraphs, together with the word "other" in the final paragraph, were to be deleted and it read, "all regional strategies", it would mean exactly the same thing as listing the three and then saying, "all other regional strategies".
<P>

<a name="40224-19_para7"></a>There is a test of relevance when one includes all the regional strategies. I am not an expert on this, but apparently there are regional strategies concerned with emergency planning, contingent on natural disaster or act of war. They are not really relevant to the area we are dealing with at the moment, so that would not work.
<P>

<a name="40224-19_para8"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said in Committee that draft planning policy statement 11 makes it clear that the regional spatial strategy should be consistent and supportive of the other relevant regional strategies, including in particular the regional economic, housing, and cultural strategies. Draft planning policy statement 11 explains that the reason why the draft regulations refer only to the regional economic strategy, rather than the cultural or housing strategies, is because the economic strategy is the only one of these strategies to have a statutory basis.
<P>

<a name="40224-19_para9"></a>I make it absolutely clear that we agree that regard should be had to these other types of regional strategies where they are relevant. The policy is quite clear on this, as set out in planning policy statement 11. However, we see no need to refer to these strategies in the Bill, and we could not do so anyway because of the non-statutory basis of many of them. I therefore hope that the noble Baroness will not pursue the amendment.

<A NAME="40224-19_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his answer. I beg to differ with him on natural disasters. Having had discussions, particularly with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, on what we mean by sustainability, I know that he is of the view, as are others, that sustainable communities are also communities where people are protected from natural disaster and are safe communities. Safety is also about protection from natural disasters such as flooding. I do not therefore totally agree with him on that point.

<a name="40224-19_para10"></a>He said that the strategies we were talking about, apart from the economic strategy, were not statutory. I thought that the drawing up of strategy by the regional housing board was a statutory function. Maybe I am wrong about that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I cannot answer this off the top of my head, but the way in which we have put the funds for the housing corporation and the housing investment programmes for local authorities into the regional pot has not involved legislation through this place. To the best of my knowledge, there has been no statutory instrument. It has been set up, but it is not statutory in the normal sense of that word.
<P>

<a name="40224-19_para11"></a>While I am on my feet, I want to say something about natural disasters. By definition, natural disasters occur and one has to try to avoid them. My point was that there is, however, a regional strategy concerned with emergency planning.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-19_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that explanation. He clearly does not agree with our line.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40224-19_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I will speak also to Amendment No. 30.
<P>

<a name="40224-19_para15"></a>Amendment No. 29 provides for the draft revision to include the purposes of the regional spatial strategy. We had some debate in Committee on the scope of the RSS. In that context, I picked up the reference in Clause 4(3)(b). That provision states that the regional planning body must consider whether the implementation of the regional spatial strategy is achieving the purposes of the regional spatial strategy.
<P>

<a name="40224-19_para16"></a>I may be told, of course, that it is not necessary to say this because the regional spatial strategy will set out its objectives, but it does not actually say so in Clause 6. It needs to say so, in order that the regional planning body can monitor what it is doing, and so that others can monitor what it is doing and hold it to account.
<P>

<a name="40224-19_para17"></a>Amendment No. 30 proposes that policies should be included in the regional spatial strategy in respect of the format as set out in the amendment. There has been a good deal of resistance to being explicit about these matters, but we are losing the current structure plans and unitary development plans, which have requirements attached to them, imposed through Schedule 4 of the Planning and Compensation Act 1991. The schedule contains explicit requirements for structure, unitary, and indeed local plans, to include policies in respect of the conservation of the natural beauty and amenity of the <P>


<a name="column_185"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>land, the improvement of the physical environment and the management of traffic. I  am concerned to ensure that this is not lost.
<P>

<a name="40224-19_para18"></a>In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, made a point about not having room for more on the face of the Bill. He said that everything else would remain as it is in the principal Act; that is, the 1990 Act. That Act was amended by the 1991 Act. I hope I have shown that we would lose something that is in the 1990 Act unless it is specifically retained.
<P>

<a name="40224-19_para19"></a>I have added a paragraph in Amendment No. 30 regarding,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the conservation of natural resources"

<a name="40224-19_para20"></a>
because it seemed the logical thing to do. Thinking has moved on since what became the 1990 Act was going through the process of creation. Many would say that conserving natural resources is now something that one would, if your Lordships will forgive the pun, quite naturally include with the other matters in the schedule to the 1991 Act. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the amendments are consistent with the Government's policy on what a regional spatial strategy should contain, although Amendment No. 30 is not broad enough in scope. I have said before that there is an issue about what we should prescribe in the Bill in terms of the content of the regional spatial strategy rather than in policy guidance and, if necessary, in regulations.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para0"></a>Paragraph 1.5 of the draft planning policy statement 11 makes it clear that the regional spatial strategy should set out a concise spatial strategy for achieving the desired vision for the region, and there should be a clear link between policy objectives, priorities, targets and indicators. This must include being quite clear what the policy purposes of the regional spatial strategy are.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para1"></a>When we debated an amendment similar to Amendment No. 30 tabled in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, I said that we would need a much more comprehensive definition of the content of a regional spatial strategy and we must not have such a selective definition that singles out only some of the principles of sustainable development and unnecessarily restricts the scope of the regional spatial strategy. I referred in Committee to the much more comprehensive definition of what the draft planning policy statement says the regional spatial strategy should cover.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para2"></a>A similar issue arose in the past in relation to the content of development plans set out in the principal Act, the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The definition there is similar to what is covered by Amendment No. 30.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para3"></a>Since the 1990 Act, we have had to make it clear in planning policy guidance notes that other equally important policy topics needed to be covered. An example is the list of topics for inclusion in structure <P>


<a name="column_186"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 186</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>plans and Part 1 of the unitary development plans, set out on page 19 of planning policy guidance 12, which relates to development plans.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para4"></a>We think it would be a mistake to fossilise on the face of the Bill references to what matters the regional spatial strategy should contain, since these may change in the future. We really believe that such matters of content are best left for policy and guidance and, if necessary, regulation so the House can be involved and we can take advantage of experience and respond more flexibly to future needs. The real bone of contention is putting too much detail on the face of the Bill in the principal legislation, because it curtails us later in reacting to events.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-20_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure whether the Minister has responded to Amendment No. 29. That may be because of the movement going on around me.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para5"></a>I appreciate that the list of items which I have taken from the 1991 Act is additional to what is in the 1990 Act. It says that the UDP shall consist of a written statement formulating the authority's general policies in respect of the development and other use of land in their area, including measures for the improvement of the physical environment and the management of traffic. These items were substituted for the latter part.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para6"></a>The question that arises is whether the Government think that there has been any problem with what the Minister characterised as the rather restricted list of contents. We are concerned, as he acknowledged, to see the same sort of matters covered. I suppose the question is whether the existing legislation on UDPs and structure plans is thought to be defective.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para7"></a>As I said, I am not sure whether the first amendment in the group has had an answer, but I will read Hansard and see whether it amounts to an answer. The Minister says he did&#151;I do not disbelieve him, I just did not recognise it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40224-20_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 32 repeats an amendment tabled in Committee to enable the regional planning body to add to what the Secretary of State prescribed should be included in the regional spatial strategy.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para12"></a>The Minister replied that the provisions are a safeguard and that the Secretary of State probably would not have to prescribe. The amendment would not affect that either way. He said he would expect the revision to be agreed through negotiations between the regional planning body and the Government Office and that even if the Secretary of State were to prescribe the subject matter, that did not mean he would prescribe the content of the revision.

The Minister said that the regional planning body can have what it wants if it thinks it is expedient. It is the "what" that I am bothered about. The four criteria referred to are the extent of the revision proposed by the draft.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para15"></a>The debate went on for quite a long time. I am still not convinced that the clause is as wide as I would like. I am sorry to ask the Minister to go back to the debate; he may feel that it would be adequate to refer back, but if he has some new points, I would be glad to hear them. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry that the noble Baroness was not reassured by what I said in Committee. I will make it really clear and unambiguous, without using much of my brief.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para16"></a>I assure the noble Baroness that if the regional planning body wants to, it has complete freedom to prepare a draft revision that goes wider than any subjects prescribed in regulations under this clause. There is a reason for that: any regulations in no way detract from the duty in Clause 6(1)(a), which provides that the regional planning body must prepare a draft revision of the regional spatial strategy,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"when it appears to it necessary or expedient to do so".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-20_para17"></a>
That is wide and catch-all. Therefore, none of the other regulations can detract from that duty. I hope that that spells everything out.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-20_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, Clause 6 (1)(a) states that the RPB must prepare a draft revision "when" it appears necessary.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the "when" means when it appears necessary. Do not forget that when the regional planning body thinks it necessary, and it appears that it is necessary or expedient to prepare that revision, the RPB will do so&#151;it must do it when it appears necessary. Because the matter is subject to examination in public, the RPB can make minor revisions or major revisions, as I made clear when we discussed the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. It can tear everything up and start again. However, in the mean time, we have regional policies because of the transition from the old to the new scheme. The RPB can make minor adjustments if it thinks that they are necessary.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para18"></a>All such matters are subject to public examination, so they cannot be tinkered with in any rational way by the Secretary State&#151;which is what underlines most of the amendments put before the House. Nobody seems to trust my right honourable friend to do the right thing, yet he has made wonderful, brilliant planning decisions since he has had the responsibility to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-20_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether the Minister trusts his right honourable friend's successors in the fourth or fifth government to follow this one. <P>


<a name="column_188"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>That is the problem. We have made it clear throughout the debate that the Minister's integrity is not impugned and neither is that of his right honourable friend, but future governments remain to be tested. That lies at the heart of so much of what we are saying about the Secretary of State's role and why we are so concerned to spell out the "what". The subject matter is not restricted to what the Secretary of State says in the regulations it must contain&#151;it is merely the starting point and the RPB can add its own assessment.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para19"></a>The Minister has reassured me. I am reassured about what he and his colleagues in the Government intend. However, none of us is able to give a reassurance about how future governments will carry on. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40224-20_para22"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving these draft regulations, I will also speak to the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) (Amendment) Order 2004.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para23"></a>There are two statutory instruments to be considered. The first is the draft Immigration (Provision of Physical Data) (Amendment) Regulations 2004 which are made in exercise of the powers conferred on the Secretary of State by Section 126 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Section 126 enables the Secretary of State, by the making of regulations, to require that an immigration application be accompanied by physical data of an external characteristic or to enable an authorised person to require an entrant to provide information of this sort. One set of regulations has already been made under this power&#151;the Immigration (Provision of Physical Data) Regulations 2003. The 2003 regulations required the provision of a record of fingerprints by entry clearance applicants in Colombo.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para24"></a>The second statutory instrument is the draft Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) (Amendment) Order 2004, which is made in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 3A of the Immigration Act 1971, as inserted by Section 1 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. Section 3A (3) enables the Secretary of State by order to prescribe the circumstances in which an entry clearance is to have effect as leave to enter the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para25"></a>The purpose of these statutory instruments is to expand the current fingerprinting power in the 2003 regulations to encompass new categories of <P>


<a name="column_189"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 189</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>immigration application. The new provision will require those applying for entry clearance in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Tanzania and Uganda to provide fingerprint data. Holders of 1951 convention travel documents issued outside the UK will also be required to provide fingerprints on making an application for leave to enter the UK. We are amending the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order so that this application has to be made on arrival in the UK. This ensures that any 1951 convention document holders who refuse to provide their fingerprints can be refused leave to enter.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para26"></a>Fingerprinting in Colombo will continue. The initial six-month pilot has been concluded and the results were reported to the House in the letter from my right honourable friend Beverley Hughes of 5 February to the chair of the Seventh Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation, a copy of which was placed in the Library of the House. The results of the pilot are encouraging and the Government remain convinced that greater use of biometric technology will support efforts to prevent document and identity fraud. It will enable those who have an entitlement to enter the UK to do so without hindrance while preventing those who seek to circumvent our controls from doing so.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para27"></a>There will be no change to the procedural safeguards already provided as part of the existing fingerprint requirement. Applicants who are under 16 years of age will have their fingerprints taken only in the presence of a responsible adult who is over 18 years of age and not employed by the Government. Those safeguards also apply to the new categories of applicant who will be subject to the fingerprint requirement. Fingerprints collected in Colombo and east Africa will be added to the immigration and asylum fingerprint system database. That will allow for the identification of any visa applicant who subsequently makes either an asylum or immigration application in a different identity. That will, in turn, help establish the nationality of those who no longer have a basis on which to remain in the UK, and so assist with securing their removal.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para28"></a>In common with other data collected in respect of immigration and asylum applications, fingerprints will be shared with the police and other law enforcement agencies for the purposes of the prevention or investigation of crime. All such exchanges will be carried out in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998. That means that data may only be disclosed when it is necessary for one of the specified purposes set out in the data protection legislation, such as the exercise of statutory, departmental or police functions, and that the disclosure must be conducted in accordance with the data protection principles. An additional safeguard is that, under the regulations, any fingerprints stored on the database are required to be destroyed no more than 10 years from the day on which they were provided.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para29"></a>Any entry clearance application that is not accompanied by the necessary fingerprint data may be treated as invalid. There may be exceptions, including applicants who, because of physical disability or <P>


<a name="column_190"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 190</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>injury, cannot provide fingerprints. The system will be operated in a reasonable way to limit the impact on applicants.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para30"></a>We also propose to fingerprint holders of all 1951 convention travel documents issued outside the UK at the time those people make an application for leave to enter this country. There is some evidence to suggest that, in addition to more conventional document fraud, individuals who have been granted refugee status elsewhere are making asylum applications after arriving in the UK. They do this by travelling to the UK on a convention travel document issued by another country which they destroy on arrival in the UK and subsequently claim asylum. Fingerprinting such people on arrival will allow us to identify the basis on which they entered the UK if they subsequently claim asylum. Again, the safeguards in relation to age and use and storage of fingerprints will apply.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para31"></a>The Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000 is being amended because, at present, an entry clearance will act as leave to enter. Without this amendment any convention travel document holder with an entry clearance would enjoy a right of entry to the UK. To require such a person to provide fingerprints at the entry clearance stage would require the installation of fingerprinting equipment at every entry clearance post world-wide, as we do not want the fingerprint requirement imposed on convention travel document holders to be limited to those applying in certain countries. To do that would involve vastly disproportionate expense. The order needs to be amended to make clear that the holder of a convention travel document must apply for leave to enter on arrival in the UK even when he or she is in possession of a valid entry clearance. If a convention document holder refuses to provide fingerprint data when seeking entry to the UK, that application for leave can be refused and the individual can, if appropriate, be removed.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para32"></a>We are working with the authorities in relevant east African countries to effect a smooth introduction to the fingerprinting operation. The support and co-operation received is much appreciated by this Government. The UNHCR is also being consulted about these proposals.
<P>

<a name="40224-20_para33"></a>As I have said, we believe that the use of biometric technology in the immigration field is an important development that will provide greater certainty over people's identity than has been possible in the past. We are not alone in that view. We are working with our EU partners on proposals for the inclusion of biometric identifiers in visas and residence permits, and noble Lords will be aware that the US authorities are already making greater use of fingerprint data. Those measures will of course provide benefits for us and our controls, but they also provide reassurance to legitimate travellers. By reducing the scope for identity fraud, we reduce the risk that legitimate travellers will have their identity stolen or, because of similar details, will be mistaken for someone else. It is for those reasons we believe that it is essential that we make appropriate use of biometrics. I commend the regulations and the order to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-21_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for that comprehensive explanation of the two orders. The physical data order extends the entry requirement for both visa and non-visa nationals, which they must obtain for clearance before travelling to the UK. Apart from the saving in time by processing such applications before arrival in the distant country, it also saves the complications that could arise in certain circumstances in which entry would otherwise be refused at the port of entry. That is a policy that we certainly support, and it is clearly a matter of some satisfaction that the pilot scheme in Sri Lanka has worked well. We accordingly support the move to extend the policy to the other countries in east Africa.
<P>

<a name="40224-21_para0"></a>We also welcome the tightening of the requirements in respect of the documents relating to documents issued pursuant to the UN convention on refugees by requiring the production of fingerprints to the Immigration Service. We welcome the effect that that will have on applications under another identity or where national security is involved. I am grateful to the Minister for outlining the safeguards that are in place to ensure that that is not abused.
<P>

<a name="40224-21_para1"></a>The other, related order tightens up the loophole in the previous order and provides that an entry clearance shall no longer have effect as to leave to entry when that entry clearance is endorsed on a refugee travel document. We are pleased to note that that is not retrospective and applies only to those refugee documents endorsed after 27 February 2004. We on these Benches support the two orders.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, we are also much obliged to the Minister for her comprehensive explanation of the orders. We are in favour in general terms of the better use of physical data in preventing illegal immigration and are aware of the useful work that is already being done on that subject. In Sub-Committee F we had the opportunity to visit Oakington, where we were told that some people who had been refused asylum came round the second time and were being detected by the fingerprint system. To that extent, we are already making good use of biometric data and there is no reason in principle why that should not be extended. However, we need to be assured that the present proposals are both proportionate and compatible with data protection considerations. I am grateful to the Minister for her remarks on those matters.
<P>

<a name="40224-21_para2"></a>We do not have the letter referring to proportionality that the Minister said was sent by her colleague in another place to the committee. I asked in the Printed Paper Office and in the Library, and I can tell the Minister that it was not on POLIS. Therefore, I have come into the Chamber without full knowledge of the report made by the Minister in another place, although I have had the opportunity of studying what she said before the Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation.
<P>


<a name="column_192"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 192</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-21_para3"></a>The Minister in another place explained that the purpose was to extend the use of biometric controls to the countries mentioned today. She also gave some information about the results from the letter; she said that 14,000 fingerprints had been taken in Colombo and that the result was that seven people were positively identified and two of them received prison sentences. In reply to a question from Mr Boswell, she said that if one considered the decline in applications from Colombo and compared it with the equivalents from India and Pakistan, there was a more than proportionate reduction. Therefore, fingerprinting had been effective, not only in catching people who committed offences but in deterring unjustified applications from Colombo. I would very much like to have seen the coloured graphs that the right honourable Lady mentioned in her speech to the Standing Committee; I hope that copies of them can be placed in your Lordships' Library.
<P>

<a name="40224-21_para4"></a>The Minister in another place also made the point that sharing the data had to be consistent in all respects with the Data Protection Act 1998, the Human Rights Act 1998 and the common law of confidence. I should like to ask the noble Baroness, when she comes to reply, what consultation she has had with the Information Commissioner on the matter. It is not only what the Government say about the use that is to be made of the data that matters, but what the statutory body set up for the protection of individuals under the Data Protection Act has to say. Personally, I should like there to be a certificate in the legislation, when major extensions are being contemplated in the use of biometric data, saying that the Government have consulted the Information Commissioner and that he has raised no objections to the proposals.
<P>

<a name="40224-21_para5"></a>The noble Baroness referred indirectly to the European Union draft directive on the use of biometrics on all passengers arriving at ports of entry into the EU. The report from Sub-Committee F on the proposal, which was published on 12 February, found that an adequate case had not been made out for that proposal, which was of course much more far-reaching than what is in front of us now, because of the considerable burden it would place on carriers and the disproportionate cost in comparison with the results hoped to be achieved. It is unfortunate that we have had no opportunity of debating that report, as we are faced with a creeping extension&#151;although it may be perfectly justified&#151;of the use of physical data without the opportunity to consider the order in the context of the more far-reaching proposals that will be coming down the track. However, that may simply be an accident of our timetable, which could not have been avoided.
<P>

<a name="40224-21_para6"></a>Both the UK and the European Union have taken their cue on these matters from the US, where all visitors from non-visa waiver countries must already provide biometric data on arrival. I understand that that is to be extended to everybody who enters the United States, even those who possess standing visas, from October this year. Perhaps we do not have any discretion in this matter, when airlines will be compelled to accept US regulations. There will be very <P>


<a name="column_193"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 193</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>practical reasons for Europe to adopt the same rules. However, we should at least know what it is going to cost, what new obligations are being loaded on to carriers and whether the Government and the Information Commissioner are fully satisfied that adequate steps are being taken to ensure that our data protection legislation is being observed.
<P>

<a name="40224-21_para7"></a>I should like to say a word on the imposition of the new requirements on the holders of convention travel documents. I understand what the noble Baroness said about not requiring everyone to obtain fingerprints before they set off, as that would entail an enormous extension of the fingerprinting system to every country from which a CTD holder might arrive. Presumably, however, when CTD holders from the main countries in east Africa&#151;and from Kenya if it is added to the list, as was discussed in the Standing Committee in another place&#151;apply at those posts for an entry certificate, they will automatically be fingerprinted before they set off and will not have to be fingerprinted again on arrival. I also assume that when CTD holders apply for an entry certificate in other countries that are not in east Africa or in Sri Lanka they will be told specifically that they will be asked to give a fingerprint on arrival in the United Kingdom. I hope that the noble Baroness can give those assurances. I welcome this order and these regulations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-21_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I thank both noble Lords for the warmth of their welcome for the order and regulations, for the utility which they will provide in determining the bona fides of the identity of those seeking to rely on them, and for their generosity and understanding of why they have become necessary. Having said thank you very warmly, I hope, to the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, for his unreserved support, I turn to the questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury.
<P>

<a name="40224-21_para8"></a>The Information Commissioner has not specifically been consulted. However, as the noble Lord will know, the Data Protection Act provides very clear safeguards. We have taken those safeguards very seriously indeed. We are not aware of any issues raised by the commissioner in relation to Sri Lanka but we shall certainly make inquiries about them. As for the issues raised about the CTD holders, the noble Lord's description was correct. The fingerprints should be taken once. We are proposing the amendment so that those who have not had their fingerprints taken can have them taken when they arrive.
<P>

<a name="40224-21_para9"></a>The noble Lord also asked whether east African CTD holders will be required to provide fingerprints on arrival. The answer is: no; they will have their fingerprints captured when they apply for a visa overseas prior to arrival. So people will have their fingerprints taken either prior to arrival or on arrival. I thank the noble Lord for his appreciation of the utility of the scheme we have put together. We think <P>


<a name="column_194"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 194</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that it neatly fits the requirement for a measure which is necessary and proportionate. Of course I note the noble Lord's comments on the regrettability of not having a debate. As always, that is not within our hands; it is a matter for the usual channels.

<P>

<a name="40224-21_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this draft order has been seen by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. It will bring into effect the procedures for authorising and using directed and intrusive surveillance and for the conduct and use of covert human intelligence sources.
<P>

<a name="40224-21_para14"></a>Where there is an allegation of criminal conduct by a person serving with the police, there is a real need for an independent alternative to an investigation by the police. Part 2 of the Police Reform Act 2002 envisages that the IPCC will itself conduct investigations only in the most serious cases. The IPCC investigators will need to operate in the same way as the police and will need the same capabilities and the same powers in order, for example, to interfere with property, to engage in surveillance or to use human intelligence sources. The order will give the IPCC the necessary powers to conduct investigations independently from the police into allegations of serious criminal conduct by any person serving with the police.
<P>

<a name="40224-21_para15"></a>The modifications made by this order are about setting appropriate levels within the IPCC in regard to authorisation to use specific powers for specific purposes; ensuring that the IPCC is subject to equivalent controls as apply to the police; and handling of complaints against the IPCC in exercising its powers under the order.
<P>

<a name="40224-21_para16"></a>The provisions in the Police Act 1997 and RIPA were drafted to ensure sufficient certainty in the mechanisms for safeguarding against the misuse of the powers contained in them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-22_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   My Lords, I again thank the Minister for her helpful explanation. This is a very significant order as it sets in train the Independent Police Complaints Commission. It is of the most vital importance that this body is seen to be the monitor of police behaviour in exercising the very considerable powers they now possess particularly under the Police Act 1997 and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. It is so important in maintaining the public's confidence in the integrity and good behaviour of the police.
<P>

<a name="40224-22_para0"></a>The order includes some very satisfactory requirements for authorisation by senior officers and officials of the commission. We very much welcome the express provision in the order relating to the requirement of the IPCC to assist the tribunal with documentation and information, thus providing a further monitoring body for the proper exercise of police powers.
<P>

<a name="40224-22_para1"></a>In these days of the ever-present threat of terrorism in the United Kingdom it is important that the ever-delicate balance between respect for the rights of the individual and the security of the realm is correctly struck. I would very much welcome the Minister's assurance that the Government are satisfied that the order meets that criterion. I welcome the order.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, that it is essential to maintain public confidence in the police and that this order goes to the heart of that matter in giving the IPCC identical powers to conduct investigations into complaints of criminal conduct by police officers as there would be if that conduct were committed by a member of the public.
<P>

<a name="40224-22_para2"></a>I should like to add only one comment to those of the noble Viscount. Although the noble Baroness has given us the assurance that these powers will be used extremely sparingly&#151;I certainly hope that that will be the case&#151;I should like to know what kind of parliamentary oversight there will be of the use made of the powers. Will a report be made by the Independent Police Complaints Commission on the particular exercise of these powers; or, when the powers are exercised, will it be part of a general report&#151;such as an annual report&#151;that they make?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-22_para3"></a>I should like to be assured that this extensive power will be monitored properly and that the way in which it is used is known to the public, so that the assurance sought and obtained by the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, in respect of the order is extended to the actual exercise of the power; and it is not simply a theoretical notion that those powers might be used in extreme cases.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, again I thank both noble Lords for their helpful remarks in support of the order.
<P>

<a name="40224-22_para4"></a>In answer to the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, I am happy to say that we are so satisfied. The IPCC will prepare annual reports which will include the occasions that the powers are used. I hope that that satisfies the concern expressed, quite properly, by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury.

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"(3) Before publishing the revision of the RSS, the Secretary of State shall cause an examination in public to be held of such matters affecting the consideration of the proposals as he considers ought to be examined, unless the draft revision is minor and inconsequential."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40224-22_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I wish to speak only to Amendment No. 33 and not to Amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 37 which will not be moved tonight.
<P>

<a name="40224-22_para12"></a>As I have just said, in this grouping I wish to speak only to Amendment No. 33. The Bill gives the Secretary of State discretion whether to hold an examination in public into revisions of an RSS. The discretion is put in fairly general terms. He could decline to hold an examination in public in a wide variety of circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40224-22_para13"></a>The examination is a very important part of the process. It enables local authorities and interest groups to argue the merits of a draft RSS before an independent person and to seek recommendations that changes be made. It should only be in respect of minor uncontentious changes&#151;effectively tidying up&#151;that an examination will be unnecessary. This seems in <P>


<a name="column_197"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 197</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>practice to be the Secretary of State's view. The consultation draft Planning Policy Statement 11 states that in paragraph 230:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is a strong presumption that an examination in public will be held and it is only in the exceptional circumstances of a minor revision and subject to the criteria set out in [old] Clause 6(4) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill that the Secretary of State may decide that an examination is unnecessary".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-22_para14"></a><P>

<a name="40224-22_para15"></a>Our amendment better reflects the Secretary of State's intention than subsections (3) and (4) of Clause 7 as drafted. The Bill could be used to deny examinations in public on significant and contentious issues. Our amendment would safeguard the safeguard, as it were. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-22_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I shall speak only to Amendment No. 33. As the noble Lord said, Amendment No. 33 would amend Clause 7 to require an examination in public to be held unless the draft revision is minor and inconsequential and would delete subsections (3) and (4) of Clause 7. The amendment seeks to achieve almost precisely the same thing as the two subsections that it would delete&#151;that an examination in public will be held except where the changes proposed to the regional spatial strategy are so minor and routine that the effort and expense involved would not be justified.
<P>

<a name="40224-22_para16"></a>We believe though that the current wording of the Bill is better than that proposed in the amendment. The extent of previous consultation and the level of interest shown in a draft, though we would expect those to be in line with the importance of the revision, could be important factors in their own right. A revision might be minor but still contentious. In those circumstances there should be an examination in public.
<P>

<a name="40224-22_para17"></a>The Bill as drafted would allow for that, so one has to be careful. I do not believe that there is anything between us on the principle of this issue, but we want to allow for circumstances such as when a revision might be minor, but could still be contentious for certain sections or groups. Therefore, one would justifiably hold an examination in public. On that basis, unless the noble Lord has any further point, I hope he will not pursue the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-22_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the Minister that there is not really any difference between us. We just want to make certain that where there could be a minor but contentious issue, there should be an examination in public. I am pleased to note his comments, which will appear in Hansard. It is important that it is on the record, because there needs to be the right examination in public in the right circumstances at the right time. Clarity is important.

<a name="40224-22_para25"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment would remove the power of the Secretary of State to withdraw a draft revision of the RSS on the basis that it is not his document to withdraw.
<P>

<a name="40224-22_para26"></a>I was minded not to return to this issue because the Minister gave us a helpful response in Committee. However, on reflection, three important questions remain, which I ask the Minister to clarify. The first goes right to the heart of the Bill. Who owns the regional spatial strategy? Clause 1 makes it clear that the policy is the strategy of the Secretary of State. The provision implies that the document itself belongs to the Secretary of State. That cannot be the case. Regional spatial strategies are developed and prepared by regional planning bodies. The strategy must be owned by the RPB, not the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40224-22_para27"></a>The second question is whether, if subsection (7) is to be used to stop the RSS revision process grinding on when a change has occurred that was so fundamental&#151;such as a radical new economic or waste strategy&#151;it would be better and more pragmatic to go back to one or two stages. That is the hypothetical situation that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, used by way of illustration. If that happened, would it not be better and less prescriptive for the regional planning body to step in and withdraw the draft revision of the RSS so that it could incorporate the new developments? I believe that, in some ways, this is an extension of my first question. Perhaps the Minister will be able to clarify those points in a moment.
<P>

<a name="40224-22_para28"></a>My third question is: will the Secretary of State be able to exercise his powers under subsection (7) only after the draft revision of the regional spatial strategy has been presented to him or will he be able to intervene at an earlier stage when it is still the case that the RPB could withdraw the draft revision under Clause 6(7)?
<P>

<a name="40224-22_para29"></a>If the latter interpretation prevails, I wish to reiterate our serious reservations about the centralising tendency&#151;the overwhelming top-down approach&#151;of the whole RSS revision process. The planning system should work from the bottom up. It is that quality that has made it so successful in the past.
<P>

<a name="40224-22_para30"></a>If there is nothing to stop the Secretary of State withdrawing the draft revision of the RSS when that would properly be the decision of the RPB, I believe that we may need to consider this issue again before the Bill completes its passage. However, I would like to have the Minister's answers to these questions now. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40224-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, so would I. Amendment No. 40 would remove the Secretary of State's power to withdraw a draft revision of the regional spatial strategy at any time before he publishes the final version. That would prevent the revision process being rewound if that is the best option. Even if everyone <P>


<a name="column_199"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 199</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>could see that the current draft revision should not be pursued, that would have to happen in any case. Therefore, a real problem arises there.
<P>

<a name="40224-23_para0"></a>Clause 9(7) is a pragmatic provision to prevent the revision process grinding on when, for reasons such as those that I have just mentioned, it needs to go back a stage or, indeed, several stages. Clause 6(7) similarly allows the regional planning body to withdraw a draft revision at any stage before it submits it to the Secretary of State for the same reasons.
<P>

<a name="40224-23_para1"></a>Therefore, with regard to the first question concerning who owns the regional spatial strategy, the answer is the regional planning body because, as we said in our debates before the dinner break, the RPB is the initiator. It is true that, ultimately, the Secretary of State gives the imprimatur promulgation but, of course, that is only after the examination has taken place in public.
<P>

<a name="40224-23_para2"></a>Clause 9(7) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"But the Secretary of State may withdraw a draft revision . . .  at any time before he publishes the revision".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-23_para3"></a>
However, the point is that he will only be able to do that after it has been given to him by the regional planning body. He will not have seen it before it is submitted to him and therefore it would be unreasonable to withdraw it. Thus, he could take that action only when the draft revision had been given to him by the regional planning body, when, presumably, it would have gone through all its processes. According to the answer that I have just given, he could not step back in the process while it was going on and stop something that he had not seen or had submitted to him. The Secretary of State cannot direct a withdrawal before the draft regional spatial strategy is submitted to him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may ask a question which goes back to my own example. The Government have announced that they want another runway and a big extension at Stansted airport in Essex. Therefore, if we were in the new world of regional spatial policies and other planning policies, obviously there would have to be a revision which the Government would have initiated because they had announced that they wanted a runway. Surely the Secretary of State would have to ask for a revision of the planning policies because another Minister&#151;in this case, the Secretary of State for Transport&#151;had suggested a runway. That does not really cover the issue. The Minister is saying that the policy would come from the region but, if the Government had initiated such a major change, surely they would then have to ask for a revision of the strategy.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Yes, my Lords. That is on the assumption that there is a procedure under way. There may not be. There may be a regional spatial strategy. There is no revision, there is no review going on. In other words, there is no process. Obviously, looking at the Secretary of State's powers in Clause 9, which is headed "RSS: further procedure", that would arise only in those circumstances.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-23_para4"></a>However, I am not so sure because the airport must come under major infrastructure projects. I am not using this as a defensive answer, although it is the reasonable one because it is a big example. In terms of proposals, a new motorway, airport or, dare I say it, a nuclear power station would probably be classed as a major project to be dealt with under the procedures set out much later the Bill. I am not sure whether simply proposing, in the case that the noble Lord gives, an expansion of an existing airport&#151;there is already an airport there in the example that he used&#151;would be covered by that. I do not know at the moment. It is certainly a major infrastructure project; that I can clearly understand. Whether that would amount to having to redraw the whole of the regional spatial strategy, I cannot say off the top of my head. It is something that I shall get advice on beforehand. I understand the concern.
<P>

<a name="40224-23_para5"></a>In fact, I am a bit surprised that the proposals for Stansted have not figured more in our deliberations. It is due to the incredible professionalism of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, in not pushing his own local backyard issues from the Dispatch Box. That is a tribute.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that. We shall read his answers very carefully and he has indicated that he will look at the matter again before we discuss these issues again. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40224-23_para6"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<a name="40224-23_para7"></a>Clause 10 [Secretary of State: additional powers]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-23_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee </B>   moved Amendment No. 41:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 5, line 31, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-23_para8"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"( ) Before taking any step under subsection (1), (3) or (5) the Secretary of State shall consult the RPB and shall seek the advice of each authority in the region which is an authority falling within section 5(3)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40224-23_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 41 provides that before the Secretary of State directs an RPB to prepare a draft revision or prepares it, if the RPB fails to comply with various matters, including that direction, or revokes an RSS or part of it he,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall consult the RPB and shall seek the advice of each authority in the region",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-23_para10"></a>
which is essentially a county or unitary district, as already identified in the earlier clause as amended.
<P>

<a name="40224-23_para11"></a>So, if the Secretary of State decides that he wants five runways at Stansted and wants to change the RSS to provide for it, he has to come and talk to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. I think that the Minister underestimates the forcefulness of his refusal to get dragged into any current issues when Stansted was last mentioned. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, probably feels that he has come to the end of the runway on that one.
<P>

<a name="40224-23_para12"></a>When we were debating Clause 10 in Committee, the Minister stressed that these overarching powers were only reserve powers and that the Government would <P>


<a name="column_201"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 201</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not expect that the Secretary of State would ever need to give a direction to a regional planning body to prepare a draft revision. He said twice that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"revisions . . .  are not something that will be governed by central diktat".&#151;[Official Report, 22/1/04; col. 1172.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-23_para13"></a>
He also said that this was a sensible safeguard, that a reserve power was the best way of dealing with it and that he would use the powers of direction only in exceptional circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40224-23_para14"></a>As I said earlier, unwillingly acknowledging &#151;I was about to say accepting, but acknowledging is closer to the mark&#151;that the role of the Secretary of State was written for him by the Government in all this, I am seeking to insert a degree of consultation and communication with both the regional planning body that the Secretary of State will have judged not to be doing the job and with relevant authorities before he takes the step.
<P>

<a name="40224-23_para15"></a>We may hear that the Secretary of State would do that without being told to do so by the legislation. I simply make the point I made on an earlier amendment; that is, that if the Minister can get out of his mind the image of his right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister as being the current Secretary of State and think of the worst possible example, that is why we tabled the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, this is almost a case of deja vu. I shall make clear for the record that we would not expect the Secretary of State ever to have to direct a regional planning body to prepare a draft revision of the regional spatial strategy or to prepare one himself. As I have said before, these provisions are in the Bill simply as a safeguard. What happens now and will continue to happen in the future is that the regional planning body will discuss with the government office when a revision is needed and the kind of topics it should cover and take the revision forward on that basis. That goes back to our discussion on an earlier amendment: why should they tell anyone that they are going to do it? First there will be an examination in public. Someone has to organise the planning inspectorate. They have to be aware of providing staff and resources to do that, so there is good reason to discuss it with the government office.
<P>

<a name="40224-23_para16"></a>Similarly, the power to revoke all or part of the regional spatial strategy is a procedural safeguard. There might be occasions when part of the regional spatial strategy had become seriously out of date before a new revision could be completed and it would be helpful in the interests of clarity if it was revoked. Any revocation is something that would be done in discussion with the regional planning body and as a matter of good practice the Government would always give reasons for the action taken.
<P>

<a name="40224-23_para17"></a>To impose a requirement to seek advice and consult before exercising powers that are included in the Bill as a safeguard, frankly is unreasonable. Nor do we see any case for this in principle. The powers are there as a safeguard. If they ever have to be used it would be in the most exceptional circumstances and reasons would <P>


<a name="column_202"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 202</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be given. I do not think that one can ask for more than that. I shall stop singing my right honourable friend's praises in case he gets the wrong idea.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-23_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, if the powers are there as a procedural safeguard, why do we not put in a procedural safeguard that the Secretary of State will do what the Minister says he will do? It is another case where the parliamentary draftsmen might put their drafting where the Minister's mouth is. I recognise that we are not going to make progress on this and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 6, line 34, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-24_para0"></a><P>

<a name="40224-24_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, when I spoke to this amendment in Committee the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, hinted that I was a conspiracy theorist, so it is important that I clarify my reasons for coming back to this issue of who is the relevant Secretary of State for the purposes of regional spatial strategies. I reassure your Lordships that with this amendment I am genuinely questioning this legislation's adaptability in relation to future governance arrangements rather than pursuing a conspiracy theory.
<P>

<a name="40224-24_para2"></a>I understand that the way Clause 12(4) defines the Secretary of State by function is unusual in a Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, did partly answer my query in Committee. The Minister explained that the purpose of defining the Secretary of State in this way was to ensure that Clause 2(2) cannot be interpreted as requiring policies prepared by any other Secretary of State to be included in the regional spatial strategy if those policies relate to the development and use of land in the region. So, for example, the regional spatial strategy will not contain the policies of Secretaries of State for Education or Health, because even though they relate to land use, they are not primarily concerned with it. I think that that is right and I have no argument with that aspect of Clause 12(4).
<P>

<a name="40224-24_para3"></a>However, I remain concerned about why there is no mention of regions in the definition of "Secretary of State" in Clause 12(4). In subsection (4) the Secretary of State is defined as the Secretary of State who has for the time being,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"general responsibility for policy in relation to the development and use of land".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-24_para4"></a>
At the moment that Secretary of State happens also to have responsibility for the regions.
<P>

<a name="40224-24_para5"></a>We know that Prime Ministers and all governments rearrange ministerial responsibilities. So, if that situation were to change, would the Secretary of State who is in charge of general policy on planning always necessarily be the right Minister to lead on regional spatial strategies, as opposed to the Secretary of State responsible for the regions? There is my own situation with the Conservative shadow team. We now have a Minister responsible for the regions.
<P>


<a name="column_203"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-24_para6"></a>Part 1 of the Bill deals solely with the regional spatial strategies. In other words, it deals with land use, planning, houses, infrastructure and so on for particular regions. It does not deal with general planning policy&#151;those provisions come later in the Bill&#151;for example, on compulsory purchase or major infrastructure projects or simplified planning zones. I would have thought that was a very good argument for putting regional spatial strategies firmly in the orbit of whichever Secretary of State happens to be in charge of the regions.
<P>

<a name="40224-24_para7"></a>I would simply be interested to know from the Minister why the Government have chosen not to do that. If the explanation is simply that in the current circumstances it makes no difference, thus we need not worry about it, I ask why the regions are not added to the existing definition of the Secretary of State. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I understand that the noble Lord has a problem with the notion of adaptability. He says that at the moment it happens to be a happy coincidence that regions and planning are in the same place. That might not be the case in the future. I think that the answer is that we have to deal with what is in front of us. It is impossible to envisage every change of circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40224-24_para8"></a>Currently we have that happy coincidence and it is important. In any event, I think that one could safely argue that a Secretary of State with overall responsibility for planning would always play a leading role in regional matters. So, I certainly understand what the noble Lord is saying and the point he is getting at. He has explained it rather better this evening than he did the last time we went around this course. I am not making any allegations here. It would be wrong of me to do so. I do not think that the noble Lord sees conspiracies everywhere; he is not that kind of person. I was being slightly facetious.
<P>

<a name="40224-24_para9"></a>Our view is that whoever has general responsibility for the planning system&#151;not the geographical units of those plans&#151;must be finally accountable for the policies in a regional spatial strategy, particularly where there is no regional assembly. That is after all the key point of a system which is reliant on regional spatial planning.
<P>

<a name="40224-24_para10"></a>So I understand the point, but I think that at the moment we are content with the structure we have set up. It falls to the Secretary of State with that responsibility to ensure that all others who have a bearing on regional planning in different ways are aware of their overall role in pulling things together, co-ordinating them and ensuring that the regions function well and in a coherent way. I hope that, having heard that, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. He obviously realised the point that I was trying to make. Perhaps I did not make it well the first time round. We are concerned, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has said several times, not just with the current situation. The previous planning legislation lasted for many years, although it may have been tinkered with. Once planning legislation has been set in <P>

However, today I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "COMMENCEMENT OF PART 2
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40224-24_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 45 inserts a new clause, which states that:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-24_para14"></a>
At the previous stage of the Bill, my noble friend Lady Hamwee introduced a debate on understanding and plain English. I know that at that time the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, had a great deal of sympathy with her point. He gave some assurances that, with officials in his department, he would discuss how we could get into the public domain a guide to the changes in the planning system that ordinary people&#151;those who do not necessarily live with the matter day to day&#151;could understand. Some of us have lived with the matter on a day-to-day basis for quite some time and it has become a little clearer. This is a new system and it is important that people understand it. If the community is to be properly involved in the consultation, people need to be able to understand it.
<P>

<a name="40224-24_para15"></a>This amendment may not be the appropriate way in which to deal with the matter, but I hope that it will give the Minister a chance to tell us what action he has taken since we last discussed the issue. He said that he would take this back to his department as he believed that it was important that we had a plain English guide to the new system and to the new hierarchy in planning legislation. I hope that he will be able to report favourably on those discussions and that something will be forthcoming, even if not in the form of the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I have a simple and positive answer for the noble Baroness. We absolutely agree that there is a need for guidance for what I shall call the person in the street. In the past I would have said "the man in the street", but now we talk about persons. I am very happy to give an assurance that we shall work to produce a guide, not just for Part 2, but for the whole reform system for the person in the street in time for commencement. I cannot be clearer than that. I think it would be overkill to legislate for it in this way. I hope that my statement will be accepted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-24_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, when my noble friend and I were talking <P>


<a name="column_205"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 205</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about this amendment, I had no serious expectation that it would appear on the face of the Bill. As it is important, perhaps I can check what the Minister has said. He says, "We shall work towards that". Is that an assurance that the Government will publish before commencement? I am not trying to trip him up; I want to be clear about the assurance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-24_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I understand the qualification. I am happy to give an assurance that we shall work to produce a guide, not just for Part 2, but for the reform system as a whole in time for commencement.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-24_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is whispering to me, "Does that mean that it will actually happen?"

<a name="40224-24_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, with this amendment we are back to county issues again. We are seeking to maintain the strategic dimension of the county planning function as it relates to undertaking a survey. I received a helpful letter from the Minister setting out exactly what a "county matter" means in the context of Clause 14. I thank the Minister for that letter, which was also sent to other noble Lords and the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="40224-24_para19"></a>The letter makes it clear that Clause 14(1) and (2) provide a survey function for county councils to underpin their responsibilities for mineral and waste planning only. The county councils' other responsibilities, such as highways and transportation, are not conceived as relevant to this clause. The letter goes on to say that when the county councils advise and are consulted on regional spatial strategies&#151;this is slightly imprecise, surely the Minister means when county councils are consulted on the revision of regional spatial strategies, but I let that pass&#151;and when they are consulted on local development documents, these are the processes through which the county councils properly influence plan-making and have their wide range of responsibilities taken into account in so far as they affect development and the planning of development in their area.
<P>

<a name="40224-24_para20"></a>Clause 19(2)(g) provides for local planning authorities to have regard to county councils' community strategies in two-tier areas. I was pleased to see this part of the letter from the Minister that in the Government's view community strategies are particularly important. I know from my experience that a tremendous amount of work is going into councils' community strategies. They are totally relevant to everything that happens in a county area and partnerships with districts and voluntary <P>


<a name="column_206"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 206</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bodies, and there is a tremendous amount of work going into these community strategies. They are very relevant indeed.
<P>

<a name="40224-24_para21"></a>This is a comprehensive response, and we appreciate that these various processes are in place. However, the central question remains why the Government are curtailing the county councils' survey function so greatly. Why do they insist on pursuing policies that consistently undermine their own objectives for local government? This is not the way to achieve joined-up services. County councils have a general duty to seek to promote the economic, environmental and social well being of their communities, by drawing up community strategies that are focused not narrowly on particular functions, but are designed to be outward-looking.
<P>

<a name="40224-24_para22"></a>We are attempting to use our place in the community to exercise leadership for all our citizens. Reducing this survey function does not help us, our partners or districts to achieve cross-cutting objectives or better service delivery. District councils might welcome monitoring support from county councils. This provision also threatens to undermine the retention of planning resources in the local government system. It is a bad idea, and I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to this amendment. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40224-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord said, we keep coming back to the issue of county councils. I hope that I can be positive in my explanation. Certainly, I will use the material that I have, so that it is helpful for Third Reading if need be. I hope that we can put this one to rest in the end.
<P>

<a name="40224-25_para0"></a>Clause 14 provides for local authorities with minerals and waste planning responsibilities&#151;which are county councils in two-tier areas&#151;to keep under review matters that are likely to affect mineral and waste development, or the planning of that development. These are referred to as the "county matters". Amendment No. 46 removes the reference to county matters, and the effect would be to require the county council to review planning matters and undertake survey work for areas of all district councils within the county boundary.
<P>

<a name="40224-25_para1"></a>We recognise that some small districts might be stretched to undertake full survey work. We have discussed the role of the counties, and I reiterate that they will play an important role with survey work being one of those aspects where county councils can contribute.
<P>

<a name="40224-25_para2"></a>Clause 14(3) provides for the Secretary of State to require by regulations or direct a county council to keep under review the wider matters relating to land use planning and development referred to in Clause 13(2). The draft regulations propose that the matters to be kept under review are those set out in Clause 13(2)(a) and (c) to (e) and that the results should be made available to local planning authorities.
<P>

<a name="40224-25_para3"></a>It would be inappropriate to specify in the Bill that all counties must review all matters in respect of all the areas of district councils in the county. That would be ridiculous, given the context of the Bill. It would remove ownership of the process from the district, even though the work is essential for preparing local <P>


<a name="column_207"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 207</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>development documents. It would also take no account of the different circumstances or capacities of district councils; indeed, it would treat them all the same.
<P>

<a name="40224-25_para4"></a>Our approach can be adapted to particular circumstances. The issues that a county would need to keep under review may change over time, as the new planning system evolves. The beauty of the regulations is that they provide the flexibility to adapt to that. I hope that, in the light of those comments, the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment, but I must put on the record again a sentence that I used before, as it may help those who assist with the drafting of opposition amendments: by removing the reference to county matters, Amendment No. 46 would require the county council to review planning matters and undertake survey work for areas of all district councils within the boundary. There would be a requirement to review for all district councils within the boundary. That cannot be what the noble Lord intended with his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, that is how we operate in Essex. With our county community partnership, we are involved with each district partnership. In fact, we pay for a lot of the work that the districts do. We have local service agreements under which we work with district councils. We share responsibility. They take some services from us, and we work in partnership to develop legal services and purchasing services.
<P>

<a name="40224-25_para5"></a>Some of the discussions that we have had suggest that people do not realise how the two-tier system works. There is a partnership between the district councils and the county council, and it has changed a lot in the past couple of years. The development of the well-being clause and the development of the community strategies have changed the whole process, even the comprehensive performance assessment process. This week, every district in Essex is having a CPA. The Audit Commission asks me how we work with each district council, as part of the CPA process. Things have changed so much.
<P>

<a name="40224-25_para6"></a>I think that, when the Government were drawing up their regional planning policies, they did not realise how their earlier local government Bills would operate. What we are doing now relates to the local government Bill before last. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, was not responsible for it; he was not doing that job then. We are operating in the spirit that the Government wanted, and it has changed the relationship between districts and counties remarkably: it has improved it. We are involved in the process with every district council in Essex, and I suggest that we continue with what is happening in a sensible way in the best interests of the community in the county. The problem with much of the Bill is that local government has moved on in the two or three years since people started talking about planning policies.
<P>

<a name="40224-25_para7"></a>I am not content with what the Minister said. We will have to come back to the matter with some vigour at Third Reading. We need to set out clearly what is happening, and we do not want to undo the good that <P>

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "LOCAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS
<br>
(1) The local planning authority must prepare a plan for their area to be known as a local development plan.
<br>
(2) The plan must set out&#151;
<br>
(a) the authority's objectives in relation to the development and use of land in their area;

(3) The plan may also set out specific policies in relation to any part of the area of the authority.
<br>
(4) Regulations under this section may prescribe the form and content of the plan.
<br>
(5) In preparing a local development plan, the authority must have regard to&#151;
<br>
(a) current national policies;
<br>
(b) the RSS for the region in which the area of the authority is situated, if the area is outside Greater London;
<br>
(c) the spatial development strategy if the authority are a London borough or if any part of the authority's area adjoins Greater London;
<br>
(d) the RSS for any region which adjoins the area of the authority;
<br>
(e) the Wales Spatial Plan if any part of the authority's area adjoins Wales;
<br>
(f) the community strategy prepared by the authority;
<br>
(g) the community strategy for any other authority whose area comprises any part of the area of the local planning authority;
<br>
(h) the resources likely to be available for implementing the plan;
<br>
(i) such other matters as the Secretary of State prescribes.
<br>
(6) The authority must also&#151;
<br>
(a) carry out an appraisal of the sustainability of the plan;
<br>
(b) prepare a report of the findings of the appraisal.
<br>
(7) The community strategy is the strategy prepared by an authority under section 4 of the Local Government Act 2000 (c. 22) (strategies for promoting well-being).
<br>
(8) A plan is a local development plan only in so far as it&#151;

(a) is adopted by resolution of the local planning authority as a local development plan;
<br>
(b) is approved by the Secretary of State."

<a name="40224-25_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the Minister thought that I was going to be quiet all day. I have had a lovely day&#151;just think of the time that I spent listening carefully. It is my turn now.
<P>

<a name="40224-25_para11"></a>We moved a large number of amendments in Committee to try to clarify the bewildering number of documents that would come before councils and authorities in bringing together the planning development scheme. Those amendments did not find much favour with the Government, so I shall try to adopt a different tactic.
<P>

<a name="40224-25_para12"></a>We have a fair number of amendments here again, but their aim is to replace the cumbersome and confusing system of local development schemes, frameworks, documents, and development plan documents, with a <P>


<a name="column_209"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 209</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>single, simple, local development plan for each local authority. It replaces the proposed English system with a simpler Welsh system, proposed in Part 6 of this Bill, making necessary adjustments to reflect the different forms of spatial planning in the two countries.
<P>

<a name="40224-25_para13"></a>The Government have said that they want to achieve simplicity in planning and to "de-layer" the planning system. The Bill as it stands risks replacing the removal of structure plans with a whole range of previously unheard of documents, schemes, frameworks and plans.
<P>

<a name="40224-25_para14"></a>Announcing the publication of the Bill on 4 December 2002, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, described the changes as including new roles for both business and the community. He said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The lack of clarity in the system makes the outcome of decision-making unclear and it hurts business. Planning needs to reconnect with people. It is seen as remote and difficult to understand. It is seen as a system set out for the convenience of planners, not consumers".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-25_para15"></a>
I am sure that the noble Lord finds those words ringing in his mind, as he recollects them.
<P>

<a name="40224-25_para16"></a>The Government propose that the local development framework shall be set out in a local development plan scheme comprising local development documents, some of which are development plan documents; namely, the core strategy, area action plans and a proposals map. Other documents will be local development documents but not the development plan documents, namely supplementary planning documents. A statement of community involvement will be treated as a development plan document&#151;sometimes.
<P>

<a name="40224-25_para17"></a>These documents will require sustainability appraisal and may need strategic environmental assessment. The development plan will be the development plan documents plus the regional spatial strategy or spatial development strategy. Noble Lords are still with me on all this, I hope! Or, to put it in the Government's own acronyms in a document entitled Creating Local Development Frameworks, the LDF shall be set out in an LDS, comprising LDDs, some of which are DPDs, namely the CS, AAPs and a proposals map. Other documents will be LDDs but not DPDs, namely SPDs, and the SCI, although the SCI will be treated as a DPD&#151;sometimes. These documents will require SA and may need SEA. The DP will be the DPDs plus the RSS or SDS.
<P>

<a name="40224-25_para18"></a>There must be a better way of dealing with this serious aspect of planning and planning control.

<FONT SIZE=3>amendment is supported by the Town and Country Planning Association, which includes over 100 local planning authorities within its membership, and Friends of the Earth, which represents some of the many users of the planning system.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para2"></a>These amendments closely follow proposals by the Town and Country Planning Association, with some tweaking by us, and removal of the binding nature of inspectors' reports. The proposals for this complex local development framework scheme have been widely criticised by developers, who find them extremely hard to understand.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para3"></a>In Wales, where the Minister responsible for this subject in the Welsh Assembly is a professional planner, they have been too wise to contemplate such a proposal. The amendments, which are based entirely on the system proposed for Wales, would bring the benefits to England of the system that the Principality will enjoy.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said in Committee that,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-26_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40224-26_para7"></a>Regrettably, Part 2 of the Bill does not command all-party support&#151;I am sure the Minister understands that now. There is no enthusiasm for it in England. The response of local councils and planning professionals to the proposals is generally one of complete dismay at its complexity. An unamended and complex system of the kind proposed by the Government will militate against community involvement.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para8"></a>These amendments, though many, seek to bring clarity where there is confusion and approachability where there are acronyms. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, that is not bad in six minutes. I am tempted to play the noble Baroness at her own game and read out some of the 50-odd amendments, which are written in gobbledegook.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para9"></a>In Committee, I had a single sheet of A4 paper with a little diagram explaining how each document fed into the other&#151;some were statutory, some were not. I am quite happy to make it available if we can find it.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para10"></a>The noble Baroness can have a bit of fun with all her initials. Fancy sitting there all day, waiting for that point. She comes along, with a proposal from the Conservative Party, to impose on England what has been chosen by the elected Welsh Assembly, for Wales. Why does it fit for Wales? The first reason is unitary local government. I have seen no proposal for unitary English government from the Conservative Party. The noble Baroness did not imply that that was part and parcel of it. In other words, the system works in Wales because the governance arrangements and the local government structure are different there, and the devolved Welsh Assembly chose to use it.
<P>


<a name="column_211"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para11"></a>I do not know who the Minister is in charge of planning, but the noble Baroness seems to set great store by the fact that that person is a professional planner. Ministers who are experts are dangerous people. That is not an attack on that Minister. Ministers do not need to be experts&#151;that is quite dodgy.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para12"></a>The Welsh Assembly chose this system for Wales to fit its local government structure. We do not have the same structure in England, and it certainly would not work here.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para13"></a>I made a lengthy speech in Committee, and if I shared the notes with the noble Baroness, which I am not about to do, we would be here for the rest of the night. I described the new system, explaining it in words that could be easily understood, instead of all those acronyms she used. Using acronyms is very confusing to people outside. So far, during the Bill's proceedings, I have never once, on Second Reading or in Committee, fallen into the trap of using acronyms. The Civil Service loves acronyms&#151;there are catalogues of them&#151;but they do not explain things in the way that people need to understand them.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para14"></a>I do not want to go over this in great detail, because I would be repeating what I said about how each document is structured, how each document is formulated, how one document leads to another, how it is a portfolio system of a set of documents which makes them incredibly flexible, and how some of them will be subject to examination in public while others will not because they are subsidiary or daughter documents. I thought that I had explained that perfectly satisfactorily. Quite clearly, the map that I was using at the time is not available. What we need on Report with this type of operation is a screen at the end of the Chamber so that we can explain things more easily than is possible by reading out lists of acronyms.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para15"></a>We operate a plan-led system. We must have comprehensive up-to-date plans and we believe that the new system will enable that. The noble Lady may want to defend the present system, but I remind her that, 14 years after the system was put in place, 29 local planning authorities have yet to adopt an area-wide development plan for their districts. That is an absolute disgrace. Exacerbated by the time it takes to put plans in place, with a complicated process of multiple deposits, examinations and modification stages, the present system has still not stopped thousands of objections being considered at examination. For example, I am told that there were 20,000 objectors to the unitary development plan in Leeds.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para16"></a>We have set out a clear system for local planning that contains straightforward elements that link in a clear way. Each of those documents to which the noble Lady referred&#151;in a way that nobody would understand&#151;are clearly linked. One leads to another. The amendments would set out an alternative approach. We do not think that that approach would work because it is based on an entirely different system&#151;unitary development plans across Wales and a different role for the Welsh Assembly. The Welsh Assembly has decided that it wants <P>


<a name="column_212"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to go down a different route to our approach in England. I remind colleagues in this House that that is what devolution is all about.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para17"></a>I believe that we are introducing a system to deal with some of the problems, which I could set out in answering all of these amendments&#151;most if not all of which we dealt with in Committee. The system will be faster and more flexible, and more responsive to plan making in England. It will allow much more effective community involvement than we have today. The idea that because the system is faster means that it is less fair is not true. There will be more involvement and more opportunity for involvement. We are not imposing an English system on Wales and the Welsh system should not be imposed on England&#151;it could not be, because our local government structure is entirely different. Therefore, I hope that noble Lords will withdraw their amendments. Otherwise, I shall read them all out for the record.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-26_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, the Minister seems to has lost his usual cool. Somewhere along the line I must be striking a note which is causing him irritation. The irritation can only be because I am getting at his new system of development and planning control. The only reason that I am standing here getting at that system is because there are people out there beyond the Doors of this Parliament, who are completely perplexed by what is proposed and totally against it.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para18"></a>We do not dream up these things without having some evidence that people are concerned. There is plenty of evidence that those involved in the planning world are concerned about this plethora of planning documents. The Minister may say that they interweave with each other. However, I can knit and drop a stitch, but I cannot knit a jersey. No matter how many loops there are leading things one into another, somewhere along the line there will be a tumble and the system will not work. The system is complex and difficult. It may not be as difficult and complex as it sounds, but it sounds manic. That is what is generally considered.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para19"></a>As I said in Committee, we know that the UDP system was not absolutely brilliant. It had its flaws, one of which was the time-scale. The Minister told me that 29 area wide plans have not been done and I have no reason to doubt that, but why have the authorities been allowed to get away with that? My local authority would not have been allowed to get away with not producing a UDP and getting it on the stocks in a timely fashion; the elected members would not have allowed that. It says something about the people involved in those areas that that has been allowed to happen. However, the system is simple. The Welsh, whether or not they have a different unitary government, have a simpler system. The UDP system has worked within the rationale of the Government and the local government of the present day, and we believe that it is perfectly possible to translate it back, although the Government are hell-bent on everything being regional.

<a name="40224-26_para20"></a>I said what I said about acronyms slightly tongue in cheek&#151;it is always desperately worrying when one has to explain a joke. However, since the Minister has risen to the bait a little, I hope that the issue has been raised. The Minister is right in saying that he has never used an acronym in discussing this matter, but he is going to be alone. Acronyms will come into being whatever happens, and they will all be received with the usual incomprehension by people reading papers and trying to draw conclusions about what it is all about.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para21"></a>The Government have set up a system to fail, as it has far too many tracks down it. The idea that it will engage the public and give them a real feeling of being involved is probably quite wide of the mark. I know that the Minister does not like all my amendments, and I dread the thought that he may go through them all one by one. What a threat at this time of night!

<A NAME="40224-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I want to take this matter seriously. I could have gone through the amendments, but I realised that that was not the intention behind them. I realise that the noble Baroness was having some fun at what she thought was my expense. However, I want to make her an offer. Since only the Front Benches are present, why do not my four noble colleagues accept the invitation to come into the ODPM and listen to the civil servants who put the legislation together explain how all the documents fit together? They will do so using modern English, and show how the thing will gel before Third Reading.
<P>

<a name="40224-26_para22"></a>If there is confusion, and the Front Benches accept the offer that I have made to take them through it, they will see why the confusion outside is totally unnecessary and unfounded. There is always confusion with a Bill going through Parliament; it has been in this House and the other House a long time and has changed substantially because of all the changes that we have made. I know that I am taking too long&#151;I am only intervening. However, I wanted to make that offer. Noble Lords do not have to accept it now, but I strongly advise them to do so&#151;otherwise, maybe at Third Reading if we return to the matter, I shall have some fun at the expense of the noble Baroness. My offer is meant genuinely, because I take what she says as genuine. It is a question of linking the documents with the new terminology and explaining the matter easily over a cup of tea, in less than an hour. The noble Baroness will come away thinking, "Ah, I have something here after all".

This is precisely why we felt that it was important to table the amendment that my noble friend Lady Maddock moved about the "Rough Guide" to the legislation, as it were.

<A NAME="40224-27_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, is correct. It is very kind of the Minister to invite us to tea, and I should like to think about that offer rather than simply turn it down. However, it might be helpful on the basis of looking at a draft of the guide that the noble Baroness has put into her amendment. I believe that we can do something about this matter. It is perfectly possible to go on having a humorous discussion across the Benches, but I believe that matter to be really serious. If there is a draft of the guide or another way of dealing with this, perhaps we should think about it before Third Reading&#151;in case we decide to come back to it with perhaps fewer amendments, and so that I do not run the risk of the Minister spending the whole of Third Reading reading them back to me. I am grateful for his reply. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

As we have draft regulations which will not be amendable, I thought that this might be the opportunity to understand whether the Government think they have the right approach in the regulations, or whether the words I have used in this amendment need, to use the noble Lord's word, to be "finessed". I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I congratulate the noble Baroness on the subtlety of her amendment. However, our view really has not changed since the earlier stage of the Bill. The amendment seeks to outline what the core should include. That would mean that a core strategy with specific contents would be required of all local planning authorities until such time as Parliament agreed otherwise. Our view remains the same. It is neither necessary nor sensible for the core strategy to be on the face of the Bill. We have argued this before, but I shall make the point again. Regulations will require every local planning authority to have a core strategy and will set out what it should include, at Regulation 14(1).
<P>

<a name="40224-27_para11"></a>Our view is that primary legislation is too rigid and difficult to change. We certainly do not have many opportunities for planning Bills to make perhaps necessary changes. We think that it is better to set out the broad framework describing local development documents in the legislation and then to leave it to regulations and policy statements to flesh out the detail of what those are and what they contain. We believe that that gives the planning system the robustness and flexibility it requires. It also provides local planning authorities with flexibility in creating local development documents as regulations can be updated in the light of good practice. I know that the noble Baroness is very keen to ensure that local good practice is used, and that is certainly our intent in ensuring that regulations are up to date in their import and impact.
<P>

<a name="40224-27_para12"></a>We have already received quite a lot of responses to the draft regulations. The question is raised in the noble Baroness's mind as to whether they are absolutely correct. Does the noble Baroness think that her wording&#151;it uses the formulation currently contained in the regulations&#151;is right? How would she change it to ensure that it kept abreast of developments and the way in which the planning framework is inclined to change over time? That is the difficulty which the noble Baroness creates for us and for herself in her approach to this part of the legislation.
<P>

<a name="40224-27_para13"></a>Having heard my reply, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40224-27_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I find it difficult to envisage such a change in circumstances that the words used in the amendment&#151;I filched them from Government&#151;will become out of date.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40224-27_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 64 is a partner amendment to Amendment No. 30 which I moved earlier. I move this amendment to ascertain whether the Government have anything further to put on the record with regard to this part of the Bill. The amendment applies to the local development document rather than the regional spatial strategy. It picks up the same part of the 1991 Act which refers to local plans. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-27_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I recall Amendment No. 30. I can give almost the same reply. In the context of the local planning authority these are important considerations. No one gainsays that. But they are not the only ones. I made that point earlier. We do not think it right to single out particular policy considerations on the face of the Bill as it would cut across the integrated and holistic approach of the new system.
<P>

<a name="40224-27_para17"></a>Local planning authorities must consider those issues&#151;the conservation of the natural beauty and amenity of the land; the conservation of natural resources; the improvement of the physical environment; and certainly the management of traffic&#151;alongside a much wider range of matters as is already set out in planning policy statement 12, together with further policy requirements as set out in Annex A on page 37.
<P>

<a name="40224-27_para18"></a>A further safeguard is the requirement for a sound evidence base and the requirements for sustainability assessment and strategic environmental assessment, again as set out in the paragraphs 4.2.1 and 4.3.1 of planning policy statement 12.
<P>

<a name="40224-27_para19"></a>Spatial planning goes beyond traditional land use planning to bring together and integrate policies for the development and use of land with other policies which influence the nature of places and how they develop. Global and national policies may change over time and, therefore, we should not prescribe for these in legislation, as many will emerge as a matter of good practice.
<P>

<a name="40224-27_para20"></a>That goes a little further than what I intended to say. In other words, these are very important considerations but they are not the only ones. For that reason, it would be wrong to put them on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-28_para0"></a><P>

<a name="40224-28_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment seeks to amend Clause 18, which deals with the statement of community involvement. It seeks to extend the persons who are the subject or the object&#151;I am not sure which&#151;of the activity under Clause 18(2). That subsection provides that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The statement of community involvement is a statement of the authority's policy as to the involvement in the exercise of the authority's functions . . .  of persons who appear to the authority to have an interest in matters relating to development in their area".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-28_para2"></a>
My amendment seeks to add the words "and use of land".
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para3"></a>The Minister very helpfully sent out a compendium letter, if I may describe it as that, which picked up a number of points made in Committee. One of those concerned the definition of "development" and the definition of "use". He pointed out the differences between those and said that planning permission is required for the carrying out of a development as defined. References in the Bill to development alone refer to development and control matters. References in the Bill to the development and use of land refer not only to development in the development control sense but also to the ongoing use of land where there is not necessarily any change or activity envisaged in respect of it.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para4"></a>I tabled the amendment before receiving the letter. Nevertheless, I was very grateful to receive the letter as it seems to me to spell out exactly what I was concerned about in tabling the amendment&#151;that is, that the statement of community involvement should be wide enough to include those who are interested in the ongoing use of land where there is not necessarily any change or activity envisaged. It must be right to ask whether the Government believe that things are right now. Do they want change or no change? If Clause 18(2) is confined only to those who have an interest in matters relating to development control, that seems to me to be too narrow. I was glad to have the relevant definition. It was helpful to be given that and the distinctions between the terms. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40224-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, it would be ridiculous for me to read out my notes bearing in mind that the noble Baroness tabled the amendment before she received the letter, as she said. The letter is quite lengthy.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para5"></a>We want the Bill to be clear that both tiers of plans should include policies for ongoing use as well as development. We do not think that there are any grounds for concern that the wording of the Bill will in any way exclude parties with an interest in conservation or those opposing development for that matter.

<a name="40224-28_para6"></a>As the letter was received after the amendment was tabled, I am happy in the time available between now and Third Reading to do a triple check on the use of the words in this part of the Bill.

<A NAME="40224-28_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful for that. I do not think that it would involve any loss of face at all on the part of the Government, particularly as they have three-quarters raised the matter, to make it wholly clear on the face of the Bill that the involvement is as extensive as we all believe that it should be.

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 10, line 21, at end insert "including councillors"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-28_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40224-28_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the amendment adds the role of local councillors to the matters addressed by statements of community involvement. That might seem odd, as it is the authority's policy on the statement of community involvement which is being put forward. Since the introduction of executive arrangements in councils, decision making is concentrated mainly in the hands of a small number of executive members. Other councillors may well be on the authority's planning committee, but the majority of councillors will have no decision-making powers beyond the small number of matters reserved for full council meetings.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para10"></a>The representational role of those back-bench councillors becomes more important as a result and one of the areas in which the public most expects representation is on planning matters. The role of ward councillors is not always clear at the moment and it certainly needs to be enhanced. The amendment would ensure that the role of councillors in community involvement in planning decisions is set out and, consequently, will improve the representations that they will make. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, this issue was raised in Committee and we set out our firm commitment to community involvement. I have repeated that throughout the process. Today we have published our policy paper on the objectives for community involvement in planning, copies of which have been made available to the Front Benches and placed in the Library of the House. I hope I am not going to be contradicted on that. It is good bedtime reading. It is an important statement of the vision and I hope will be a useful description of many of the things we are doing to promote community involvement&#151;not just in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para11"></a>Amendment No. 68 requires local planning authorities to consult councillors. They have a vital role in leading the process of community involvement. That is part of their role as democratically elected representatives They are spokespersons for their areas and their role should be clear. I encourage councillors to take the fullest part in promoting and facilitating the process and the community involvement paper makes that clear. But what is the point of the amendment? The councillors are members of the local authority. They will, <P>


<a name="column_219"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 219</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in effect, be responsible for their own statements of community involvement. The amendment seems to imply that councillors will be divorced from the process. If that is happening there are real problems in the local authority concerned.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para12"></a>I have never been a councillor, but you need to know the difference between governance and management. The councillor's job is not to manage the authority, but to govern it. The manager's job is not to govern it&#151;that is the councillor's job. The councillors need to know where the dividing line is. There are real problems in authorities if we have reached the position where councillors who own the decisions of the authority do not feel part of it. They will all have different roles, including scrutiny, planning and so on, but they are all members of that authority.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para13"></a>If the amendment is meant to refer to councillors in other authorities&#151;which could be the case&#151;that is covered by the arrangements that the local planning authority must make to consult other local planning authorities on its local development document. So we cannot see a problem for the amendment to tackle. If the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, is aware of any serious problems, I will be grateful if she will let the department have her notes about them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-28_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down&#151;I am dredging my memory&#151;I was going to ask if that meant that the issue would be a key decision that would have to be reported as part of the forward plan. I am thinking of practising councillors; but it cannot be a key decision in this context as it does not lend itself to that. It would be helpful for us to understand, in the context of the mechanisms now in place&#151;with reference to the relevant local government Act&#151;the basis upon which the matter should be referred to all councillors.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-28_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, there were several reasons for raising this matter. One was that, on the whole, I believe that councils are becoming more and more divorced from governance. I do not say "management"; I do not really know why the Minister raised the issue of governance and management because that is not germane to the amendment. However, under the last licensing Bill, councillors were excluded from making representations. Members are excluded from making any decisions that have anything to do with any planning anywhere within their wards or areas. That cannot be right because there must be policy areas where they are absolutely enabled to take part.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para14"></a>I believe that the two examples I have quoted make all the more relevant the reason for wanting to see councillors referred to on the face of the Bill as part of the group who are to be consulted formally or included in the discussions. A wider audience would be discussing the statement of community involvement and, by rights, they should have a role in that. That was the purpose of the amendment. I do not believe that it required too much jubilation. I beg leave to withdraw it.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40224-28_para17"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment requires enterprise zone authorities, urban development corporations, housing action trusts and English Partnerships to prepare statements of community involvement where they exercise development control powers. We touched on this matter in Committee but did not really get anywhere with it. All those bodies can be empowered to determine planning applications.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para18"></a>Local planning authorities will be obliged to prepare statements explaining how they will involve persons interested in development in their area in preparing local development plans and in making development control decisions. While urban development corporations and similar bodies will not be responsible for development plans, they may have powers to grant or refuse planning permission.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para19"></a>Local authorities, which are democratically accountable, are required to produce statements of community involvement. That is on top of their existing statutory responsibilities to consult on and publicise planning applications and to make decisions in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Ministers clearly consider that this additional statement is required.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para20"></a>The Minister's reply&#151;that of the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, no less&#151;to this amendment in Committee was unfortunately unconvincing, again. He said that those bodies are subject to the obligation to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"determine the application in accordance with the development plan drawn up by the relevant local authority unless there were other material considerations".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-28_para21"></a>
That is true, and so are local authorities. He said that these bodies are subject to,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-28_para22"></a>
That is true, and so are local authorities. The Minister said that those bodies must involve the community in decision-making. That is also true, and so must local authorities.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para23"></a>The Government have just produced a document, Community Involvement in Planning: the Government's Objectives. Its front page says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Planning shapes the places where people live and work. So it is right that people should be enabled and empowered to take an active part in the process. Strengthening community involvement is a key part of the Government's planning reforms".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-28_para24"></a>
But nowhere in its 24 pages does the document mention enterprise zone authorities, urban development corporations, housing action trusts or English Partnerships. Community involvement is not only about local authorities and planning; it must be about these other bodies and planning decisions. We do not <P>


<a name="column_221"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 221</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>see how a statutory statement, subject to independent examination, is required for local councils but is not necessary for other bodies exercising the same powers.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para25"></a>In Committee, the Minister made a complaint that the amendment did not work technically. Those advising our side on these matters do not agree. Clause 18 will apply the obligations of independent examination and powers of withdrawal and adoption to these other bodies' statements of community involvement. Contrary to the suggestion in Committee, an urban development corporation's statement of community involvement will not be a local development document, as under Clause 17 that is only the local planning authority statement of community involvement. A tidying-up amendment may be needed to the interpretation section, Clause 37, to extend the definition of "local planning authority" for the purposes of independent examination, withdrawal and adoption, that is, Clauses 20, 22 and 23, to these bodies. That could be tabled for Third Reading. If Ministers have other consequential technical amendments, they can bring them forward later.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para26"></a>The Government envisage that we shall see a revived role for urban development corporations and English Partnership in planning major growth areas in this country. Those schemes will require effective public involvement to attain credibility. The need for statements of community involvement apply with as much, if not greater, force to those bodies as to local councils. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40224-28_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, for the avoidance of doubt, the normal procedures relating to development control will apply to the urban development corporations and to English Partnerships, the statutory bodies. So in terms of development control, that is planning applications for a particular site or development, the normal procedures of consultation apply.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para27"></a>I have always made it absolutely clear that in setting up delivery vehicles for the growth areas and for some of the housing renewal pathfinder areas&#151;at the moment there are no delivery vehicles of a statutory nature, but there may be&#151;it is not our intention to shortcut the consultation process. It is a different kind of management tool. They have a defined life. From memory, I think that we said 10 years for the two that we are consulting about in Milton Keynes and south Midlands at the present time. There are two in London so far but there will not be very many. They are a tool for getting action, but not for snuffing out people's opportunity to put their objections in and to have their five penn'orth. So far as development controls are concerned, the normal procedures would apply. I am more than happy to revisit this issue for Third Reading.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para28"></a>It is important and completely different from what we have discussed in the rest of the day. Coming to it at this late hour I do not intend to delay the House but there are just a few points I shall put on the record.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para29"></a>We discussed this issue in Committee. I described in some detail the consultations that urban development corporations and others would need to undertake, <P>


<a name="column_222"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column 222</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which mean that it is unnecessary to apply the statement of community involvement processes to them. I was faced with an acronym and I refused to use it. It was not spelled out for me.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para30"></a>The amendment would require the enterprise zone authority, urban development corporation, housing action trust or the urban regeneration agency to prepare the statement of community involvement where it has the power to exercise any function. These functions are preparing the local development documents. The bodies in question can be given powers to determine planning applications. They have to determine the application in accordance with the development plan drawn up by the relevant local authority, unless the material considerations indicate otherwise. So the framework within which the delivery vehicle operates would have been subject to the involvement processes that we have already discussed.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para31"></a>The statement of community involvement is an integral part of the process for preparing the local development documents and we think that it would be problematic to import it wholesale into the structures and ways of working of other bodies. The delivery vehicles are not all the same; they are fit for purpose for the area. In the Milton Keynes and south Midlands area one is an ordinary, standard urban development corporation&#151;that is the west Northampton one. The one for Milton Keynes is an English Partnerships-led statutory authority. It is slightly different. It is not English Partnerships but they are using different powers of the law that already apply. We think it would be problematic to import this into different structures and ways of working. But they are still required to go through the consultation process.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para32"></a>The nature of the beast, the body, when we put these agencies together is to ensure that the local authorities are represented; that they are not being snuffed out; that there will be places on the board and independent involvement. When the chair and chief executive are appointed, it would be wise indeed to ensure that they take the body of public opinion along with them as they perform their role as part of the big picture for the growth area, which it is a Minister's duty to put forward and explain.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para33"></a>We would expect the local development documents to take due account of the urban development corporation's proposals for an area and would expect close consultation between the local planning authority and the urban development corporation. The statement of community involvement processes will apply.
<P>

<a name="40224-28_para34"></a>I have one final point: as a generalisation, the urban development corporations which are being set up are borrowing planning powers where the planning powers are coming over to them, only for the strategic sites in a locality. They are not taking all the planning powers of all the local authority area. It will apply only to the strategic development sites. Until planning permission is given&#151;there may be developments under way&#151;the planning would then revert back because it is a borrowing of the powers.

<a name="40224-28_para35"></a>Unlike former UDCs, or many of them, which have taken wholesale all the planning powers including modification to domestic dwellings, this will be for the strategic development sites for generating growth. This is a slightly different animal. I am happy to give this matter more thought so that on Third Reading we can give further clarification if necessary. It may be that we can put together a letter at an early stage between now and then to explain in greater detail why&#151;there will be good reason&#151;for example, they are not referred to in the document we have published today.

[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Viscount Allenby of Megiddo) in the Chair.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-29_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Viscount Allenby of Megiddo): </B>  Before we commence business, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, wishes to speak.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-29_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   Simply for clarification, I had given notice to the Minister's office that I would ask him today whether there had been any progress in its investigations regarding the pressure that we felt had been put on some suppliers in giving us advice. I have had a very satisfactory answer from the Minister, which is that the Committee will get the full answer next Monday. I have not had any response, but I am quite content, as I am sure the Committee will be, to leave the matter until next Monday.
<P>

<a name="40224-29_para9"></a>I wish to raise another point, which the Minister may feel he is not in a position to answer today, in which case he can do so on Monday, if he so wishes. During the eighth Committee sitting, on 12 February, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, made a statement&#151;that is fine. However, we were concerned that on the following Saturday a newspaper reported Sir John Mogg, the chairman of Ofgem, as saying that he heard those statements with regret, and that they were very misguided. We thought that that was quite a strong word to use about something that the Government were doing. Do the Government have any comments on that, or would they prefer to comment later, when they have looked into the matter themselves?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   No doubt Ministers will respond to my noble friend's first point, but I wish to comment on the second one. I have had a good deal to do with regulators over the years and was the Minister who published the White Paper that led to the creation of Oftel, the first of the new-style regulators. I cannot remember an occasion since then when there has been quite such an open, blatant disagreement between a regulator and a department of state. My noble friend said that Ofgem used fairly strong language, which it is. Sir John Mogg said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"To amend the Energy Bill in this way is unnecessary and misguided".

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-29_para11"></a>No doubt we will come to the matter when we debate the amendment, which I understand is to be moved on Report, to fulfil the undertaking given to the Grand Committee on 12 February about new subsidies for the transmission of offshore electricity. I do not know whether Ministers wish to comment on a row that has been very public and, I should have thought, very damaging to them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-29_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  The row may have been very public, but until I came into the Room I was not aware of it. Clearly, I need to consult my officials and those in the DTI to see quite what Sir John felt was out of order. We have indicated which amendments we propose to bring back, which I cannot think Sir John would have found unhelpful, but we shall see what he was talking about. I certainly do not think that we are in the midst of a major row between Ministers and the chair of Ofgem. I shall leave the matter until Monday, as the noble Baroness suggests, and come back with a full account to the Committee.

<P>

<a name="40224-29_para14"></a>Clause 106 agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding </B>   moved Amendment No. 116:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 106, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-29_para15"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "PRE-PAYMENT METERS
<br>
 The Authority shall, within 6 months after the passing of this Act, review the rules about the use of pre-payment meters in order, among other matters, to determine whether it would be desirable to allow suppliers to offer concessionary energy packages to the users of such pre-payment meters."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40224-29_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: With the amendment, we are discussing Amendment No. 132C. Perhaps I should say at the outset that my remarks will be primarily addressed to Amendment No. 132C, as we believe that it would more properly reflect the desires of those who wish to see changes in relation to pre-payment meters than Amendment No. 116. I hope that that will meet with the approval of the Committee.
<P>

<a name="40224-29_para17"></a>Amendment No. 132C proposes to amend the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989 to allow the current restriction on the use of pre-payment meters to be relaxed or even removed where that would be in the consumer's interest and more consistent with the Government's overall social and environmental objectives for the energy sector. At the moment, it is not open to a supplier to extend to those who have pre-payment meters any of the special deals or arrangements that can be made in favour of normal gas and electricity consumers.
<P>

<a name="40224-29_para18"></a>The ability of energy suppliers to provide a wider range of service through modern pre-payment meters is hindered by current statutory restrictions which prevent arrangements that would be beneficial to customers from being introduced. That stems from the Utilities Act 2000, which amended both gas and electricity legislation so that each industry is now permitted to use a pre-payment meter only to recover its own supply charges.
<P>


<a name="column_GC57"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC57</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-29_para19"></a>At the time, that was welcomed by the consumer bodies but now, nearly four years later, it is widely recognised as too sweeping to work effectively in customers' interests. In particular, it prevents the provision of combined energy service and supply packages to those customers who have pre-payment meters. Surely it is within the experience of noble Lords throughout the Committee that, on the whole, pre-payment meters are used by those of limited resources, sometimes at their own choice and sometimes because that is felt to be the best way to ensure that the customer will actually pay for the gas or electricity that he uses.
<P>

<a name="40224-29_para20"></a>There are two main reasons for looking for a change. Research has shown that a great many electricity pre-payment meter users are not in debt and not in fuel poverty but choose that method of payment for their convenience and for ease of budgeting. One can understand that. For people whose lives are mainly based round the use of cash, a pre-payment meter is one way of making sure that they will not go into debt for the supply of gas or electricity. Therefore, people who like to budget in cash are especially likely to benefit from energy packages.
<P>

<a name="40224-29_para21"></a>The second reason is that, although fuel-poor consumers may in general be expected to qualify for free energy-efficiency improvement under the Warm Front or priority EEC schemes, either some such customers on pre-payment meters may fall outside the qualifying criteria or the energy package may not fall within the scheme. Again, it may well be in the customer's interest to allow payment for such services through the meter.
<P>

<a name="40224-29_para22"></a>The current restrictions could therefore distort consumer choice and prevent the energy services market reaching its full potential. I would regard that as a missed opportunity, particularly given the forthcoming pilot agreed by the energy services working group, led by the Minister's department, to suspend the 28-day rule in relation to combined energy services offered under domestic supply contracts.
<P>

<a name="40224-29_para23"></a>There may well be other broadenings of the use of pre-payment meters that would be in the consumer's interest. For example, when customers with pre-payment debt move to new premises they often ask the industry to put the existing debt on the new meter. In such cases the industry is currently required to refuse the request and to seek payment by other means. I can well understand that this may be confusing and inconvenient for the customer. Consideration should therefore be given to whether, when a customer requests the transfer of a debt, this should be allowed.
<P>

<a name="40224-29_para24"></a>I started from the proposition that it is wrong in principle that innovation should be forbidden by law, without any possibility of exception, where that would be in the consumer's interest. A more positive framework would be consistent with the Government's social and environmental objectives for the energy sector. To repeal the restrictions outright is one solution. However, Amendment No. 132C adopts a more politically acceptable approach&#151;that is, a <P>


<a name="column_GC58"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC58</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>simple regulation-making power for Ofgem, with the Secretary of State's consent, to relax or remove the constraint, with the detail to be settled after consultation. This could be achieved by adding the words in the amendment to the end of paragraph 12(2) of Schedule 7 to the Electricity Act. That is one way of doing it.
<P>

<a name="40224-29_para25"></a>I have been given to understand that Ministers may be sympathetic to an amendment along these lines. I say straightaway that the amendment is not drafted in a form which the Minister could accept today. However, it would be extremely helpful if the Minister who is to respond could give an indication of whether such a relaxation of the restrictions currently imposed on those who have pre-payment could be lifted. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I support the amendment so clearly moved by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding. It seems wrong that those on pre-payment meters should be prevented by law, as matters now stand, from benefiting from the various energy packages which, in other legislation, have been stimulated by government in order to achieve government objectives. Bearing in mind the wide range of people who use pre-payment meters for various reasons, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, pointed out, this should be put right and the noble Lord has tabled an amendment for so doing. It may or may not have the correct wording, but I fully endorse the principle behind it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-30_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My name is also on the amendment. It is totally unnecessary for me to add anything to the clarity with which my noble friend Lord Jenkin moved the amendment and the extra words added by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   As I understand the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, he will withdraw Amendment No. 116 in favour of Amendment No. 132C, which gives the power to propose, consult and in due course regulate on an extension of the range of debt that can be collected from a pre-payment meter. At the moment there is a little flexibility in that any proposed regulations will be subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40224-30_para0"></a>Clearly there are a number of inflexibilities in the present system which the amendment may well address, and there is no particularly good reason for maintaining the block on it. The noble Lord is right to say that we have considerable sympathy with what he is trying to achieve. Whether this is the best way in which to achieve it I will leave to the Committee to explore between now and subsequent stages. However, it is the Government's intention to bring forward an amendment to deliver what all noble Lords who have spoken are seeking to achieve with Amendment No. 132C.

<A NAME="40224-30_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 116A:
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 106, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-30_para2"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "LICENCE MODIFICATIONS RELATING TO THE RENEWABLES OBLIGATION
<br>
After section 15A (licence modifications relating to new electricity trading arrangements) of the 1989 Act insert&#151;
<br>
"15B LICENCE MODIFICATIONS RELATING TO THE RENEWABLES OBLIGATION
<br>
(1) The Secretary of State may, in accordance with this section, modify the conditions of licences of the type mentioned in subsection (1)(d) of section 6 for the purpose of introducing or implementing arrangements for the prevention of certain breaches of the renewables obligation by the licence holders.
<br>
(2) Before making modifications under this section, the Secretary of State shall consult the holder of any licence being modified and such other persons as he deems appropriate.
<br>
(3) Any consultation undertaken by the Secretary of State before the commencement of this section shall be effective, for the purposes of subsection (1), as if undertaken after that commencement.
<br>
(4) Where the standard conditions of licences are modified under subsection (1), the Secretary of State shall make the same modifications of the standard conditions for the purposes of their incorporation in licences of that type granted after that time.
<br>
(5) The Secretary of State shall publish any modifications&#151;
<br>
(a) in writing to all holders or applicants for licences who may be affected by such modifications, and
<br>
(b) by publishing the modifications in at least two national daily newspapers and any appropriate trade journal or journals.
<br>
(6) The power of the Secretary of State under this section may not be exercised after the end of the period of two years beginning with the passing of the Energy Act 2004.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40224-30_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 116A would enable arrangements to be established that will prevent certain kinds of breach of the renewables obligation by suppliers of electricity. The precise form of the arrangements to be established is to be determined in accordance with the power provided for by the amendment. Under this provision, the Secretary of State is given the power to amend the standard licence conditions of suppliers who have the obligation to supply a proportion of renewable energy and whose compliance with the obligation is evidenced either by the production to the authority of renewables obligation certificates, known as ROCs, or by a payment into the buy-out fund.
<P>

<a name="40224-30_para4"></a>The intent behind the amendment is to give the Secretary of State power to introduce a licence condition obliging suppliers to be signatories to a renewables obligations code. It is intended that the code would, in accordance with the terms of the licence condition, be designated by the Secretary of State. The code would contain conditions as to its amendment which are in similar terms to the conditions for the amendment of the balancing and settlement code: that is, specified parties may propose amendments provided those amendments satisfy or can be claimed <P>


<a name="column_GC60"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC60</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to satisfy the amendment criteria contained in the licence and the code; the proposal is examined in accordance with the same criteria and by means of a pre-determined procedure and, following a final review by the governing panel, a recommendation to amend or not to amend is made to the authority; and the authority approves or rejects the panel's proposal on the basis of the same criteria used by the proposer and the panel.
<P>

<a name="40224-30_para5"></a>Currently, the Secretary of State has no specific powers to make the proposed licence amendments. Therefore, a power is required to be introduced if a licence amendment for the specified purposes is to be made. The power given by the amendment is similar to the power granted to the Secretary of State to enable NETA provisions to be brought into effect. The scope of any licence obligation or code that may be developed under the amendment should be limited only to whatever is strictly necessary to enable the authority to carry out its administrative duties with the greatest efficiency. It should not be used to introduce policy issues, nor should it be within the power of the authority to introduce licence conditions that may directly or indirectly affect competition between suppliers.
<P>

<a name="40224-30_para6"></a>In modifying suppliers' licences in this manner, the Secretary of State would be acting within the scope of his functions and the stated objectives of the Government as regards renewable sources under Clause 32, which permits the Secretary of State to impose renewables obligation on suppliers.
<P>

<a name="40224-30_para7"></a>My commentary on the amendments is as follows. The amendment has been drafted as an amendment to the Electricity Act 1989, as amended by the Utilities Act 2000, in order to avoid the need to make further consequential amendments. Subsection (1) in Amendment No. 116A introduces the power to make an amendment to licence conditions to achieve the intended aim. Subsection (2) requires the Secretary of State to consult as he deems fit. Subsection (3) allows the Secretary of State to consult before the amendment comes into effect with the aim of achieving the intended aim as soon as practically possible. Subsection (4) provides that new licences shall contain the amended licence condition. Subsection (5) provides for the publication of the amended licence conditions.
<P>

<a name="40224-30_para8"></a>Members of the Committee will notice that the method of publication is the same as that for which I have been asking in the case of other licence variation provisions and not that for which the Government have been asking, which is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in any manner the Secretary of State considers appropriate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-30_para9"></a>
Subsection (6) allows the amendment to be made at any time up to a final date of two years after the Energy Act 2004 comes into force.
<P>

<a name="40224-30_para10"></a>I hope that the Government will accept this as a constructive amendment designed to facilitate and improve the regulatory licensing regime. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   We appreciate the constructive approach taken by the noble Baroness <P>


<a name="column_GC61"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC61</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the Opposition to this area. She will recognise that, in response to that constructive approach, we said that we would take on board several of the points made during our last Committee sitting about the renewables obligation and securing the buy-out fund, and that we would bring forward amendments on Report to incorporate the fresh position. However, we do not believe that Amendment No. 116A helps the situation. I shall now identify the reasons why.
<P>

<a name="40224-30_para11"></a>As the noble Baroness said, the amendment would enable the Secretary of State to make changes to the renewables obligation by means of modifying the licence conditions. As Members of the Committee will be aware, at present any changes require the affirmative resolution of both Houses. Given the importance of the renewables obligation, the Government cannot accept the reduction of parliamentary scrutiny that this would involve.
<P>

<a name="40224-30_para12"></a>In addition, the amendment does not make it clear which breaches of the renewables obligation are intended to be covered by licence modifications and which would still require legislation. It is clearly essential that any changes impacting significantly on the obligation&#151;thus materially affecting the prospects of achieving the Government's aim of increasing the contribution of renewables&#151;should receive proper parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="40224-30_para13"></a>The Committee will be aware that the renewables obligation is a complex instrument with a number of interacting provisions. What appears at face value to be a minor or technical change may have far-reaching consequences. We need to assess those consequences before taking precipitate action, and the present system enables us to undertake that full and proper assessment.
<P>

<a name="40224-30_para14"></a>I understand the desire on the part of the Committee and, in particular the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, in pressing her amendment, for a more flexible mechanism to make changes. However, we do not believe that that is the right way to achieve it. We are all aware that the shortfall in the renewables obligation as a result of the failure of TXU (UK) Ltd required changes to be made to the obligation in respect of late payments, and those changes are being progressed quickly.
<P>

<a name="40224-30_para15"></a>I am not sure that use of the licence conditions route would save much time in the circumstances. The Committee will recognise that action has been taken since last October and changes in that regard are almost complete. I cannot see, therefore, how effective action could have been achieved any faster against the background of noting how important it is for a full assessment&#151;through Parliament in its proper role of scrutiny&#151;of the implications for the renewables obligation.
<P>

<a name="40224-30_para16"></a>I want to reassure the noble Baroness that we take very seriously issues concerning the renewables obligation. We have already undertaken to move some way towards meeting certain of the issues defined by the Opposition, but we do not think that the amendment is acceptable. On that basis, while <P>


<a name="column_GC62"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>indicating our support for the proposals set out in the earlier amendments, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-31_spnew0"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   Will the Minister clarify one point? He said that the present renewables trading arrangements would require a positive message from both Houses of Parliament, but Clause 106 states that if the Secretary of State considers it necessary or expedient to change something, he may do so. That wording appears similar to that of the amendment. Is the Secretary of State allowed to modify licence conditions in such a manner as he considers appropriate&#151;as provided in subsection (5)&#151;on his own say-so, or does that also require the positive procedure?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   As I said, the amendment envisages significant changes to what we all recognise is a complex and sensitive mechanism. We are talking about a market which involves substantial interests and to which substantial resources are devoted. In our view, that will require both a proper basis for consideration and adequate parliamentary scrutiny. That is the case as the Bill stands. The amendment would detract from that.
<P>

<a name="40224-31_para0"></a>I assure the noble Duke that changes to the renewables obligation require affirmative resolutions of both Houses. Other than by introducing new primary legislation, we cannot be more assertive about parliamentary scrutiny than that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-31_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Can the Minister give other examples of market-sensitive matters involving a lot of money for commercial organisations which are decided by order laid before Parliament, albeit by affirmative resolution?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I have no comparable reference before me. But the noble Baronesses will recognise that because of the significance of this market&#151;there was the one regrettable failure with regard to TXU (UK) Limited&#151;it has all along been envisaged that changes that affect it and have such a dramatic impact on significant interests should require that level of parliamentary scrutiny by affirmative order. That is what we envisage. I recognise the importance of flexibility; that is why, as I said, we made some positive responses to opposition amendments during our previous sitting. I am concerned that, in such a significant incident, we would need to protect proper parliamentary scrutiny. That is why I reject the amendment and defend the Bill's provisions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-31_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Perhaps I may follow on from what my noble friend Lady Carnegy said. In Committee, we have been trying to clarify the use of words such as "substantial", "significant", "proper" and "appropriate", and at what time and level decisions are made. My noble friend makes a good point.
<P>

<a name="40224-31_para1"></a>I accept that the matter falls under the affirmative rather than negative resolution procedure, which is a blessing, and that the amendment may not be the right <P>


<a name="column_GC63"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC63</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one in the right place. I further accept what the Minister said about accepting some of our arguments during the previous sitting, for which we are grateful. However, I take my noble friend's point. I have raised the issue during the passage of many Bills.
<P>

<a name="40224-31_para2"></a>The Minister partially answered my noble friend's question but many of us would much rather things were written into a Bill than into an order. Even if an order is introduced under the affirmative procedure, all we can do is talk about it; ultimately, the Government of the day get their way. So it is a flag-flying exercise. If, however, the provision is in the Bill, it must be adhered to. Perhaps the Minister will enlarge a little in response to both of our queries.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-31_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I am grateful for the noble Baroness's contribution but I emphasise that the present arrangements in an area that we all recognise to be of great importance and sensitivity enable us to address a substantial difficulty within a matter of months. We all recognise that the failure last year with the default of TXU on 1 October was a substantial difficulty affecting the market. Under the present arrangements, we will have completed all the necessary changes by 1 April, a time of only six months.
<P>

<a name="40224-31_para3"></a>As to the issue of licence conditions raised by the amendment, we do not envisage being able to effect change vastly quicker than that. Under the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, sensitivity with regard to the market would still be a major inhibiting factor on prompt action. Evaluation of the impact would still be necessary. It might appear that all that is necessary is a limited technical change, but we would need to work through all the implications for the market.
<P>

<a name="40224-31_para4"></a>I understand the basis of the noble Baroness's argument to increase the element of flexibility. That is to be desired if we can effect it. We are meeting the representations made under previous amendments but we do not think that this amendment will advance that objective.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-31_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I thank all Members of the Committee who have spoken in this short debate and the Minister for his remarks. It may well be that the amendment is not correct; I would not suggest for one moment that any amendment that we table will provide a 100 per cent solution. The problem is that no one seems to have a solution.
<P>

<a name="40224-31_para5"></a>The Minister was helpful before by saying that he would take the amendments away, but I do not know with what he will return. I well remember that when we debated an amendment I suggested that securitisation was the way but that mutualisation was a possibility because others wanted it that way. The fact is that there is a black hole that we must in some way seek to fill. I am happy that the Government are taking away the other amendments to consider. I shall read carefully what the Minister said. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-31_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 116B:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 87, line 30, after "place" insert "(the function of doing so being the "system operator function" for the purposes of this Act)"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-31_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40224-31_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 116C, 116D and 116E. Inasmuch as we have no Divisions, every amendment before the Committee is, in essence, a probing amendment. This group of amendments is even more probing, if I can describe it in that way. This is a probing probing amendment.
<P>

<a name="40224-31_para10"></a>Let me first put on record that the amendments were tabled in consequence of representations made to me and my colleagues by Scottish Power. They can be explained in few words. Amendments Nos. 116B and 116C are paving amendments for Amendment No. 116D. The two amendments simply seek to insert the technical words, "system operator function" and "system provider function" into paragraphs (3)(a) and (b) respectively. They are intended to define the difference between the transmission owner and the systems operator.
<P>

<a name="40224-31_para11"></a>As I have said, the purpose of the two definitions is to pave the way for the main amendment, to Clause 108. In essence, it would prohibit the same body from being both the system provider and the system operator. The logic of the amendment is to ensure that not too much commercial power and control over the separate components of the combined generating and distribution systems fall into one set of hands. It is argued that there should be sufficient legal separation of the functions of system operator and transmission operator to ensure that the system operator cannot discriminate against other transmission owners in favour of their own transmission business.
<P>

<a name="40224-31_para12"></a>Having put that as succinctly as I can, I must tell your Lordships that I have also had representations from Transco vigorously putting the opposite point of view, speaking strongly against the amendment and the concept of the strict separation of functions.
<P>

<a name="40224-31_para13"></a>Perhaps I may summarise the argument against my Amendment No. 116B as fairly as I can. It is that the question of separation of transmission owner and system operator was extensively considered during the consultation process over the British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements (BETTA). This consultation process was conducted over a period of two years, first by Ofgem and the DTI and then by the Trade and Industry Select Committee in the course of its pre-legislative scrutiny. I said at the outset of my remarks that the amendment I have tabled is supported by Scottish Power.
<P>

<a name="40224-31_para14"></a>However, I am informed that while the separation of transmission owner and system operator functions is acceptable in Scotland, entirely different considerations apply to England and Wales. I understand that during the consultation and scrutiny, the separation of transmission owner and system operation functions was rejected. This is because in <P>


<a name="column_GC65"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC65</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>England and Wales, transmission and system operation are wholly separated from generation and supply. Transco has strongly represented to me, and no doubt to the Government too, that separation in England and Wales would result in a substantial loss of efficiency and increased cost to consumers. I have to admit that this is far too technical a matter for me to be able to judge the relative merits one against the other. Clearly, they have been examined at great length by experts. That is why at the beginning of my remarks I described this as a probing amendment&#151;even a probing amendment to a probing amendment&#151;and we look forward to hearing the Government's views on the subject.
<P>

<a name="40224-31_para15"></a>For lay people such as us, this is a technical Bill. We have experts in the Room&#151;the noble Lords, Lord Tombs, Lord Ezra and Lord Jenkin&#151;and we on this side and the Ministers try to do our best to explore all the different issues. However, because security of supply and so forth are so important and necessary, it is right that when we are being lobbied by two different views and are unsure we should put them fairly and ask the Government to give us what they consider to be the answer. Obviously, when it comes to the Report stage, noble Lords will make up their minds when they have heard all the arguments. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40224-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I have some difficulty because I do not know whether to support my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon or whether to support her alter ego, my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon. She put the case most charmingly, but it is clear that there is a distinct division of view between some of the operators and owners in this field. It is also clear that Scottish Power feels that it will be discriminated against by National Grid Transco if the separation system is extended to Scotland.
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para0"></a>It would not surprise me in the least if this is an issue that has been under intensive discussion between the department and the relevant officials in Ofgem. They have a laudable ambition to ensure that all the arrangements are as transparent as possible. The public, particularly those concerned with the operation of the system, can then see how costs are allocated, how charges are made and how the different participants in the market are treated.
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para1"></a>I also believe that Ofgem would want to ensure that this was as fair and even a market as possible. With the degree of intervention that may well be necessary in the complex electricity system that we have, it is most difficult to ensure that transparency. Where there is, as here, the merger of two different systems&#151;the extension of NETA to include Scotland, under what in the Bill is called "BETTA", which will include the entire mainland of the United Kingdom&#151;that will be difficult. I would have thought that when we debate the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, on transitional relief, there will be a strong case for that so as to enable the changeover to take place as smoothly as possible.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para2"></a>I am told by NGT that the fears that Scottish Power may find itself the subject of adverse discrimination are considerably exaggerated. There may be a case to be met, but it is not simply by insisting that there should be a separation of the two systems so that what is sometimes called the SO/TO system&#151;that is an integrated system that has been running in England and Wales&#151;should not apply to Scotland.
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para3"></a>I, too, shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in response to this. I feel equally divided, although if I have to express a view it is to come down in favour of a system that will ensure the greatest uniformity and transparency across the country as a whole. If, as the Minister has indicated, in order to achieve that there needs to be special provision to recognise, for instance, the transmission costs in Scotland, that should be done as openly and clearly as possible. At a later stage in Committee, we will come to an amendment tabled by the Government on that subject.
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para4"></a>I hope that the principle for which Ofgem stands on this will be borne firmly in mind before decisions are taken. I believe that it is an effective regulator and that it has done extremely well over the years. It has made enemies along the way, but that is the nature of effective regulation. That is how I see the position and not seek some concealed way of ensuring a favourable position for Scottish Power and perhaps other Scottish generators in ways that would not achieve market transparency. That is my view and I have a feeling that it is the view of my noble friend Lady Miller, mark two. Like her, I do not feel myself sufficiently qualified to make a firm decision one way or the other. An interesting argument has arisen and we look forward to hearing how the Government come down in response to the representations made to them.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-32_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Tombs: </B>   During our discussions last week, I said that we should recognise that there are real differences in Scotland from England and Wales. They are differences of geography, history and organisation. Those lie at the root of the argument. National Grid Transco is a separate outfit and not at all connected with the generators in England and Wales. It has enjoyed a single transmission operator and owner organisation. The Scottish boards are commercially independent and are jealous, or suspicious, of the notion that their system will be controlled by someone who has a competing, in a sense, system. It does not compete geographically but in terms of arguments on tariffs and similar issues.
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para5"></a>There is a real need for the Scottish concerns to be recognised and provided for. That can be done either by the creation of a separate Great Britain operator or by the incorporation of some duty on National Grid Transco to preserve, or have regard to, or to treat equally the concerns of the Scottish boards. That problem will not go away. It is not a take over or a merger, it is a trading arrangement between commercially independent organisations. We have to have regard to the fact that one part of that <P>


<a name="column_GC67"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC67</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>organisation wants to feel that it will have equal independence of treatment from the person designated to be the system operator.
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para6"></a>The later amendment, to which this leads the way, goes one way towards achieving that and I would regard that as satisfactory. It would disappoint National Grid Transco, but so does the proposed system disappoint the Scottish boards. My judgment from having worked in both organisations is that the commercial imperatives should prevail. Either there should be a provision of this sort or a duty laid on National Grid Transco.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-32_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   As these discussions continue, I hope that the Government will pay close attention to the noble Lord, Lord Tombs. His lifelong experience of the system all over the United Kingdom gives his wisdom a depth beyond that of other noble Lords, even those who have been Ministers. He knows the system from the inside.
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para7"></a>On the wall of the Moses Room is a picture of Moses bringing down the Tablets of Stone. I rather wish that the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, was sitting underneath that picture, as well as our Deputy Chairman. I feel that he is able to illustrate these problems. We hear the arguments from both sides and those of us who live north of the Border are anxious that our generating companies should not operate on a playing field that is other than level.
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para8"></a>I heard what my noble friend Lord Jenkin said about the need for transparency and I understand that. In all things, it is right to try to achieve as much transparency as possible. I cannot say whether I support my noble friend Lady Miller because she has not given us anything to support&#151;she has presented two arguments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I feel slightly redundant. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, have made cases for the defence and the prosecution and the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, has been cast in the role of Moses. However, I shall try to give the Government's view on these matters.
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para9"></a>Amendment No. 116D would oblige National Grid Transco to create two separate group companies. That would be its effect, although it would not necessarily require a divestment of ownership. However, the starting point for the design of BETTA was, with substantial consultation, to do the minimum needed to be done to create the GB-wide competitive market for wholesale electricity.
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para10"></a>There are a number of ways in which we could create a uniform structure. There is this way or, alternatively, Ofgem and the DTI could have proposed legislation which forced all transmission licensees to sell their transmission assets to the Great Britain Systems Operator, so that we create the same situation in Scotland as for in England and Wales. I suspect that had we proposed that there would have been the same reception as Moses received when he came down with the Ten Commandments. No way of altering the system to create exact congruence will be popular.
<P>


<a name="column_GC68"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC68</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para11"></a>However, this is not the most important problem in the sense that Ofgem and the DTI concluded that to force the private companies to sell part of their business was a disproportionate solution and that this issue is not the most important in relation to transparency and distinction between different roles. The most important issue is to operate a system independent of generation and supply. That is why the GBSO role is to be created. We concluded that it was not necessary for transmission licensees to sell their transmission assets to the systems operator, whoever that role was assigned to.
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para12"></a>It was not an objective of BETTA to separate out the systems operating function from the systems providers, which is the logic behind the amendment. It was only to separate out certain transmission functions from those with generation and supply interests. The conclusion of all the discussions on this is that the DTI and Ofgem are of the view that certain synergies can be gained from having the same person undertake systems operator and systems provider functions. Of course, the National Grid in England has combined the two roles for 10 years and in general it has delivered considerable cost savings from being able to trade off the cost of taking an action on the operator side of its business with the cost of taking an action on the transmission owner or systems provider side of its business.
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para13"></a>There is no particularly good reason for ending that synergy. It would be much harder to properly incentivise a company that simply operated the networks but owned no assets. We therefore need to be careful about putting at risk arrangements which have successfully delivered improvements in efficiency.
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para14"></a>Just as we do not think that it is necessary to force the Scottish transmission licensees to sell their assets under BETTA, we do not think that it is proportionate to force National Grid, as the amendment suggests, to divide its transmission assets into separate companies. Of course, both the systems operator and the systems provider are regulated. They are monopoly operations and are therefore subject to heavy regulatory oversight, including provisions on transparency sought by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. Both Ofgem and the DTI believe that the systems operator can be prevented from discriminating in favour of its own transmission assets effectively through the conditions of the licence.
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para15"></a>They propose that the condition in the licence would be not to discriminate between providers or in favour of their own comparable provider activities where it undertakes them. The transmission licence conditions to apply under BETTA would cover such a requirement. It would be better to locate them in the licence provisions rather than in the statute. The licence condition will set the legal and contractual context for the application of all relevant non-discrimination obligations and will form the basis on which the regulator would intervene to enforce such a condition.
<P>

<a name="40224-32_para16"></a>We recognise the problem, but we believe that it is better to operate through licence provisions rather than in statute. Perhaps it is worth adding that in <P>


<a name="column_GC69"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC69</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>addition to this, given the nature of the monopoly position, competition laws apply in this context to any discriminatory conduct or arrangements, which provide an additional safeguard. I therefore recognise the problem of non-congruence between England and Wales, and Scotland. Nevertheless, I think that it is not appropriate to try to create a congruence that is not really justified in terms of efficiency or transparency.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Tombs: </B>   I find that response quite encouraging, at least in intent. However, since the Bill proposes the creation of a Great Britain system operator, I cannot see why it should not prescribe this non-discrimination requirement, to which it seems to me that the Minister has subscribed, or to which at least Ofgem has subscribed with his blessing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I am prepared to consider that, but that is not quite the same as what is set out in the amendment. It proposes a requirement to split the company, which I will quite strongly resist. A non-discrimination provision, without commitment, I would be prepared to look at if Members of the Committee give me leave to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-33_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   First, I thank the Minister for his comments. I also thank every Member of the Committee who spoke in this debate. Perhaps I may echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord Tombs. There was certainly a suggestion that some kind of compromise could be worked out and brought back.
<P>

<a name="40224-33_para0"></a>The amendment made two proposals. It provided an opportunity for a first-class debate of the whole issue. It also offered a little light relief on the other side: the Minister nearly did not have to respond at all. He thought that I had responded to myself. The difference in approach between my noble friend Lord Jenkin, who thought that I was promoting the second part of the argument, and the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, who thought that I was promoting the first part of the argument, was interesting. My poor noble friend Lady Carnegy said that she could not say one way or the other because she was not quite sure what I was promoting. That was difficult.
<P>

<a name="40224-33_para1"></a>The truth is that this is a very serious matter. We were lobbied quite strongly by Scottish Power and we have great sympathy with what it had to say. However, while my noble friend Lady Carnegy may not agree, the reason we did not think it fair simply to leave it on the table was not because we thought that we should do the Government's job for them, but that we could see important and interesting elements in the second part of the debate. This is such a difficult and technical area that we need to explore it in detail. We have achieved that end in so far as we must now look carefully at the Minister's words to see whether we can accommodate what he thinks might be acceptable to deal with the problem. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

I apologise to the Minister&#151;I address the noble Lord, Lord Davies&#151;for the somewhat disparate amendments in this group. They are not all quite the same, although they touch on similar things. However, I have tried to put them in order so that the noble Lord can respond to them without having to shuffle his papers as he did on the last occasion. At that time I spoke to my amendments out of order, which was not quite right. I understand that other noble Lords have added their names to various amendments in the group and I am quite sure that their remarks will complement my own brief explanations.
<P>

<a name="40224-33_para15"></a>National Grid Transco owns and operates the high voltage transmission network in England and Wales; that is, the National Grid. It sets and recovers charges for connection to and use of its grid system in accordance with the charging statements derived from charging methodologies that it is required to maintain under its transmission licence. Under the terms of the licence, National Grid Transco is obliged to keep its charging methodologies under constant review and to make changes if it believes that such alterations will better meet the relevant objectives specified in the licence. Essentially, these require that NGT's overall charges reflect the costs it incurs and that they facilitate effective competition in the generation and supply of electricity.
<P>

<a name="40224-33_para16"></a>In February 2002, NGT commenced such a review. This culminated in proposals subsequently approved by Ofgem which will fundamentally alter the way NGT calculates its charges for, connection to and use of its transmission system. In particular, the revised methodologies have moved some elements of the charges which used to be recovered by way of connection charges into the use of system charges. The new charging arrangements take effect in England and Wales from April of this year.
<P>

<a name="40224-33_para17"></a>In December 2002, the Government confirmed that NGT would be appointed the GB system operator once the required BETTA legislation&#151;that is, this Bill&#151;has gained Royal Assent. One of the responsibilities of the GB system operator will be to set GB transmission charges and to maintain the GB <P>


<a name="column_GC71"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC71</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>charging methodologies and associated charging statements from which the GB system charges will be derived.
<P>

<a name="40224-33_para18"></a>National Grid Transco has therefore initiated work with a view to developing GB charging arrangements. They will be based on new arrangements that will be implemented in England and Wales in April 2004. Initial analysis suggests that, as a consequence, there will be a significant impact on the charges faced by the generators who are located in Scotland. In particular, Scottish generators will be exposed to a significant and disproportionate burden of GB use of system charges, possibly picking up over 60 per cent of the total of such charges whereas Scottish generation accounts for only around 12 per cent of GB generation. Similarly, customers in the south of England will be disproportionately affected.
<P>

<a name="40224-33_para19"></a>Such acute steps are neither appropriate nor desirable and should be avoided. Instead arrangements should be put in place that provide some form of transitional relief, such as phasing, from the initial impact of the new charges resulting from the roll-out of the GB market. That would not be new; precedent exists&#151;for example, when NGC, as it then was, last introduced fundamental changes to its charges in 1993, the full effect was phased in over a number of years.
<P>

<a name="40224-33_para20"></a>[The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 4.31 to 4.41 p.m.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-33_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   Given that NGT charges are derived from the charging methodologies provided for in its transmission licence, it could possibly be argued that Clause 106, particularly paragraph (b) of subsection (2), already provides a power for the Secretary of State to modify transmission charges introduced as a consequence of BETTA. However, the powers in Clause 106 are discretionary, and there is no guarantee that the Secretary of State will use the powers to mitigate the adverse effects of the new GB transmission charges.
<P>

<a name="40224-33_para21"></a>What is needed, therefore, is something that requires the Secretary of State to provide interim relief rather than simply to do so at his discretion. This is what the amendment seeks to achieve. However, given that National Grid Transco has only just embarked upon the work necessary to introduce GB charges, the amendment does not seek to specify at this early stage the precise nature or the amount of relief that may be required to mitigate the inevitable adverse effects. Instead, it simply requires the Secretary of State to bring forward an appropriate scheme after consulting widely.
<P>

<a name="40224-33_para22"></a>Amendment No. 117B seems on the face of it a statement of the impossible. The Secretary of State, from whom only the Prime Minister is higher up the scale, has a duty to publish the text of each licence under a new scheme to deal with existing transmission licences&#151;it is open, transparent government. There is nothing wrong with that, one might think, but <P>


<a name="column_GC72"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC72</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>immediately after establishing the duty, the Bill proceeds to add a caveat; namely, that the text that he publishes may not be authoritative. What does that mean? Is it that the licence does not confer the rights to participate in the transmission of electricity; or is it that the text covers up something that relates to the operation of the licence but that is not published? If either of those is the case, how would the text indicate that it is not authoritative? If the text of a licence is not authoritative, what is the point of issuing it, never mind publishing it?
<P>

<a name="40224-33_para23"></a>Amendment No. 118 would delete paragraph 2 of Schedule 17. The paragraph gives the Secretary of State wide&#151;indeed, unlimited&#151;powers to amend a code or agreement affecting transmission licences,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if it appears to him to be desirable to do so in consequence of anything for which the scheme makes provision".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-33_para24"></a>
The sole criterion for the power to tear up any agreement or code is that the Secretary of State thinks it desirable. In other words, subject to the very limited power of the courts to intervene, the Secretary of State can do very much what he likes, provided he thinks that it is desirable. That is the sole test. I shall not comment further on that amendment, as my noble friend Lord Jenkin wishes to speak to it also.
<P>

<a name="40224-33_para25"></a>On Amendment No. 118A, can the Minister explain exactly what sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of paragraph 4 mean? In particular, will he inform us whether the correct interpretation involves the possibility that the Secretary of State may alter retrospectively a scheme relating to changes to existing transmission licences? Will he also specify whether any scheme relating to changes to existing licences might affect moneys payable or receivable by parties to the altered licences? If that is the case, can he assure the House that no one would be required by the Bill to find sums of money relating to past performance?
<P>

<a name="40224-33_para26"></a>Amendment No. 118B is consequential on Amendment No. 117A and would add that holders of generation licences shall be added to the list of those to be consulted about transitional relief, and only transitional relief. Amendment No. 118C is also consequential on Amendment No. 117A and defines "transitional relief" and "use of system charge". I beg to move.

<A NAME="40224-33_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I tabled Amendment No. 118 because paragraph 2 offended me, for the reasons that my noble friend has given. It seems to leave the matter entirely in the hands of the Secretary of State with, as the noble Baroness put it, very limited power for anybody to question matters or to intervene. So long as the Secretary of State thinks that a provision is desirable, he is entitled to make it.
<P>

<a name="40224-33_para27"></a>This is a very extreme version of a form of legislation that was well summed up in a clerihew of many decades ago that appears in the epitome of lawyers' texts on such matters, Megarry's Miscellany-at-Law. It is a great book, which I recommend that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, read. The following observation has always stuck in my mind: the attitude of modern <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>governments&#151;and I am sure that it applies to two of the governments of which I was a member&#151;could be summed up in the phrase,

<a name="40224-33_para30"></a>When, from time to time, some of us protest about this form of legislation&#151;my noble friend Lord Peyton expresses his distaste with considerable eloquence&#151;I hope that, somewhere deep in the recesses of departments, people take note. We do not like it. Somehow one must find a better approach. Perhaps, on this occasion, the provision is so minor and consequential to the making of the scheme to which Schedule 17 relates that we ought to swallow our distaste and accept it. However, like my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon, I find such provisions very distasteful.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-34_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Tombs: </B>   The amendments that deal with the provision of transitional relief have been largely discussed earlier. We know the dangers and the reasons involved. I trust that they will be dealt with in due course.
<P>

<a name="40224-34_para0"></a>Amendment No. 118, which stands in my name and that of other noble Lords, would delete words from line 15 of page 207 because they seem to be covered by Clause 1. One should avoid repetition so far as possible. I support the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-34_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   It is our misfortune to have such a complex group of amendments punctuated by a Division, creating problems in ensuring the continuity of our discussion. I will do my very best to respond to all the points made in this short debate. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for suggesting that she move the amendments in such a form as to remove the need for me to reshuffle my notes. I regret to say that she has not achieved that objective. I would be already in a state of confusion if I followed precisely the order that she suggests because, believe it or not, I took a simpler approach to this group of interesting and challenging amendments. I intend to deal with the easiest amendment first, on the grounds that that would establish my credentials with the Committee, and hope to survive on the more difficult ones as we progress.
<P>

<a name="40224-34_para1"></a>I shall refer first to Amendment No. 117B. Sub-paragraph (8) has been included so that if a mistake is found when the text of the licence is published, it can subsequently be rectified and the situation clarified. The amendment would remove that ability. We have included the sub-paragraph to provide clarity and transparency. I hear what the noble Baroness says in support of her amendment. We merely seek to establish as clearly as possible that the text should be treated as authoritative unless, because an error has been identified, a change must be made which will be specific and clear. I do not think that we could have expressed the situation more clearly, against a <P>


<a name="column_GC74"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC74</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>background in which we must guard against the possibility of error, requiring us to make a different statement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Tombs: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I have difficulty with the wording of sub-paragraph (8), which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Any text shall be treated as authoritative unless the contrary is shown".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-34_para2"></a>
The Minister referred to "inaccuracy", which is not the same thing. According to the provision, when a text is published, it is authoritative unless it can be shown that it is not. One may be able to show that a text is inaccurate, but I do not know how one can show that it is not authoritative.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-34_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The sub-paragraph relates to the text at the point at which a licence is published. We are saying that that is the authoritative position. However, if it were necessary to rectify a licence, we would need to clarify the position. We merely state in the Bill that we are committed to being explicit in that regard. I hear what the noble Lord says; the concept of "authoritative" has considerable weight attached. The intention is that the position is authoritative, provided that a change is not necessary and a position made to the contrary. The purpose of the provision is to make the situation as open and transparent as possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-34_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Tombs: </B>   I am still puzzled by the last few words of the provision. If it is to remain, the sub-paragraph needs modification. I do not know how one can show that something is not authoritative. One can show that it is incorrect or badly judged, for example, but not that it is not authoritative, if the statute says that it is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-34_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I once witnessed a competition in which the prize was a cut-glass vase for the person who could best expound on the obvious. Sub-paragraph (8) says that anything will be treated as authoritative unless it is not. In explaining it, the Minister said something clearly; when he looks at Hansard, he might find a way to reword sub-paragraph (8). However, I do not think that the noble Lord should win the cut-glass vase; it would not be a very good advertisement for the Captain of the Yeoman of the Guard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-34_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I have no intention of entering that competition. If I inadvertently blundered into it, and at present I am highly placed, I shall try to withdraw myself from the competition as rapidly as possible.
<P>

<a name="40224-34_para3"></a>In explaining the position to the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, I was trying to identify that we seek to be clear and transparent, and that therefore the provision shall be authoritative. However, we are aware that on occasion change might be necessary. Making the statement in these terms guarantees that we must be clear, transparent, open and honest when such a change takes place, because we are committed in the <P>


<a name="column_GC75"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC75</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>legislation to that principle. That is all that I seek to reflect in respect of the word "authoritative" in this provision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-34_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I am terribly sorry to disturb the Minister again on this simple point; I am grateful to him for giving way. He may recall that a long time ago, before the Committee was suspended for a Division, I said that on the face of it, the statement is impossible. The more the poor noble Lord tries to tell us that it is possible, the more he convinces us all that it is not. It is merely necessary to change one word. One cannot possibly state that the text shall be,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"treated as authoritative unless the contrary is shown".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-34_para4"></a><P>

<a name="40224-34_para5"></a>If the contrary can be shown, then it is not authoritative, full stop. That is the normal interpretation of the word. There is no point in discussing the matter further, but I wanted to ease the Minister's way. Sub-paragraph (8) contains a statement of the impossible, and sometimes when one is faced with the impossible, one must accept that something must be done about it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-34_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I hear what the noble Baroness and the other Members of the Committee have said&#151;I thought that this was the easiest part of the debate. As I disappear beneath the waves, I wish to point out that this is a clear attempt on the part of the Government to be open and clear about the position: issues should be described in authoritative terms. However, we are aware that, having described them in those authoritative terms, that is the issue that will govern the procedure. Some change to a licence may be necessary. We are merely indicating that we will be open, clear, honest and precise when we need to effect that change. If noble Lords are saying, "Well, you do not sound very authoritative now", we will reflect on that. If there is one thing that Ministers crave, it is the semblance of authority. I express enormous gratitude to the Committee for having tested me on this amendment.
<P>

<a name="40224-34_para6"></a>On Amendment No. 118, we understand the concern that the noble Baroness expressed about the extent of the power granted to the Secretary of State to alter agreements with users of the transmission system. We do not believe that the provision should cause any concern. Its use is limited to a narrow purpose; that is to say, when a change is needed to an agreement or codes as a consequence of changes to a transmission licence for the purposes of BETTA. If the provision were not present, that could damage the smooth implementation of BETTA. Without it, the only other way to modify agreements would be through the "power to modify licence conditions". Some participants are unlicensed, and the agreement of the unlicensed parties to the changes to the agreement would need to be provided.
<P>

<a name="40224-34_para7"></a>In particular, this provision relates to the framework agreements for the Balancing and Settlement Code (BSC) and the Connection and Use of System Code (CUSC). Those code framework agreements refer to an authorised area of England and <P>


<a name="column_GC76"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC76</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Wales. Upon the introduction of BETTA the authorised area will no longer exist. These framework agreements therefore require amendment.
<P>

<a name="40224-34_para8"></a>Without the provision in Schedule 17 we cannot be confident that we would be able to achieve the amendments needed within the timetable, as it would require the agreement of all parties to the framework agreement&#151;including those who are unlicensed&#151;and that would need to be complete at the time that the licensing system was applied. That is currently scheduled for soon after Royal Assent, so it would be a risky proposition for the smooth implementation of BETTA.
<P>

<a name="40224-34_para9"></a>In general, both the Secretary of State and Ofgem intend to use the power to modify licence conditions to achieve amendments to codes necessary for BETTA. However, we do not have all the detailed steps that will need to be completed to enable a smooth transition to BETTA at present. Those are being worked out as a matter of priority but, as such, it is conceivable that in some circumstances the power to modify licence conditions will not be the appropriate way to achieve a modification to a code where that needs to be complete by the time that the licensing system comes into effect; namely, the start of BETTA.
<P>

<a name="40224-34_para10"></a>I recognise that the argument is complicated, but it meets what the noble Baroness indicated in moving the amendment were the difficulties surrounding the issue. It is because of those difficulties that I am obliged to present a complex argument in defence of the position.

<P>
<A NAME="40224-34_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I have been following the Minister's words fairly carefully. He said that steps were being worked out. Are things still not settled? Does that not add to the reason why my noble friend's amendment might be very applicable?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-35_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The noble Baroness is right; not all details with regard to BETTA have been completely worked through. It is a tight timetable to meet the objectives by Royal Assent. What has occurred is that the DTI and Ofgem have worked to ensure that documents describing the details of the BETTA project are in the public domain while the Bill is being discussed. So far, 35 such documents have been published.
<P>

<a name="40224-35_para0"></a>All the main planks of the BETTA project framework have been established and, for the most part, only details remain. However, a few issues of significance remain. The DTI and Ofgem expect to resolve those in the coming weeks. The detailed implementation arrangements will be resolved only during the final phase of BETTA. It is for that reason that the Bill seeks enabling powers rather than detailed provisions. I recognise the justifiable anxiety of the Opposition and the accuracy with which they identify the fact that some details have not been worked through, which is why we need powers in such terms. <P>


<a name="column_GC77"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC77</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, I hope that it will be recognised that the area is very complex and that work is ongoing. That is why we are not able to accept Amendment No. 118.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-35_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I may have misheard the Minister, but I got the impression that, when he drew the distinction between licence holders and other parties who were not licence holders, he used a phrase along the lines of "proceeding by agreement". If the Government's intention in making changes to the codes and licences to which the schedule refers is to proceed by agreement&#151;there is provision for consultation, but that is not the same thing&#151;many of our anxieties would withdraw. However, if I misheard that, it would be quite appropriate to ask the Minister to make it clear that the Government might have to overrule some of the parties not prepared to agree.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-35_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   It will be recognised that we hope to achieve agreement of the parties concerned for BETTA, in all aspects of it. The noble Lord will recognise that the broad structural framework has been achieved against a background of extensive consultation and agreement, but there are one or two outstanding points. There are also matters of detail on which the amendment would make it extremely difficult for us to achieve the objective of establishing BETTA within the time frame that we have. Of course we recognise that we cannot implement BETTA without the main structural positions being agreed with the parties, and that is the basis on which we are working.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-35_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I would like to come back on one point. There are so many in the group that, if I waited until the end and we had gone through various other matters, it would be terribly confusing for us as well as for the Minister. As he knows, I always try to help him when at all possible.
<P>

<a name="40224-35_para1"></a>I see that the Secretary of State obviously needs some power to vary agreements and codes. However, my noble friend tabled an amendment to remove paragraph 2, which is headed:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Consequential amendment of related codes and agreements".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-35_para2"></a>
The amendments are not merely consequential&#151;let us say that straight out. We are talking about a major power that drastically affects the commercial interests of the licensee. That is a very serious matter.
<P>

<a name="40224-35_para3"></a>Paragraph 2 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may include in a scheme under paragraph 1 provision amending a code or agreement relevant to the conditions of an existing transmission licence if it appears to him desirable to do so in consequence of anything for which the scheme makes provision".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-35_para4"></a>
I emphasise,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if it appears to him desirable to do so".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-35_para5"></a>
We do not agree; we think that that wording is far too wide and allows the Secretary of State to do anything on a very important matter.
<P>

<a name="40224-35_para6"></a>If the Minister is now saying that there will be some kind of agreement, we will not press the relevant amendment. We could not do so in any case, as this is <P>


<a name="column_GC78"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC78</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Grand Committee. However, it is important that we know in detail what the Minister means by the words about which my noble friend asked him. As it stands, the provision is not appropriate to be left in, and nor is it consequential. We are slipping into giving the Secretary of State quite wide powers. We do not think that whether he believes that it is "desirable to do so" is the appropriate way to move forward, particularly when the Minister is talking about transparency. How transparent is the provision if it is merely based on what the Secretary of State thinks desirable at the time?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-35_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I have to give a fairly general answer to the noble Baroness, who is obviously not entirely satisfied with my answer thus far. I am seeking to establish that the licensing scheme is the means by which existing transmission licences are changed to licences to participate in transmission. It is also used to incorporate new standard conditions for transmission. Amendment of a code or agreement under paragraph 2 is limited by the nature of the licensing scheme. The Secretary of State may exercise the power only if that is helpful to the scheme. I hope that I am allaying the noble Baroness's anxiety. The power is not an eccentric one for the Secretary of State, but is restricted very much to being helpful to the licensing scheme and is within that framework.
<P>

<a name="40224-35_para7"></a>I recognise that "desirable" is a softer test than that used to change licence conditions in Clauses 106 and 109, which require the change to be "necessary or expedient". We had aspects of that debate a little earlier. However, the power is to be used to amend agreements that have been entered into by non-licence holders such as traders. It is intended to be wide enough to ensure that such persons are not able to delay the BETTA timetable. I put it to Members of the Committee that that is a reasonable position for the Government to take with regard to a tight timetable. The power is restricted to a very limited area.
<P>

<a name="40224-35_para8"></a>On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will consider withdrawing the amendment, although I recognise that I have not thus far addressed several other amendments. I agree with her that it has been necessary for the clarity of our proceedings to get the issues clear on amendments about which there are some difficulties.
<P>

<a name="40224-35_para9"></a>On Amendment No. 118A, I reiterate the case that I made a little earlier. It is not impossible that errors could be made in the transmission licensing scheme. Therefore, a power to modify the scheme including retrospective modification is necessary. An error in the term of a licence would be capable of amendment only if a power were provided to amend the scheme itself. For example, one cannot amend the term of the licence by exercising the power to modify licence conditions.
<P>

<a name="40224-35_para10"></a>I recognise that the subject is difficult. One example of when the provision might be used is where we use the licensing system to amend the term of an existing licence to set out where that licensee can operate. For example, let us say that an error was made in the scheme and NGC was licensed to operate in England only, whereas currently it operates in England and <P>


<a name="column_GC79"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC79</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Wales. We would wish for NGC to continue to undertake its activities in England and Wales, and a modification to correct the error in the licensing scheme would need to be capable of having retrospective effect. I recognise what has been said on that subject. We would need a retrospective effect to ensure that NGC was not found to have committed a criminal offence while it continued to undertake its activities in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40224-35_para11"></a>I want to stress how seriously the Government take retrospective modifications. I recognise the proper anxiety about them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-35_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Tombs: </B>   Can I make an observation that might help the Minister? Amendment No. 118 is extremely modest. It does not challenge the point to which the Minister is replying. It simply seeks to delete words in paragraph 2 that are already included in paragraph 1.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-35_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord. However, as the subject has been raised, I was seeking to allay anxieties about aspects of retrospective consideration in the schedule. Concern has been expressed, so I seek to identify how narrow the definition is, but how essential it is in the circumstances in which we are placed.
<P>

<a name="40224-35_para12"></a>We have had debates that cover Amendments Nos. 117A, 118B and 118C on previous occasions in Committee&#151;certainly one occasion is very vivid in my mind, given the contributions of a number of noble Lords&#151;as we have talked about the costs incurred by Scottish generators following the introduction of BETTA. The GB system operator has been charged with developing a GB charging methodology that is cost-reflective and non-discriminatory. That means that generators whose connection to the system imposes the greatest cost will pay the highest charges.
<P>

<a name="40224-35_para13"></a>As generators in Scotland and the north of England are located furthest from centres of demand, they will face the highest charges. However, as we discussed previously, the Government intend to take measures to mitigate the impact on renewables. At the same time, it should be recognised that Scottish generators will no longer have to pay any inter-connector charges or a separate charge for access to the England and Wales market. It would not be fair for Scottish generators to receive the benefits of BETTA on day one, but, as the Opposition argue for, to receive transitional relief from the costs of BETTA. As I emphasised in the previous debate on the issue&#151;I was not greeted with overwhelming enthusiasm from the Opposition&#151;our analysis of the costs and benefits ended up in a fairly neutral position so far as Scottish generators were concerned.

<A NAME="40224-36_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The noble Lord is in no danger at all of spoiling my speech; he might well have spoiled my evening, but that is a different matter altogether. When he makes his representation, we shall examine it with the greatest care, and I hope that we shall be able to reply to him effectively. In any case, I would not be too sanguine about the possibility of the issue not arising again on later stages of the Bill. I am sure that we shall return to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-36_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   When the Minister gets my noble friend's letter, will he bear in mind that to make a change that creates a level playing field is one thing, but to then allow a change to be made to create a newly uneven playing field is another? They do not necessarily cancel each other out. My noble friend will doubtless write more clearly about that, but perhaps he will refer to what I have said. He will find that there is some nonsense going on.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-36_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I hear what the noble Baroness says. She is talking to a former sportsman, and I have never liked the analogy of the level playing field. It does not matter whether most playing fields on which sports are played are level, because everyone changes round at half time. I merely indicate that Scottish generators have an equal score with their competitors in England and Wales. I hear that the noble Lord is challenging the figures that I cited to him and which I predict that we shall examine later. At present, so far as the Government are concerned, the score is level, so it is not for the Government to worry about the playing field.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-36_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Tombs: </B>   I thank the Minister for giving way yet again. The interruptions to his flow do not show; nevertheless, I apologise. I want to make two points. One is rather specific and relates to his reply on the transmission costs. I keep saying that the geography is different, and that in Scotland a much sparser and simpler transmission system has developed. In many ways it is simpler because the Scottish boards historically did things differently from those in England and Wales. There is a physical case for different charges in Scotland. Quite apart from that is the question, if we do not have transition, of the impact on the trading arrangements. It would be extremely difficult and, I think, unacceptable to the Scottish boards.
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para0"></a>On a much broader point, when I was responsible for the Scottish system some years ago, I was very conscious as an Englishman of London as a centre for decisions, which tended to throw Scotland to one side. I was a member of a so-called nuclear power advisory board, which consisted of five people and met regularly in London. When I asked if we could have one meeting in five in Scotland, I got the reply, "But Scotland is so far away". I pointed out as solemnly as I could that the distance from Glasgow to London was the same as that from London to Glasgow, but that did not have any effect and we still met in London.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para1"></a>It is a fact that National Grid Transco, the DTI and Ofgem are all located in London. Glasgow seems a long way away, and we are talking about something smaller than the main system. The Minister must be very much aware of that and guard against it, because it will provoke unfairness, rapid decisions made local to other pressure points, and a sense of unfairness that may find its way through political channels and other routes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-36_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   We cannot change sides to either side of the border at half time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-36_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   One cannot so far as the border is concerned, but one can with regard to the playing field on which one is operating. The proposal is that BETTA will operate on the basis that there is no discrimination between the generators. I understand the arguments made on the transitional position; I merely indicate that we do not think that the case has been made out, in terms of unfairness and so on.
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para2"></a>The implications of the amendments are clear enough: they would discriminate against generators in England and Wales, which would have to pay increased charges as a result of the transitional relief granted to Scottish generators. That is a straightforward distortion of competition. I understand the motive behind it, but let us not make any bones about the fact that we seek to create a fair, open and transparent market. The amendments would certainly distort that. On that fairly important point of principle, I hope that the amendment might be withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para3"></a>Given the protracted nature of my reply&#151;not all of it of my own wont, as the Committee will recognise&#151;I hope that I have responded to most of the points and that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-36_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I thank all Members of the Committee who have contributed in various ways to the whole group of amendments. I started off by apologising to the Minister, as it seemed a disparate group, although Scotland was the binding element of the amendments. Other than that, some of the issues were quite different.
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para4"></a>I also thank the Minister for giving way on so many occasions and dealing with the group so charmingly, if I may say so. Once again, he has drawn the short straw. He did so during another sitting, and it was most unfortunate for him. I tried to help this time by tabling the amendments in the order that I did, only to discover that he thought that he would deal with them from the easiest to the most difficult. He found that the one with which he started was perhaps the most difficult of all. I feel for him; he had an excellent stab at a hard point.
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para5"></a>I hope that the Minister will take Amendment No. 117B away and that his officials will try to find some different words; it does not look as though we are turning the world upside down. The Minister did not answer the second part of what I said on Amendment No. 118A. I asked whether, if any scheme made <P>


<a name="column_GC82"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC82</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>changes retrospectively, he could assure us that no one would be required by this legislation to find sums of money relating to past performance. On Amendment No. 118, he said that the discretion was very narrow within the licence. However, we are still concerned about it, and the Minister could come back with a different form of wording to make it clear that the amount of discretion was very tightly controlled. That might meet our difficulties.
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para6"></a>With regard to the main body of amendments&#151;Amendment No. 117A and the consequential amendments&#151;we must agree to disagree. We were trying to search out from the Government what they felt about the issue. We are talking about complicated measures. We did not intend to make an uneven playing field, although there was a suggestion of that. We were trying to provide for phasing in during the transitional period, as has been done previously. The example that I gave of when it had been done before was not a precedent, so our proposal is not something against anyone's policy. We suggest a gentle phasing in to make the beginning somewhat easier. On that note, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40224-36_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Gray of Contin </B>   moved Amendment No. 118D:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 89, line 40, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-36_para12"></a><P>

<a name="40224-36_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: After the excitement of the previous group, we return to our more wearisome progress through the Bill. This is a small amendment to leave out subsection (5); grouped with it is Amendment No. 118E, which would leave out lines 42 and 43. On Amendment No. 118D, I was encouraged by one remark of the Minister about how the Government hope to proceed by agreement. If that is a sign of how we shall proceed for the remainder of the Bill, we will all heave a sigh of relief.
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para14"></a>This is a probing amendment designed to elicit the Government's motivation: why is the restriction considered necessary? Is there not a grave danger that if the Secretary of State may exercise the power only on a single occasion for a single licence there may be unfair advantage for a single company or person? Such advantage could turn out to be seriously unfair. The Minister has been good at giving examples to illustrate what the Government will do under the Bill. Perhaps he could now give us an example of the nature of the argument that could result in his directing GEMA to grant a transmission licence. It is undoubtedly implied in the wording of the Bill that if he did not so direct, GEMA itself would not necessarily grant the licence.
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para15"></a>Amendment No. 118E is also probing. Is the Bill's wording constructed to mean that the Secretary of State may direct GEMA to refuse an application and then direct it to accept another one? Or is the intention to stop the Secretary of State from directing acceptance and then changing his mind and instructing <P>


<a name="column_GC83"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC83</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the application be refused after all? Or is the intention to restrict the Secretary of State to a single overruling of GEMA, whether that be to accept or reject a specific application?
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para16"></a>Can the Minister give us another example of a set of circumstances in which he would want or need to issue an instruction to aid implementation of the new trading and transmission arrangements? On whose advice would he overrule GEMA? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-36_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Gray. I promise him that I shall not add to the excitement following the previous group. I am not sure whether the amendment and this part of the Bill are simply complex or so significantly obscure that excitement is almost impossible. In trying to deal with the nature of the argument, as he put it, I shall try to set out the purpose of the clause, to enable everyone to understand what it is intended to achieve. It may well be that, not so much examples, but what is already happening, will illustrate the points that have been so appropriately raised with us.
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para17"></a>The purpose of the clause is to enable the Secretary of State to appoint the GB system operator by requiring the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (GEMA) to award a licence or to refuse any one application. Perhaps I should add in parentheses that, at present, under the Utilities Act, Ofgem has that power and it will be transferred to GEMA; it is not a power of the Secretary of State. Under Amendment No. 114, it might have been thought that the Secretary of State still had that power, but I want to be clear that it is GEMA that holds it.
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para18"></a>That power will need to be exercised only if a GB system operator is not one of the existing transmission licensees. That is because in such a case, the licence will be modified to switch on the conditions applicable to the system operator. That will be done through the licensing scheme. If that power is commenced, it should not be capable of being exercised more than once, as the intention is that there should be only one system operator for Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para19"></a>However, the power is unlikely to be used&#151;this is where my explanation may be more useful than the provision of examples. In August 2002, invitations were sent out for applications from parties interested in being the system operator for Great Britain, and the process closed in September 2002. One application was received from the National Grid Company plc. Rather than giving examples, let me state that that is the company that made the application.
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para20"></a>Amendment No. 118E would remove from the Bill a subsection the purpose of which is to enable the Secretary of State to appoint a GB system operator. In doing that, it is important to ensure that the authority&#151;Ofgem/GEMA&#151;turns down all but the chosen application. We cannot conceive of the Secretary of State overruling GEMA. The Secretary of State is making the transmission licence award because it is considered that such an important appointment should be considered and made by the Government direct; in no other circumstances would it be contemplated that that should happen.
<P>


<a name="column_GC84"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC84</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para21"></a>It is therefore necessary to include the power in the subsections to ensure that the authority refuses all but the successful application to achieve that single application status. However, that power needs to be available only prior to the appointment by the Secretary of State of a system operator for Great Britain. Once the system operator is appointed, there is no need to refuse anyone else.
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para22"></a>It may be asked why the power is necessary when I have already said that NGC, an existing transmission licensee, is to be the only Great Britain system operator. The Bill cannot at this stage constrain the Secretary of State's choice as to who is the appropriate candidate. The Secretary of State has issued a statement saying that she is minded to appoint NGC as the single GB system operator under BETTA. However, it is not possible to make that designation until the legislation is in force; we are at a step before that.
<P>

<a name="40224-36_para23"></a>The amendment would allow the Secretary of State at any time to request that the authority turn down an application for a transmission licence. I hope that I have demonstrated that that would be neither necessary nor appropriate for BETTA in the circumstances. I understand the exploratory nature of the amendment, which was intended to elicit that information, and hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw it.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-37_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Gray of Contin </B>   moved Amendment No. 119A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 208, line 17, leave out sub-paragraph (3).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-37_para7"></a><P>

<a name="40224-37_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: Again, these are essentially short-term measures. Schedule 18 itself is essentially short-term, in that there is only a three-month window in which to apply for a property arrangement scheme. However, the start of that window is not specified, in that the clause that refers to the schedule&#151;Clause 113&#151;comes into force on such a day as the Secretary of State may by order appoint. It is at least theoretically possible that there may be a great deal of time available to ponder, design and produce all manner of property arrangement schemes.
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para9"></a>The schedule makes clear that an element of compulsion may be involved. In those circumstances, I am concerned to know what property rights or liabilities would be liable to be transferred&#151;especially those which would not otherwise be capable of being transferred. Does the use of the word "transfer" mean <P>


<a name="column_GC85"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC85</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that money, as in buying and selling or compensation, will not be involved? Will the Minister give examples of possible property arrangement schemes, highlighting the circumstances in which they might be appropriate and including an instance of transfer that would not otherwise be possible?
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para10"></a>Amendment No. 119B would, after "shall", insert, "within three calendar months". Under the provisions of the schedule, the application for a property arrangement must be made in a given period of three months. There are 21 days' grace between the making of the scheme and its implementation. Seven days are allowed for applying for review of a GEMA decision, and there is a further seven days in which someone who has applied for review may apply for an interim arrangement.
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para11"></a>It seems unreasonable that no limit is set on the time GEMA takes to determine an application. How long would GEMA normally be allowed? Do the Government expect any sort of a backlog to arise because of the three-month window for making applications? Would GEMA recruit extra temporary staff to deal with any such backlog? If so, which departments or organisations would be approached for help?
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para12"></a>I hope the Minister will be able to reply to these amendments as fully as he replied to the first set I put to him. We shall wait and see. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-37_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I am not sure that I can give detailed replies with the same level of erudition as my noble friend Lord Triesman. In essence, the issue is straightforward. I understand why anxieties are raised; we are talking about transfer of property and, as the noble Lord said, there could be an element of compulsion involved without the agreement of a third party. I emphasise that that would be used as a last resort and that there is provision for compensation, but the provision is vital. If it were removed, that could be detrimental to the introduction of BETTA.
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para13"></a>To answer the questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Gray, about what kind of property we are talking about, for the most part, we are almost certainly discussing property such as leases, licences of intellectual property, contractual rights and so forth, rather than cash. Nevertheless, that is property and the provision could involve compulsory purchase of property.
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para14"></a>Obviously, in the first instance, we would hope that all parties concerned&#151;the transmission asset owners, the transmission system operator and so on&#151;would be able to agree on how the new system will operate and how the parties will interact and arrange their affairs. But that may not occur. It will be necessary to use the property arrangement scheme only if agreement cannot be reached and if that would result in BETTA failing or being undermined.
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para15"></a>In order for that provision to be used, an application to use the property arrangement scheme would, as the noble Lord said, have to be made within three months of BETTA's introduction. Were the provision not <P>


<a name="column_GC86"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC86</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>there, we would be in danger of allowing the BETTA system not to operate in practice. On the procedures, I understand that GEMA intends to publish the procedures that it intends to follow when the Act is in force.
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para16"></a>On the second amendment and the question of a timetable, it is important that we allow time for all the parties' interests to be fully considered. That requires some flexibility. Some of the matters on which the authority may have to decide may be straightforward&#151;a simple assignment of a single software licence, for example, where the main licence could not otherwise be assigned. But other issues may be much more complicated.
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para17"></a>Whatever the application, it is incumbent on the authority to consider whether the proposal is necessary or expedient for the implementation of BETTA, as well as deciding what arrangements to impose. In that context, it is important that all affected licensees' and third parties' interests must be considered. The authority needs to act as rapidly and as expeditiously as possible, but it will be operating in a system in which its decisions can be challenged under administrative law.
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para18"></a>That cuts both ways. On the one hand, if it fails to take all those issues into consideration, it can be challenged. On the other hand, if it takes too long about it and there is detriment as a result of the delay, it could also be challenged. So it is not easy to define a fixed period or even a normal period in the sense in which the noble Lord, Lord Gray, asked me to do.
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para19"></a>We do not expect a backlog. We hope and expect that in almost all instances, the parties will reach agreement without resorting to that last resort provision. The staffing issues will therefore probably not arise. In any case, they will be an administrative matter for GEMA rather than for the Ministry, so I cannot answer that question. We do not anticipate that that will lead to any serious pressure on staffing.
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para20"></a>However, if we removed the provision or imposed a timescale that would prevent the authority from carrying out its duties, that could in certain circumstances lead to delay in BETTA's introduction or compromise the ability to implement BETTA at all. The deletion proposed by the first amendment would clearly lead to that consequence. Were we to place too tight a timescale on the authority, the same problem could arise. We must ensure that the process is pursued, taking into account the interests of all parties concerned. It would be unhelpful to those parties were a tight timescale to be imposed on them in all cases.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-37_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Before my noble friend replies, as my name is linked with the amendment, perhaps I could ask a couple of questions. The Minister said clearly that the provision would be enacted only if agreement were not reached. That is the second amendment on which a Minister has said "only if". Would it not make more sense to include those words? At present, as my noble friend clearly spelt out, the provision is open-ended.
<P>


<a name="column_GC87"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC87</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para21"></a>The Minister went on to say that there would be guidelines about the length of time, that the response would be as rapid as possible or that a normal period would be used. Other Members of the Committee may know, but I should be grateful if he would tell me whether there is a recognised normal period. He said that it may be possible to respond in three months. I know that this is a DTI Bill rather than a Defra Bill, but the Minister will be well aware that I am still concerned that, for example, payments due from the foot and mouth outbreak have still not been completed two years later.
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para22"></a>We all want to get the system up and running, but what do the Government anticipate that a normal period may be? Earlier, we were referred to the Utilities Act. We raised similar concerns before it was passed. Is there anything in that Act to help my noble friend by giving him some idea of the sort of period anticipated?
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para23"></a>If there is a major challenge that may go to the courts, that will obviously take some time, but at present, reading the provision to which the amendments refer, it seems open-ended. It could take a considerable time, but no guidelines have been given. In his response, the Minister did not define the period at all; he gave us only a generality. Is there any provision in previous Acts that would help my noble friend and me to be more satisfied about the Bill's wording?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-37_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Gray of Contin: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend for that intervention and I entirely agree with her. I take the points made by the Minister, but I still believe that deadlines are not a bad thing for concentrating the mind. I only suggested three months to see what would be the Government's reaction. If they could argue a case for six months, we would listen.
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para24"></a>The Minister said that they do not expect delays. Surely in legislation we should provide for the unexpected as well as the expected. Delays could have a serious effect. As a safeguard I would like a time limit to be imposed, but I shall listen to the Minister's further remarks on that. In any case, we will certainly consider carefully what he has already said, but we may want to return to the matter on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-37_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   In response to the point about last resort, the process is triggered not by the regulator but if a transmission licensee applies. In other words, it can effectively be used only if no agreement is reached. So it is not a question of the regulator becoming irritated and deciding on the last resort; someone must decide that they cannot agree with the other parties. In that sense, it does not need to be spelt out that it is a last resort; it is a last resort because negotiations must have broken down before it can operate. That is not at the regulator's discretion.
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para25"></a>I understand what was said about the timescale, but we do not know how complex the issues that arise will be. GEMA may set out an idea about timescales in its procedures, but it would be unwise to lay down a statutory limitation at this point. The assurance that parties to such agreements will have is that if the authorities delay unreasonably they are challengeable <P>


<a name="column_GC88"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC88</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in law. Equally, they would be challengeable if the opposite were to take place and by hurrying it through they ignored or did not take into account the interests of one of the parties.
<P>

<a name="40224-37_para26"></a>Although I understand why people may want some reassurance, it would be unwise to put that in statute. There may be something in the guidance that the regulators themselves may issue, but at this stage I would resist the building into the Bill of a statutory timetable. There are not many areas where in similar circumstances involving potentially complex negotiations the regulator is under a specific timetable to resolve matters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-38_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 119D:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 213, line 6, after "order" insert "subject to the positive resolution procedure"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-38_para0"></a><P>

<a name="40224-38_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 119D, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 144A, 146A and 146B. In doing so, I should mention that I propose to table similar amendments to Clauses 24 and 72. Those provisions have already been dealt with by the Committee, so I shall introduce the amendments on Report.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para2"></a>The Bill contains at least 12 Henry VIII clauses. As the Committee will know, that alludes to the popular perception of that king as an executive autocrat. It means a provision that allows an Act of Parliament&#151;not necessarily the one that grants the power&#151;to be modified by statutory instrument. This is a power which, although not invented by the present Government, has been used by them with ever-increasing frequency since they have been in power.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para3"></a>A Henry VIII clause is normally, and quite rightly, made subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. However, there are some cases, in our view, where the affirmative resolution procedure itself needs to be strengthened by what I may call a "super affirmative procedure". The super affirmative procedure is set out in Amendment No. 146B, the last amendment in the group. Basically it requires more than the usual procedure employed for ordinary affirmative resolutions.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para4"></a>In those cases, the Secretary of State will have to do more than table the order. Before he does so, under proposed subsection (2) he will have to give Parliament a detailed explanation. There must then be a 60-day consultation period before the order is laid. That is covered by proposed subsections (3), (4) and (5). Under subsection (6), the Secretary of State, in formally laying the draft order before Parliament in <P>


<a name="column_GC89"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC89</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the ordinary way, will also have to inform Members of both Houses what representations he has received and what amendments he has made as a consequence. Subsection (7) of the proposed new clause provides a definition of the word "enactment".
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para5"></a>There is a precedent, set by the Government themselves, in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, where Sections 4 and 5 make provision for prior consultation before a Henry VIII order is made.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para6"></a>Despite the fact that there are, as I have said, no fewer than 12 Henry VIII clauses, I have not applied a shotgun approach to them. I have selected only four for a special super affirmative procedure, modified from the more detailed one required by the Regulatory Reform Act.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para7"></a>I shall now deal with the four remaining amendments in the group in order. Amendment No. 119D affects paragraph 21 of Schedule 18. The schedule does not specify either the positive or negative method of ratifying the order. Presumably that was not an oversight but due to the fact that, as I assume, the Government rely on the general provisions of Clause 156.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para8"></a>However, we believe that this particular provision in the 18th schedule should in any case require the use of the positive resolution procedure. More than that, we believe that it needs the super affirmative procedure. The reason for this is because of the powers given to the Secretary of State to refer Ofgem's determinations to the Competition Commission. The occasions when this could arise are too serious to be allowed to slip through, probably unnoticed, under the negative procedure.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para9"></a>Amendment No. 131A relates to paragraph 14(2) of Schedule 22, which enables the Secretary of State by order to modify any of the time periods specified in the schedule. It therefore has the potential adversely to affect the exercise of persons' appeal rights. This is currently constrained only by the negative resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para10"></a>Amendment No. 144A relates to Clause 155, which enables the Petroleum Act 1998 to be modified by Order in Council to give effect to international agreements relating to the construction, operation, use, decommissioning or abandonment of a pipeline or offshore installation.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para11"></a>Amendment No. 146A is to Clause 156(3). The clause relates to powers exercisable by statutory instrument and the amendment is merely consequential to ensure that the exercise of that power is subject to new Section 156A.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para12"></a>If and when I am able to introduce the similar amendments to Clauses 24 and 72, I shall be drawing the Committee's attention to the effect of those two clauses. Respectively, Clause 24 allows the Secretary of State scope to increase the NDA's borrowing by increasing the limits. Clause 72 permits the Secretary of State to give effect to international agreements which Parliament may never have had the opportunity of discussing in the first place.

<a name="40224-38_para13"></a>The new Section 156A created by Amendment No. 146B lays down the super affirmative procedure that I believe is essential in the four special and particular cases that I have set out. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-38_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   As regards the first amendment, I am in a slightly strange position. Having looked at the issue, I find that the paragraph of the schedule to which the amendment relates was drafted some time ago when this was a stand-alone Bill. It relates to a situation when the relevant clause of the Enterprise Act had not commenced.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para14"></a>Having considered the matter&#151;partly as a result of having my attention drawn to it by the amendment&#151;it is our view that we do not need to retain the power and that the best way of dealing with it is to delete the sentences completely. So we shall bring forward amendments to do just that and to remove the whole of paragraphs 21 and 22 of Schedule 18.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para15"></a>I cannot be so accommodating on the rest of the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-38_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   Perhaps you should just sit down now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The noble Baroness is suggesting that in those clauses which give a very specified power to the Secretary of State we should go for a special super affirmative resolution procedure. That is a concept which is alien to many Members of the Committee and I do not see the need for it. The name of Henry VIII has been much maligned in this context. He would have regarded the provisions as being preposterously restraining on him.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para16"></a>We have to look at the precedents for this. I have quite a long brief here, which I can read out, or I can write to the noble Baroness. There are situations where a special procedure has been operated, more or less in the terms suggested by the noble Baroness, but the provisions to allow that are open-ended provisions to modify legislation in an unspecified way for unspecified reasons. Some of them arose in the Local Government Act&#151;certainly the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, will remember them&#151;and others arose under Northern Ireland legislation, where powers are given to amend the primary legislation without specifying why. In all such cases, including the ones relating to the earlier clauses, there are specified reasons and means for modifying the clause, most of them relating to the implementation of international agreements.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para17"></a>I know that there is a running argument in parts of the House about whether Parliament should negotiate treaties. The practice is that we do not negotiate treaties but the effects of treaties come into legislation. This is one way of making sure that treaties come into legislative operation. It has been used before. It is a very specified and particular reason for what is being called a Henry VIII power. It is not a proper Henry VIII power in the sense that it has a wide range of unspecified actions that the Secretary of State is allowed to take.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para18"></a>Even the marginally more open-ended question of increasing the borrowing limit of the NDA is very specific. I do not therefore believe that in this context <P>


<a name="column_GC91"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC91</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we require a special procedure. It is no different from many of the other contexts in which we use the affirmative procedure. It would be difficult to justify it in this context when a whole range of affirmative resolution procedures are at least of similar provenance and where no open-ended power is given to the Secretary of State. So in all of these instances I would resist the imposition of a special procedure on these clauses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-38_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   It seems to be one to us and three to the Government. I believe that that is a fair summation of what the Minister said.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para19"></a>I thank the Minister for accepting the fact that the paragraphs in the schedule needed to be deleted. It looked as though we were setting a precedent with this group of amendments. It did not last very long, but it was better than nothing.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para20"></a>I shall read carefully what the Minister said. I have had problems with Henry VIII clauses&#151;not only in this Bill but in many Bills&#151;which are creeping more and more into legislation. One must make a stand at some stage and say, "We do not believe that it is right". The Minister referred to another Act which contained such a provision with regard to international agreements, and Clause 72 of this Bill refers to international agreements.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para21"></a>I shall read carefully what the noble Lord has said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para42"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment&#151;and the two that follow at Clauses 128 and 130&#151;relates to the proposed special administration regime for energy licensees. The Department of Trade and Industry consulted on this matter last summer, but there are still some loose ends to tie up.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para43"></a>As we understand the position, there are some inconsistencies in administration arrangements across the different regulated utilities. For example, special administration may be enforced in the water industry for breaches of licence conditions or general duties, yet for the energy sector the assumption is that administration arrangements will apply only in cases of insolvency. Amendment No. 125 is therefore proposed in the interests of good practice and consistency across the board.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para44"></a>Amendment No. 126 relates to Clause 128 and seeks to ensure consultation at a timely and appropriate stage through the established industrial relations machinery. For any employee the experience of having his or her company placed into administration is, at the very least, extremely worrying. It is well known that the consequences, both in terms of future employment security and pension provision, can be dire. It is therefore only right and fair that there should be proper and meaningful consultation throughout any such process. The amendment does not seek to create any new structures, but simply to ensure that existing arrangements are honoured properly.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para45"></a>Amendment No. 127 relates to Clause 130 and seeks confirmation that the arrangements for a special administration regime do not, are not intended to, override the statutory duties on employers of protected persons under the Electricity Act 1989.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para46"></a>Clause 130 appears to lay a duty on the administrator to prioritise the interests of creditors and, subject to them, the interests of members of the company. A clear statement is needed that this statutory duty will not override duties arising under the 1989 Electricity Act.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para47"></a>That Act empowered the Secretary of State to make regulations that would protect employees then in the industry from detriment in respect of their pension provision. These were enacted as the Electricity (Protected Persons) (England and Wales) Pension Regulations 1990. Similar protection was provided for employees in Scotland under Schedule 15 to the Act and the Electricity (Protected Persons) (Scotland) Pension Regulations 1990.
<P>

<a name="40224-38_para48"></a>The regulations impose a duty on the relevant employer to maintain or provide its protected employees and protected beneficiaries&#151;together called "protected persons"&#151;with pension rights on both an ongoing basis and in three particular circumstances. Those circumstances are as follows: first, in the event of the partial or total winding up of the scheme; secondly, arising from the restructuring or change of ownership of the participating employers; and, thirdly, where employees transfer from one employer to another within the electricity industry.

<a name="40224-38_para49"></a>The amendment would also support the objective of maintaining energy network services as this will clearly depend on achieving the fullest co-operation of staff. In such circumstances it will obviously be helpful if staff are not pre-occupied with concerns about their future employment. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-39_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The first amendment seeks to link the objective of energy administration directly to the fulfilment by the company of its licence conditions and its general duties. I understand my noble friend's argument that a company's administration should continue to comply with its licence conditions and we considered whether we should stipulate that in the Bill. However, we concluded that a direct reference to the licence conditions was unnecessary because the energy administrator would, in any event, need to be mindful of the company in administration continuing to comply with all the licence conditions. Otherwise the consequences for members and creditors of the company if it ceased to be licensed could be damaging. We therefore considered that it was not necessary to stipulate that in this context.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para0"></a>It is also unnecessary to link the objective to the fulfilment of the company's general duties, which are quite wide. The objective already links to maintaining and developing an efficient and economical system. Insofar as this is a general duty of the company, there is no need to refer to it again in the clause.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para1"></a>The approach as drafted focuses on the policy objective&#151;which must be the main and overriding reason for introducing the special administration&#151;that there should be no interruption to gas or electricity networks. In other words, the lights should not go out. That is the overriding responsibility of the administrator. Insofar as licence conditions can be complied with within that, clearly there is an expectation that the administrator would ensure that they were. It is important that that overriding responsibility should be spelt out; anything else may cause confusion.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para2"></a>The other two amendments relate to the interests of employees in the case of energy administration. The first deals with a requirement to notify the trade unions of an application. I appreciate that there may well be a general argument for that, which my noble friend Lord Brooke may wish to pursue, but the clause follows the precedent of existing insolvency law and adapts only where necessary for the purposes of energy administration. It would be odd if such a provision were written into this kind of administration if it was not generally provided in other administration circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para3"></a>Clearly the employees are subject to the same protection as in any other "ordinary" administration. It will be for the company to ensure that its employees are properly informed. That is the main area of communication with the trade unions.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para4"></a>Amendment No. 127 would require the energy administrator to exercise his powers in a way which protects the interests of employees, insofar as that is <P>


<a name="column_GC94"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC94</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consistent with the objective of energy administration. That may be highly desirable but, again, we are following the precedent of existing insolvency law and adapting it only where necessary to meet a particular situation. Again, there is no real justification for treating employees of a protected energy company in energy administration differently from those in ordinary administration.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para5"></a>Of course, under existing insolvency law, employees can be classed as creditors under paragraph 99 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986, which is to be found in Schedule 16 to the Enterprise Act 2002. In that regard, their interests would be protected under energy administration just as would those of other creditors. Under paragraph 74 of that schedule to that Act, an employee who is a creditor of the company may apply to the courts if he believes that the administrator is acting unfairly to harm his interests as an employee creditor of the company.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para6"></a>My argument against the second and third amendments is that there is no reason for us to depart from the ordinary rules of administration in this respect. The text therefore follows that objective. The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, referred to a piece of legislation&#151;I did not hear entirely what he said&#151;and suggested that there is a precedent. Clearly if that is the case I shall look at it and consider whether it gives me any cause to modify that argument.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lea, whose name is attached to the amendment, is not in his place. He has been campaigning for such legislation for trade unions for at least 35 years to my knowledge&#151;it was in his evidence to the Donovan commission in 1966&#151;but has never succeeded. He will not succeed through this back door either.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-39_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe: </B>   I thank the Minister for his response. I regret that my noble friend Lord Lea is not in his place to elucidate on the evidence put to the Donovan commission. I certainly do not remember the fine detail of that.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para8"></a>Taking the last point first, if we have raised a precedent that requires further attention, I should be grateful if my noble friend will take the matter away, discuss it with his officials and consider whether there is any opportunity for some variation of what has been stated to meet the precedent previously established.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para9"></a>As to my noble friend's other points, naturally we believe that the Government have recognised, so far as they can, that this is a special piece of work that must be undertaken by specially qualified people. That will ensure that the work is carried out and seen through fully by the best qualified and, in many respects, protected staff.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para10"></a>We have endeavoured in our representations to ensure that employees' terms and conditions are up to the best possible level, particularly in regard to protection of pensions. Indeed, in certain areas, we have tried to achieve minor breakthroughs to ensure that their best interests are protected. I recognise that the generality of applications will similarly apply in this area but I was hoping that we might look for some special changes for involved employees.

"( ) Before making (or proposing to make) an application in relation to a company under this section, or consenting (or proposing to consent) to such an application by GEMA, the Secretary of State must&#151;
<br>
(a) have consulted the directors of that company; and
<br>
(b) be satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect that the company would otherwise be able to avoid going into administration or insolvent liquidation within the meaning of section 214 of the 1986 Act."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40224-39_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: An energy administration order is defined by Clause 126 as one made by a court in relation to a protected energy company. It provides that while the order is in force, the affairs, business and property of the company are to be managed by a person appointed by the court. Clause 128 gives power to apply to the court for an energy administration order. It limits the power to apply for an order to the Secretary of State or to GEMA if the Secretary of State authorises it.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para17"></a>Under the Bill in its present form, there is a danger that an energy administrator might be appointed prematurely. I believe that the test for the exercise of the Secretary of State's power to apply for the appointment of an energy administrator is the same as the court will exercise in deciding whether or not to grant it.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para18"></a>Administrators cost a great deal of money, adding to a defaulting company's problems and depleting still further the funds available to the creditors. It should be recognised that a company in financial trouble can sometimes be rescued or reorganised without an administrator being appointed. This may involve, for example, a formal arrangement with creditors or an informal arrangement with one or more of them.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para19"></a>High profile cases in recent months have included British Energy and AES Drax. In the case of TXU Europe there was a six-week period before the appointment of the administrator. During that period, the orderly sale of the K supply business was achieved. Those three examples are from the competitive, as distinct from the monopoly, segments of the energy market.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para20"></a>However, the appointment of administrators, as distinct from an informal rescue, in any kind of business, including energy administrators, is likely to be a value-destroying step for any company. That is because administrators are bound to act in a somewhat rigid manner. They are not likely to stick out their necks by taking a commercial risk to carry on or <P>


<a name="column_GC96"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC96</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>further the business. Usually, an administrator will be an insolvency practitioner who will have little or no knowledge of the business, even if he has access to outside expert advisers.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para21"></a>It seems desirable, therefore, that the Secretary of State should be required to consult the directors of the company before, in effect, pulling the plug by taking the drastic step of applying for an energy administration order, or even by taking the commercially damaging step of announcing an intention to do so.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para22"></a>The amendment also prohibits the Secretary of State from applying to the court for an energy administration order unless he believes that there is no other reasonable prospect that the company would be unable to avoid liquidation. In other words, the amendment prohibits the Secretary of State from acting in haste. It requires the Secretary of State to consult with those who will know at least as much about the affairs of the company as his advisers and the headline writers in the financial press.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para23"></a>The amendment does not unduly restrict or delay the exercise of the Secretary of State's powers to apply for the appointment of an administrator. Consultation with the directors need not be a lengthy process. It could be carried out in a matter of hours or even in the course of a telephone call. It does not impose on the Secretary of State the responsibility of carefully considering whether it is better for an administrator to be appointed than to allow a rescue to be organised. But having to give consideration to that alternative is no bad thing. It is not a novel idea. It frequently happens in the ordinary world of commerce when a creditor has to decide whether it is better to seek a winding-up order or to appoint an administrator rather than go along with a rescue plan.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para24"></a>I recognise that there is an added dimension in the case of a failing energy company; that is, the need to ensure that there is a continuity of supply to customers. There is no reason to believe that a very short consultation with the directors would prejudice that. Neither would the requirement that the Secretary of State must take all relevant factors into account before deciding whether to apply for an energy administration order.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para25"></a>On the contrary: the effect on customers is one of the matters that the Secretary of State would undoubtedly want to take into account. This amendment, far from inhibiting or restricting the Secretary of State's power to act, will enhance it. By following the procedure laid down in the amendment, he will be protecting himself from a challenge in the courts about the way that he has exercised his discretion. I beg to move.

I have tried to fit in my <P>


<a name="column_GC97"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC97</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mind what the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said about how rapidly that might be operated in extreme circumstances. I must confess that at the moment I find it hard to reconcile the notion that it could be done in hours or on a telephone and still meet what I think is the quite serious test of no reasonable alternative, which might well be difficult. Of course, it could be brief&#151;that is not inconceivable&#151;but it would be difficult.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para26"></a>I hope that what I have already said illustrates that I completely understand the proposers' concern that the Secretary of State should not use premature powers or act precipitately&#151;possibilities that have been described&#151;and should not seek an energy administration order lightly. That is quite right. By any standards, that would be a very serious matter. The noble Baroness referred to the rights of the creditors and the desire to explore other options. The delays that are sometimes needed in order to consider what the alternatives might be were also mentioned. They are all serious matters.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para27"></a>I concur that the Secretary of State first should be satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect that the company can avoid going into administration or insolvent liquidation by means of a workout or some alternative solution. To do that he would no doubt normally consult the protected energy company and others, such as the regulator and insolvency experts, as appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para28"></a>However, it would not be appropriate to place either requirement envisaged by the amendment in the Bill. The purpose of the provisions for energy administration for protected energy companies is to ensure, as the noble Baroness said, that "the lights stay on". In the most extreme circumstances, there should be a provision to ensure that the lights stay on in the very unlikely event that such a company faces insolvency. I do not imagine that that would be an event which would occur with great frequency.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para29"></a>However, I say to the noble Baroness that were there to be any risk of the lights going out, by any standards, it would be an extremely dire and public event that would cause considerable consternation. For those reasons, it is important to think about the alternatives that we believe are already in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para30"></a>I should add that I take very seriously the noble Baroness's argument that by and large administrators are averse to commercial risks. However, in the extreme circumstances of a real risk of the lights going out, I doubt whether anyone would take any risks on the side of Government because of the serious consequences.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para31"></a>In exceptional circumstances&#151;clearly they would be very exceptional circumstances&#151;this may require the Secretary of State to act with the greatest possible dispatch. It cannot be right to require him first to consult the directors of the company or fully to satisfy a test that "there is no reasonable prospect" that the company would otherwise be able to avoid administration or insolvent liquidation. As always, the Secretary of State will have to act within the bounds of <P>


<a name="column_GC98"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC98</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>administrative law. In any sense, that is a constraint that must remain. But he should not be further constrained at the point when that rather more remarkable and dramatic circumstance potentially could occur.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para32"></a>I would also observe that even where there is no consultation prior to the making of an application, there should be sufficient time before the hearing for the Secretary of State to discuss the application with the company. It would be possible for the Secretary of State to withdraw the energy administration application if, following discussions with the company, it appeared that energy administration was unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para33"></a>The Secretary of State has a duty to serve notice of the application on certain interested parties listed in the Bill once the application has been filed at court. Therefore, there will be a short window in which to make representations to the Secretary of State before the hearing and a further opportunity to raise objections at the hearing. Alternatively, if the interested parties concur with the Secretary of State's judgment, it is intended that they will be able to waive this notice period under the energy administration rules.
<P>

<a name="40224-39_para34"></a>I therefore hope to assure Members of the Committee that energy administration will not be sought lightly. The reason that the Secretary of State must have freedom to act quickly would be to keep the lights on. In those circumstances, the amendment is inappropriate. In conclusion of this point, I recognise that the circumstances I am describing probably would occur either not at all or very rarely. But the provision of a safety net of this kind in legislation is none the less, in our view, essential.

<A NAME="40224-40_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   The noble Lord said that he cannot conceive circumstances in which a transmission company might find itself in the difficulties envisaged in the clause. One must remember that this does apply only to transmission companies. However, the same might have been said about British Energy shortly before it had to come before the Secretary of State to say that there would be a number of unpaid bills. The Government had to step in with substantial sums of money with the threat of administration hanging over their head. I heard this morning, in a report to the all-party nuclear group, that British Energy is well on its way to hauling itself out of its difficulties and may be able to repay its Government loan. I regard that as good news.
<P>

<a name="40224-40_para0"></a>On the whole, the British Energy situation was reasonably well handled. But one must recognise why it arose. As the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, told us in the debates on the Electricity Act last year, British Energy got into difficulties because it did not have a retail arm that could pay the losses on its generating arm, whereas most other generating companies had a retail arm, with the result&#151;as we know well and the Select Committee in another place complained&#151;that there was no reduction in retail electricity prices to reflect the 40 per cent reduction in wholesale electricity prices. Therefore, in one sense, Ofgem's <P>


<a name="column_GC99"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC99</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>administration of NETA was a direct cause of the collapse of British Energy, which drove prices down to a level at which British Energy could no longer make a profit.
<P>

<a name="40224-40_para1"></a>For most of today, we have been talking about the regulation of transmission companies and the issue of licences, changes, codes, and so on. I am sorry to speak for so long, but I come to my point. In the light of the experience that we saw with NETA, I do not believe that the regulators would not drive the transmission company into a position where it is unable to meet its obligations.
<P>

<a name="40224-40_para2"></a>The Government have recognised that this is a very serious matter by introducing an entire chapter to this part of the Bill to give them the power to do so. I would regard it as quite strange if they said that it is purely hypothetical and will not happen. It happened at British Energy, with considerable embarrassment to the Government, who had to step in. That is all history&#151;but I do not regard a recurrence as inconceivable.
<P>

<a name="40224-40_para3"></a>I hope that the new administration at BETTA will recognise that there is no future in driving prices down&#151;whether generating prices or transmission costs&#151;to the point where companies cannot pay their bills. This is an important chapter. It is important to have appropriate safeguards. I have listened carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, said. I hope that the Government will give some further thought to this so that they do not simply step in and take the actions envisaged under this chapter without there having been a proper opportunity for the directors of a company to explain their case and where they stand.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-40_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   It is entirely right and fair that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, should refer our attention to British Energy. I understand that potentially such occasions could occur. I think that they would be relatively unusual occasions. A critical point in the noble Lord's submission was that here was an example where, with time and a great deal of discussion, the company has begun to develop ways in which it can successfully survive. I hope that the generality of cases would be ones in which time was available for all kinds of consultation and opportunities to seek expert advice, as a result of which the company could survive.
<P>

<a name="40224-40_para4"></a>In general, the regulator will be required to assure the financial viability of the network companies and it would be something of a surprise to stumble on some of these events without knowing that they might occur. None the less, I accept that it could happen. I do not want to speculate about such circumstances overmuch. I concede that such a scenario is a possibility. However, it is hard to imagine that an emergency might frequently occur where the Secretary of State felt that he had no time at all to consult or to think about any options of the kinds mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin.
<P>

<a name="40224-40_para5"></a>I should like to pose the question in different terms. Could we guarantee that such a scenario would never in any circumstances occur? The answer is that probably none of us are satisfied that that could never happen. In circumstances where we are not satisfied <P>


<a name="column_GC100"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>that it could never happen, there needs to be some reserve powers that give sufficient authority to ensure that the lights stay on.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-40_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I should like to draw the noble Lord's attention to a point that I made at Second Reading. Under the operations of NETA, the Ofgem regime of the time, Callum McCarthy thought that he was doing a marvellous job in getting prices down by 40 per cent. When it was pointed out to him that he was simply driving one generator after another into administration or bankruptcy, he said, "Well, that's the cost of getting prices down". I hope that Sir John Mogg and his colleagues at Ofgem will not take that high-handed view. When Callum McCarthy went off to run the Financial Services Authority, my comment in the House was, "God help the banks".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-40_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I should be very careful not to trespass into the reasons why British Energy or others faced difficulties, but I understand the point made by the noble Lord. I hope that noble Lords will forgive me for reiterating that if we ourselves cannot be satisfied that a really urgent circumstance could never occur, it is sensible to make provision for that very rare possibility.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-40_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I thank my noble friend for his timely intervention and for pointing out the situation with regard to British Energy and NETA, which I think that most noble Lords accept are the real reasons why British Energy unfortunately got itself into so much trouble. We only hope that BETTA really is better in that respect. It is interesting that Part 3, Chapter 3, is such a large chapter dealing with the special administration regime for energy licensees, energy administration orders, and so forth. I do not imagine for one moment that it could be quite that rare, otherwise it would be unusual to have such a big portion of the Bill dealing with the matter. I think that that is there as insurance so that people know what to do.
<P>

<a name="40224-40_para6"></a>I am sorry that the Minister does not see a need for my amendment. He was quite complimentary about how it was dealt with and spoken to. However, I shall read carefully what he said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-40_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty </B>   moved Amendment No. 127B:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 220, line 1, leave out sub-paragraph (2) and insert&#151;

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<br>
"(a) a voluntary arrangement approved under Part 1, or
<br>
(b) a compromise or arrangement sanctioned under section 425 of the Companies Act (compromise with creditors and members).""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40224-40_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: In speaking to Amendment No. 127B, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 127C to 127G. The amendments correct minor drafting errors in Schedule 20, which provides for Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986, to which I referred earlier, to have effect in relation to energy administration, amended to allow for the circumstances of energy administration.
<P>

<a name="40224-40_para19"></a>I assure Members of the Committee that none of the amendments makes any difference to the substance of the schedule. I therefore hope that Members of the Committee would be prepared to accept them. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-40_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   The schedule seems most amazing. I would not have the slightest idea whether the amendments were an improvement; nor would any lawyer at present. Would it not be possible to republish the schedule, rather than referring to countless amendments? It is very difficult to understand, which seems bad drafting practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-40_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   It is normal drafting practice, but no doubt the noble Baroness is nevertheless correct to say that it is pretty incomprehensible. It would obviously have been better had we reproduced the 1986 schedule as amended by our proposals in the original Explanatory Notes. I regret that we did not do so, but we can provide a version of what is now Schedule B1 before the next reprint of the Explanatory Notes, if that would be helpful, and copy it to the Committee. I shall need to check whether, if the amendments are accepted now, they can be incorporated, so that all the infelicities of drafting can be removed. That might be helpful. However, the individual amendments are minor and it would make more sense to make a complete schedule available before Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-40_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am concerned not so much for the Members of the Grand Committee, this House or the other place, but the people who must operate the Bill when enacted. The amount that it will cost in legal fees for someone to sit looking up what all the changes amount to will be enormous over the years. There is a strong argument for reproducing the schedule in its final form in the Bill. That is what I was suggesting, but perhaps I am wrong about that.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-41_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Perhaps it would help the Government if we said that we would not accept the amendments, so that they could get it right by Report. That would fit well with what my noble friend said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   That would be to confuse ourselves further. There may be infelicities in the drafting now <P>


<a name="column_GC102"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC102</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>but, if we can put them right before the next stage, we could see what the schedule would look like as amended both by the original Bill and the drafting amendments. If we did what the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, suggests, and did not adopt the amendments until then, we would need yet another version of the schedule between Report and Third Reading.
<P>

<a name="40224-41_para0"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, is undoubtedly right that it is difficult to interpret. Without committing my colleagues to not producing equally complicated cross-references between different Acts, if we can do so for this Bill, that will be incorporated in the next reprint of the Explanatory Notes, if that would be helpful to the Committee. Without wanting to be churlish, it would be better to adopt the amendments so that any misdrafting can be corrected before the next stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-41_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I thank the Minister and my noble friend Lady Carnegy for her comments. It is terrible when we receive letters with "Defra" written across the top and know that something else is coming and they say, "These are all simple drafting amendments". However simple they are, we must quickly look through them in case we are told off because they were not quite so simple or involved more than drafting amendments.
<P>

<a name="40224-41_para1"></a>Normally, it is easy for me because I have a lawyer on tap at home and pass it on, saying, "What do you think about this?". I must tell the Committee that he took great exception to looking at this. I was interfering with social events when he wanted to watch various programmes on the television. The document is 10 pages long and refers non-stop to other documents. He pointed out to me that if I really wanted him to give a legal opinion, I would have to pay for it. I did not think that the Government would take that on board.
<P>

<a name="40224-41_para2"></a>It is important that we try to make things simple. This is not the first time that this has happened; we get it all the time. Schedules always refer to this, that and the other provision and one must be a knowledgeable lawyer to cope with what is being said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-41_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Roper: </B>   I am grateful for what the Minister said, but I feel that the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, are worthy of greater consideration. Will the Minister give me an assurance that paragraph 312 of the Explanatory Notes, which refers to Schedule 20 at the moment and is rather brief, will be reprinted in extenso incorporating effectively Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended by this legislation? If that were the case, and if it were possible to do that by Report, it would clarify the issue and be helpful. I would be grateful if the Minister could give me such an assurance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-41_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   That is the intention. Clearly, it would probably be produced as an annex and would refer to that paragraph rather than disturbing the literary flow of the Explanatory Notes. That would be our intention, and we could obviously provide it to noble <P>

<A NAME="40224-41_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding </B>   moved Amendment No. 128:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 107, line 25, leave out "appropriate" and insert "necessary"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-41_para14"></a><P>

<a name="40224-41_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving the amendment, one can be fairly brief as it speaks for itself. The question is whether, under Clause 140(1), the Secretary of State should be able to make modifications to the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"conditions of a gas or electricity licence held by a particular person",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-41_para16"></a>
simply if he considers it appropriate. I hope that someone will be able to explain that that means by any person holding any licence, and not only the company that may have had to have an administrator appointed. That seems a wholly subjective test. If we substitute "necessary", as I suggest in the amendment, clearly that would be justiciable. If not, one would have to prove bad faith in order to resist having one's licence amended under the clause. That is the effect of "appropriate". With "necessary", it is clearly open to parties to argue whether a particular licence change affecting any person holding a gas or electricity licence was necessary in the light of the energy administration.
<P>

<a name="40224-41_para17"></a>I strongly argue that, because a very wide number of licence holders could be affected&#151;perhaps all the licence holders who supply or draw electricity from the company that has gone into administration&#151;the measure ought to be subject to a fairly clear justiciable test. "Necessary" does that and "appropriate" does not.

<a name="40224-41_para18"></a>The Government would be wise to accept Amendment No. 129, regardless of whether they agree with Amendment No. 128. To the words in subsection (5):
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State must publish every modification made by him under this section",

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-41_para19"></a>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-41_para20"></a>
I am sure that he could do that in a letter. If he is to hold this stringent power with considerable consequences for many licence holders, then when he publishes a statement of what he has done in the modification, the statute should require him to set out the reasons why. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-41_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has made clear, Amendment No. 128 would reduce the discretion of the Secretary of State to make modifications to licence conditions. I hope that noble Lords will not mind my saying that the proposed change from "appropriate" to "necessary" revisits some of the issues on discretion. I shall not go through all the arguments that we have rehearsed throughout our debates; I shall deal with the amendment. Rather than allow the Secretary of State to make modifications where "appropriate", it is proposed to allow her to do so only where she considers it "necessary".
<P>

<a name="40224-41_para21"></a>I understand the concern and I have been attentive to the arguments made in its support at other points in our discussion of the Bill. There is concern that the power should not be overused. Although the term,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where the Secretary of State considers it appropriate",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-41_para22"></a>
may sound too loose for the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, it is none the less standard legal terminology with a considerable number of precedents. In saying that, I am fully aware that Members of the Opposition have objected to the fact that the number of precedents has been growing. Indeed, that is part of their objection. However, the fact is that that is how legal terminology is now constructed. Furthermore, the powers exercisable by the Secretary of State to make those modifications would be construed in accordance with administrative law. The modifications made would need to be reasonable and for the purposes of this particular provision, not wider.
<P>

<a name="40224-41_para23"></a>It may assist Members of the Committee if I point out that we intend to use this power to make such modifications as are required to secure the recovery of costs of energy administration. That is its purpose. We do not at present envisage any wider exercise of the power. I should add that in consideration of that, we have had no adverse representations from the industry about the provision as stated and with those purposes in mind.
<P>

<a name="40224-41_para24"></a>I hope that I have it right that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, asked about "discussion with any person". That may well be a wide requirement, but plainly the Secretary of State will need to make a judgment about who should be consulted in such circumstances.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-41_para25"></a>Amendment No. 129 would require the Secretary of State to make a statement outlining the reasons for making a licence modification. In effect it is an appeal for transparency and is one of a number of such appeals that have been made. I understand the point and I take note that it has been urged throughout.
<P>

<a name="40224-41_para26"></a>However, we believe that the amendment is unnecessary because there is an existing duty on the Secretary of State to give reasons for modifications to the conditions of a licence. Section 49A of the Electricity Act 1989 and Section 38A of the Gas Act 1986 require the Secretary of State to publish reasons as soon as reasonably practicable after modifying the conditions of a licence. That will include modifying the standard conditions. So that is an obligation currently in legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-42_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I am sorry to interrupt, but I want to make sure that I understand the noble Lord. While that applies to the standard conditions and licences, would it apply where there is a modification of an individual licence that has been granted to a particular person? Do the earlier clauses apply to them? That is what distinguishes this case from the others.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-42_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   Section 49A applies to the following decisions of the Secretary of State: the revocation of a licence, modifications of the conditions of a licence, the giving of any direction or consent in pursuance of a condition included in a licence by virtue of other sections of the Act, the determination of a question referred in pursuance of a condition included in a licence by virtue of the section, a determination of a dispute referred to under the various sections of the Act, the making of final orders, the making or confirmation of provisional orders and the revocation of a final or provisional order which has been confirmed. In short, it is comprehensive. I hope that I made it clear in my answer that it is the conditions of the other clauses that require the Secretary of State to publish reasons as soon as reasonably practicable after modifying the conditions of a licence in all those circumstances. I sought merely to add the thought that it also includes modifying the standard conditions themselves. It is genuinely comprehensive. I hope that that answers the question put by the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para0"></a>The notice would need to be published in a way considered appropriate by the Secretary of State for the purpose of bringing the matter to the attention of persons likely to be interested. Ofgem must also send a copy of the notice to the licence holders to whom the modification relates. Ofgem is subject to the same requirements if it makes a modification to the licence conditions. It cannot escape from the set of criteria that I have just outlined.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para1"></a>I hope that noble Lords will forgive me for elaborating at length, but I thought that a comprehensive response was the only appropriate way to deal with the serious question put to me by the noble <P>

<A NAME="40224-42_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord for his very comprehensive reply. I turn first to the second amendment. He has answered in full the point that I sought to make. The only point I want to add is that I am full of admiration for the speed with which the piece of paper was put into his hand. He is well served by his officials. If there are now blushes behind the Minister, then so be it.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para2"></a>On the first issue, the only point I wish to make is that I hope it will not necessarily be taken as a point against an amendment that it has not been suggested by one of the outside interests. This Committee is a place in which Members can apply their own judgment to the legislation before them. Many points have been proposed for amendments that were not suggested by outside interests. I hope that that is not regarded as an argument against an amendment. Perhaps the outside interests have greater faith in the competence of Ministers to regard modifications as appropriate because they will only be the ones that they will not mind.

<A NAME="40224-42_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 130A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 141, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-42_para8"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "EXERCISE OF REGULATORY FUNCTIONS
<br>
 Where an energy administrator has been appointed in relation to a protected energy company in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, the Secretary of State and GEMA, in carrying out their respective functions under Part 1 of the Gas Act 1986 (c. 44) (gas supply) and Part 1 of the Electricity Act 1989 (c. 29) (electricity supply), must have regard to the need to ensure that the energy administrator is able to fulfil his obligations in relation to the business of the company."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40224-42_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: In the case of an ordinary commercial company regulated by the Companies Act, the duties of a receiver or manager are primarily to the secured creditor who has appointed him. It is a duty to recover the debt owing to that creditor, even though that may not suit the wishes or even the best interests of the other creditors or shareholders.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para10"></a>However, when the Secretary of State appoints an energy administrator, she is doing so in the interests of ensuring continuity of supply and of protecting customers. The aim of the amendment is to require Ofgem, the gas and electricity regulator, to take account of the functions and duties of an energy administrator appointed in relation to a protected company.
<P>


<a name="column_GC107"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC107</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para11"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there can be no risk that the work and objectives of an energy administration regime could be frustrated by a conflict with an inappropriate regulatory action.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para12"></a>It is a matter of concern that the regulatory actions of Ofgem during the period of an energy administration will set the framework within which the energy administrator can perform his functions, but may also impact on his freedom of movement in the exercise of his discretion. There is, therefore, the potential for Ofgem, in exercising its statutory functions, to clash with the energy administrator in the exercise of his functions.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para13"></a>That is not just a hypothetical possibility. This amendment was inspired by a recent event. In the special administration of Railtrack, such a dispute did arise. Without going into unnecessary detail, that case arose in relation to the rail administrator's important power to determine track access charges. The case went as far as the Court of Appeal, with both parties being funded, in effect, by the taxpayer. The litigation revealed that the relevant legislation did not establish a clear predominance of powers between the administrator and the regulator.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para14"></a>The lesson has clearly not been learnt because the same defect is evident in the treatment of energy administration set out in the present Bill. The issue is a particular problem in the case of energy supply. Although the regulator's duties and those of the administrator may overlap in some cases, they are not the same. In some cases, therefore, that could lead to each of them reaching a different conclusion.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para15"></a>Energy administration as provided for in the Bill is, in essence, a variation of the normal insolvency regime. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, energy administration must reflect the public interest in the operation of the network. But the regulator has no duty to recognise the functions of the administrator when he exercises his own powers. That is an undesirable situation which this amendment seeks to put right.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para16"></a>To avoid any unnecessary clashes and misunderstandings, and even the potential for them, as between the administrator and the regulator, the amendment places a duty on the regulator to have regard to the functions and duties of the administrator. Bearing in mind that the administrator will have been appointed at the behest of the regulator, this should not be an onerous burden, rather it should be one which the regulator should be willing to assume without having been told to do so. Indeed, it might be an unreasonable exercise of his powers if he fails to do so.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para17"></a>The amendment does not create, or even suggest, any ascendancy of the administrator over the regulator, or vice versa. On the contrary, the amendment will help to foster a relationship of mutual co-operation which is more conducive to meeting the purposes of an administration regime quickly, efficiently and in the public interest. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-42_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I understand the concerns that the interaction between the regulator and the energy <P>


<a name="column_GC108"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC108</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>administrator should be clear and that the administrator should not be unreasonably frustrated by the operation of the regulator. However, I draw a slightly different conclusion from the recent court case of Winsor v Bloom in relation to Railtrack.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para18"></a>The decision, and the moratorium on the enforcement of proprietary and legal rights against a company in special administration, also applicable in an energy administration, provide ample clarity as to how the two bodies should interact. The moratorium provisions prevent the instigation of legal proceedings against the company without either the consent of the energy administrator or, alternatively, the leave of the court. That provides the protected company with a "breathing space" in order for it to organise its financial affairs.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para19"></a>In Winsor v Bloom the court considered the moratorium and its effect on the enforcement of proprietary and legal rights. The decision in that case confirms that a company in energy administration will still be under a duty to comply with all its legal and regulatory requirements. Those duties would be unaffected by the energy administration order. Ofgem will still be able to carry out its regulatory function in respect of the company, including the making of determinations and imposing enforcement orders. However, under the moratorium provisions, Ofgem would need either to secure the consent of the energy administrator or the leave of the court to institute legal proceedings against the company, should it be required to enforce any of its decisions.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para20"></a>That decision of the Court of Appeal seems to strike a balance different from that proposed in the amendment. Energy administration should not reduce the regulatory obligations of the company in energy administration, nor should it affect the duties of the regulator, except in accordance with the moratorium, the safeguards and the built-in breathing space. The law following Winsor v Bloom seems clear and clarifies the relationship. It would be inappropriate and unhelpful for the Bill to make slightly different provisions, as the amendment would do, in respect of energy administration.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para21"></a>It should also be borne in mind that Ofgem is under a duty to have regard to the need to secure that the company can finance its own activities. The duty on Ofgem is not altered by the fact that the company is in energy administration.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para22"></a>In my submission, the courts have now provided ample clarity on the relationship between the regulator and the special administrator, covering the regulator's actions towards the company in administration. They will obviously be constrained by the usual dictates of administrative law, and also by Ofgem's special requirements to have regard to the need to secure that the company can finance its activities.
<P>

<a name="40224-42_para23"></a>I draw a slightly different conclusion: the courts have already given us ample clarification of the relationship, and it would be wrong to put it in different terms on the face of the Bill.

 REMIT FOR GEMA TO REGULATE ENVIRONMENTAL MARKETS
<br>
(1) In addition to the regulatory powers conferred on GEMA by the 1989 Act (as amended), GEMA or a body authorised by GEMA, or to whom GEMA shall have the right to delegate any of its functions, shall have power to regulate environmental markets so that such markets are recognised and regulated as markets in their own right, and not only as compliance tools in the regulation of gas and electricity markets.

(2) The power conferred on GEMA by this section shall include a power to regulate, so far as it lies within the competence of the United Kingdom government, environmental markets which will be developed under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme.
<br>
(3) Regulations may be made to define the scope of the power conferred on GEMA by this section, including appropriate enforcement powers."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40224-43_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment stands in my name and that of my noble friends. It would introduce a new clause headed:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Remit for GEMA to regulate environmental markets".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40224-43_para4"></a>
It is interesting to reflect that the UK has taken a lead internationally in developing and establishing environmental markets. The market in renewable obligation certificates has become an effective instrument for enabling people to be certain that they will derive the benefit from their certificates that they had bargained for&#151;and for companies to sell them on and others to buy them. It is a precursor of the European emissions trading scheme, which is another market that has developed in the environmental field.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para5"></a>The financial services industry in this country can be proud that it was the first to develop that kind of market. Of course there have been other emission trading schemes; for example, 20 years ago in Chicago there was a trading scheme in PM10 particulates. Nevertheless, given the way that the market has developed here, its sophistication and the number of participants, it has certainly established itself.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para6"></a>If these markets are to work well, they need sound regulation and effective compliance measures. In the UK, despite the lead we have taken, it is not clear who is regulating these markets. My inquiries reveal that this is a matter of some concern to those operating in them. I should say that these are substantial markets. <P>


<a name="column_GC110"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC110</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>By 2010, the cash flows from renewable energy, if it achieves 10 per cent of the market, could be worth 2 billion, one third of the value of the cash flow from all electricity generation. Much of that will be subject to the buying and selling of certificates. Thus I make the case that such a market needs to be regulated and to work efficiently.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para7"></a>GEMA, the regulator, has no remit to consider how environmental markets work, including for example the renewable energy market and ROCs, and notwithstanding that these affect energy prices and consumers. GEMA is able to take into account only the effect on the environment of the generation, transmission, distribution and supply of energy, and not vice versa.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para8"></a>One example where Ofgem could make a practical difference to the market is to alter its registry for renewable obligation certificates. Currently, the registry works adequately to provide a compliance mechanism for the obligation and, as such, fulfils Ofgem's present responsibility in the area. But it also means that Ofgem cannot spend resources on anything that would improve the market.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para9"></a>As the European emissions trading scheme and the Kyoto-related markets develop, which they assuredly will, it is ever more important that these environmental markets are recognised as markets in their own right, not just as compliance tools for the energy industries. This is important because improving the efficiency of the environmental market will lead to reduced costs.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para10"></a>Perhaps I may cite an example. When the hole in the buy-out fund appeared following TXU going into administration, the next auction of ROCs achieved a significantly lower price than had been the case before. The result was that ROCs became less attractive and, to that extent, impacted adversely on the Government's targets for achieving renewable energy supplies.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para11"></a>I would argue that it is not enough for GEMA and Ofgem to regulate in the sense of managing the energy industries. They are dealing here with a market in its own right, one that needs to be regulated. In addition to Ofgem's increased regulatory powers in this area, improving environmental markets and having a positive effect on consumers, it will also help the authority to achieve the Government's environmental targets as set out in the White Paper. If an environmental market such as that for ROCs&#151;and there will be others&#151;can be made to work more efficiently, it will become more likely that the goals and targets set by the Government will be met. The costs of meeting any goal will decrease, which means that a given amount of money will go further. It also means that it will become more attractive for players to become involved in the market, increasing its financeability, investment, market activity and liquidity, and reducing costs further.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para12"></a>The case for the proper regulation of the environmental market is strong and now needs to be firmly addressed by the Government. If GEMA is not to regulate it, then who shall it be? Someone will have to take on the regulatory role. Would it be the <P>


<a name="column_GC111"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC111</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Financial Services Authority? However, it is not familiar with this area of national policy, whereas GEMA is deeply involved and could perfectly well take on the role.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para13"></a>The case for GEMA to do it is that it would be a form of joined-up regulation. As it is involved in the energy market, it could be involved in these environmental markets. The case is now being addressed. And, if I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, it was addressed by an outside body which is a substantial operator in the market. It is looking for clearer and firmer regulation so as to make the market better. Efficient markets are more attractive to more players. As more players become involved, all the other advantages will flow.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para14"></a>There is much to be said for this amendment. I have discussed it at some length with those who are involved and I have been convinced that something of this kind is necessary. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-43_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I share the sentiments of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, as regards the important and positive role that environment markets can play in meeting environmental objectives, and the need to ensure that the markets operate properly and efficiently and are authentic.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para15"></a>The amendment give GEMA the power to regulate markets and to give environmental credits and certificates&#151;which, as the noble Lord said, means ROCs&#151;the European emissions trading scheme and other trading schemes which may come out of the large combustion plants directive and so forth. There are two issues. First, the amendment would hugely widen Ofgem/GEMA's powers, which are at present based on gas and electricity. The players in these markets cover a wider range of industries and would therefore change the nature of Ofgem/GEMA considerably. Although Ofgem administers a number of environmental programmes and covers an environmental action plan, its main remit is on competition and consumer protection. The participants in trading schemes have a different relationship with consumers and there is a different structure of industry from the gas and electricity industries.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para16"></a>Once the emissions trading scheme is set up, there will also be other structures to regulate those markets. There are two aspects. First, there is the management of the environmental outcome of the market&#151;setting the targets and authenticating the achievements in environmental terms, which in the UK is the Environment Agency&#151;and the propriety of the market and its functioning, which will be the responsibility of the FSA as with other markets. It is true that while the FSA does not have the experience of these markets, which are just developing, it has huge experience of markets as a whole. It would bring that experience to bear.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para17"></a>There are a number of aspects which it would not be immediately appropriate for Ofgem to run or would end up with it clashing with other and more appropriate regulators. There is an underlying question, too: that is, what is the basic remit of Ofgem? <P>


<a name="column_GC112"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column GC112</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The noble Lord will know that there have been a number of discussions on whether Ofgem should have more explicit environmental objectives than the current legislation gives it.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para18"></a>There have been many arguments discussing that in the context of the energy White Paper, but the decision was that it should not be broadened into those environmental objectives and that it should be a matter for the government departments and the appropriate environmental regulators. Whether one agrees with that decision or not, that is the legislative position. Therefore, to give Ofgem powers in an area for which it does not have mainstreams in its objectives would seem to me a mismatch of function and role.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para19"></a>The other point on the amendments is that there is a power for Ofgem to delegate its powers to a new body set up specifically for this purpose. It seems to me that if we are considering setting up a new body, specifically in relation to the renewables obligations market, that should be considered in the round rather than tacked on to Ofgem's responsibilities, which run into a number of conflicts in any case.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para20"></a>There may be a case for having a different body regulating the totality of the market. The Committee will know that a review of the obligation is scheduled for 2005&#150;06. Any decisions relating to the regulation of that market are perhaps best left for that, rather than establish it as a knock-on to Ofgem/GEMA's responsibilities under the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40224-43_para21"></a>I return to the main point. It would bring the Ofgem/GEMA set-up into an area of industry for which it currently has no wider responsibility. That seems to me to lead to some difficult areas of conflict and lack of clarity. I do not disagree that the Government need to think carefully about the regulation of those markets, particularly as there will be growth in a number of them. However, I do not believe that we should jump to this conclusion and impose the obligation on Ofgem.

It might be the Financial Services Authority.
<P>

<a name="40224-44_para0"></a>I hope that the Government will be able to think about the issue between now and the Report stage. I shall certainly consult on it. I am tempted to say that we should bring back another amendment, perhaps appointing a different regulator or imposing a different duty on the Government to provide for the regulation of these markets. As the Minister recognised, the efficient working of these derivative markets, if such they are, is an important instrument in developing the Government's overall energy policy. No one denies that. But if the market is not working properly because there is no effective regulator and because no one has the power to help to increase the liquidity of the market to attract more players so that <P>

<P>

<a name="40224-44_para1"></a>I am grateful to the Minister, wearing his Defra hat, for going as far as he did in recognising the need for regulation. I suspect that we may want to try again, but we will look most carefully at what he said. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

The administration cost limit has been increased by &#163;34,000 from &#163;163,375,000 to &#163;163,409,000.

<a name="40224-44_para20"></a>The change in the resource element of the DEL arises from a change in the budgeting treatment for pension schemes (&#163;25,000,000) and from the net effect of transfers to and from other government departments (&#163;3,325,000). The increase in administration costs (&#163;34,000) is also as a net effect of transfers to and from other government departments.

<P>

<a name="40224-44_para22"></a>I am today publishing for consultation a draft of Planning Policy Statement 1 (PPS1)&#151;<i>Creating Sustainable Communities</i>&#151;the core statement of the Government's key planning policies. I am also publishing a paper on the Government's approach to community involvement in planning.
<P>


<a name="column_WS13"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column WS13</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-44_para23"></a>PPS1 is the key overarching document which sets out the Government's high level principles for planning.
<P>

<a name="40224-44_para24"></a>Clause 39 (Clause 38, the sustainable development clause, as was) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill requires regional and local plans to be drawn up with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development. The clause requires that in doing so, planning authorities must have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State. PPS1 will be a key document underpinning this requirement.
<P>

<a name="40224-44_para25"></a>PPS1 is based on three themes:
<P>

<a name="40224-44_para26"></a>Planning for sustainable communities and sustainable development;
<P>

<a name="40224-44_para27"></a>The new approach to planning we are promoting as part of planning culture change (the spatial planning approach); and
<P>

<a name="40224-44_para28"></a>Community involvement in planning.

<P>

<a name="40224-44_para29"></a><i>Sustainable development


</i><P>

<a name="40224-44_para30"></a>Our legislation will make contributing to the achievement of sustainable development the key purpose of the planning system. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister should expect planning policies to pursue proactively the four aims of sustainable development&#151;economic development; social inclusion; environmental protection; and prudent use of natural resources&#151;in an integrated way, in line with the Government's overall strategy for sustainable development.

<P>

<a name="40224-44_para31"></a><i>Spatial Planning

</i><P>

<a name="40224-44_para32"></a>The new regional and local plans provided for in the Bill are based on the philosophy of spatial planning. Spatial planning goes beyond traditional land use planning to bring together and integrate policies for the development and use of land with other policies and programmes which influence the nature of places and how they function.
<P>

<a name="40224-44_para33"></a>PPS1 sets out the spatial planning approach that will be adopted in the new planning system. These planning tools will reflect real geographies and real community issues, and are thus a flexible approach to planning and sustainable development.
<P>

<a name="40224-44_para34"></a><i>Community involvement


</i><P>

<a name="40224-44_para35"></a>Effective community involvement is a vital element in delivering sustainable communities. Our aim should be to develop effective community involvement processes which enable a better understanding of the sometimes difficult choices which have to be made in considering development and more ownership of the accompanying decisions.
<P>

<a name="40224-44_para36"></a>We need of course to strike a balance between promoting effective community involvement without allowing the system to be bogged down by endless consultation exercises. I want the reformed system to emphasise community involvement as a way of helping to resolve problems early in the process and secure ownership, so that when plans and proposals are put forward, there are fewer objections.
<P>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column WS14</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40224-44_para37"></a>The paper makes clear that community involvement should be based on a real understanding of the community's needs, should be fit for purpose, and should be front loaded&#151;i.e. involvement early in the process.
<P>

<a name="40224-44_para38"></a>PPS1 can only set out the key policy principles for community involvement in planning. To put these in context, the community involvement paper sets out our general philosophy on community involvement in planning, and puts this in the broader context of policy.
<P>

<a name="40224-44_para39"></a>Copies of the two documents will be available in the Libraries of the House. They will also be available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website at (www.odpm.gov.uk/stellent/groups/odpm&#150;planning/documents/sectionhomepage/odpm&#150;planning&#150;page.hcsp)

<A NAME="40224-45_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My right honourable friend the Minister for Local Government, Regional Governance and Fire has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para0"></a>The Government have today published a consultation paper setting out their proposals for draft regulations under Section 66 of the Local Government Act 2000. These proposals will make provision for local government monitoring officers in England, in cases where ethical standards officers of the Standards Board for England deem it appropriate, to investigate allegations that local authority members have breached their code of conduct. The Government are consulting on this issue over the next three months, and at the same time the Standards Board for England is consulting on draft guidance for monitoring officers on how they can best undertake their duties under the proposed regulations.
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para1"></a>We need to ensure the highest possible ethical standards in local government, but we need a system which is efficient and workable. This approach is a sensible, effective and proportionate way of handling allegations of misconduct at a local level.
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para2"></a>Copies of the consultation paper are being sent to local authorities and will be available in the Libraries of the House, as well as being made available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website at www.odpm.gov.uk.

<A NAME="40224-45_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para3"></a>On Friday the Government tabled amendments to the Housing Bill which is currently being considered by the House in Committee. These amendments meet a number of the recommendations of the Park Homes <P>


<a name="column_WS15"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column WS15</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Working Party and aim to deal with some of the key concerns about the existing legislation.
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para4"></a>They amend the Mobile Homes Act 1983 to require a written statement of terms to be given to a prospective occupier 28 days before the agreement to station a park home on a site is entered into. At present written statements may be given up to three months after the agreement has commenced.
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para5"></a>In the event of the owner failing to produce the written statement in advance, any express terms contained in the agreement will not be enforceable at the suit of the owner. This is to encourage the site owner to produce the written statement in advance, and is not likely to hold up the process of a sale.
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para6"></a>The amendments create a power by which the Secretary of State (in Wales the National Assembly for Wales) can add additional terms to be implied into the agreement, and repeal and vary those in the Mobile Homes Act 1983. This power might be used, for example, to give an occupier the right to quiet enjoyment of their home, whereas currently an occupier would have to go to court to have this term implied into their agreement.
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para7"></a>Because existing agreements are of infinite duration, we need to be able to amend the statutory implied terms for existing agreements, where these are clearly inadequate. Provision has therefore been made for the first exercise of the power to have retrospective effect, i.e. to allow amendment of the implied terms operating as part of existing agreements. Future exercises of the power will be non-retrospective. Any order made under the power is subject to affirmative resolution by both Houses of Parliament, and the clause contains a consultation requirement for the Secretary of State to consult interested parties as to the proposed amendments. Representatives of both site owners and occupiers will therefore be consulted about the terms of any order to be made.
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para8"></a>Site owners will in future have a time limit of 28 days for giving or withholding approval of a prospective purchaser. By the end of this time limit a decision must have been given in writing. If not, the occupier can apply to the court for an order giving approval to that purchaser, which if given would involve the site owner in costs.
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para9"></a>The age of a home is removed as a relevant criterion for ending an agreement. Currently a site owner may terminate an agreement on grounds of "age and condition" of the unit. The amendment will remove the reference to age from the 1983 Act, as the age of a unit is irrelevant. The amendment will enable courts to consider the condition of the unit and to allow time for appropriate repairs (if reasonably practicable).
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para10"></a>The amendments increase the protection of occupiers of park homes against harassment and illegal eviction by amending the Caravan Sites Act 1968 to mirror the wording in the Protection from Eviction Act 1977, which governs the protection given to occupiers of conventional housing against eviction and harassment. The wording for the existing offence for a site owner doing "acts calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort" of the occupier which cause him <P>


<a name="column_WS16"></a>

<B>24 Feb 2004 : Column WS16</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to abandon his home has been relaxed to "acts likely to interfere" with such peace or comfort, which is obviously an easier test to satisfy. A new offence has been introduced which does not require specific intent by a site owner or his agent to cause an occupier to abandon his home. This will increase the protection available to occupiers and the chances of successful prosecutions.
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para11"></a>The remaining recommendations of the working party need further work to ensure that when fully implemented they will work effectively in practice. To that end, we have recently commissioned consultants to develop proposals on the implementation of the recommendations in relation to site licensing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224-45_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Lord Filkin): </B>  The Government have today published their response to the Joint Committee on the Draft Mental Incapacity Bill report which was published on 17 November 2003 (HL189-1 and HC 1083-1). Copies of the response have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses (Command Paper 6121).
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para12"></a>The Government would like to thank the committee for publishing such a comprehensive report in a short period of time, and obtaining such a wide range of evidence on the Bill. We are pleased that the committee agrees this new statutory framework is needed and that it endorses the principles and general direction of the draft Bill.
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para13"></a>The committee suggested that the Bill, being about how to maximise mental capacity, should be renamed the Mental Capacity Bill and we agree with this recommendation.
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para14"></a>The Bill will reform the law in order to improve and clarify the decision-making process for those aged 16 and over who are unable to make decisions for themselves. It will also offer, to people who have capacity, the choice to decide how they are cared for in the future by introducing new ways to plan ahead for a time when they might lose capacity.
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para15"></a>Over 2 million adults in England and Wales are currently affected by a lack of capacity. Many more care for someone who may need help with decision-making. With increasing ageing most of us will face the risk of losing mental capacity at some point in our lives. The Bill therefore has the potential to help a high proportion of the population.
<P>

<a name="40224-45_para16"></a>The Department for Constitutional Affairs is working closely with the Department of Health on a revised Bill. We plan to introduce the revised Bill later in this parliamentary Session. We will also have a draft outline of the codes of practice for Parliament to see at Committee stage.

<P>

<a name="40224-46_para8"></a>Signature of the contract amendment demonstrates the positive relationship between the MoD and the company and the joint commitment to deliver this important military capability within the terms of our agreement. This contract amendment, however, although important, is not an end in itself. The work over the past year in putting the agreement into effect has set the programme on a much sounder footing for the future. Risks and challenges remain, however, and we are working hard with the company to assure the long-term stability of the programme.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224w01_spmin0"></A><B> The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos):</B>  The Belfast Education and Library Board (BELB) calculates primary school budgets in accordance with its local management of schools (LMS) scheme, which is the subject of consultation with all schools and subject to approval by the Department of Education. The majority of funding which primary schools receive is determined under the board's LMS funding formula, which takes account of individual school characteristics, including the number of pupils, the size of school premises, support for small schools, social deprivation, special educational needs and support for particular groups of pupils.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224w01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   The chief executive of the Belfast Education and Library Board (BELB) has advised that, in the formula funding budget allocation for the 2003&#150;04 financial year, St Mary's Primary School, Divis Street, Belfast, with 70 pupils, attracted the most money at &#163;3,838 per pupil and Stranmillis Primary School, with 435 pupils, attracted the least at &#163;1,566 per pupil. It should be noted that all of the pupils attending St Mary's Primary School are from the Traveller community and as such attracted additional funding under the board's LMS scheme. In the 2003&#150;04 financial year, this amounted to &#163;941.58 per qualifying pupil.

3. A pensioner benefit unit has been defined as any benefit unit which contains at least one member who is 60 years old or over. This definition ties in with qualification conditions for the pensioner premium for benefits.<P>

4. The Other tenure category covers pensioner benefit units that do not include the householder, for example those living with a son or daughter who is the householder, and households occupied as rent-free or squatting.<P>

5. The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors that control for tenure type, council tax band and a number of demographic variables. Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining response bias.<P>

(1) The revenue figures are net of operating income.<P>

(2) In October 2000 there was a change in contractor operating the Crystal Palace Sports Centre on behalf of Sport England. The current contractor operates the centre on a full repairing lease contract. The previous contractor operated the centre on a part repairing lease. The difference betweeen the contracts, together with a different treatment of income under the contracts, makes it difficult to compare results between 1996&#150;97 to October 2000 and the period after October 2000.<P>

(3) The capital works programme at Crystal Palace is largely undertaken by the new contractor with Sport England only responsible for a minor amount of the capital works undertaken.<P>

<P>
<UL>What action they are taking to ensure that witnesses to crime and disorder associated with licensed premises give evidence when licensing magistrates consider police objections to the renewal of liquor licences.[HL1352]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224w03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Under the current licensing regime, where the police seek the revocation of a licence or oppose renewal of a licence, it is a matter for the chief officer of police to ensure that the police are able to substantiate any allegation which they intend to make in the course of presenting or amplifying their objection or case. It is therefore a matter for the police to ensure that witnesses attend relevant hearings and the Government have no power to enforce attendance. The Government have recognised that the current arrangements are very restrictive and have therefore taken action by introducing new review arrangements in the Licensing Act 2003. The new provisions recognise the reluctance of some members of the public to attend hearings for a variety of reasons. When fully implemented, the 2003 Act will allow interested parties, for example a local resident, or responsible authorities, for example the police, to apply for a review of a premises licence or club premises certificate to the relevant licensing authority, and to make relevant representations to the authority about the grounds for a review. There will be no requirement for the police to support their application. During the consideration of the grounds for a review at a hearing under the 2003 Act the authority will consider those grounds and any of the relevant representations made. Attendance by individuals, who have experienced or witnessed crime and disorder, at such hearings will not be compulsory as the authority will consider written representations.

<A NAME="40224w04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty:  </B>  Wild boar have only very recently recolonised parts of the United Kingdom and their diet has not been investigated in detail. We do, however, have a good understanding of their feeding preferences from studies carried out elsewhere in the world. The following description of wild boar feeding behaviour is taken from a Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food report published in 1998. <sup>1</sup>

<a name="40224w04_para0"></a>"Wild boar are omnivorous and will consume a large variety of food items; plant food typically constitutes around 90 per cent of the diet, with animal matter constituting around 10 per cent, although a tendency for concentrating on a few preferred foods, such as forest fruits and grain plants can be shown where these items occur in abundance."

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224w04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty:  </B>  Imports of captive birds (which have been wild caught in a third country) are checked by an official veterinarian of the State Veterinary Service at border inspection posts (BIPs) to ensure that they comply with EU import conditions. After clearance from the BIP they are held in quarantine for 30 days under veterinary control where they are tested for relevant notifiable diseases. The birds are only released at the end of the quarantine period if they are healthy and present no risk to the UK flocks.

<P>
<UL>What view they take of the proposal of the European Union Committee on Excise Duties to reclassify computer monitors thereby permitting Customs authorities to impose higher rates of duty on them.[HL1345]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40224w04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham:  </B>  The customs duties charged in the European Community have evolved over time through various rounds of multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, now superseded by the World Trade Organisation. The information technology agreement (ITA) also represents what was negotiable within this complex multilateral framework. The ITA is promulgated in the common customs tariff of the European Communities (CCT).
<P>

<a name="40224w04_para6"></a>When differing interpretations of the CCT arise, the European Commission takes steps to provide clarification to ensure uniform application across the Community. The European Commission is to publish a decision of the Customs Code Committee (Nomenclature Section), which advises it on these matters, in the form of a regulation on the classification of plasma monitors.
<P>

<a name="40224w04_para7"></a>This proposal does not in fact reclassify computer monitors. It clarifies the distinction between them and other types of monitor, such as video monitors, which, within the terms of the ITA and the CCT, are classified separately from computer monitors and attract a higher rate of duty.
<P>

<a name="40224w04_para8"></a>HM Customs and Excise together with the Department of Trade and Industry are satisfied that the proposed regulation provides a correct interpretation of the ITA and CCT. This clarification is intended to assist importers to clear their goods through Customs.
