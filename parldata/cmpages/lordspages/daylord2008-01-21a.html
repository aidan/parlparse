We continue to work on improving security, which is the main cause of displacement and which also restricts access to assistance that could be provided by NGOs. In addition, we have targeted &#163;15 million in 2007 and &#163;132 million since 2003 directly to assist displaced Iraqis.</p>

I return to a Question I first raised in this House in April 2007: how many Iraqis who have been employed by the British as interpreters have now been resettled here? The local guidance being issued warns that places are limited and that the process may take until the summer of 2009. Is that the right priority to give to Iraqis who may be in danger of reprisal for no other reason than that they have helped this country? </p>

As noble Lords are aware, two schemes were announced in October last year by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister and explained to this House by my noble friend Lady Ashton. The gateway refugee settlement scheme has already started. We have received 910 applications, of which 404 were rejected for showing no visible connection to British work. Ninety have been passed on to the Home Office, and 24 have been passed altogether. We estimate that the target cap of 600 is manageable, particularly because new forecasts show that there was a spike in December suggesting that the number will be adequate and manageable.</p>

Is it the Government&#146;s view that many will now return voluntarily? If not, how many have actually been forced to return? Is it the Government&#146;s view that all parts of Iraq are now sufficiently secure for refugees to return, save in exceptional circumstances?</p>

The numbers of applications from Iraq have remained relatively stable. We assess them on individual merit, according to the refugee convention and the European Convention on Human Rights. To give your Lordships a sense of the estimates of the people accepted and returned, for the first nine months of 2007 we had 1,105 applicants. One hundred and five were granted refugee status, 15 humanitarian protection and 70 discretionary leave. The rest have returned or will be returning. We make the assessments about return individually, to ensure that individuals are protected. Return is also based on our assessment, and on that of others, of areas that are safe, so that asylum seekers are returned only to such areas.</p>

It is very difficult to identify Iraqi displaced people within the neighbouring countries and within Iraq because they get absorbed into the host community and are very hard to identify. Only 3 per cent of refugees and IDPs live in camps. As a result, we cannot provide assistance in the targeted way that the noble Lord is suggesting. The best way to provide assistance is to the whole community into which the IDPs and the refugees have been absorbed. We therefore think that the issue is about the reconstruction of the system in Iraq for basic services. Funding is therefore not a problem&#151; there has been more than $30 billion of oil revenue in the past year, and less than a quarter of its capital budget was used. The issue is capacity. Of the &#163;680 million that we have disbursed in reconstruction, our efforts go towards creating the capacity of the Iraq Government to provide services.</p>

We have therefore successfully secured the post of a new UN humanitarian co-ordinator, at least partly based in Baghdad. We welcome the arrival of David Shearer, who has experience in the region, as well as in humanitarian issues. He will be launching his first consolidated UN appeal, involving NGOs, in mid-February. We have also managed to secure a pledge for increased UN staff in-country. Therefore, we hope that the centre of gravity is moving from Iraq to Amman.</p>

Of course I understand and sympathise with the motive behind that part of the definition, but once we start talking about the quality of life, we are entering a very subjective area, which is better avoided. I invite your Lordships to stick with &#147;potentially life-threatening&#148;, which can be added easily to &#147;serious&#148;.

Abortion is only permitted under fairly strict conditions; that is, those that are life-threatening.

However, is it possible to think of conditions that are serious, but not life-threatening, which one would want people to carry on with? There are conditions that are serious but are not necessarily life-threatening. If a child has a cleft palate, very few people would regard that as sufficiently serious or life-threatening; it is possible to have that as part of a syndrome in which the child is badly deformed, deaf and has all sorts of associated anomalies, yet that serious condition is not normally life-threatening.

Therefore, this amendment introduces a higher test, as noble Lords have acknowledged. That higher test would mean that the HFEA would not be able to license treatment of a condition that had a significant impact on the life of the sufferer and which was serious but not necessarily potentially life-threatening.

One change made to the Bill on the recommendation of the committee was that the wording in relation to tissue typing should be amended so that the term &#147;life-threatening&#148; was replaced by &#147;serious&#148;. We have heard views today and in Committee that it would be more appropriate if this were limited to life-threatening or potentially life-threatening conditions, and we acknowledge those views.

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="0801217000129">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the draft Bill provides for embryo testing to be carried out for the purposes of determining tissue type where there is a sick older sibling who could be treated with cord blood stem cells, bone marrow or other tissue of any resulting child. Concerns were raised in Committee that &#147;other tissue&#148; could include whole organs&#151;for example, kidneys&#151;and that the Bill could permit embryo testing for tissue type where there was an intention that any resulting child could be used as an organ donor for their older sibling. This was not in fact the intention of the use of &#147;other tissue&#148;. This term was used to ensure, for example, that the potential use of cells of the umbilical cord rather than the cord blood could be considered. The main use of this technology would be when someone suffers from a life-threatening blood condition which could be treated by cells of the cord blood or bone marrow where there are no compatible donors on the worldwide bone marrow register or in the family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="0801217000130">In addition, in the future other types of regenerative tissue could be used for treatment, perhaps where a small number of cells could be removed from a donor for culture. In previous discussions this has been referred to as regenerative tissue, as the body could compensate for the loss of a small amount of cells without lasting harm to the donor. The amendment would continue to allow for tissue typing in these circumstances, subject to a licence by the regulatory authority. Taking into account the concerns expressed in Committee, this amendment limits &#147;other tissue&#148; by clarifying that the term would not include any whole organ of the resulting child. The result is that it will now not be possible to license embryo testing for tissue type where the intention is an organ transplant for the older sibling. The use of organs from children in transplantation is governed by the Human Tissue Act, or in Scotland the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act. The Bill does not change this position. The amendment still allows embryo testing where the intention would be to treat the older sibling with other types of tissue from any resulting child, such as bone marrow, cord blood or, as discussed in Committee, types of tissue other than whole organs.</p>

At that time, as the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, will recall, when he replied to my Written Question it was the Government&#146;s intention to include whole organs in the Bill. I am grateful to him and to the Government for making some change in this area, but I still have some reservations and I would be grateful if the Minister, when she responds to this brief debate, could say something about what will happen in the case of parts of organs. In Committee and at the earlier stages of Report I raised the issue of what happens if part of a liver or part of a lung is taken, and whether the Bill will permit that to occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="0801217000133">The noble Lord, Lord Darzi, kindly sent to a number of noble Lords a letter dated 21 January that sets out a series of useful points about this question.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"><a name="0801217000277">&#147;Several noble Lords have proposed the term &#145;regenerative tissue&#146; could be used in this context.

</ul>
<p><a name="0801217000259">There is no difference between anyone in this House about the desirability of using umbilical cord. Many of us have made the point that to routinely destroy 98 per cent of all cord blood, as we do in this country at this time, and to have only four National Health Service hospitals collecting cord blood is itself something that we need to address. I hope the noble Baroness will say a word about that and consider again, before the Bill goes to another place, whether it might be possible to specifically exclude umbilical cord and refer to that in the Bill, and to include &#147;regenerative tissue&#148; as distinct from those things that, once taken, might not properly regenerate. There are levels of morbidity and mortality associated with the removal of parts of organs, let alone whole ones.</p>

It is very welcome but, as she rightly said, it addresses only part of the concern that was the focus of our debate in Committee. Any decision on whether an organ may or may not be transplanted from a child falls outside the scope of the Bill and is the province of the Human Tissue Authority, based on the merits of each case put to it. While the amendment is decidedly welcome, so far as it goes, because it would prevent embryo testing with a view to carrying out a whole organ transplant, it does not, of course, address whether such an organ is actually transplanted in practice. I am sure that I speak for many of your Lordships when I say that I am grateful to the Government for their consideration.</p>

At that time, I was concerned about the point that my noble friend Lord Alton made about part organs; I was even tempted to suggest that the amendment should include part organs. Then I realised, of course, that some of my own research has been in the field of muscle disease and I suppose that taking a tiny sample of muscle by a needle biopsy could be construed as taking part of an organ. For that reason, I think that the amendment is better as it stands and no attempt should be made to include part organs in it, even though we all have concerns, as my noble friend Lord Alton said, about taking part of a liver or a lung. This is a welcome amendment which I warmly support.</p>

I should like to start at a slightly different point from the one that was the focus of the amendment in the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. New subsections (9), (10) and (11) of Clause 14, which would amend Section 13 of the Act, focus upon pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and take us to a particular aspect of that issue which, but for these provisions, many of us might not otherwise have thought much about. They explicitly prohibit embryos being selected with a view to increasing the chance of having a child with a serious disability or medical condition. Consciously to wish such a disability or condition on a child may seem extraordinary, but there have been well documented cases where parents who are disabled in a particular way have expressed a desire to have a child with the same disability. I find that idea repellent because it ignores one of the issues central to any IVF procedure, namely, the future welfare of the child. Therefore, I wholly support a ban on that type of embryo selection. The techniques available to diagnose the presence of genetic conditions in any embryo should be used, if they are used at all, to reduce the risk of a child being born with a serious handicap and to reduce the risk of suffering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="0801217000142">Over the years, this type of pre-implantation diagnosis has been carried out in a sensitive and responsible way by clinics on behalf of patients.

<a name="80121-0004.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="0801217000143">Two problems have caused concern. One of them is the time that it sometimes takes for the HFEA to allow a procedure to go ahead. The need for the HFEA to approve a particular condition as being serious enough to warrant pre-implantation diagnosis often means a considerable delay for couples wishing to access the procedure.</p>

<a name="80121-0004.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="0801217000144">It is absolutely right that each case should be considered on its merits. There should be sufficient flexibility in the system to allow that to happen. At the same time, there is an argument for encouraging the HFEA to look at ways of shortening the decision-making process. For example, the BMA suggested that that could be done by having, in the first instance, a set of broad criteria included in the Act, with the scope and interpretation of those criteria fleshed out for clinics in the form of HFEA guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="0801217000146">The question begged by this wording, similar to that in Clause 14, is: what does the word &#147;serious&#148; mean&#151;serious for whom? Most would immediately say, &#147;Serious for the child in terms of the degree of suffering or the extent to which life expectancy is curtailed as a result of the child having the condition in question&#148;. We do not mean serious for the NHS or the parents in looking after the child or serious for the parents in having to bring up a child who may not be 100 per cent able-bodied. The seriousness of the illness or condition is surely defined, for most of us, from the point of view of the child when they are born. Therefore, we should think of setting out a broad definition of what is meant by serious in the Bill. This would potentially assist the HFEA in terms of Parliament&#146;s intentions and it would address a second problem.</p>

The Government accepted that recommendation. Personally, I have no problem with the change, provided that we know in broad terms what we mean by &#147;serious&#148;. Again, we surely mean serious from the point of view of the child in terms of its likely future suffering or the risk to the life of the child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="0801217000149">The whole concept of a saviour sibling is, ethically speaking, a difficult one. Some people find it impossible to countenance at all: others will do so only in a narrow range of cases. That is why, if we are going to extend the legal grounds on which tissue matching is to be permitted for the creation of saviour siblings and avoid the possibility that the process will be invoked for reasons that are less than compelling, we need to spell out in clear terms how we want the statute to be interpreted. The seriousness of the condition in this context is surely about the probability that it will end a person's life prematurely or cause the person a degree of suffering such as to impair their quality of life to a severe extent.</p>

It is a perfectly respectable line to adopt. But the very fact that there is room for discussion on that point makes it all the more important for us to make sure that the terms in the Bill are defined in ways that are not overly prescriptive but, at the same time, we should leave all concerned in no doubt about what was intended. I believe that the definition that I have proposed is what the Joint Committee intended and I hope very much that the Minister will look at the amendments positively. I beg to move.</p>

That disease has responded dramatically to the new biological drugs, which suggests that it may be possible in the not-too-distant future to use stem cells in some way in an infant who clearly has that terrible disease. But you have to define how bad it is to warrant a saviour sibling. You will have to be able to say that it is not just &#147;serious&#148; but &#147;life-threatening&#148; as well. Are you going to create a life because it may be a more convenient way of treating the disease, even though there are other ways of managing it, which may be expensive?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="0801217000153">The other difficulty with &#147;life-threatening&#148; is that you cannot wait until the child who is ill is actually dying: you need to think about the saviour sibling concept earlier. The amendment addresses that neatly and beautifully. Without it, I fear that the line may shift and shift until there is increasing pressure to go for aesthetic biological perfection rather than being able to accept the broad spectrum of humanity. Surely, we should only be considering saviour siblings when a condition really is life-threatening and there is strong evidence that without a saviour sibling the child will die.</p>

Before coming to my reason for that, I address his point about delays, to do with PGD, to applications being considered by the HFEA. I hope it will help the House if I indicate that it probably was true when PGD first started. It took quite a long time to go through the system, because each condition had to be considered on its own. The present policy is that once a condition has been licensed in principle, and the laboratory has a licence to carry out PGD, the whole process is speeded up. They do not have to consider again on an individual, case-by-case basis. Something like 70 conditions, some of them very rare, have already been licensed in principle.</p>

I do not believe that medical practice and research are progressing so quickly that we cannot establish basic ethical rules about how we manage things in law and regulation. Things are not moving that quickly. It is very obvious in the case of pre-implantation. After all, as I mentioned

It is quite a long time, in which only a handful of diseases have been regulated and passed through the guidelines of the HFEA, which brings me to my second point.</p>

<a name="80121-0004.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="0801217000158">It is not entirely desirable to have every disease process regulated in quite the way that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, suggests for one very good reason. There is a much greater expert on muscular dystrophy than myself in this House: the noble Lord, Lord Walton. The defect in the dystrophin gene is found in somewhere between 2.25 million to 2.5 million letters of the DNA alphabet. There are at least 400 or 500 different misspellings that can cause a form of muscular dystrophy, and those different muscular dystrophies will have different prognoses. Some will lead to relatively minor weakness, with a good chance of longevity. Others are totally devastating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="0801217000159">Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a much rarer disease, which affects only boys. No single family in the United Kingdom has precisely the same mutation as another; everybody has a slightly different mutation. The manifestations of that disease can be absolutely devastating. These children may frequently expose themselves to damage. They mutilate themselves; they bite their tongues off; they often have to have their teeth extracted to prevent that happening, in case they die of the infection. It is the most brutally revolting disease, which I will not describe in detail because it really is that unpleasant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="0801217000160">Even with cystic fibrosis&#151;perhaps the most common disease that is a recessive disorder&#151;the nature of the mutation makes a very big difference to the quality of life afterwards. Therefore, the idea that permission should be given in each case is not terribly useful. There has to be a degree of latitude in how this is done and, in many ways, the proposition in the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, fits the bill beautifully. In some mutations one might say that screening is not suitable but in others it clearly is.</p>

It may be that doctors can come to understand what is meant by &#147;quality of life&#148; rather better than lawyers and judges. When I was a judge and I had to decide whether a very young baby or, at the other end of the spectrum, a severely ill elderly person, should be given treatment to keep them alive, I and the judges of the Court of Appeal, of which I was once a member, were, where possible, extremely careful not to use the phrase &#147;quality of life&#148;.</p>

As a member of that committee, I thought that that was a reasonable suggestion in the circumstances. The kind of considerations mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Winston, on this amendment, and by the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, on the previous amendment, seem to go towards a definition of something that was not necessarily life-threatening but was still very damaging to the health of the person in question. Therefore, so far as I was concerned, that was what &#147;serious&#148; meant. After all, it is an ordinary word of the English language and there is a limit to the extent to which it is right to define ordinary words; but, as some of your Lordships have pointed out, &#147;serious&#148; has been used in a context that has led to a surprising result by including something that some noble Lords would not be prepared to include.</p>

<a name="80121-0004.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="0801217000164">So the suggestion is that &#147;serious&#148; is too vague to be allowed to stand alone in an Act of Parliament. If that is the case, we must look to see whether we can produce a better definition, as my noble friend Lord Howe has suggested. When I read the amendment, I thought it was pretty much like what I had in mind when we changed &#147;life-threatening&#148; to &#147;serious&#148;. However, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, with her great experience of the judicial art, has said that lawyers stand away from, and do not wish to define, the phrase &#147;quality of life&#148;, and refrain from using it when giving their reasons for judgment.</p>

We cannot make such an amendment at this stage, but if the principle of this amendment were acceptable to the Government, as I sincerely hope it will be, it would be possible to refine it a little further. But the idea that trivial impairment to health would qualify as &#147;serious&#148;, certainly never entered my head at the time of the Joint Committee&#146;s deliberations. If, as has been said in relation to the earlier amendment, a definition of &#147;serious&#148; is required, I cannot think of anything much better than this fitting the context&#151;except, possibly, with the substitution of &#147;health&#148; for &#147;quality of life&#148;.</p>

I saw a number of cases there where people with severe spinal injuries&#151;such as tetraplegics&#151;would simply turn their face to the wall and die. The injuries that they had received were not, in themselves, life threatening, but the psychological effect upon the patient made them feel life threatening&#151;they simply pulled up their roots and died.

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="0801217000219">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment concerns allowing existing cells and cell lines to be used in research involving somatic cell nuclear transfer or admixed embryos. As noble Lords are well aware, medical and biological research is about taking tissue, cells and cell lines from diseased patients to better understand the progression of diseases in the attempt to find treatments and cures. All medical research is based on this principle. The Bill as drafted requires the explicit consent from the donors of any cell used to create an embryo. This effectively blocks the use of many existing cells or cell lines in somatic cell nuclear research. They could include many valuable lines representing specific and rare diseases.</p>

However, I also recognise that such research involves a transient, embryo-like stage to permit the derivation of stem cells. The research would never create embryos for further development or implantation. The amendment is not about the donation of material for fertility treatment. However, there are existing cells and cell lines which have been completely anonymised so that the original donor is untraceable. In other cases, donors have been told that they will not be contacted again about research. The amendment creates a limited exception for some of these cells or cell lines to be used.</p>

These safeguards have been expanded following Committee, and the amendment now lists seven different exceptions. The discussions in Committee most notably turned on limiting the existing holdings of anonymised tissue where it is not reasonably possible to contact the donor to seek consent. The exception is subject to a number of important conditions, including the condition that no alternative sources of tissue for which effective consent can be obtained are available, and that there should be no evidence that the donor would have objected to this use. As with any research, approval would have to be required from both the HFEA and the relevant research ethics committee. This will ensure that in exceptional, deserving cases, vital resources are not wasted and important research can be carried out.</p>

To demonstrate the level of support for this outside this House, I shall quote from a letter from various patient-based charities written to the noble Lord, Lord Darzi. The bodies include the Association of Medical Research Charities, the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, the Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society and many others. They said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"><a name="0801217000326">&#147;The creation of pluripotent embryonic cell lines using somatic cell nuclear transfer will be a valuable research tool to gain greater knowledge of specific disease conditions. Scientists in the UK currently use tissue and cell samples donated by patients for basic research although a substantial number of human cell lines are also commercially available. These valuable donated resources will become unavailable as soon as the retrospective requirement for donor consent to use these cells for SCNT currently in the bill comes into effect. These tissues and cells were donated with the explicit condition that the donor/patient was giving consent for their use in research to help find treatments and potential cures and in many cases it is now impossible to trace them back to the original donors. A specific and telling example relates to Spinal Muscular Atrophy. At a clinic in the US, there are tissue and cell samples donated from over one hundred patients with SMA which could be used to create human embryonic stem cell lines that could model this devastating disease in the lab. As the Bill stands, it would become illegal to use these cell lines&#148;.</p>

I shall not go through the whole list; 27 of the most distinguished men and women scientists and others in our country have signed the letter. Would they do so if they did not think this was of the utmost importance? Would they put their credibility on the line as serious scientists if they did not think that this was a very important issue that they wish the Government to consider?</p>

There is no dispute about it, nor is there debate over whether those who make contributions of this kind in the years ahead should be asked if they would care to make an exception, on moral grounds, to anything which might become connected with embryonic stem cell activity. What is being suggested, however, is that it should be presumed retrospectively that, as some donors who it is impossible to contact might have objected to being associated with this branch of research, there should be a blanket prohibition in this area&#148;.</p>

Without being able to research on the existing lines they will have to create further lines. This will take resources and a very long time. Others outside the United Kingdom may not be bound by such a regulatory regime. I am not asking for blanket coverage to allow scientists to use this collection; seven stringent conditions in the amendment will have to be met. I beg to move.</p>

It is important for the House to understand how difficult it is to generate an embryonic stem cell line. In my own laboratory, in one of the leading science universities in Europe at Imperial College, I have had a team of three post-doctoral scientists&#151;so not PhD students&#151;working for several years with a virtually unlimited budget to produce stem cell lines both from mice and from human embryonic tissue. It is extraordinarily difficult and it is only now that we have started to get lines which look vaguely like normal stem cell lines. In fact, after two and a half years of research, we were so desperate to get stem cells lines that we ended up buying in lines from Harvard University in the United States. When we examined those stem cell lines, we found that they too were defective and not valuable for human research. This is a priceless biological commodity and it is frustrating for us as scientists to see a slight inconsistency in the Government&#146;s position. It is interesting to consider that, at the moment, growing consideration is being given to the idea of people having their organs donated without consent after an accident for renal transplantation, yet here we have lines which have been established with consent but not specific consent, so they cannot be used for this research. That seems a very difficult position for the Government to adopt, and therefore I must support this amendment.</p>

The noble Lord is right to remind us that we should see this in the wider context of the debate about organ donation. Having been involved first as a Liberal Member of Parliament and then as a

I am slightly surprised that this amendment was not brought forward at a much earlier stage. If it is so crucial, why was this issue not considered by the scrutiny committee in detail? Before we incorporate this proposal into the legislation, should we not at least pause and give it further deep consideration?</p>

<a name="80121-0006.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="0801217000228">The issue of consent is the crucial one, not the issue of the creation of the human embryo in the first place. Are we willing to allow retrospectively this use of the tissue and cell lines of people who might have a deeply principled objection to the creation of human embryos? That is the problem. We cannot on their behalf take this decision. Certainly, if I were asked whether my organs or cells could be used for a particular medical treatment, I would continue to carry my donor card. It is an altruistic and generous thing for members of the public to do. We should follow the Spanish model of having teams in every hospital in the country. These teams have significantly increased the levels of donation in Spain in comparison with our own country. We should also look at the alternative of using the far less ethically troubled adult cells which can be reprogrammed to create embryonic cells. If we were to do that, there would be no reason for any disagreement between the noble Lords, Lord Winston and Lord Patel, and people like myself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="0801217000229">Mine might be a minority view but it is perfectly properly held. I think there will be deep concern and anxiety outside your Lordships&#146; House if we agree this principle, which, as I say, is one of retrospection. It could be seen as a violation of the rights of someone&#146;s body. We are sometimes properly swayed by the humanitarian concerns raised in your Lordships&#146; House, but outside there are also commercial considerations. We have to weigh all these things in the balance. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which we are invited to place so much faith in, is a regulatory body, not an ethical one. That is one of the reasons why we have been debating how complex questions of this kind can best be resolved in the future. The HFEA is not the place to do that.</p>

We fully agree that in the future such consent should be a requirement and that it would be wrong to use previously donated cells if there were good reason to believe that the donor would have specifically objected to their use in embryonic stem cell research. However, many existing cell and tissue samples and cell lines were donated, for any research purpose, by patients (now untraceable) with particular diseases, before this sort of research was even imagined. These cells have been well characterised over many years, or have unique properties and may therefore be the best samples to use for the derivation of embryonic stem cells.

If there is no general consent, but there have been some conditions under which the material has reached a bank, that must determine whether it is right to use the material in the way proposed. Therefore, there may be slight differences between the different types that are subject to this amendment.

Due to the nature of cell lines, these cells may be cultured for many years. Some in existence today originate from donations made decades ago. Schedule 3 to the Bill preserves the system of consent found in the 1990 Act for the creation, storage and use of embryos and gametes to create embryos, but makes changes to reflect the fact that human embryos can now be created in more ways than simply by mixing human gametes. Additional consent requirements are introduced to ensure that informed consent is obtained before any human material can be used to create an embryo, and for the subsequent use and storage of such embryos.

The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, rightly pointed out the Government&#146;s situation in relation to the Human Tissue Bill. The Government take the view that the use of tissue for purposes under the Human Tissue Act is distinct from the use of a person&#146;s genetic material to create a human embryo or a human admixed embryo. The Bill&#146;s provisions reflect the special status of the human embryo and are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. For that reason, the issue is different also to the considerations being undertaken by the Organ Donation Taskforce on presumed consent for organs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="08012115000007">Although existing cell lines could be a useful resource for the creation of cloned embryos, there is scope for an alternative option of using other cells, cells for which proper consent is in place. This is critical in considering whether using existing cell lines would be compatible with the convention rights. The fact that there are other possible and effective routes for research means that it is not possible to argue that interference with the rights of persons to whom the cell line relates is justified on the basis of scientific need. However, I hear the very strong will of the House that we should take back this amendment and reflect further. Naturally, anything that the Government say or do at Third Reading must be compatible with the Human Rights Act, as noble Lords would wish; but I am very willing to take this back, reflect further and we will report to the House at Third Reading, and say where we can move from there.</p>

The amendment allows for only somatic cells to be use&#151;not gametes. It is a requirement that the tissue has already been lawfully obtained.

To develop these disease models, scientists need to be able to take somatic cells&#151;adult cells&#151;through an embryo phase in order to generate embryonic stem cells, which in turn would allow the disease model to be studied. These lives may then be studied further, to understand how the effects of such devastating diseases occur at a cellular level, and how potential gene or drug therapies might be developed.</p>

It is almost 60 years ago that I began to work on that topic in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The most severe form of muscular dystrophy manifests itself only in young boys. It is due to an X-linked recessive gene, transmitted by female carriers which is manifest in half their sons. Indeed, half their daughters are themselves carriers of the gene. The late Professor Nattrass and I entitled the disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy because of the outstanding descriptions given in the 19th century of the disease by Duchenne of Boulogne. It causes difficulty in walking; boys begin to waddle as they walk, and by the time they are nine or 10 years of age, they are confined to a wheelchair because of widespread paralysis. In the old days, because of gross deformity, few of them survived beyond the age of 15 or 16. Now, as a result of much improved care, including ventilatory care, many of these boys live until their twenties and even later.</p>

<a name="80121-0008.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="08012115000032">Research has been vital in learning more about this disease and it is bringing with insight the prospect of potential treatment. In 1987, the gene responsible for this disease was discovered. As the noble Lord, Lord Winston, said, it was found to be a very large gene, with several different kinds of mutations within it. Broadly, the result of this abnormal gene is that it traduces in the muscle cells an absence of a protein called dystrophin, which is an important part of the membrane of the muscle fibre&#151;it is rather like the skin of a sausage. Because of this, that membrane becomes inefficient and, as work in my department in Newcastle showed many years ago, it allows certain chemical substances to get in from the extra-cellular fluid which begin a process of digestion or breakdown of the muscle.</p>

The Bill, as introduced in November, removes that requirement, while retaining the need to consider the welfare of the child. Concerns about the removal of this provision have been clearly made. Although intending to continue to omit the reference to a need for a father, we agreed to consider further how the welfare-of-the-child provision might best reflect comments made in Committee. As many noble Lords are aware, we have discussed this issue at great length and are grateful for all the comments that we have had on this very important issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="08012115000050">It is generally considered to be beneficial for a child to have a mother and a father, and many fathers play a significant and important role in their children&#146;s lives. We also recognise that same-sex couples and single mothers can, and do, offer loving and supportive environments for raising children. Parliament has passed legislation allowing the legal recognition of civil partnerships and preventing discrimination on the grounds of sex and sexual orientation. In line with this government policy, the Bill provides for civil partners and same-sex female couples to be named as the parents on birth certificates. We feel that retaining the need-for-a-father provision, or indeed any other provision that mentioned a mother and a father, would be inconsistent with the wider government policy of promoting equality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="08012115000051">In this context, that would mean that any provision that placed additional hurdles for same-sex couples or single women accessing treatment compared with heterosexual couples would not be appropriate or acceptable. That would inevitably be the case if the provision mentioned either just a father or both a father and a mother. In addition, it is the Government&#146;s view that such a provision might be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Therefore, we cannot accept amendments that could be discriminatory and we would seek to overturn any that were introduced.</p>

Accordingly, our amendment replaces the need for &#147;a father&#148; with the need for &#147;supportive parenting&#148;. I am sure that everyone accepts the importance of supportive parenting in the context of child welfare and therefore the intention behind the amendment. I also recognise that for many noble Lords the key to this is how the term &#147;supportive parenting&#148; is defined.</p>

However, we acknowledge the importance of knowing the meaning of the term, particularly for clinicians who carry out the assessments, and therefore we believe that it would be appropriate to have an explanation of this term in guidance produced by the HFEA&#151;in its code of practice, which is subject to approval by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80121-0009.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="08012115000056">Another prime consideration about the term relates to how it would be applied in practice. People embarking on assisted reproduction are fully committed to having a child and have given a great deal of thought to it. Therefore, in general, it would be expected that such people would be supportive parents. However, as part of the consideration of the welfare of the child, in rare situations where the treatment providers are aware of any evidence or indications that that is not the case, they should take into account the need of the child for supportive parenting when considering whether to provide treatment. For example, where a child is conceived following gamete or embryo donation, it is beneficial for the child to be told of this fact at an early stage. This is something that we have discussed separately but, in this context, a commitment to inform the child at an early age would be indicative of supportive parenting.</p>

It is therefore important that any interpretation of supportive parenting does not contradict or impede this position. I believe it is true to say that it is generally regarded to be beneficial for a child to have a mother and a father, but this does not preclude other parental situations from being regarded as supportive. All patients need to consider how they will provide supportive parenting to the child and how they will provide for the needs of that child. It is critical that the welfare of the child is safeguarded. We believe that this is achieved by referring to the need to have &#147;supportive parenting&#148;.</p>

This issue has been one of the most discussed in the Bill and I know that there are strongly held views on it. We have heard the concerns expressed and have tabled an amendment, as discussed, to try to address some of these concerns. It is our view that &#147;supportive parenting&#148; is a key concern when it comes to considering the welfare of the child.

<p><a name="08012119000029">Amendment No. 127Ais consequential to Amendment No. 108A. &#147;Supportive parenting&#148; was chosen to ensure that the term did not present obstacles to the treatment of same-sex couples and single women. We believe that other amendments being proposed would make access to treatment more difficult in those family situations where there would not be a father, and that is not appropriate. In addition, such an amendment is not in line with the Government&#146;s position of promoting equality.</p>

This would mean that when taking account of the welfare of the child, a clinician would have to consider the child&#146;s need for supportive parenting and family life, or the child&#146;s need for supportive parenting and the advantages of having a mother and a father.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="08012119000006">I shall address each of these additions in turn. The first refers to family life. This introduces an additional factor. Not only does a child need supportive parenting; it will also require a family life. A family life would automatically be implied by &#147;supportive parenting&#148;. Further guidance on the meaning of &#147;supportive parenting&#148; will be included in the HFEA code of practice. In our view, all children would automatically be part of a family, which in some cases would include brothers, sisters and a larger extended family, but in other cases could just be one other person&#151;the mother. People who do not have a wider family would not automatically fulfil the criteria and would require additional consideration. In our view, neither interpretation of the additional wording is appropriate.</p>

Legislation relating to fertility and embryology, as we are discussing today, is not the appropriate place to have a general definition of &#147;supportive parenting&#148;. Such a definition would be much more appropriate in legislation relating to responsibilities towards children who have been born, such as the Act from which these words were inspired&#151;the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. However, we recognise the importance of exploring the terminology, and we certainly agree with the principle of the definition proposed. This would be more appropriate in guidance than in the Bill.</p>

I wish the scientific parts of this Bill, which have gone a long way forward, to succeed and to bring good to us all. Your Lordships know well that, although this House has voted quite rightly in favour of more scientific permissiveness in this law, there is some unease among the public. I appreciate the extra trouble the Government have taken to meet the concerns expressed, hence my inclusion in this amendment of the need for a father and a mother. This should not be a party issue.

There, assessments are made of parents&#146; behaviour retrospectively. You have the parents and the child, and you can look back to see whether they were supportive parents and how they behaved in relation to the child. IVF is prospective. The doctor has a woman or a woman and man standing there waiting for treatment. Of course they will say that they are committed to supportive parenting, that they give this or that undertaking, yet it is all purely speculative. We need a phrase or principle in this law for the doctors and for the public, one that is simple and can be readily understood, and that can permeate the guidance that the HFEA will give in its code&#151;which may flesh it out or water it down.</p>

It is about avoiding the risk I have referred to on earlier occasions in this debate that scientific advances in fertility may dehumanise in particular fathers, who are reduced to mere sperm donors and who, having done their job, can go away with no regard to their vital importance in children&#146;s welfare. Women have fought a long battle to be recognised in their maternal role, for their bodily integrity and autonomy, and for their role to be valued.

Even more young people&#151;84 per cent of 18 to 24 year-olds&#151;want to see the children having a legal father as well as a social one.

The research that has been done on same-sex rearing of children of course only deals with very young children and is at an early stage. It is greatly outweighed by the research going the other way, and begs the question whether children would not do even better if there were a father.

To remove the need for parents sends an unfortunate signal. Moreover, the Government, rightly, have encouraged paternity leave as well as maternity leave. They encourage child support from fathers. They, as do the judges, encourage contact with fathers after divorce. They encourage the registration of a father's name on the birth certificate. They have ended the anonymity of sperm donors. Why, if they are not important? With all the drawbacks of reduced numbers of donors, why has anonymity been ended? Why is there a drive to tell children who their fathers were, if not for the simple reason that to know your father is a good thing? As the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child says, the child has a right to know and, if possible, to be cared for by its parents.

I come from a very large extended family, including uncles and aunties, but we knew who our dad was. As for the phrase &#147;supporting parenting&#148;, supposing that a child wants to know, &#147;Who is my dad?&#148;, and is told, &#147;Don&#146;t ask such questions. It is discriminatory. We are your supporting parents&#148;. A child will not be satisfied. A child wants to know. I have friends who are in same-sex relationships who, through treatment, have children.

Removing from the statute the words &#147;father and mother&#148; is trying to discriminate against another group of people. Again, here are competing rights.

The person whom I know who donated the sperm to my friends for them to have a child could not be in a relationship with that person.

The Government are seeking to remove the need for a father from existing legislation, but their case contains a fundamental contradiction which they have so far sought to avoid. I know that the Government and those who have taken part in previous debates are all agreed that the best interests of the child are paramount in the Bill, but it can never be in the child's best interests for someone to decide that he or she does not need a father. If our primary concern is the best interests of the child, noble Lords must support Amendment No. 108A.</p>

While of course we rejoice at the outcome for these individuals, we must be wary of such anecdotal evidence. As I have said before, stories with happy endings are not the basis on which to make law. Many people could testify to the negative impact on their life of growing up without a father. Both public opinion and the weight of sociological research recognise the vital importance that the father plays in a child&#146;s development. The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, has already quoted the ComRes poll which found that 77 per cent of those interviewed considered the obligation for IVF clinics to consider the need for a father to be &#147;important&#148; or &#147;very important&#148;. In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, and I referred to and quoted from extensive bibliographies of evidence. All of that research is on record.

An overwhelming weight of evidence shows that a child is most likely to have good outcomes living in a family with both a mother and a father, above all when the parents are married. The Government amendment simply fails to address the fundamental issue. It will replace a firm recognition of the importance of the father with an inadequate alternative. I believe that to remove the requirement to consider the child&#146;s need for a father prioritises the desires of people to be parents above the needs of the child. I repeat: it prioritises the desires of people to be parents above the needs of a child. That is not a change I believe noble Lords should support and I urge them to support Amendment No. 108A.</p>

Our judges, being close to the social conditions and ethical values of our country, and showing themselves to be aware of the need to secure equal treatment without discrimination, would be much more likely to grant a declaration of incompatibility if the Bill were to stand as it is without Amendment No. 108. If one replaced it with Amendment No. 108A, there would be a serious risk of litigation leading to that result.</p>

I also have experience, but of a slightly different kind from that of my noble friend Lord Carlile, of lesbians, in particular, being model and rather traditional parents. That simply illustrates that you cannot generalise. I know many terrible families, with terrible parents who are a father and a mother; and I know some extremely good parents who are same-sex couples. We must guard against the danger&#151;I say this in the presence of the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher&#151;of a kind of Clause 28 being an indirect result of the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="08012129000013">The first issue concerns the way in which the debate has been turned into a discussion about the value or non-value of fathers. We should all remember that fathers are intrinsically valuable. I said in a previous debate that I had a marvellous father. Difficult as he was, I would not have given him up for anything else. But to say that we are looking for every family to have a father denies the reality of our society as it stands today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="08012129000014">I was rather concerned by some of the comments made, where I thought the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, linked cloning with same-sex families in terms of not having fathers. It suggests to me that the hundreds of non-conventional families out in our communities&#151;and there are many kinds&#151;are not respected. We demand respect of those families if we are going to support them and give them a good life.</p>

<a name="80121-0010.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="08012129000015">Secondly, I wish to consider the issue from the point of view of the child. The noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, mentioned that for too long children had been seen as the end rather than the means. For too long, issues about fertilisation have been about childless couples rather than about the children. We know that children do best when they feel secure, understand about their background and have no sudden traumas. Growing up in any family that gives them that kind of background will be helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="08012129000016">There was debate earlier about research. The most scientifically rigorous studies of the development of children in same-sex families show that children raised in lesbian mother families are no more at risk of developing psychological problems than their counterparts from families with fathers present in their home. As I said earlier, a stable and loving home environment is the most important thing that children need. The evidence compiled by CARE and laid in the Library&#151;I am a Christian&#151;has been called to account by some of the country&#146;s most eminent experts in the area of fathering and parenting. They have seriously questioned the credibility of <I>The Fatherhood Bibliography.</I></p>

She advised the Rowntree Foundation on parenting and families, is an adviser to the Department of Health and undertakes research at Cambridge. Together with Fiona McCullen, she has followed 25 lesbian mother families from 2004 and 38 families headed by a single heterosexual mother. The quality of parenting in these families shows very little difference. They concluded that the presence or absence of fathers in a home from the outset does have some influence&#151;this is true in single-parent families as well as other families&#151;but has little consequence in later life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="08012129000018">The reason I quote this research is not for self-indulgence but simply to point out that there is an alternative view to the one presented previously, which was deeply hurtful to at least 10 per cent of the outside population who saw this as a slight on their capacity to parent. I wish I had been able to make a speech as moving as the one of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, in which he described people whom I know who have brought up children. I was speaking recently to two doctors, both working as paediatricians, who had been together for the past 15 years and have a seven year-old boy. They were deeply offended by the suggestion that their parenting was not as good as that of heterosexual couples.</p>

I am not saying they are more perfect but neither are they less perfect. They are like the rest of the community. They are, as the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, said, extraordinarily ordinary people who happen to want to raise a child healthily and properly through the system.

It is worth bearing in mind that none of these amendments changes the idea that the welfare of the child is a significant factor in whether to proceed to IVF treatment. That is still an integral part of this Bill. We are arguing about the extent to which we nuance the term &#147;welfare of children&#148;. We have heard some very powerful speeches.

The most effective alternative was that tabled by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, which is Amendment No. 110. I always defer to the noble Lord, Lord Lester, on the European Convention on Human Rights&#151;although it seems but yesterday, it was 10 years ago that I was writing policy papers on this for the Labour Party&#151;but the main thing is that it balances rights and some rights are in conflict with each other. It does not give absolute rights to one person over another, but balances them. I would say&#151;and I am not a lawyer, but I would like to hear the arguments against this&#151;that Amendment No. 110 achieves that kind of balance. It is difficult for me to see, on the evidence so far, that that amendment in particular does not do a rather good job, and indeed does not in some ways improve the wording in the 1990 Act.

At the very least, I ask that wording like that in Amendment No. 110 is reflected in the code of practice. The reason I say that is that the distinguishing feature of that amendment is that it provides a clear and elegant test that clinicians have to pay attention to in deciding on the welfare of the child. It has clarity about what clinicians have to consider in terms of the welfare of the child at the point of determining whether they go ahead with IVF. That is the great attraction of Amendment No. 110. I ask my noble friend at the very least to give us some assurances that that is the kind of clarity we would look for in the code of practice.

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="08012135000012">I was moved, as many other noble Lords have been, by the speech of my noble friend Lord Carlile. For the purposes of making my own position quite clear, I should say that I always supported the Civil Partnerships Act. I was strongly in its favour and members of my own family have very much benefited from it. Civil partnerships are not the issue at all; the central issue is whether the welfare of the child comes before that of either parent or both parents, whether they are in a heterosexual or a gay relationship. I remain unsatisfied on that point.</p>

<a name="80121-0011.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="08012135000013">My noble friend Lord Carlile said&#151;and this was the one thing in his brave speech that I was slightly surprised by&#151;that he believed the structure of what one might call traditional heterosexual marriage has more or less disappeared. There is one reason why I would raise a substantial question about that: the clear evidence, most recently emerging from the OECD study and others, of the growing involvement of young men in parenthood. Many of us remember, if we go back a generation or two, that fathers were a very distant member of the family, sometimes not much more than authority, sometimes even an authority that abused itself by its behaviour towards its spouse and its children. That has changed quite radically in my lifetime. I now constantly come across fathers who are sharing in all the basic issues of bringing up a child, from changing nappies to pushing prams to taking a huge share in their child&#146;s upbringing. It has been a striking transformation. Many young men today share far more than their fathers or grandfathers ever did, not only in housework but in raising children and in all domestic responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80121-0011.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="08012135000014">For me, that is the way forward. That is what I always thought equality between men and women was all about: the equality of sharing responsibilities as much as equality before the law. I would therefore be very sad if we began to diminish the importance of fatherhood. Here I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain; that is the message that would go out if we effectively said that a child does not need both a mother and a father, as Amendment No. 110 suggests. Why do I say that? Whether we like it or not, our society is made up of two genders: male and female. It is important that children should be brought up knowing something about the approaches and attitudes of those two genders. They are not the same, and thank God they are not. Women bring to society a set of different attitudes and often different objectives from those of men, and children need to try to understand them both.</p>

We knew that those children needed male role models; in particular, children from broken or disadvantaged families benefited from a male role model. It did not necessarily have to be a father, but it was important that within the family structure there

They attain less, comparatively, than girls do at academic levels from the very beginning of primary school all the way through to A-levels and beyond. We are seeing the demotivation of boys. It is terribly important that we restore to them their motivation, and fatherhood is one of the key ways of doing that. I thought that much of the Government&#146;s legislation indicated that they shared that view, since they have never ceased to iterate the importance of the responsibility of fathers, as well as mothers, towards the children they generate.</p>

My chair, when it was eventually established, was the first in Britain devoted to infertility, and for 35 years of my time professionally, until I retired from the National Health Service, I sat daily in front of infertile women and men&#151;most of the time, listening. My appointments did not last for just five, 10, 15 or 20 minutes. It would be rare for me not to listen to a couple for at least half an hour, and that was true right up to the time of my last clinic. In those consultations, what I saw at first hand, again and again, was something which your Lordships cannot have seen in quite the same way. I saw the pain, the lack of self-esteem, the sense of total failure, the sense of deep bereavement, the anger that these women in particular felt, the despair they showed and the depression they frequently had. Your Lordships, as a House, are asking me, as a doctor, to make a judgment in a situation like that as to who is a suitable parent. You are trying to enforce the unenforceable.

But there is no way in the space of a clinic that you can deal with that situation except to listen, try to understand, do your best to empathise and do what you feel is responsible and right. There will be occasions when you clearly have an indication that it would be wrong to treat a couple&#151;perhaps they come from a known family with child abuse problems.

I was determined not to treat this lady. She was HIV positive and it was not clear what her relationship with her partner was. I was sure that it would be wrong to treat her because of the child. But, because I wanted to be open-minded, I gave her another appointment for three weeks&#146; time. Over the next months, I saw that lady five times in my clinic&#151;I am not exaggerating&#151;and came to the conclusion that she was worthy of treatment. In 1993-94, the diagnosis of HIV was a death sentence, but there was always a possibility that there might be treatment around the corner. It was becoming clear that it might be possible to deliver babies to lower the risk.</p>

Eighty-five members of my clinic turned up for the discussion on this patient, and without a single exception, nobody supported my view that this woman should be treated. They were all prejudiced against the idea because, to them, treating somebody with HIV was abhorrent. I could not treat her single-handedly, and I worked on my team for six months. By the end of that period, it was interesting to see a massive change of view. We treated that lady, whom some of them thought might die or abandon her child. That lady is alive today and the child, who is a teenager, is well.</p>

The biggest single issue in our society is the woman in her late 30s and early 40s. This is increasingly common as women gain skills and education and contribute to society in all sorts of ways. It is not easy for these women to find a partner to live with, but they need treatment because their ovaries are running out of eggs&#151;two or three a day, on average, according to the biological clock. By the age of 40 to 42, they cannot actually conceive. By the age of 42, something like two-thirds of women are seriously infertile. The chance of getting pregnant with IVF by the age of 45 is well under 4 per cent on average. It is not unreasonable, therefore, for these women to present to a clinic without a partner. What are they to do? What is the doctor to do? Of course I agree that the question of the father who gives the sperm is important, but it has nothing whatever to do with this debate. That is about another amendment&#151;the anonymity, or otherwise, is something that we must separate from this argument. </p>

Today, more than a quarter of the nation's children are raised by a single parent and more than 40 per cent can expect their parents&#146; marriage or partnership to break up before they leave school. Grandparents and kin often live far away, but only a small, yet important, minority of parents are failing their children.

I believe in the importance of both a father figure and a mother figure in a child's life. Men and women are equal, as several noble Lords have said, but they are different. There are different talents, skills and qualities that they can bring to the parenting of a child. There is plenty of research to show that children as they grow up benefit from having the love and example of a woman and a man who are both committed to caring for them. For that reason, my Amendment No. 108C and others in this group would ensure that the Bill covers the advantages to the child of having a mother figure and a father figure in their lives.</p>

A survey of research carried out by Charles Desforges, which the Government have accepted, has shown that family life has a major influence on the child's educational outcomes and his life chances even after discounting all other factors. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child lays down that all children have the right to family life. I know that this Government have not signed up to the convention, but it is right to draw attention to the value of family life for a child, not in a restrictive definition of family life&#151;that must depend on the child&#146;s needs and family circumstances&#151;but at least a family life in which the child would have the opportunity to feel safe, have fun, to learn to interact in a secure environment with friends and relatives and to learn from them how to learn. That is why I tabled Amendment No. 108B.</p>

I suggest that in the majority of cases the conditions on which some of us have suggested the centre should make an assessment do not necessarily imply that that woman is denied a child by IVF. They put in place certain sacrifices that women must make for the sake of the child if they are to qualify for IVF treatment. After all, that is no different from the commitment that most of us make when we decide to have a child.</p>

We are obviously not going to prohibit the rights of single women and gay and lesbian couples to have fertility treatment because they already have that treatment and almost everyone has said that they expect and wish that situation to continue. The likelihood of single women or indeed a gay couple re-presenting themselves to the clinician as part of a heterosexual couple is impossible unless they are manipulating the legislation. So what have we achieved should we pass any of the amendments other than the government amendment? Heterosexual couples, single women and gay couples continue as before.

It would send out a signal, which is what worries me most. The signal that would be received by the children mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne&#151;the one child in four currently in a family without a father&#151;is that we believe those families are inferior and those children are second-class children. As a result, we would be stigmatising them in the name of some family form that we wish them to have, but that they do not have, and cannot, as children, choose to have. Is that what we want to do? To stigmatise children with an amendment that will have no practical effect on any presenting client, but will impact on the children that may result. I cannot believe noble Lords want that to happen.

I know that it is not always easy, but it is something that the clinician has to take into account. All the 1990 Act says, and I think that the noble Baroness&#146;s remark about it in a sense supports this, is that there is a value to the welfare of a child in that child having a father.</p>

This guidance, which has been in existence for some time under the present Administration, seems to me to express that in a very cogent and practical way.

The only issue that matters is what is in the best interests of children. In determining that, many of us rely not only on our own experience but on the available research. Insofar as people have quoted it extensively, the fatherhood bibliography produced by Christian Action Research and Education has been a very successful piece of propaganda. It is a very selective document which moulds together peer-reviewed research, grey research and opinion. As a piece of propaganda it has been effective; it has set up precisely the debate that the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York talked about. It has led us to believe that we are talking about conflicting rights, when we are not.</p>

I do not believe that there will be fewer children born with fathers as a result of IVF. We are talking about recognising the truth of modern-day life, as my noble friend Lord Carlile said so eloquently. If as the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, said in her opening remarks, her amendment, in its intended simplicity, is taken to mean that treatment will not be given unless there is a father and mother, then, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, said, people will be reduced to trying to find a way either of circumventing the law or of presenting themselves in an untrue fashion. What the Government&#146;s amendment attempts to do is recognise a factor that has so far not been mentioned to any great extent&#151;that all children benefit from stability and security in their upbringing. The Government&#146;s amendments attempt to enable people who intend to become parents to become good parents, and to do so from the start by presenting themselves honestly for treatment.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, quite rightly set us off on our discussions this afternoon by talking about the importance of principle. Part of principle is precedent in law. I ask noble Lords whether they have appreciated the fact that, in trying to establish a principle&#151;which is what the noble Baroness is trying to do, and for good reasons&#151;it is just possible that we may set a precedent of denying a person health treatment? This would not be on the basis of their need, or the way they present themselves as a patient, or even the way they behave, but because they are a member of a minority group within our population. That is a dangerous principle and a dangerous precedent&#151;one that I would not wish this House to set in law.</p>

That will cause us great difficulty, going forward. Equally, in the moving and challenging speech of the noble Lord, Lord Alli, who was, as always, stalwart against discrimination, I reflected that, sometimes, as one becomes more vigorous against discrimination in one direction, one can just see incipient discrimination coming from another quarter. That is the only point I wish to make; I shall not be repeating any of the remarks that I made in Committee&#151;not one jot, nor one iota.</p>

If we accepted the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, who is one of my colleagues on the committee, and added to it &#147;and/or supportive parenting&#148;, we would solve the problem.</p>

In many debates we have made a plea for honesty about genetics and what we do. The amendment simply tidies up and makes this legislation compatible with the most honest of today&#146;s practices. If we do not allow that, two things may well happen. The Government are changing the burden of proof on doctors, probably from the criminal standard to the civil. I fear that there will be gold-plating by clinics. They will say, &#147;It&#146;s on the face of the Bill that we cannot treat you if you do not have your one man in tow&#148;. We will go back to the days of men being dragged into clinics&#151;perhaps for money&#151;and pretending that they are in a supportive and loving relationship.</p>

That is completely different from unplanned pregnancies and broken relationships where the father has been abusive or whatever. I therefore make a plea to your Lordships that, if we are to be honest, this is the only amendment that we can pass. Other bits can go in guidance and can be helpful, but the Bill has to reflect what is actually happening today, not turn the clock back and force people to be dishonest.</p>

The outcome intended here is to change the law, as was eloquently described just now. We need to ensure that we have a clear and transparent law. There should, as my noble friend said, be no pressure on clinicians such as me. We may be good at interpreting science within a framework of regulation, not a law which is not transparent and meaningless. That point was eloquently raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, who said that the law was &#147;ineffective&#148; and &#147;wishy-washy&#148;.</p>

I am motivated by the fact, of which I am pretty sure, that the public wish us to put some ethical underpinning to the enormous leap forward in science. As for statements by noble and learned Lords about human rights, I point out that we will be in a minority in Europe if we change the law in the way that the Government wish. I point out also that &#147;private life&#148; and particularly &#147;family life&#148; have been interpreted as something that is already in existence. There is no human right to have a baby. The only body that is in danger of discrimination is the National Health Service.</p>

Whichever way the House goes tonight, the decision is likely to upset members of the public and to devalue fathering. Unlicensed sperm donation on the side has been going on and I am sure that it will continue.

&#147;With your permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement on Northern Rock. The House will understand that it was necessary to issue a statement to the markets with our proposals before the start of trading this morning in the usual way. Copies of that statement and the accompanying Treasury press release are available in the Vote Office.  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_89"><b>21 Jan 2008 : Column 89</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;I shall next week publish proposals for strengthening depositor protection and the supervision of banks. Today, let me set out how we intend to meet the previously stated objectives of the Government, the Financial Services Authority and the Bank of England with regard to Northern Rock, as well as the background against which we make our proposals. The proposals I set out today for a commercial solution to Northern Rock&#151;underpinned by Government support&#151;best meet our objectives of protecting taxpayers and depositors, and maintaining financial stability. I will set out the reasons for this in greater detail.&#147;I can confirm that the existing government guarantee arrangements to depositors will remain in place. Savers&#146; money remains safe and secure. As the House will recall, at the end of last summer, following the problems in the US mortgage market, Northern Rock found it increasingly difficult and then impossible to raise the billions of pounds it needed to finance its business. It was completely exposed. It had no Plan B. Northern Rock was forced to ask the Bank of England for support to allow it to continue to operate. The Government agreed to that support because, in the then prevailing conditions, there was a serious risk that other parts of the banking system would be destabilised. That support was successful and prevented further contagion. That decision was wholeheartedly supported by right honourable and honourable Members of this House.&#147;As the House knows, the Government have announced guarantee arrangements for depositors&#146; money saved with Northern Rock. In October and December we also provided further guarantees and funding arrangements in order to give the company the time it needed to try and find a solution to its problems, as I informed the House. At that time I said that I would ask Northern Rock to come back with proposals no later than mid-February this year. These guarantee arrangements, including the extension in December, have not been called and there has been no cost to the taxpayer. However, these arrangements remain necessary and will be in place for the time being. Equally, Bank of England lending is secured against Northern Rock&#146;s assets, such as high quality mortgages, which are assessed by the Financial Services Authority as being of good quality. Again, there has been no cost to the taxpayer.&#147;Let me make it clear that the Government&#146;s position&#151;which I reiterated most recently in the Treasury Select Committee on 10 January&#151;is that a private-sector solution for Northern Rock is the preferable route for meeting our three objectives, but this cannot be at any cost. If it does not prove possible to secure a proposal that meets our stated objectives and conditions, it would be necessary to take Northern Rock into temporary public ownership. For that reason it would be irresponsible to rule it out.&#147;Despite intensive efforts over the past few months, and as a result of uncertain market conditions across the world, it has proved impossible for Northern  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_90"><b>21 Jan 2008 : Column 90</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Rock to find a purely commercial solution. In the autumn, market conditions were such that banks became increasingly reluctant to lend on terms that would have been acceptable. As the House will be aware, right across the world, banks are reporting substantial losses. Whilst conditions are better now than they were before Christmas, they remain difficult and the Government&#146;s financial advisers believe that there is no chance of achieving a private-sector deal backed entirely with private finance in the near future.&#147;Before I turn to my proposal, let me first deal with the question of putting the company into administration, as some have suggested. Administration would mean that control would immediately pass to an administrator who would look to realise the value of the company's assets which, under current market conditions, would amount to a fire sale. It could also exacerbate current market turbulence, and costs would be significant. I have therefore rejected such a proposal. &#147;My proposal today is one in which Northern Rock is owned and run in the private sector as a commercial bank, and where the Government provide a backstop guarantee to make private financing possible in the current market conditions. I believe that this company should be managed with private-sector disciplines and management, provided that we can do so on terms that properly protect taxpayers' interests.&#147;Let me now set out in greater detail how this proposal will meet our objectives of protecting the taxpayer, protecting consumers and promoting financial stability. Northern Rock would raise the funds it needs from investors by selling assets. The Treasury would guarantee payment to those investors in the event that the assets were insufficient to meet its obligations, for which Northern Rock would pay the Treasury a fee. In this arrangement, shareholders and other providers of capital in Northern Rock accept the first risk, with the Government acting as a backstop.&#147;According to the Financial Services Authority, Northern Rock has a good quality loan book. In normal market circumstances, such a guarantee would be unnecessary. However, in the current circumstances, to attract a wide range of investors on acceptable terms that protect the public interest, a guarantee is necessary.&#147;If this proposal is accepted, it would mean that all of the Bank of England's current loan facilities for the company are repaid in full, with interest, upfront, on completion of the transaction.&#147;Our willingness to put that support in place depends entirely on the terms on which a deal can be struck. I will authorise support for the private sector only if the public interest will be better served than through taking the company into temporary public ownership.&#147;In addition, any acceptable proposal would also need to comply with clear conditions. The company will need to demonstrate how it can operate sustainably in future without any government support and we will favour proposals that reach that point quickly.  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_91"><b>21 Jan 2008 : Column 91</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>New private sector capital will be needed, so that the private sector&#151;not the taxpayer&#151;takes the burden of risk for commercial success or failure. As long as the Government continue to provide a backstop guarantee, we will require restrictions on any sale of the company and on dividend payments.&#147;To allow that financing structure to be explored, the Treasury and the Bank of England will make arrangements to extend the Bank of England's loan facility until 17 March, by when we must submit a restructuring plan to the European Commission.&#147;The proposals would involve private sector participation in the financing of Northern Rock and would also provide the taxpayer with the ability to share in the potential upside returns, as business conditions improve, in return for the financial support provided to the company.&#147;The Government will make our decision as to which proposal we can, as provider of support accept, and, with the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, we will consider proposals received by 4 February from potential interested parties, including the company itself.&#147;Any proposals as a result of either that support or public ownership are highly likely to need state aid clearance and will therefore be dependant on approval by the European Commission. &#147;The Government have already started discussions with the company and with the two parties who have publicly stated an interest in the company. The Government are also ready to have discussions with any other interested parties.&#147;Let me make it clear: if the solution that I have outlined proves not to be possible on terms that protect the public interest, a temporary period of public ownership will be necessary. Legislation is being prepared, should it be necessary, and would make provision for an independent valuer to decide on the level of compensation to be made to shareholders. The principles for assessing that compensation would be based on the company not receiving public support and that all specific financial assistance from the Bank of England or the Government had come to an end. That is set out more fully in the statement to the markets today.&#147;It is for the independent Office for National Statistics to determine whether Northern Rock is classified to the public sector in the national accounts. Any liabilities classified to the public sector would be temporary and backed by significant assets and do not represent any meaningful measure of fiscal sustainability. The code for fiscal stability&#151;set out in legislation passed by this House&#151;provides for such situations. We would also address the future of the Northern Rock Foundation, in the event of temporary public ownership.&#147;The proposal that I have outlined today meets our stated objectives of protecting the taxpayer, protecting depositors and maintaining financial stability. Northern Rock got into the difficulties it faced because of global market conditions. The Government agreed to Bank of England support  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_92"><b>21 Jan 2008 : Column 92</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for Northern Rock because of the destabilising risk to the rest of the financial system, and also provided guarantees to protect depositors. Both objectives have been met. We now need to reach a solution which leaves the greatest risk with the company yet will allow taxpayers to profit from any future sale.&#147;Ideally, the best solution would have been a private-sector solution without any government support, but in current uncertain market conditions that is not possible. Administration, with the resulting fire sale of the company&#146;s assets, would not be in the public interest. Temporary public ownership&#151;nationalisation&#151;remains an option. However, even those who advocate that now see it as a stepping stone to returning Northern Rock to the private sector that would involve government support. In the mean time, it would still require continuing financial support and it would leave the public sector bearing all the risk. The proposal that I have outlined today is the right one. It provides a government guarantee that enables a commercial solution in which the private sector raises finance and bears risk. It also offers the prospect of withdrawing government support more quickly and is therefore most likely to meet our stated objectives and conditions. I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.

In desperation the Government have agreed to continue to use taxpayers&#146; money to support the Northern Rock balance sheet in the hope that there might be a deal to be done. As a result of the Statement, taxpayers will continue to bear significant risk, but for longer&#151;and that is certainly no improvement on the risk profile at present.</p>

What the Government are proposing is a million miles from the commercial solution. It is a political solution that uses taxpayers&#146; money to avoid the truth that there is no genuinely commercial solution available. Further, today&#146;s Statement gives us no real information. How much money will be tied up in these new guaranteed loan notes, and for how long? Is it just the existing lending or will even more taxpayers&#146; money be going in under cover of guaranteed loan notes? The Statement talks of arrangement fees and expenses, which the BBC&#146;s business editor estimated this morning could amount to &#163;1 billion at market rates. Will the Minister tell us what the fees and expenses are expected to total, and how Northern Rock will pay them? Will the Government have to lend Northern Rock even more money for that purpose?</p>

The Government have made noises about improvements that they will make for the future, but they have done nothing. They have not yet explained

They have told us that they have identified which committee room in the Cabinet Office will be used for future financial crises, but they have not said precisely what proposals they will bring forward to deal with the impediments to effective action that the Governor of the Bank of England identified in his evidence to the Treasury Select Committee of another place.

The Government have borrowed the Liberal Democrats&#146; idea of &#147;temporary public ownership&#148; as if that is something different from nationalisation, and that it is something which can be arranged to order. If the combined efforts of all those involved to date have failed to come up with a solution which keeps Northern Rock in the private sector, what hope is there of a crippled nationalised business being returned to the private sector on a successful and timely basis? The history of public ownership is not a good one. The fact is that nationalised industries have destroyed value. Can the Minister tell us what makes the Government believe that, under their control, nationalisation would be both temporary and not value-destroying?

It is now clear that they will not have to repay a penny up front. This demonstrates the folly of the Government&#146;s earlier position, which was maintained for a number of months against all the evidence. It was always clear to most commentators in the City and to many people in your Lordships&#146; House that the ability of the two consortia that were left standing two months ago to raise the billions of pounds they claimed was very small, and so it has proved.</p>

Indeed, not a single figure is mentioned in the entire Statement except for two dates on which future action is planned. We know that any decision about the future of Northern Rock will be delayed by a further four to six weeks, during which time the market, particularly the housing market, is likely to fall further, and the costs of having dithered on Northern Rock will have increased yet again.</p>

They say in the Statement that they intend to take some of the up-side that might accrue if the bank has a successful future, but it is completely unclear how much of the profit the Government intend to benefit from. Is the <I>Financial Times </I>right, for example, in saying that the Government&#146;s equity stake will be no more than 5 to 10 per cent? Such a figure would obviously leave 90 to 95 per cent to a private buyer. What is the logic in those figures? Given that the Government are the only ones keeping this institution going, that seems a completely unacceptable ratio.</p>

That solution would mean that the public had a stake in the developing equity if the bank was successful while, if the bank ran into serious trouble, as a private sector bank it would expect that the private investors would take first risk. If we did not do that we would be open to the challenge, which has emerged from the Liberal Benches in the past, that what is being constructed is an automatic underwriting by the public purse of gains that the private sector will take, and which will be of no value to the public at all.

That other time constraint is that there is a defined time period in which state aid to the private sector is available. That period runs out for this process on 16 March, and the Government are working towards obtaining solutions to these issues and a successful bid, should it prove to be so, well within that timeframe.</p>

It will depend on whether the private sector produces bids that meet our other criteria in order that it can act on this basis. Far from the Government standing idly by, we have carried out the necessary preparation over these past two months to ensure the viability of the bids as well as the clarity of the terms on which any bid needs to be established.</p>

On the moral hazard, one issue that was abundantly clear to the nation was the sight of investors queuing outside a bank. That represented a distinct threat not just to Northern Rock, but to banks that could and would be signalling difficulties.

That emblem was clear from the moment that the Northern Rock crisis broke. If there is one achievement which clearly exonerates the Government, it is that they put a stop to that position.

I should add that this amendment is not concerned with the question of putting information on birth certificates.

I entirely accept the importance of counselling&#151;and there are other amendments in this group about counselling&#151;but it cannot be anywhere more important than in the field of a putative donor conception.

There is no doubt whatever about the damage that can be done to children either if they accidentally find out that their social father is not their biological father or if circumstances arise where they have to be told. They may take it very hard, whereas they can&#151;with difficulty, I agree, because it is a difficult subject to explain to a child&#151;be brought up in the knowledge that their biological father is not their social father. Therefore, I strongly support the amendment, even if in the end the advice appears not in the Bill but only in the code, although I should prefer to have both.</p>

All the amendments have the fundamental principle behind them of being open and honest with the child. There is nothing more devastating for children than to discover that their parents have lied to them. The difficulty is that parents do not know how to begin the conversation. In a well meaning way, they think that if they put it off until the child is more mature and can cope, somehow that will be better, but the converse is true. There is good evidence that if you start communicating with children before they develop speech and language, and they know either that they are adopted or that there is something in their background&#151;donor conceived, or whatever, or that there is some family secret&#151;they grow up with it. It is normal to them; it is internalised and they are okay. When they are brought up believing that the world consists of one construct and then somebody says that they have something to tell them, all of those foundations of their lives are taken away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="0801222000121">It is that principle behind the amendment, which stands in the names of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, myself, and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. It is essential to reinforce the principle of honesty in all that we do, particularly when medical technology is used to intervene in what could be called processes of nature. I am worried that if we do not have something on the face of the Bill, it could slip in priority in clinical services, which are somewhat hard-pressed. There is merit in having a requirement in the Bill that people need to know how to give information. The government amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Darzi of Denham, does that. I realise that it has been drafted in that way. I hope, therefore, that the guidance that goes with the amendment will really stress the need for parents to be given the skills, tools and guidance so that they can update how to give information as the child grows up. It should not be one-off information at the time they attend the clinic, but they should be able to access age-specific and age-relevant information, which will match the child&#146;s development, so that some of the traumas of which we have heard can be avoided in future.</p>

The social worker involved saw that one of the young people was adopted, noticed a striking similarity and discovered that the proposed spouse had also been adopted.

Children can search for their unknown genetic parents, and families can make contact with genetic half-siblings with a donor in common. Thousands of people have registered on that site looking for sperm donors, parents and for the children they helped to conceive.

I am sure that there is not scintilla of difference among anyone in this House: we want high-quality statistics. The board cannot begin its new role in April by being asked to connive in something which is, on the face of it, a falsehood if full details are not recorded in birth certificates. Has the new Statistics Board been consulted, or will it be consulted on that critically important issue&#151;a genealogical, historical and medical issue&#151;for those whose records it is considering?

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="0801222000144">As a practitioner running, at the time, a busy fertility clinic in Hammersmith, I think we invested in counselling more heavily than any other unit in the United Kingdom. Since then, one of our senior counsellors has been an adviser to the HFEA and is now a member of that authority. Therefore, our credentials for counselling are pretty impeccable. Certainly, as director, I took it very seriously and made certain that we invested in the salaries to ensure that every patient coming through for in vitro fertilisation could have extensive counselling if required, in particular when donor gametes were to be offered to a patient, something that we were very conscious about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="0801222000145">Everyone has said tonight that it is important to be open with children, to be as honest as we can about their origins and explain to them as early as possible that they come from a donor parent of one or the other sort. The question here is how many parents decide to keep this matter a secret. My impression from following up on patients in the clinic&#151;I admit that this is anecdotal and that I do not know of any solid research&#151;is that, rather than seeing a decrease in the number of people who keep quiet, we have seen an increase in the number of men and women who want to keep the origin of their children secret. That cannot in any way be enforced in the clinic; it would be impossible.</p>

<a name="80121-0016.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="0801222000146">The consequence is that children may find out at the wrong time. I have seen that in several children, including one young man I am particularly concerned about, who is now a student at university. The children find out at the time of their parents&#146; break-up, usually when they are young teenagers. That is probably the most damaging time. In the case of the young man&#151;it has happened with other children as well&#151;the father has said, &#147;You&#146;re not my responsibility, and I am not your father anyway&#148;. That had a devastating effect on the young man, but I have seen the same in girls as well. That is a problem with sperm donation.</p>

<a name="80121-0016.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="0801222000147">Another problem that we have not considered is, I think, even more serious: egg donation. I do not know if there is an easy answer. As has been explained ad nauseam, when women run out of eggs, one of the most successful treatments in infertility practice today is that of offering donor eggs. In fact, donor eggs given to an early menopausal woman in her late 30s or early 40s carry an almost 50 per cent chance of resulting in a pregnancy. But what happens in reality, particularly in the private sector, is that, because it is difficult to get hold of donor eggs, women who are not wealthy and are perhaps somewhat dispossessed and have to pay for their in vitro fertilisation treatment opt to donate some eggs from the clutch of eggs taken during an in vitro fertilisation cycle, in return for which they get free treatment. The recipient of those eggs remains anonymous. There is no way back because the eggs have to be exposed immediately. As a consequence, some women end up donating eggs, their own in vitro fertilisation cycle fails, and the woman they have given their genetic material to has an embryo implanted and has a baby.</p>

<a name="80121-0016.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="0801222000148">Rightly or wrongly&#151;I have views about it that are not relevant here&#151;the HFEA has consistently sanctioned egg sharing of that sort. I am not sure that it is a wise decision, but that is what happens. However, the position is now made even more poignant with the loss of anonymity. Many women go through in vitro fertilisation treatment as poor patients. I have seen this, and indeed I wrote to a former Minister of health&#151;not one of the current Front-Benchers in either House&#151;to explain that I had just met a women who had had five treatments as a donor. The statistical probability was that she had at least two or three children of whom she was not aware. Imagine the problems for that woman, who was left infertile and has remained so, when 18 years later she is visited by a child of whom she had no knowledge. It is a very serious issue.</p>

However, this legislation increases the risk in some ways because the fact is that fewer men will be prepared to provide donor sperm because of the possible consequences of being traced later on. There is then a greater risk of consanguinity because there will be fewer sperm donors in the United Kingdom. A number of issues need to be teased out as we consider the legislation. I do not know the answers, but they have to be borne in mind during the passage of these amendments.</p>

I start, as I have in all my contributions on the Bill, by highlighting again the need for us to rely on solid evidence. Over the past few months, I have been concerned when individual cases have been cited, some in the press, which your Lordships have no way of verifying independently, emotive though those cases may be. It behoves your Lordships&#146; House to look not only at the evidence base but at current practice before we legislate.</p>

There is an equally emotive case to be made on behalf of people who do not wish there ever to be any mark on any birth certificate that identifies a person as being donor-conceived. We will have a fuller debate in time, but noble Lords should be aware of that.</p>

I have been involved in it, I have seen some of its work, and I invite noble Lords to take the easy action of clicking on to its website. There they will find not only guidance to prospective parents but guidance from existing donor fathers, donor mothers and same-sex couples about the importance of telling children at an early stage about their status and about all other aspects of the experience that they are likely to have and the things that they should consider as parents. So, even without the legislation, much work is already being done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="0801222000153">Many of the debates so far on this matter have been based on some very old data. I looked at data from a research study that was published last year. Prospective parents, who had been approached via infertility counsellors in licensed clinics, were specifically asked whether, in view of the changes in the rules on anonymity, they would be more or less likely to tell children at an early stage and what were the issues around that. Two-thirds of the prospective parents said that they were more likely to tell children of their donor-conceived status. Interestingly, though, a tenth said that they would be less likely. That flags up the fact that, whatever law we may pass, in practice this is an extremely

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="0801222000154">We should do two things: we should encourage the Government to continue to support all voluntary efforts such as the talking and telling courses that are being implemented by the Donor Conception Network for parents; and we should be mindful that counselling is a resource, and it costs. I can think of many examples across the whole spectrum of social policy where one would like counselling to be available. I urge one note of caution: people who have made the conscious decision to go to a licensed clinic for this treatment may not be the people most in need of counselling; they may be well aware of what they are letting themselves in for and what the issues are for any future children. So be aware that adding a cost to a treatment may well put off some people who, in all other respects, would be extremely good parents of whom we would otherwise approve.</p>

I should like very briefly to add to the weight of that opinion. I begin by saying how very much I support the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Jenkin. As he and others have said, a number of us initially thought that it might be possible to devise a way of satisfying the child&#146;s right to know by ensuring that the child&#146;s birth certificate made clear in some way the fact of his birth status. It became apparent from the Government&#146;s response and from private discussions that however it is dressed up, this is not an idea that Ministers are willing to accept, mainly on human rights grounds. It would be helpful to hear from the Minister exactly why that is; there are a lot of people out there who are unclear and unsure about the precise arguments. I understand, of course, that a couple who have become parents through receipt of donor sperm believe strongly that they have a right to privacy and that it is no part of the state&#146;s function to interfere in their family life. However, it is at least highly questionable whether the rights of parents on that matter are of a comparable magnitude to those of donor-conceived children. I would maintain that they are not, which is why many of us have been trying so hard to find a way through the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="0801222000156">In Committee I also argued that whenever a woman requests IVF treatment involving donor sperm or ova, she should receive mandatory counselling. At present the Bill merely specifies that the woman and her partner should be given an opportunity to receive such counselling. Disappointingly, that idea was kicked into touch by the Minister. It is, however, very welcome to see the government amendment to Clause 23, which appears to go part of the way at least towards that objective. I hope that I understand the amendment correctly and that it is the Government&#146;s intention to make it mandatory for anyone seeking treatment at a clinic to receive certain relevant information as part of the process of giving their informed consent. In other words, the woman and her partner would not only have to read and digest the information; they would

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="0801222000157">However, I am going to sound a little like Oliver Twist because I do not think the amendment goes quite far enough, which is why I have tabled Amendment No. 129 as an amendment to it. This amendment specifies that included in the information received by people who request IVF treatment by donor, there needs to be a section making clear the critical importance of being open with the child about the circumstances of his conception and another section pointing the couple towards sources of advice designed to make it easier for them to approach the very sensitive process of actually breaking the news to the child. We have heard powerful contributions from the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, on that point. The key elements here are the absolute necessity of explaining why it matters so desperately to a donor-conceived child to be told the truth, what happens to the child if he is not told the truth but discovers it for himself by accident, and what is at stake in terms of the trust placed in the parents by the child&#151;trust that will vanish for ever if the child finds out that he has been deceived. The parents have to be taken through all of this&#151;that is the point. While I have to recognise the reality that counselling will not be made compulsory, I hope that the process of obtaining informed consent will encourage couples to ask for counselling. Parents need to understand that bringing up a donor-conceived child carries with it some particularly onerous responsibilities that should not be ducked. I hope the Minister will consider my amendment in a positive way.</p>

That is done by the parents telling them in the most effective and least distressing way. It is the Government&#146;s view that that is best achieved by education rather than enforcement.</p>

Following discussions in Committee we have tabled Amendment No. 128, which strengthens provision in the Bill in respect of counselling and information, in addition to requiring that all patients be given the offer of counselling and provided with information. It also requires quite specifically that the HFEA produces in its code of practice guidance for the clinics about doing so. The noble Earl is quite right in his reading of our amendment. For example, where the treatment involves donated gametes, the code could specify that information relating to the importance of discussing this issue with the child from an early age was provided to prospective parents.

Therefore, any interference by the state into this private realm would have to be proportionate and fully justified.

<p><a name="08012111000010">The noble Baroness said: This is a probing amendment to draw the attention of the Committee to the apparent disparity between the stated aims of the Bill in the Long Title and the clause that immediately succeeds it. Despite the Bill promising deregulation to make provision for,</p>
<ul><a name="08012111000103">&#147;the reduction and removal of regulatory burdens&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08012111000094">the office to facilitate that is named the &#147;Local Better Regulation Office&#148;. While Her Majesty&#146;s Government may have pulled the wool over the eyes of the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, they have not succeeded with us on these Benches. Better regulation is not deregulation. I also suggest through this amendment&#146;s removal of the adjective &#147;better&#148; that, as the office stands in the Bill, &#147;Local Better Regulation Office&#148; is a misnomer for something that will produce more hideously complex and heavily bureaucratic regulation.</p>

<p><a name="08012111000011">While the Bill promises a change from Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s past record on regulation, I fear that no such promise will be fulfilled. This is the third piece of supposedly deregulatory legislation to pass through Parliament since 2000. In 2001, Her Majesty&#146;s Government introduced an Act that produced only 27 deregulations in four years. In the same period, more than 600 new regulations were introduced. How can a Bill that creates a fantastically complicated primary authority partnership, which potentially allows one local authority to have jurisdiction over another, even pretend that it is deregulatory? I believe that the Bill will cause resentment between local authorities, resentment between big businesses competing to secure the best primary authority and resentment from small businesses in relation to their larger competitors, which will have an unfair chance to choose their primary authority. All that resentment will burden the Local Better Regulation Office with more complaints to field and more and more disputes to oversee.</p>

As I said at Second Reading&#151;I shall reiterate it&#151;all that the Bill does is to introduce more regulation in an optimistic bid to mend a broken system. I would be much reassured if the Minister could tell me where in the Bill is the impetus to deregulate. I do not find it anywhere. I beg to move.</p>

Almost the whole Bill, perhaps with the exception of Part 4, is concerned with better regulation. The Bill sets up the Local Better Regulation Office, which will try to achieve, by way of monitoring and review, the better co-ordination of regulation that otherwise might be inconsistent from one local authority to another, for example.</p>

<p><a name="08012111000014">The Better Regulation Task Force, which has been in existence for some years, used to be called the Deregulation Task Force. However, it was realised that that was something of a misnomer, because sadly, if only the noble Baroness would recognise it, regulation is needed across a whole range of matters, whether health and safety, food standards or consumer protection, an issue that has, I know, always been close to her heart. If the amendment is not frivolous&#151;in a way, I would prefer that it was&#151;but is meant to be serious, much of Parts 1 to 3 of the Bill, which are concerned with making regulation better, would not have any sense. To call the LBRO the &#147;Deregulation Office&#148; would be to misname it, given its job according to the Bill.</p>

He noted that local authorities regulate an extremely diverse range of issues and he drew attention to the debt that we all owe local authorities

LBRO has been established to address that problem and to drive forward essential improvements in local authority regulation services. Its core aim is to support local authorities to regulate more effectively. It will be judged, of course, on its ability to reduce burdens on business and to build the capability of local authority regulatory services to deliver what has come to be known as the better regulation agenda. LBRO will work with local authorities to build on the many examples of good practice that are already emerging on the ground.</p>

I emphasise that regulations are vital for a civilised society generally, so just to look to deregulate and not to use deregulation as part of the better regulation process would be an error.</p>

We have listened to businesses, the public sector and voluntary organisations and we are currently undertaking one of the most radical reform agendas in the world to strip away unnecessary and burdensome regulations.

We recognise, as must all Members of the Committee, that regulation brings valuable benefits, such as fair competition, employee welfare and the protection of our environment. The benefits of regulation have to outweigh the costs and burdens that it imposes. Better regulation is a light touch while upholding the valuable protections that regulations provide.

The amendment deals with the criteria for membership. Other amendments dealing with membership have also been tabled but have been degrouped from this one.</p>

I hope that current members would not need this to be said, but I will say it anyway as a matter of courtesy; this is not an attack on any of them. The Liberal Democrats&#146; main concern about Parts 1 and 2 is that&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, has already alluded to this&#151;we may end up with a greater burden on local authorities rather than a reduction of the burden. I therefore felt it important to ensure that the board members of the LBRO were as well informed about the practice of local government as they were about

<p><a name="08012111000039">I have some sympathy with the noble Baroness&#146;s point and the objectives of her amendment. The way in which the structure of the LBRO has been laid out in parts 2 and 3 of Schedule 1 is very loose and quite difficult, and may over time be open to some form of abuse and cosiness. However, I think that her amendment suffers in two ways. First, there is a technical problem, because using percentages on small boards produces some odd results. Let us say that the board is finally constituted of six members&#151;it can have between five and 10 members. In that case, 25 per cent would mean two members from local government. Percentages are probably the wrong way to go about this. I would prefer to see it expressed as representation from the area that the noble Baroness is concerned about, which is local government.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0001.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08012111000040">My more fundamental point is that it is not just local government that is concerned with the impact of the Bill. A minute ago, the Minister, in his opening, quasi-Second Reading speech, reminded us that the intention of the Bill is to reduce the burdens on business, so it would be appropriate for there to be some representation for those who are going to be in the regulated community: commerce and industry in our cities, towns and villages across the country. They will have real-life, practical experience to offer about how LBRO is working, or not as the case may be.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0001.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08012111000041">Secondly, there are several clauses in the Bill concerned with links with Wales: Clause 10 is entitled &#147;Advice to Welsh Ministers&#148; and Clause 16 is entitled &#147;Guidance or directions by Welsh Ministers&#148;. In addition to having all that stuff, which is slightly ex post in the sense that it is the cart after the horse, it would be better to find a way to have some Welsh involvement in the LBRO.</p>

I know that she will have looked at the current list of members. It is of some significance that the chairman is a former chief executive of a local authority and the chief executive is a former trading standards chief from Staffordshire. They are very experienced in local government. There are other people, but I know only their names so I am not sure what their provenance is&#151;perhaps the Minister will enlighten us.</p>

<p><a name="08012111000044">Given the significance of this Act, as it will be, in relation to local government, I find it difficult to imagine that the Minister&#146;s choice will not inevitably include people who have experience of local government. However, like the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, I feel that other people who are regulated&#151;businessmen, commercial people and people from businesses of all kinds&#151;probably ought to be represented. In addition and&#151;if I may be forgiven for saying so&#151;perhaps even more important are people who can be said to represent the public, in whose interest the regulatory scheme is meant to be. Those who are being regulated may be represented, but it is important that people representing the public in general should also be on the LBRO.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0001.htm_para27">
<p><a name="08012111000045">The wording of the amendment is surely much too prescriptive and restrictive in its approach. It is perhaps difficult to follow the sense of &#147;recent&#148;, &#147;direct&#148; and &#147;significant&#148;; lawyers such as the noble Baroness and I could argue for a long time over whether anybody came within those interesting categories. That emphasises that the wording is too restrictive. There must be an element of trust in those who make the choices.

I would be grateful to know, now that we have the Local Better Regulation Office&#151;everybody recognises, although you have to read the Bill pretty carefully, that it is actually central and national&#151;how these local concerns are to be fed into the system.

They cover&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, I think, will be particularly delighted about this&#151;business representation and Welsh representation in the figure of one member; namely, the chairman of the board, who apparently meets those qualifications admirably. The other eight, plus a chief executive who is also a member of the board&#151;I shall not go through this in detail&#151;include a member of the Security Industry Authority; a senior partner at Global Consulting; someone with Scottish Executive health department experience; someone who was an important member of the Department for Transport; the chief executive of the London Borough of Enfield; a commissioner with the Independent Police Complaints Commission; and a justice of the peace, who was formerly head of legal services for Sainsbury&#146;s. The chairman, to whom I have already referred, is a company director and was until three

Moreover, the chief executive was, as has been said, a distinguished head of trading standards and community safety at Staffordshire County Council. So the board has a broad scope at the moment. Of the nine directors, six have experience of local government, while two have recent or current experience of local government.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0002.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08012111000053">I remind the Committee that the directors were appointed in full compliance with the recommendation of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. In practice, that means that the current board has been appointed using a process with the agreed higher standards. It is our intention that this would allow the current directors to transfer to the new body, which the Bill will form, without a further appointment process. The Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments has specifically confirmed that that is an appropriate step.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0002.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08012111000054">It is not the Government&#146;s intention that the LBRO board be representative of all the groups with an interest in its work, nor do I believe that members of the board should represent particular interest groups. The board should be made up of those people most capable of ensuring that it achieves its objective while taking into account the opinions and expertise of all its key stakeholders. For those reasons, we disagree with the noble Baroness in suggesting that a specific percentage of the board should come from local government.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0002.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08012111000055">The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, raises an important and interesting point, to which I think we will return in Committee. I shall try to start the ball rolling on this issue. We do not agree that the LBRO is a kind of centralising force. It is about consistency where appropriate. I emphasise to the Committee that it will remain for local authorities to decide whether and when they should take regulatory action, and what that action should be, subject to this sensible requirement for some consistency. Macrory was not really about bigger penalties; the report was about targeted, flexible and appropriate enforcement, with lighter enforcement and penalties where appropriate. It was not about having people convicted of offences where that was completely inappropriate. I know that we will have interesting debates around Part 3 and Macrory. I say that just as a starter in reply to the noble and learned Lord and I look forward to the continued debate on that point.</p>

<p><a name="08012111000056">As far as reassurances going ahead are concerned&#151;the noble Baroness was concerned about that&#151;the problem of a representative board is that, frankly, the LBRO has too many stakeholder groups. They involve business, small business, consumers, professional organisations such as the Trading Standards Institute and devolved Administrations. There are other stakeholders, too, for want of a better word. Where do we stop with appointments to the board? We firmly believe that the LBRO cannot function without a lot of input from the sector. That will be as important with future appointments as with the current board. I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I started by saying that I wanted to understand the criteria for appointments. Simply saying that something has gone through proper processes in the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments does not answer the question about criteria. I was not for a moment challenging propriety. Indeed, there are a lot of stakeholders&#151;that is a terrible term. It is perhaps almost impossible to have every interest represented. There is certainly an argument to be made that one wants not necessarily representation but the ability to understand work of which one has no direct experience or general wisdom, and so on. The main point is about understanding how the Government or the chair, who will make future appointments, are going to approach the task.</p>

<p><a name="08012111000062">To answer some of the points that have been made, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, that I went for a percentage because there will be issues about the size of the board and we could have a variable number. I entirely take the point that there is no one right way of doing this. I did not table an amendment that included representation from the business world; I sometimes leap perhaps a little too fast to champion local authorities. I had assumed that the Conservative Front Bench would table amendments for the representation of business; perhaps that was wrong. I simply thought that business would have more champions.</p>

It was a very different organisation. I was one of the local authority members. When someone made a proposition, there were two distinct reactions.

<p><a name="08012111000069">I look forward to the future and to what might happen in other times and other circumstances. As I understand it, we have two classes of members.

I found the wording, particularly in line 27, quite strange. It certainly does not meet general corporate governance principles. When you serve on the board of a company, you have some say in who will join that board. The chairman does not appear one morning, saying, &#147;Here is your new member&#148;. He may lead the process, set the executive search people going and arrange the interviews. He may do all that&#151;undoubtedly he and the chief executive will have considerable influence on how the shortlist is drawn up&#151;but the members of the board will have some say. </p>

This is not just a theoretical question, because if the Bill is enforced in its current form and we have, say, four ordinary and four ex officio members&#151;half and half, as laid down&#151;on a board of eight, we would have three ordinary members and the chairman and three ex officio members and the chief executive. It is perfectly clear at that point that the chairman, the chief executive and the ex officio members will all be in the same loop. That is because the chief executive and

Alternatively, we need to find a way&#151;this is not in my amendment&#151;to improve the appointment process for ex officio members so that, beyond peradventure, how these people are to arrive on the board is written into the Bill. The paragraph is not up to modern corporate governance practice and the Local Better Regulation Office should adhere to the best practice around in British commerce, industry and public life.

<p><a name="08012111000079">The noble Lord said: Encouraged by my previous amendment, I am going on for a major prize. In paragraph 6(2) of Schedule 1, a person is appointed as an ordinary member of the LBRO for a term of less than five years and paragraph 6(5) states that the total term may not exceed 10 years&#151;that is, two terms of office. I do not want the Minister to feel persecuted by me, but this is another place where his department must look outside at what is going on in the wider world. Almost everywhere there is now a maximum of three three-year terms&#151;nine years. The purpose of that is quite simple. You have a year or 18 months to learn about the business, get involved in it and understand it, and a basic three-year term. If it has been a failure and you have not contributed, it can be brought to an end at three years. You then have another three-year term when you are contributing majorly to the discussions; if you are really contributing, you can be given a third three-year term, after which you should retire because you have probably become part of the furniture rather than part of the critique. Those three three-year terms are now enshrined in British corporate life.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0002.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08012111000080">This point is not just about what is going on in the wider world. A bad chairman for five years can do an enormous amount of harm. I am not saying that we will have a bad chairman, but we could. He or she could make this organisation lose its reputation. Shorter periods of time are part of the modern practice, so people are being properly assessed on whether they are delivering on what is part of their basic role. We have been through this again and again. We went through it at some length in the Charities Bill. There we were getting two five-year terms, but the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury&#151;sadly, he has now taken leave of absence&#151;persuaded the Government that three terms of three years was the right way to proceed.</p>

My point is that it takes some time to get to know the ropes in an organisation that is full of people working part time. It is quite different if you turn up Monday to Friday every week, for weeks and months on end. This is a part-time post and it will take a considerable time to learn the ropes, whatever the person&#146;s background and experience. Of course, the members have to get to know one another, their strengths and weaknesses, the staff and so on.</p>

<p><a name="08012111000085">There is provision for reappointment, so three years does not seem to be too short a period in one sense. However, in another sense, you get into the swing of things and get to know what you are doing in the second year; in the third year, if you are interested in the job, you are concerned about whether you will be able to continue in it. You may give a lot of attention to whether you will be reappointed and whether you will upset the Secretary of State if you go in a certain direction. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the chairman, will determine reappointment. Of course, there is no magic, whether the period is three years, five years or six years. All sorts of organisations have had similar periods and have changed; there is no absolutely correct way. I suggest that three years seems a little short for a part-time position in a public body. You would soon get to the third year and be thinking of retirement or reappointment and attitudes may change because of that. I am not at all sure that the Government have got it wrong.</p>

If you can serve three terms of three years, with a total of nine years, and everyone else has three terms of three years, I believe that statistically you can achieve a balance of continuity more easily than if people can do only two terms, with half leaving every time you get to the end of the five-year period.

I would like the Minister to accept that the way in which the annual report is to be drawn is too sketchy. It is too vague in its layout and it would benefit greatly from being made a bit more prescriptive so that the LBRO has to be judged against better criteria than the rather bland phrase, &#147;discharge of its functions&#148;, which comes in line 30 on page 36. If this is to work, it is important that we set the bar high so that the LBRO does well&#151;we will discuss that when we debate Clause 5&#151;and that it can be seen by those concerned with its operation that it is meeting those high standards. The &#147;discharge of its functions&#148; is perhaps a general, important statement that it should make, but it also ought to look at the way in which it has fulfilled its objectives as laid out in Clause 5. We will be debating those and perhaps amending them, but we really want to make sure that it has done what it has been asked to do in Clause 5.</p>

<p><a name="08012126000010">The LBRO also needs to say something about general duties and something about its management of affairs, bearing in mind that under Clause 14 it can enter into agreements, borrow money and acquire property. There is a whole series of things that it ought specifically to be asked to report on each year. Yes, it should report on its functions, but it also ought to deal with objectives, its general duties&#151;where it is giving advice about central or local government and where it is dealing with enforcement&#151;and the management of its affairs. That would make a better, more cohesive annual report, which would enable everyone to see whether the LBRO was performing in accordance with what was originally planned for it.

The promise of guidance does not meet the central issue, which is that there are concerns on all sides of the Committee about how well this body can work. It must show that it is meeting its objectives, functions and management. I do not see how the operation of the LBRO would be hindered by the fact that its annual report had to meet standards set out in the Bill, as opposed to mere guidance that might or might not be given in years to come. The Minister is slightly undermining the credibility of this organisation if it is not to have the highest possible standards of reporting and accountability.

The LBRO is, in fact, an NBRO: I know that it will have plans to operate locally, but it is operating nationally. We therefore need a means for people at local level to make a fuss about a national body operating at too high a level, as opposed to at the specific level we need if it is to be effective.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0003.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08012126000016">My amendment would require an annual public meeting. That would give the LBRO a chance to show that it is working with the grain and gaining public support. However, it would also be a chance for those who are not convinced to make a fuss; that may be uncomfortable, but so be it. The amendment merely lays down a series of broad criteria to be met for the annual public meeting. The meeting must be held within three months of the publication of the annual report and time must be found to allow for discussion of the report and questions on it. The LBRO must also give proper notice of the meeting and publicise it reasonably widely. Subject to that, however, the LBRO can more or less organise it in any way that it wishes.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0003.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08012126000017">I cannot see the objection to the LBRO being required to hold one public meeting a year; indeed, there are arguments that there should be more than that. I would like written into the Bill the potential link between those at the grass roots who are being regulated and what is inevitably a national organisation with some pretty high-level people, judging by how the Minister described them, who may or may not always be in touch with what is happening at the lowest level where their activities are having the most effect.

It suggests that a consultation be arranged annually to discuss the annual report once it has been published. Given my own history of consumer representation, I welcome the amendment because it would let the consumer public have some point of contact with the LBRO. Such an annual meeting could be a fortuitous forum for an exchange of questions and answers that will all, one hopes, contribute to the improvement of the LBRO&#146;s performance in the year ahead. It is important that the Bill should create more opportunities for consultation, as the Minister said earlier, between regulators, consumers and all the stakeholders in this. In making the Bill, the Government seem to have forgotten that sometimes not only business but the consumer is affected by regulation; the consumers must either benefit or suffer its consequences. I am therefore hopeful that the Minister, given his earlier words, will look at the amendment sympathetically.</p>

I wish the noble Lord had proposed a website, a cyber meeting or a virtual annual meeting, which would be a much more efficient way of doing this. People running small businesses do not really have time to get down to London or Cardiff to listen to the LBRO.

The lack of an explicit requirement for such an annual open meeting&#151;again, I am conscious that I am repeating what I said in the debate on the previous amendment&#151;follows the SOCA legislation as well as the Natural England legislation. The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, knows that the Cabinet Office guidance on NDPBs strongly recommends that an annual open meeting should be held for them where possible. I confirm again that the LBRO will be consistent with those standards. Whatever the statutory position, it will hold an annual public meeting, even in its current form, as a company wholly owned by guarantee. If the noble Lord is concerned that there will be no annual general meetings, his concern, if I may say so, is unwarranted. We do not feel that it is necessary for this to be in the Bill.</p>

I accept his point that even when a meeting is held people cannot always afford to come because they run small businesses and have to travel a long way. I will reflect on what the Minister said.

A few years ago I spent rather a long time wandering about the country as a member of the commission that set up these new authorities, so I know that they exist. I, too, shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in response to my noble friend&#146;s question.</p>

Although the term &#147;unitary authority&#148; is not explicitly included in the definition, I assure the Committee&#151;this was as much of a surprise to me as it may have been to the noble Lord and the noble Baroness&#151;that they are captured by Clause 3. While the term &#147;unitary authority&#148; is often used when discussing local government, such authorities do not actually exist as entities distinct from county or district councils and the term has no meaning in any legal sense. A county council can be a unitary authority if it includes some of the activities of a district council, and likewise a district council where it includes some of the activities of a county council. However, as I say, the term has no meaning in any legal sense. &#147;Unitary authority&#148; simply means a county, or more often a district council, that exercises the functions of both a county and a district. Therefore, through the inclusion of county and district councils in England and Wales in the definition of &#147;local authority&#148;, Clause 3 captures the notion of unitary authorities.</p>

He and I know what I am talking about, but the Committee should know that it is the city of Leicester. Bristol is in the same category.

I hope that the Minister will not be shocked&#151;I do not think that he is that shockable&#151;if I say that I have not followed through every single reference in Schedule 3, but at least Schedule 3 has them so that I and others will know where to refer to. The enactments referred to in Clause 4(3) are not listed in detail. I said to one of the organisations that will be concerned with the implementation of the Bill that I was concerned about that. The response was, &#147;Yes, we are concerned in case anything is left out&#148;. I said that my concern was whether there was more in here than I really understood. That relates to the lack of an authoritative list of the regulatory powers at issue here.</p>

I have had some exchange with the Bill team on this, for which I am grateful, but the team&#146;s answer was that listing all the regulations would be impractical. I simply do not think that that is good enough. We are making law and, regardless of whether it is impractical, tough or difficult to do, to my mind it still has to be done. If it is impractical for those in the department, is it practical for those who are outside the department who will have to implement all this? Should they be required to make their own assessment on whether a particular regulation is covered?</p>

I cannot claim that the Government have responded to my amendment; I am well aware that the Government have responded to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. How life will be for those affected by this new raft of legislation needs to be dealt with carefully. I beg to move.</p>

I shall answer the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment by speaking to my Amendment No. 16. Then, of course, other Lords will no doubt join in and, if necessary, I will come back, as we are in Committee. The amendment and its associated Amendment No. 62 would implement the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee on Clause 4 directly. I hope that, in the light of the explanation that I am about to give on the approach taken in our Amendment No. 16, the noble Baroness will eventually feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08012141000010">The Bill does not list the many relevant regulations that have been made under the European Communities Act 1972 but instead, in Clause 4, gives a list of those categories of regulation that will be considered to be in scope. The committee questioned the treatment of these directions in the Bill and recommended that specific ECA regulations should be listed individually, either in the Bill or by secondary legislation. Listing all the regulations that exist, whether in the Bill or by statutory instrument, would frankly be impractical. Regulations under the ECA 1972 are made frequently and any list would quickly be out of date; we would have to lay an order practically every day. Regulations under the ECA&#151;particularly on agriculture, food safety, consumer protection and environmental health&#151;are made in large numbers: 3,000 statutory instruments between January and October 2007. They generally, but not always, list the subject in the heading.</p>

<p><a name="08012141000011">Our approach in the Bill makes it clear which regulations are in scope. In the majority of cases, it will be clear whether particular ECA regulations fall within the category headings in Clause 4(3), as they generally include the relevant subject heading&#151;animal health, consumer protection and so on&#151;leaving no room for doubt. However, cases of doubt may arise and the committee questioned the appropriateness of the provision in Clause 4(7) that allows the Secretary of State to specify by direction whether specific regulations fall within one of these headings. It will be important to maintain the flexibility of the approach to listing the orders that we have taken in the Bill, but we accept that the process for clarifying the position regarding particular regulations should be subject to parliamentary oversight through the negative resolution procedure. That is what Amendment No. 16, which I will move in due course, seeks to do.</p>

Presumably, the LBRO will have to get a list, whether or not it is impractical, because that is what it will have to be concerned with. Someone somewhere will have to prepare some formulation, amended however frequently, because the Minister has made the case for better regulation.

Addition is fine, but I question the deletion of something that will not have been repealed; as I said, it would just drop away of its own volition.

The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, raises an important point. If an enactment is not applicable or appropriate for this regime, it is not necessary to delete it if it simply does not fall within the scope&#151;I think that that is probably the right term. However, as the noble Lord says, if there is a problem with the enactment&#151;that it is a bit difficult but is within the regime&#151;it should not be deleted just by the Secretary of State deciding to amend the schedule. On the previous amendment, perhaps I should not have said that I had not been through Schedule 3 in detail; those who will have to operate this will have done.

Even so, I hope that the Government will take the Pedlars Act 1871 out of Schedule 3, as that would please my noble friend Lord Cope greatly.

Regulations cannot change one authority to another; that is not fair regulating. The geographical location of a given business should not determine the strictures under which it is put. Furthermore, for a multi-site business, inconsistent regulating under the primary authority partnership has the potential to create a bureaucratic nightmare. Jones the butcher in Luton could be found to be transgressing fire regulations in Luton Borough Council and yet be complying with the fire regulations of his home authority, Westminster. Such regional differences threaten to swamp the resources of the LBRO, diverting it from important work. So consistency is a pre-requisite for the LBRO managing effectively and efficiently to co-ordinate our regulatory system.</p>

The fourth amendment requires that the guidance given to more than one local authority is given to all local authorities within the same category in Clause 3(1). For example, guidance given to one county council in England would need to be given to all county councils. Our view is that the first three amendments are not necessary, although we are very grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, for having spoken to the Bill team about them. The second part of the group&#151;Amendment No. 28&#151;would significantly hamper LBRO&#146;s ability to respond appropriately to issues that may affect only smaller groups of local authorities.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0004.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08012141000046">Dealing with Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 and 15 first, the relevant subsection simply allows for orders under Clause 4 to make different provision for local authorities in Wales and those in England. These orders can amend the scope of Part 1 of the Bill by allowing enactments to be added or removed from Schedule 3. That reflects the devolution settlement and the fact that Welsh Ministers may take a different view on the extension of LBRO&#146;s work into the new areas. The orders may specify enactments but may not pick and choose particular authorities to which they should apply.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0004.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08012141000047">On Amendment No. 28, Clause 6 specifies that LBRO may issue guidance to one or more local authorities, guidance to which they will, in the words of the clause, have to have regard. This ability to specify groups of authorities gives the organisation the flexibility to respond to particular regional or sectoral issues without the need for all local authorities&#151;frankly the guidance will be irrelevant for many as they will already be following best practice and implementing the better regulation agenda&#151;having to access it, study it, review it and then look at their procedures against it and possibly, we believe, reinvent the wheel unnecessarily.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012141000223">&#147;This Code supports the Government&#146;s better regulation agenda and is based on the recommendations in the Hampton Report.

The LBRO is charged with enforcing the code to which the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, refers. The word &#147;effectively&#148; is there to ensure that as the new body works with local authorities to ensure that the burdens of regulation are reduced, it does not neglect the interests of consumers and the public, whom the regulations are designed to protect.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0005.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08012141000082">The primary statutory duty of local authority regulators is to enforce the provisions in legislation that Parliament has put in place to protect the public. Better regulation is a matter of finding the right balance between securing those protections and doing so in a way that does not impose unnecessary and counterproductive burdens on business. It is government policy that burdens should not be reduced at the expense of the protections that regulation provides. It should not hamper effective enforcement. Emphatically, the word should not in this context be taken to mean that the LBRO will routinely scrutinise the internal management processes of particular local authorities. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said at Second Reading, local authorities have become familiar with the management trinity of the three Es: efficiency, economy and effectiveness.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0005.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08012141000083">The way in which local authorities manage their particular services in detail will not be a matter for the LBRO. The body will not overlap with a function that is already performed successfully by the Audit Commission. The LBRO&#146;s role is different; it will be about working to ensure that the whole regulatory system&#151;the system in which local authorities play a critical role&#151;works in the best interests of businesses and consumers alike. It will be as much about effective strategic oversight in the way in which central government plays its part as about working to disseminate the many examples of good practice that local authority regulatory services already have. That is why the phrase that may be widely used in management and local government is not appropriate for the LBRO and why the three E words are to be resisted. What has given me food for thought is the reminder from the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, that an early part of the code&#151;how will anyone who took part in the proceedings on that code in this Room ever forget?&#151;specifically mentions the word &#147;efficiency&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08012141000084">These are two separate amendments. I mean no disrespect to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, but I ask her to withdraw her amendment because we think that using the three E words would be an error and would give the wrong impression about how closely the LBRO would be involved in the mechanics of a local authority&#146;s management. As far as the word &#147;efficiency&#148; is concerned, without any promise at all to the noble Lord&#151;I am now talking to the next amendment&#151;I will take that back and consider whether his point about the code is unanswerable or false.</p>

<p><a name="08012141000094">Amendment No. 20 adds further criteria to the LBRO&#146;s objectives. A number of amendments have been laid to the Bill seeking to alter the objective, and I will take this opportunity to explain why the LBRO has been given its objective as drafted in Clause 5. Under Clause 5, the LBRO is required to secure that local authorities exercise their relevant functions in a way that is effective, does not give rise to unnecessary burdens and complies with the five principles of better regulation.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0005.htm_para22">
<p><a name="08012141000095">Those principles of good regulation were first set out by the Better Regulation Task Force, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Haskins, in 1997. They have stood the test of time pretty well and are increasingly being integrated into the legislative framework for regulators. They also feature in Ofcom&#146;s founding legislation, for instance, and many regulators are required to have regard to them under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. It is essential that the principles of better regulation are embedded at the local level, and it is appropriate for the LBRO to take on the task of achieving that. In addition, it is vital that the LBRO secures that local authorities carry out their functions in a way that reduces regulatory burdens and is effective; that is, in a way that reduces those burdens without compromising regulatory outcomes or the valuable protections that regulations provide.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0005.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08012141000096">On Amendment No. 20, we are utterly confident that the LBRO will look to promote proactiveness and positivity on the part of local authorities but do not believe that that should be added to the objective. There is a risk, in statute, of overloading the LBRO with multiple objectives; that should be avoided to reduce the possibility of unnecessary confusion. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment is just a step too far.</p>

We often find pushing forward more difficult. I am anxious that, for better local regulation, nothing should inhibit people from innovating and trying new ways and approaches. That was the purpose behind my amendment.</p>

A key motive for establishing the LBRO is to encourage a culture among local authority enforcement services in which the approaches recommended by the Hampton review of regulatory enforcement would be followed. Essentially, those are better co-ordination and consistency, a risk-based approach, targeting of rogue traders, securing compliance as the objective rather than punishment and prosecution, and education and information taking a central role as the preferred means of securing compliance. That approach is expressed officially in the compliance code.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0006.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08012141000105">In principle, the value of targeting for local authorities is that, taking into account both national and local priorities, they focus their resources on high-risk enterprises and give a much lighter touch to those businesses that are compliant. That ensures that traders who flout the law and deliberately go against the rules that they are required to follow are dealt with effectively&#151;or should I say effectively, efficiently and economically?&#151; providing in those cases vital protection for consumers, businesses and the environment. It seems to me that we should follow the precise words of the 2006 Act and not delete them, as the noble Baroness wishes.</p>

I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. I suspect that Clause 5(2)(a) is the generality of the approach, and Clause 5(2)b) is talking about individual cases where activity is needed. Unless we find a way to ensure that we focus the available resources in areas where action is needed&#151;I accept that action will be needed&#151;we will have the lowest common denominator where everybody is treated the same. There will be no reward for good behaviour, for behaving properly and owning up to mistakes when they occur, and the good boys will be treated the same as the bad.

I am not against targeting or risk-based regulation, but the word &#147;only&#148; seems not to provide the kind of protection for consumers and others that my noble friend spelt out earlier. As this is my first intervention in the debate, I suppose I should declare an interest as chair of the National Consumer Council, following in the footsteps of the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0006.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08012141000108">The wording was probably wrong in 2006. It does not say &#147;intervention&#148; or &#147;enforcement&#148;, but &#147;activities&#148;. Unless there is a degree of randomness about inspection, for example, that protection is not achieved. Certainly, for a bulk of resources, the totality of enforcement probably needs to relate to high-risk premises, companies and activities. But &#147;only&#148; overstates the risk-based principle; if it is in the 2006 legislation there is nothing I can do about that. But as Clause 5(2)(a), as the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, just said, states the generality, why do we not just leave it at that and accept the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment? I do not expect the Minister to agree to this, but perhaps he could have another look at it to see if the risk-based approach to regulation in 2008 could be better expressed, slightly more subtly.</p>

Of course, the statutory regulators&#146; compliance code was recently issued under the 2006 Act. The scope of the code coincides closely with that of Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill and the LBRO will naturally take a strong interest in the performance of local authorities in delivering their duties under the code.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0006.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08012141000110">However, it is unnecessary to include provision in the Bill requiring the LBRO to secure that local authorities act in accordance with the code. Local authorities are already under a statutory duty to have regard to the code under the 2006 Act. The inclusion of a provision to this effect in the Bill would not add anything and might create duplication and confusion where none exists. That is our simple argument against Amendment No. 21 of the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley.</p>

<p><a name="08012141000111">On the interesting amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and supported by my noble friend Lord Whitty, he is right: the Government will not accept it. We are more on the side of my noble friend Lord Borrie and the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. It would of course remove the five principles of better regulation from the Clause 5 objectives, and its duty not to impose unnecessary burdens which stipulates that action should be targeted only at cases where action is needed.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0006.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08012141000112">I go back to the Better Regulation Task Force publication that attempted to describe the principles. It described the attributes of &#147;targeting&#148; as follows: first,</p>

If they are good enough for the regulators&#146; compliance code, they are good enough for the Bill.

I ask the noble Lord why local authorities should penalise themselves and try to be jacks of all trades when there are many masters of one, like the Trading Standards Institute and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health at hand to do the job with expertise.

A problem with providing the capacity for local authorities to regulate effectively and efficiently&#151;the risk-based approach that we advocate here&#151;is that the number of TSOs, environmental health officers and other inspectors and professionals within local authorities has been squeezed with other priorities. It seems to me that whether local authorities employ such inspectors themselves or whether they subcontract in the way that the noble Baroness suggested, effective operation of regulation by local authorities requires a high level of professional expertise to fulfil the objectives of better regulation and to protect the consumers and the environment and every other area that is protected by the vast list of regulations listed in Schedule 3. Therefore, I think it is appropriate to have some reference to the professionalism of local authorities in the objectives of the LBRO.</p>

If the Minister is going to say &#147;not here&#148; because this is the same wording that we have used in the 2006 Act, that is fair enough, but where will he refer in the Bill to the professionalism of those on whom the local authorities will rely in delivering this regulatory outcome?</p>

It is fairly conventional stuff. The Minister has given us two descriptions. The noble Lord, Lord Desai, expressed a certain frustration&#151;&#147;Why do we not just get on with it? I mean, for goodness&#146; sake, we do not need all these extra words&#148;. But we have had less is more. We have had a Better Regulation Task Force. We have had, I think, a commission at some point. We have had Hampton and now we have the Better Regulation Executive. What in Clause 5 means that the LBRO will add any value to the things that have already been going on, as we have already been told, for the past 10 years or so? </p>

Who has not heard the argument or does not accept the argument or needs to be told again? I find it very difficult to put my finger on exactly what the LBRO will add. It will be a national body, but we already have one. Who will be dissolved to make room for the LBRO? Otherwise, why do we need it?</p>

On a couple of occasions already I may have gone on at too great length about what the LBRO is there to do. One of its jobs is to establish greater consistency in the way in which regulation is carried out. Although we praise what local authorities do, there have been unnecessary inconsistencies, and for regulation to be better, it is important to remove as many of those inconsistencies as possible.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012141000237">&#147;Enforcers should focus primarily on those whose activities give rise to the most serious risks&#148;.</p>

The Government have accepted that before a Minister confers the new powers on a regulator, he must be satisfied that the regulator will act in accordance with the principles referred to in the rather dull Clause 5(2). This is set out in Amendment No. 164 in the name of my noble friend Lord Jones of Birmingham after Clause 62. If we come to Part 3 one day, goodness knows when we will come to Amendment No. 164.

<p><a name="08012141000148">The noble Lord said: I seek to make Clause 5(2) more exciting by adding another principle, which is about regulatory stability. Let me explain what I am trying to get at. If you talk to people who are involved in commerce or industry at a high or low level, one of their complaints is about the constant regulatory change. While they can accept that from time to time there needs to be a fundamental change, too often the changes that they are faced with are tinkering with the system. The costs of complying with tinkering can be very high indeed, such as management time, even for a small firm, amendment to the IT and HR systems, changes to fixed asset registers and building up compliance records to ensure that the firm has been complying with the tinkered change.</p>

It is this constant drip, drip, drip, and maybe the individual drips are not that significant, but nevertheless they have to be complied with, and the changes that I described have to be made.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0007.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08012141000150">What I am seeking from the Government is an acceptance that rapid rates of regulatory change are unhelpful to the regulatory framework and unhelpful to economic progress for companies big and small; and some of the smaller companies find them most damaging and difficult to comply with. If the Minister is unable to accept my wording&#151;I hazard a guess that he will be unable to&#151;he might be able to come back with wording that will enable us to have as a principle to be followed the need to try to minimise the constantly changing framework with which British industry and commerce&#151;big, small and voluntary organisations&#151;have to put up with. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08012141000151"><b><a name="80121-gc0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="08012141000327">Lord Cope of Berkeley:</b> I had not originally thought that I would say anything on this amendment, although I agree with it and the principle behind it. It is worth while going back to something that the Minister said earlier this afternoon. In connection with EU regulations, he said, &#147;Look here, we cannot possibly be expected to list all the regulations; there were 3,000 in a few months last year. We cannot possibly be expected to list them. There are too many to list in the Bill or even on another piece of paper&#148;. Yet, the trader or businessman is expected to obey all 3,000. Of course, they will not all apply to every trader, I well understand that, but he must make certain which of them do, and that in itself is a burden. Obviously, the trade associations and the other bodies are extremely helpful in that.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0007.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08012141000152">It is also a tremendous burden on the local authorities. Any individual local authority potentially has to take account of all 3,000 regulations. That was just in the space of some months; I think that the noble Lord said it was January to October. The local authority has got to take account of all of them. This is part of the whole difficulty with all this regulation. We all agree that some regulation is necessary and that particular regulations are necessary, and no doubt all of us who have been in politics for any length of time have called for more regulation from time to time when something has gone wrong. In my previous existence in my constituency I heard, &#147;There ought to be a law against it&#148;. In every pub in England, someone says once a night, &#147;There ought to be a law against it&#148;, about something, and MPs pick it up and repeat it. Sometimes they are right&#151;but not all the time&#151;and that is why we have all these regulations. However, the 3,000 in a few months is an enormous number. That is why the principle embodied in this amendment is of the first importance.</p>

It is a lot, but it is not quite as many as was indicated. There are many statutory instruments about temporary speed limits when motorway repairs are being carried out and many very technical ones which do not have any substantial effect on the public. Of those that do there are 1,200. The other missing bit is that some aspects of European legislation find their way into British law without necessarily going through the transposition of a British statutory instrument. I do not know those figures because they do not come to the Merits Committee. The European regulations that come to the Merits Committee, and which are included in that 1,200, are the ones that need to be transposed into British secondary legislation.</p>

My noble friend has justified the clause from a business perspective and I would like to do the same from a consumer perspective. As the Committee will be aware, if regulations are inconsistent, there could be variations in services and standards from one business to the next. It is difficult for the consumer who will surely be disadvantaged if the Government are unable to issue clear and consistent directions. Inconsistency will lead again to the LBRO being swamped with complaints; that is, assuming that the consumer will be aware that yet another regulatory body has been established and that their complaint should be directed here rather than to their local authority which no longer has power to officiate in this. It seems certain that the introduction of such a system will mean that consumer concerns will take even longer to be addressed than they are now. Realising that this is a real and potential problem, will the Minister consider this amendment, if only to appease me, so that the consumer will be protected from the effects of the Bill&#146;s increasing bureaucracy?</p>

The requirement that they should be issued only by those who have adopted a Hampton culture, where prosecution and punishment are a last resort, is therefore an essential safeguard. This is even more important for the hundreds of local authorities who cannot be monitored effectively by central government. This Hampton approach is supposed to be embodied in the code of practice and the principles set out in Clause 5(2). I beg to move.</p>

I believe that we have managed to get to 11 minutes past seven without using that term, which is quite extraordinary. This would mean another stage in the control. Each local authority will have guidance in any event. This would be an additional stage which would probably be too much for the local authority in practical terms and perhaps too much for the LBRO as well; it would certainly add to costs. So, reluctantly, I part company with the noble Lord on this one.</p>

This would be extremely burdensome and would hamper the LBRO&#146;s ability to effectively carry out its core functions and deliver its objective. While the Government will look to the LBRO for advice on whether local authorities are generally compliant with the principles of better regulation, it would be inappropriate for the LBRO to certify each authority individually. It is more appropriate that the Secretary of State is satisfied that a regulator&#151;either national or local&#151;is acting, or capable of acting, in a way that conforms with the principles of good regulation before awarding the sanctioning power. That is why we will, in due course, move government Amendment No. 164 which will do precisely what the noble Lord is looking for:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012141000242">&#147;The relevant authority may not make any provision under or by virtue of this Part conferring power on a regulator&#148;&#151;</p>

<ul><a name="08012141000252">&#147;unless the authority is satisfied that the regulator will act in accordance with the principles referred to in section 5(2) in exercising that power&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012141000215">It has always been the Government&#146;s intention that only those regulators who are capable of acting in a way that is compliant with the principles of better regulation should have access to the new sanctions.  In due course, Amendment No. 164 will achieve  that.</p>

<p><a name="08012141000166">I do not want to enter the argument now, but we do not believe that the fixed monetary penalty will be like parking fines.

<p><a name="08012141000171">The noble Lord said: I shall engage in a little off-piste skiing on this amendment, but I would like to draw the Government&#146;s attention to some important issues which I would like them to find a way to address. I am encouraged to do so because the Minister has earlier, in talking about the purposes of the Bill, talked about avoiding powers being used in a conflicting way and about consistency, and he has just told us a little bit about regulatory stability.</p>

The Register of Members&#146; Interests will show that I am a director of a brewery and pub operator. We have 2,500 pubs around the country. The idea that we can achieve regulatory consistency with the licensing laws is a joke. The different police forces enforce in different ways. Different approaches are taken within different towns. We have just had a case where two young women came into a pub. One, clearly above the drinking age, orders two drinks and asks her colleague to pay. The colleague pays, whereupon the woman at the front says &#147;I am a police officer and that is an under-age person who has just paid for the drinks&#148;. This sort of activity is going on quite widely, and if we are going to have better regulation&#151;this is not about encouraging binge drinking, I am all for stopping binge drinking&#151;we have to find a way that firms, businesses and individuals who are affected by the activities of local police forces are able to find a way to talk to the Local Better Regulation Office about how their interests might be protected.</p>

<p><a name="08012141000174">I shall give three more, very quick, examples. I have an association with a chain of children&#146;s clothing shops, one of which is in Kensington High Street. It is told not to report shoplifting because, as a friendly sergeant said, &#147;We don&#146;t want to record a case because we probably can&#146;t clear it up, and then our clear-up rate diminishes and we are not hitting targets&#148;. If we are going to find a way to have better regulation, the shopkeeper, who has health and safety, the minimum wage and all the other things&#151;and quite right too&#151;is entitled to make sure that regulation of another sort that could benefit him is being fairly and proportionately applied. If one talks to smaller firms across the country, one of the things they raise is fly-tipping. They can find the person who is doing the fly-tipping, and they will be responsible under the environmental requirements of Clause 4(3)(e), but will the police enforce something when the person is found? There are businesses that face incursion by Travellers, who break down fences, enter premises and set up camps, but can they get the police to remove them?</p>

<p><a name="08012141000175">I understand that the Bill is about better regulation and local authorities, but there is a large tranche of activity where police forces are not acting in a way that in any way approaches the Hampton principles. They are looking for easy hits and fail to respond to the genuine requirements of individual firms, individuals and businesses large and small. While I do not doubt for a moment that the Minister is going to tell me that this amendment is out of order here, the Government have to think of a way whereby people can have more confidence and a more realistic expectation that the sorts of issues that I have raised&#151;I have raised only four to try to illuminate the point I am making&#151;can properly be addressed in the cause of better regulation. I beg to move.</p>

It gives me an opportunity to comment on the range of work undertaken by local authority regulatory services. Their work to protect the public under many different headings often involves direct co-operation with the police; for instance, where trading standards officers tackle major organised scams or licensing officers work to tackle the implications of under-age sales for community safety.</p>

It would require a complete review of many other aspects of the legislation, not least the LBRO&#146;s objective, which the noble Lord has been trying to widen during the course of our proceedings this afternoon. We do not think his amendment is the answer, but I reassure him, if I can, that this evening he has proved the relevance of the connection between police work and regulatory work by local authorities.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0008.htm_para0">
<p><a name="08012141000184">My amendment is about resources. It adds the issue of priority in the allocation of resources to the guidance section and deletes the rather more heavy-handed, as I read them, provisions in Clause 11. Every Bill tends to assume that there are unlimited resources for its own subject matter, but we are talking about a cake where the slice for a particular subject may not be enough to do all that everyone wants. If the LBRO is to have the influence that we have been assuming and welcoming, it should face up to the fact that the slice of cake may not be adequate and advise local authorities on how they should prioritise the resources that are available. Clause 11 provides for enforcement priorities, including resources. It is a rather heavier hand. The Minister may be able to explain the relationship between Clauses 6 and 11 and say whether one has more effect than the other. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08012141000185"><b><a name="80121-gc0008.htm_spnew0"><a name="08012141000340">Viscount Eccles:</b> This may be a convenient moment to support the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, in her approach to Clause 11 and to speak to my Amendments Nos. 40A to 40D and 42A. I entirely agree with the description &#147;heavy handed&#148;. That is the problem with this clause. The noble Baroness would deal with that if she proposed an amendment to strike the clause out. My proposal is to amend the clause. The principle behind the amendment seems to be that the emphasis throughout the Bill should be on advice and not on instructing or second-guessing local authorities; still less on encouraging them into box-ticking lists.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0008.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08012141000186">My amendments have two objectives. One is to bring the LBRO and local authorities together in their pursuit of effective ways of achieving better regulation. They should not be in opposition to each other. Each local authority will have its own approach to an experience of regulatory activities, and in that regard I feel rather short of evidence of all this inconsistency, slack behaviour and lack of regard to all the work that has been done to achieve better regulation to date. Each local authority will have been, or can be, persuaded to set priorities. How else can a local authority control its expenditure&#151;another point made by the noble Baroness?</p>

<a name="80121-gc0008.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08012141000187">The second objective is that if the dialogue between the LBRO and local authorities becomes and remains friendly and positive, both pursuing the same

If the Secretary of State is not involved, that enhances the independence of the LBRO, which is quite threatened throughout the Bill by the described relationships between the Secretary of State and the LBRO, which are pretty directional. Hence my amendment would leave out Clause 6(5) to (8) inclusive, thus removing the Secretary of State from the scene.</p>

<p><a name="08012141000188"><b><a name="80121-gc0008.htm_spnew1"><a name="08012141000341">Lord Bach:</b> Local authorities have repeatedly requested that the Government clarify their priorities for local authority regulatory enforcement. In March 2007, Mr Peter Rogers, chief executive of Westminster Council, carried out the first cross-cutting review of national regulatory priorities. The Government accepted the Rogers recommendations, and for the first time local authorities have been presented with a clear, evidence-based account of the issues which the Government believe should be prioritised in their work.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0008.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08012141000189">Clause 11 makes provision for the LBRO to carry this valuable work forward, and I emphasise that this has been strongly supported by both business and local authorities. The provisions in the clause will not prevent councils from giving due regard to their own priorities; nor will they reduce the regulatory standards that businesses need to meet. The clause will guarantee that central government continues to give a clear message to local authorities about their priorities. As I say, local authorities seem to welcome that.</p>

<a name="80121-gc0008.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08012141000190">Removing Clause 11 and replacing it with the provisions in Amendment No. 29 would remove the detailed provisions on the LBRO&#146;s function of preparing and publishing a list of national regulatory priorities. Significantly, the amendments would remove the obligation placed on the LBRO to prepare and publish a list of national regulatory priorities. In short, under Clause 11, the LBRO must prepare and publish a list of regulatory priorities, but under Amendment No. 29, the LBRO may issue guidance on local authority priorities in allocating resources. Given the importance of the Government issuing clear messages to local authorities and the strong support expressed for the LBRO preparing and publishing a list of regulatory priorities, our view is that the LBRO should be obliged to play this role. Clause 11, which obliges it to play that role, is therefore appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="08012141000191">Amendments Nos. 40A to 40D and Amendment No. 42A, all in the name of the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, would remove the key safeguard from Clause 11. In particular, these amendments would allow the LBRO to publish a list of regulatory priorities without first receiving the consent of the Secretary of State. I know why the noble Viscount is concerned about that, but in this instance that may be mistaken. We think that the consent of the Secretary of State is a safeguard here and that it is appropriate for him or her to be ultimately responsible for the content of any list published by the LBRO, because the Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament. These amendments would also remove the obligation placed on the LBRO to review a list of priorities on its own initiative and when requested to do so by the Secretary of State. It is vital that any list

<a name="80121-gc0008.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08012141000192">Amendment No. 41 has not been moved. I have been through the amendments in this group as best I can. It is for the reasons I have stated that we think that the noble Baroness is wrong. She makes an interesting point, but Clause 11 is of significance and is widely supported.</p>

I am grateful to him for his support. I forgot to say in my opening remarks that I have put a tick against a number of his amendments in this group, which is my code for saying that I agree with them. The Minister says that local authorities want central government to be clearer about their priorities. It does not seem to me that it needs to have Clause 11 to do that, because Clause 11 amounts very closely to the Secretary of State setting priorities, which is the heavy hand to which I refer.</p>

This will have increased the costs of generating electricity from fossil fuels&#151;oil, gas or coal. Therefore, in relative terms, nuclear&#146;s cost-effectiveness will have improved. In the cost-benefit analysis of nuclear generation we published a table showing the economic welfare balance under different gas and carbon prices and nuclear costs, which included all waste and decommissioning costs.

In it, he specifically commented that the expert witness's statements were clearly expressed in terms that suggested that he did have appropriate expertise in UK racing rules and practices and that, in 13 out of the 27 suspect races (which formed the basis of the prosecution's case), he had concluded that there was a prima facie case that the jockey in question was in breach of the relevant UK racing rule. The judge further commented that, when giving his evidence in chief, the expert witness said nothing to call into question his expertise in UK racing, either by reference to the rules or the practices of UK racing, and that &#147;remarkably, it was only as a result of and during (the expert's) cross-examination that the very

In particular, the judge said that some of the witness's responses during cross-examination were tantamount to the witness disqualifying himself from giving expert evidence in relation to the suspect races. The judge, therefore, concluded that the probative value of the expert's evidence, following extensive cross-examination, was so limited that very little, if any, weight or value could be attached to it. The judge found that in these circumstances he had to direct the jury to acquit the defendants.</p>
