<a name="40119-01_head0"></a><H3><center>Zimbabwe: British Food Aid</center></H3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Watson of Richmond </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What arrangements exist for the distribution of British food aid in Zimbabwe now that the country has withdrawn from the Commonwealth.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </B>  My Lords, Zimbabwe's withdrawal from the Commonwealth has had no effect on the levels of humanitarian funding or the way in which British food aid is distributed. The UK Government remain committed to supporting the people of Zimbabwe, who are suffering as a result of their government's disastrous policies, erratic rainfall and HIV/AIDS. DfID continues to work in close collaboration with the UN World Food Programme and NGOs to ensure that food distribution is carried out in an apolitical manner and targets those in most need.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Watson of Richmond: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for that reply and for her clarification. Does the Minister not agree, however, that there is a real danger that Zimbabwe out of the Commonwealth can also be Zimbabwe out of the public eye? Given the complete apparent failure of all attempts to persuade Mr Mugabe to follow another course, including the so-called "too little, too late" sanction on his financial assets held abroad, has not the time now come for the international community in the Commonwealth and beyond to consider new and tougher measures with regard to Zimbabwe, if that country is to avoid ruin and the world is to avoid the danger that Zimbabwe seriously begins to destabilise South Africa itself?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I totally agree with the noble Lord, Lord Watson of Richmond, and in particular the view that Zimbabwe out of the Commonwealth could mean Zimbabwe out of the public eye. We have a responsibility in the international community to ensure that that does not happen. Noble Lords have pressed the Government several times with respect to the issue of a UN resolution, and we have taken soundings on that. The temperature is not right for it at this point in time, but I agree with the noble Lord that the international community really has to continue to put pressure on Zimbabwe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Acton: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that the current appeal for vulnerable Zimbabweans by the UN World Food Programme has fallen short by 40 million dollars? Is she aware that, as a result, in this month the World Food Programme can feed a totally inadequate diet to only 3.2 million people and cannot feed a further 300,000 people at all? Britain has been very generous in this matter, but can the Government try to find some more money? Can they encourage Germany, Japan and other countries to do the same thing?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is quite  right. The WFP appeal for Zimbabwe is currently 80 per cent funded, with a shortfall of some 39 million dollars. However, I have to tell my noble friend that we are hopeful that the shortfall will be reached, in the sense that we expect an announcement from the European Commission shortly. We are continuing to monitor the situation and, if it continues to deteriorate, I assure my noble friend that we shall look again at our own contribution.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew4"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Southwark: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the local churches in Zimbabwe were disturbed at the directive last year that gave local councillors a leading role in deciding who would get food aid? Does she know whether the subsequent understanding negotiated with the Zimbabwean government, which precludes such political interference, has been honoured?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, my understanding is that that memorandum of understanding between the World Food Programme and the Government of Zimbabwe has been honoured. There have been one or two minor incidents that have been dealt with promptly, but the kind of political interference that the Government of Zimbabwe tried to introduce into the system has not occurred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Billingham: </B>   My Lords, will the Government give particular support to the women of Zimbabwe on 14 February, St Valentine's Day, when they take to the streets to protest at the situation in which their families find themselves? On that particular day, very vocal and high-profile government support would be enormously helpful and supportive to them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is quite right. The women of Zimbabwe are under particular pressure. We all know how difficult it is to see families and children go hungry. We shall continue to do all we can with respect to the humanitarian situation. Of course, we are one of the only countries that continues to give support with respect to HIV/AIDS problems in Zimbabwe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Laing of Dunphail: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness accept that Mr Mugabe, considering the destruction that he has caused in that great country, could be embraced by the title of a "weapon of mass destruction"?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, we have all agreed that Mr Mugabe's policies have been disastrous for Zimbabwe and for the people of Zimbabwe. I am not sure that I entirely agree with the way in which the noble Lord has phrased his question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   My Lords, has the Minister read the reports about the collapse of the currency in Zimbabwe and the difficulty of paying local aid workers there? Could she elaborate on what is happening to ensure that aid workers who are trying to get food aid into the country are being paid and that the food is, therefore, getting through to the people?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, is quite right. Inflation is rife and this is one of the reasons behind the increase in the number of Zimbabweans who require additional food support. People can no longer afford to buy food in the shops. With respect to the impact on the pay of aid workers, I was not aware that this is a particular problem. I shall take this information away and write to the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   My Lords, the House will be grateful to my noble friend Lady Amos for confirming that the situation is kept under constant review. Is she aware&#151;I am sure that she is&#151;of the reports over the weekend of grave food shortages in South Africa itself? A drought is affecting the whole of the region and we must not allow distaste for the Mugabe regime to deflect us from making sure that the aid programme is carried out to the fullest extent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is quite right. This is an issue that affects southern Africa as a whole, although Zimbabwe has suffered disproportionately because of disastrous economic policies. We are keeping the situation across the whole of southern Africa under review.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Chalfont </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether strategic communications networks functioned satisfactorily during the Iraq war.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Bach): </B>  My Lords, overall our communications equipment worked well in Operation TELIC, as outlined in the recent National Audit Office report. The Bowman personal role radio was a great success. However, the rigorous lessons process conducted by my department has identified that the very high level of information exchange requirements between the United Kingdom and the Gulf, coupled with the very dynamic operational situation, meant that there were occasions on which <P>


<a name="column_836"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 836</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the maintenance of strategic communications links proved challenging. However, these difficulties did not significantly affect the overall outcome of operations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Chalfont: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. Does he not agree that if the strategic tasks set out in Essay 2 of the last Defence White Paper are to be discharged, effective&#151;indeed, perfect&#151;strategic communications are essential? Can he now give an answer to the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Clark of Windermere, in the recent defence debate? Will there be someone in the Ministry of Defence who is specifically charged with ownership&#151;that is to say, responsibility&#151;for communications between home and expeditionary forces?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, about the importance of strategic communications in a conflict such as this. It is important to realise what the NAO said, which was that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the majority of communications equipment worked well on the operation, although the force sometimes had difficulty maintaining strategic communications between United Kingdom and units in theatre".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-01_para0"></a>
There was a difference between the Gulf conflict of 1991 and last year's conflict. The total information exchange requirement was increased by a factor of at least eight. It is not surprising that things did not go perfectly, but I repeat that, on balance, they went entirely satisfactorily and I can confirm that there will be a position in the Permanent Joint Headquarters that will be responsible for dealing with the issue of strategic communications.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, the Minister has said that the Bowman personal radio worked well. When are the Bowman's other functions going to come on line?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, the personal role radio worked extraordinarily well. That, as the noble Lord knows, is for platoon level. It was a huge success; so much so that our American allies bought a large number for their own soldiers' use. The noble Lord refers to the Bowman tactical secure voice and data system and I am happy to say that, as I speak, the in-service date of 31 March this year will be met.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, although the NAO report is favourable, can the Minister say whether this is due mainly to the terrain in Iraq, which is extremely favourable to radio communications? If we were in an area such as the Balkans the Clansman would not have performed as well. What is being done to improve the range of the Clansman?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I am not in a position to talk about terrain. I do not have the noble Lord's intimate knowledge of the difference of terrain between Bosnia and Iraq. All I can say is that communications worked well.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Vivian: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister explain why there was no training and initially no cryptographic equipment accompanying the OSCA strategic communications system? What problems were encountered in fitting the strategic communications systems into the current communications structures?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, as I understand it, there was training. A considerable amount of training was put into effect before the OSCA system began to be operated. Prior to deployment, personnel received training on all elements of OSCA, which as the noble Lord knows, is the operational and strategic communications architecture, which covered the strategic communications in this case. The training was conducted by a mixture of civilian and military courses and was supplemented by having subject matter experts available in theatre. As the noble Lord knows, we had some experience of using similar equipment in other theatres such as Bosnia and Afghanistan.
<P>

<a name="40119-02_para0"></a>On the second part of the noble Lord's question, we are planning to introduce the Cormorant system from May 2004, which will provide, crucially, an in-theatre command and control information infrastructure, thus avoiding the need for what is described as hubbing in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, the Minister has emphasised the importance of strategic communications. Can he tell us the extent to which those communications are dependent on satellites that are neither owned nor controlled by the British Government? To what extent does that influence our strategic policy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, we do of course rely on satellite communications, and we have for many years. The satellite communications that we relied on in this case worked well, and their strategic links were enhanced by using a combination of military and commercial resources. We are content that we have as much control over these satellites as we require for military purposes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said that strategic communications were multiplied by eight times compared with those for the previous Gulf War. Surely the one thing that commanders want is not people from Downing Street or the Ministry of Defence chattering up the lines; they want to get on with it. What possible use can there be in increasing communications eight times, except possibly looking for body armour?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that it was people chattering from Downing Street or wherever else the noble Earl said; I think it was commanders on the ground and commanders at headquarters in theatre wanting to talk to and exchange information with those who commanded the Armed Forces in this country. The reason why there is so much more communication now than before is that it is now so <P>


<a name="column_838"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 838</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>much easier. It is critically important, as I hope the noble Earl will agree, that at a time of expeditionary warfare, many thousands of miles away from the United Kingdom, we should be able to use all modern technology to enable commanders to talk to commanders.

<A NAME="40119-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Dubs </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  My Lords, I refer my noble friend to the reply which I gave to the noble Lord, Lord Burlison, on 18 December:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Committee has used the provisions"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-02_para1"></a>
within the Act&#151;

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-02_para2"></a>
While we are considering the report's recommendations carefully, we believe that the Part 4 powers are a necessary and proportionate response to the current threat.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, the whole House will of course welcome the Government's tough stance against terrorism. However, does my noble friend accept that detaining people indefinitely without charge is a denial of many of this country's most important traditions? Will the Government consider as a matter of urgency dropping the ban on the use of intercepted communications material in courts, as has been done in the United States, as the best way forward in dealing with this aspect of a very difficult problem?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I say straightaway to my noble friend that we have never at any stage suggested that the situation in which we find ourselves is ideal; it is not. However, by using this legislation we have tried to behave in a proportionate and appropriate way so as to ensure that the interests of the people of this country are put first. I hear what my noble friend says about intercepted information and the best way of dealing with that. Noble Lords will know that we are considering the response to the committee's report. We shall in due course take these matters into consideration also.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew12"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </B>   My Lords, while appreciating the way in which the Minister has replied <P>


<a name="column_839"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 839</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to the noble Lord's Question, I am struck by the fact that the Question is not just about procedure; it does indeed concern human rights. Is the Minister able to give reassurances that any legislation on detaining foreign nationals will be matched against that wider arena of human rights? Will she also reassure us that that valuable, even golden quality of restraint will figure in the way in which this government policy is worked out?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I am certainly more than happy to reassure the right reverend Prelate on that golden quality of restraint, and I hope that noble Lords will have seen clear evidence of it in the way in which we have approached the SIAC proposals. The monitoring of that procedure has been absolutely rigorous, and we shall continue to ensure that that is right. Noble Lords will know that consideration has been given also to whether any of the foreign nationals can be sent back to their own country, because we consider the issues in relation also to Article 3 and so on. All those matters are extremely complex and difficult. The Government will continue to be proportionate and appropriate in the way that we respond to them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   My Lords, in declaring an interest as a member of the review committee, I wonder whether the noble Baroness is aware that the Government&#151;in the shape of her right honourable friend the Home Secretary&#151;attacked the committee's conclusions almost simultaneously with its publication in respect of Part 4, which is the subject of the Question from the noble Lord, Lord Dubs. Does the Minister agree that as well as fixing an early debate in the House to discuss the committee's conclusions, a preceding period of quiet consideration by the Government might be appropriate?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, of course I hear what the noble Lord says in relation to attacks on the committee. However, my right honourable friend's comments should not be thus interpreted. My right honourable friend was quite clear. He complimented the committee for its sterling work. He made it clear that we are going to consider all the recommendations. However, it was only right and proper that we should indicate in relation to Part 4 that the reasons that caused us to create this legislation, regrettably and somewhat tragically, still pertain. The security of this country and its citizens will always remain at the forefront of the Government's consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that I worked at Bletchley Park during the war? One of the good things about Bletchley is that we never cackled. I hope that she will bear that in mind before adopting the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Dubs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I can certainly assure the noble Baroness that we will be as careful as she would wish.

<A NAME="40119-03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I, too, declare an interest as a member of the committee. Does my noble <P>


<a name="column_840"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 840</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>friend agree that, in relation to her previous remark, nothing in the committee's report suggested that security should be downgraded in any way whatever? However, there were recommendations about whether Part 4 was the appropriate way in which to safeguard the security of this country. I should be grateful for her confirmation of that. Equally, perhaps she could clarify something that she said in her reply regarding the Section 123 provisions which many noble Lords will remember. I think she suggested that the committee said that we would want the other provisions of the Act&#151;many of which have nothing to do with terrorism&#151;debated at the time of renewal. In fact the report specifies very clearly that it should be separate from that. Can she confirm that the Home Office recognises that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, first, I am very happy to confirm to my noble friend that the committee did not suggest that the security of this country should be jeopardised in any way. The committee made various comments about Part 4. I hope I made it clear that in his response my right honourable friend did not fail to take the committee's recommendations into consideration, but made it clear that, from the Government's point of view, the level of threat that pertained in the past had not decreased so as to make us confident that the changes which my noble friend suggests are appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40119-03_para0"></a>As for Section 123, I take on board what my noble friend says&#151;that the committee recommended that there should be two separate debates on those matters. Those matters are for the usual channels to determine, as I know she knows only too well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, is it not clear that risks of terrorism can arise both from citizens of this country as well as from foreign nationals? Does the Minister agree that both categories should be dealt with by due process of law, which is not the case at present?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I join issue with the noble Lord&#151;certainly both categories need to be determined appropriately. However, I hope that no one in your Lordships' House will forget that the whole reason why we have Part 4 of the ATCS Act is to provide an immigration power that allows the Home Secretary to detain a foreign national whom he reasonably believes to be suspected as an international terrorist, whose presence in the United Kingdom is a risk to national security, but who cannot currently be removed from the United Kingdom. Those individuals fall into a very specific category, and that is our difficulty.
<P>

<a name="40119-03_para1"></a>As for ensuring that those individuals have access to legal representation, I hope that noble Lords will accept that they have very generous access to legal representation and can make proper challenges to their detention, as they have in fact done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I can ask the Minister and indeed the Home Secretary to reread the committee's report and the debate on the Bill's Third <P>


<a name="column_841"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 841</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Reading in this House. They will see that there were considerable misgivings in the House about letting through Part 4. It was passed only because of assurances that such a committee would conduct such a review. In the light of that, does she not think that the Government should give proper consideration to these recommendations and realise that, as when the Bill was passed, there are very real concerns that, in the war against terrorism, we may indeed be losing the liberties that we are supposed to be defending?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, we have taken those matters into consideration. Each and every recommendation of the committee's review will be considered, so noble Lords can rest assured on that matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  My Lords, in January 2003, over 99 per cent of head teacher and deputy head teacher posts in maintained schools in England were filled. The vacancy rates for both heads and deputies were lower than at any time since the Government came to power. Through the work of the National College for School Leadership, professional headship training is now being offered to more serving and prospective school leaders than ever before.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Perry of Southwark: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for that reply, but is there not something seriously wrong when Education Data Surveys has just reported that 40 per cent of all headships in the south-east had to be re-advertised&#151;they were advertised at least twice and some of them more often&#151;and that in the country as a whole 30 per cent of all primary headships and 25 per cent of all secondary headships had to be re-advertised? Do not the Government recognise that their own policies of interfering in the day-to-day management of schools, the heavy bureaucratic burden that they have placed on schools with regulations as well as a punitive regime of naming and shaming have meant that good and creative people are no longer willing to come forward for the job?

<P>

<A NAME="40119-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, not surprisingly, I do not agree with the noble Baroness's final statements regarding the role of government. It is very important that we see our relationship with schools as a partnership working together to ensure that our children get the best possible education. I have <P>


<a name="column_842"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 842</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>said many times in your Lordships' House that I make no apology for wanting that outcome. It is very important in so doing to recognise schools that need additional help. As the noble Baroness will know from the report, there is a reduction in the re-advertisement ratio for deputy heads and, indeed, for primary heads. There are issues concerning secondary heads and specialist schools in particular which we have noted and will be looking at.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dearing: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether the Minister is aware that while the new framework of inspections by Ofsted is widely welcomed, there are concerns that the interpretation of the new framework has led a minority of inspection teams to concentrate on weaknesses to the detriment of producing a balanced assessment of a school, and that that can damage education. Will she confirm that possibility with the Chief Inspector and the adequacy of the means of appeal against an inspection report?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, we are aware of the issues that have been raised in the Times Educational Supplement and elsewhere. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector and my honourable friend David Miliband are looking at that. Some noble Lords may have picked up that Mr Miliband said on 8 January that we are looking to a new system of better focused inspections which will be introduced from this year. That will shift the emphasis towards self-evaluation&#151;something that I believe the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, would welcome, as, indeed, would other noble Lords. Detailed proposals on that will be published by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector next month.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister happy regarding the qualifications of teachers who teach modern languages, physics and mathematics? I gather from statistics that many do not have qualifications in those subjects. Is the Minister happy that such teachers should teach those complicated subjects without having qualifications in them?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Pilkington, will appreciate that his question is slightly wide of the Question on the Order Paper. However, as he indicated, it is very important to ensure that our children get the best possible teaching. That is, indeed, why we have introduced a series of measures to support those students who may go on to teach what we describe as shortage subjects. I am sure that the noble Lord will support us in doing that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister confident that the new national professional qualification for head teachers that has recently been introduced is on the right lines? I believe that its reception has been somewhat mixed and that some head teachers are rather unhappy about it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I cannot confirm what the noble Baroness said about teachers <P>


<a name="column_843"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 843</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>being unhappy about the qualification. However, I am sure that in considering the qualification we are very mindful of the feedback that we get. Some 11,300 teachers have completed the qualification and 6,600 are currently undertaking it. I believe that that in itself speaks volumes about those teachers who recognise its value and importance. It constitutes a critical opportunity to ensure that we have good leadership. Were I to discover that the kind of remarks the noble Baroness mentioned were reported in the feedback, I should, of course, ensure that we acted upon them.

<A NAME="40119-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, to what extent, if at all, do arrangements exist for the enhancement of salaries payable for headship posts in deprived areas, which should take account of the extra work and responsibility involved? Is not that a very important principle to affirm and one which might well lead to more suitably qualified applicants coming forward?

<P>
<A NAME="40119-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, it is very important to ensure that we incentivise people to be head teachers. As regards areas, it is perhaps worth saying that the average secondary head teacher's pay in inner London is £61,013.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-04_spnew1"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that many issues lie behind the appointment of head teachers and include such questions as the price of houses, particularly in the south-east? Recently, a Church school head was appointed who is a Muslim. Many of us who are concerned about the appointment of good head teachers look for many wider qualities of spiritual strength. Will the Minister give us some encouragement in that regard?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, as regards the recruitment and retention of head teachers it is important to look at all the possibilities in terms of support. Home loans for teachers are a critical part of that, particularly in our inner cities.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 3, line 29, leave out "follows" and insert "set out in subsections (2) to (5)"
<P>

<a name="40119-04_para9"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: I wish to speak to Amendments Nos. 35 and 41 standing in the name of my noble friend the Lord President of the Council and to Amendment No. 40 in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Maginnis and Lord Rogan. These amendments all deal with retrospective investigations by the Police Ombudsman and it seems right to deal with them together.
<P>

<a name="40119-04_para10"></a>I start by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Laird, who at Second Reading alerted us that this clause was out of keeping with the Government's policy in relation to time limits on investigations by the Police Ombudsman. Amendments Nos. 35 and 41 seek to ensure that referrals under the new clause will be treated consistently with any referrals to which the RUC (Complaints etc.) Regulations 2001 currently apply.

<P>

<a name="40119-04_para11"></a>Subject to the exceptions contained in those regulations, they limit the ombudsman to investigating complaints about matters that are no more than 12 months old. The proposed amendments allow the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to make similar regulations in respect of proposed new subsection (4A) of Section 55 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, which will be inserted by Clause 6 of this Bill.
<P>

<a name="40119-04_para12"></a>Similarly, Amendment No. 40, tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Maginnis and Lord Rogan, is intended to prevent retrospective investigations. I thank them for raising that important issue in Committee, but I hope that they will be satisfied that the Government amendments deal with the substance of the issue. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hylton </B>   moved Amendment No. 36:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 3, line 33, leave out "shall" and insert "may"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-04_para14"></a><P>

<a name="40119-04_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment concerns the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions, whose duty is to see that those who should be prosecuted are brought promptly to court where evidence exists to justify a prosecution. I want prosecutions of police officers, as well as others, to go ahead whenever there is sufficient evidence. If that is the case, I do not want prosecutions to be postponed to allow the police ombudsman to investigate. The noble Baroness the Leader of the House said at Second Reading:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The DPP has no power to conduct investigations".&#151;[Official Report, 16/12/03; col. 1118.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-04_para16"></a>
He does, however, have power to bring prosecutions and should not be prevented using that power promptly. If the Attorney-General can assure me that fully justified prosecutions will not be held up as a result of the Bill, I will happily withdraw the amendment. Of course, I do not object to cases that fall into grey areas, especially those justifying only disciplinary proceedings, being looked into by the ombudsman. I want clear cut cases, backed by evidence, to be prosecuted promptly. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I have some sympathy with the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. As I understand it, if the clause stands unamended it will, according to the Explanatory Notes:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"place a duty on the director to refer matters to the ombudsman and Clause 6 makes the necessary amendments to ensure that the recommendation is fully implemented in line with the undertaking of the Government in the Joint Declaration".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-04_para17"></a>
I am not fussed about that. What concerns me is that the amendment would retain the current discretion for the DPP, rather than having the requirement, as the Bill proposes, for the DPP to refer to the ombudsman any matter in which it appears to him,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that a police officer may have committed a criminal offence or, in the course of a criminal investigation"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-04_para18"></a>
"may",
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"have behaved in a manner which would justify disciplinary proceedings".

<a name="column_846"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 846</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Removing the discretion of the DPP is taking a step too far in the judicial process. Consecutive DPPs have served the Province and the public extraordinarily well and I am sure that they will continue to do so. We will now have a prosecution "department". That will strengthen the hand of the DPP and will increase the clarity and the transparency of the operation of the DPP. Therefore, I am inclined to support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   I shall speak to Amendment No. 37, which is a probing amendment, to ensure that the language is correct in implementing the intention of the updated implementation plan. Clause 6(3), on the duty of the DPP to refer matters of police malpractice to the ombudsman, also falls short of the review and of the promise in the updated plan. The wording confers an excessive degree of discretion on the director to decide whether a matter is one which must be referred to the ombudsman. That degree of subjectivity in assessment could make it difficult for a judicial review of the director. Will the Attorney-General elucidate on that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   I, too, have more than a degree of sympathy for Amendment No. 36, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. If it were pressed to a vote, I would find it impossible not to support the protection of the DPP.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   All the amendments in the group deal with the Director of Public Prosecutions making referrals to the police ombudsman. Amendment No. 36, table by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, would increase the level of discretion on the part of the DPP. I am grateful to him for his explanation of what lies behind the amendment. He does not want any proper prosecution to be delayed while an investigation by the ombudsman takes place and he seeks my assurance that that is not our intention. I am happy to give that assurance that, where a proper prosecution ought to be pursued in the view of the DPP, then it will be pursued. That must be the priority and I hope that my explanation and assurance will satisfy him.
<P>

<a name="40119-04_para20"></a>Responding to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, the decision to table the clause does not reflect in any way on the professionalism of the DPP. I agree wholeheartedly with the noble Lord that the director and, particularly, his predecessor and others have served with distinction, absolute professionalism and objectivity. As I work closely with the director, I know that to be true. I am happy to endorse fully his independence and impartiality, in which I have full confidence. The simple reason for the clause is that it is more appropriate for the police ombudsman to make decisions regarding police conduct, as is the case when matters are raised by the general public. Questions of prosecution will be for the director to decide, as they should be. Questions of disciplinary investigations would be left to the discretion of the police ombudsman. That would be more appropriate and more closely reflect recommendation 21 of the Criminal Justice Review.

<a name="40119-04_para21"></a>I note that the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, has spoken, but not particularly to advance Amendments Nos. 38 and 39, which go in rather the opposite direction. I see that he wishes to intervene and I am happy that he should do so.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040119/text/40119-05.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   Perhaps I have misunderstood procedure. I was going to speak on those two amendments later. Should I have done so earlier?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   Yes, they are grouped together. I am happy for him to speak to them now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   That is extremely kind. Indeed, I wish to speak to Amendments Nos. 38 and 39. Amendment No. 38 replaces "may have" with "has". It is a different approach to restoring the input in terms of the discretion of the DPP. First, if the DPP is going to direct a prosecution there must be a degree of evidential sufficiency. All matters in which it is possible that an offence has been committed are not necessarily proceeded with. Similarly, with this procedure, there should be something more than a possibility before a referral.
<P>

<a name="40119-05_para0"></a>Secondly, the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions is to determine, first, whether an offence has been committed and then to apply tests such as interests of justice and evidential matters before instigating a prosecution. If it does not appear to the DPP that a criminal offence has been committed, why should the matter be referred to the ombudsman for consideration by virtue of new subsection (4A)(a)(i)?
<P>

<a name="40119-05_para1"></a>Amendment No. 39 removes the disciplinary criteria for referral for one simple reason. The duty of the DPP is to consider criminal offences and criminal matters and one would think that there must be an element of expertise. For example, in terms of knowledge of stop-and-search procedures, the DPP is not and should not need to be an expert on internal police disciplinary matters. It is not the duty of the DPP to be an expert on police disciplinary proceedings. What behaviour would merit such proceedings? This section of the Bill presupposes that he is. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for his observations.
<P>

<a name="40119-05_para2"></a>The effect of the two amendments would be that the DPP would refer cases to the police ombudsman only where a police officer had been convicted of a crime. It would exclude the alternative limb where in the course of a criminal investigation it appears to the director that an officer may have behaved in a manner which would justify disciplinary proceedings and would limit the power and duty to refer cases where it appeared to the director that the officer had committed a criminal offence and not just might have done so.
<P>

<a name="40119-05_para3"></a>If the amendments were accepted, that would move a long way from what the Criminal Justice Review envisaged. Recommendation 21 stated that a duty should be placed on the prosecutor to ensure that any <P>


<a name="column_848"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 848</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>allegations of police malpractice were fully investigated. Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 would very much constrain what the director would refer to the police ombudsman.
<P>

<a name="40119-05_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rogan, makes an important point in saying that the director is not necessarily an expert in what would constitute disciplinary conduct on the part of police. But the director is not required to reach a definitive conclusion on that. He is required to consider whether the conduct, when one looks at it, may mean that an officer has behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings. I know that the director will want to provide to his staff guidance with assistance from those who are more expert in what those matters would be, but experienced prosecutors who deal with police conduct in the course of investigating and considering prosecutions day in and day out form a view as to what may be conduct that justifies disciplinary action.
<P>

<a name="40119-05_para5"></a>Of course, the decision is in no way final and the whole point is that the matter is then referred to the ombudsman. The discretion will lie with him and the expertise will be with the ombudsman to decide whether the conduct merits disciplinary activity. The provision therefore delineates the respective roles of the DPP and the police ombudsman by ensuring that any decisions which might need to be taken about the conduct of the police are referred to the appropriate authority; that is, the police ombudsman.
<P>

<a name="40119-05_para6"></a>I hope that that provides a sufficient explanation of what lies behind the clause and the justification for it and that therefore the amendments will not be pressed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I have a comparatively small point to make. We are slightly at odds because I asked the noble and learned Lord whether we want to be in a situation in which every suspicious case is referred to the ombudsman by the DPP. I suggest that the DPP has other things to do in respect of criminal investigations and processing a potential prosecution, instead of looking over his shoulder at whether the policemen involved in the investigation have performed directly according to the rules and regulations. If it hits him in the face that they have clearly done something wrong, that is a good reason why the case should be referred to the ombudsman.
<P>

<a name="40119-05_para7"></a>I am concerned that if the Bill remains as drafted, there will evolve a way of life within the DPP's department where one is always looking to see whether the police have done something slightly wrong and whether one ought to be pushing everything on to the police ombudsman.
<P>

<a name="40119-05_para8"></a>I should have mentioned a small point in relation to Amendment No. 40 and perhaps the Committee will allow me to do so. I am afraid I was talking to my Chief Whip on a detail of timing. Amendment No. 40 relates to timing. It asks that only conduct which took place after the Act has achieved Royal Assent will be <P>


<a name="column_849"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 849</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>referred. Will the noble and learned Lord be good enough to comment on that? We do not want to go back in time in these situations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   Perhaps I, too, may comment on Amendment No. 40 which stands in my name. As printed, it states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No reference shall be made in subsection (4A) if the conduct giving rise to the intended referral took place after the coming into force of this section".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-05_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   We have dealt with the first group of amendments, but it is open to a noble Lord to speak to an amendment in its place on the Marshalled List. If we now go through the amendments in the second group, noble Lords can raise their points when we reach Amendment No. 40. I think that that would be helpful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Rogan, will be able to make his points on Amendment No. 40 in a few moments and I will defer my response to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, on that amendment.
<P>

<a name="40119-05_para10"></a>I see that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, wants to intervene, but perhaps I may deal with the first question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. He asked whether we want a situation in which every suspicious case is referred to the ombudsman. The burden on the DPP and his staff&#151;and I am grateful for consideration of them&#151;is the lesser under the drafting of the clause. No one has to make a decision about whether, in accordance with criteria that have been laid down, a case is the right kind or not. The only question is: is it one in which it appears that a criminal offence may have been committed? Is it one in which it appears in the course of a criminal investigation that the officer has behaved in a manner which would justify disciplinary proceedings?
<P>

<a name="40119-05_para11"></a>That threshold being established, all that needs to be done is to hand the papers, or whatever, to the ombudsman and the burden of considering whether it should be the subject of time and investigation falls to him. Therefore, this may be a more desirable approach in terms of burden on the DPP so that he and his staff can get on with the important job of prosecuting cases.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-05_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   It is the important job of the DPP to prosecute important cases and I suggest that it is his sole job. I am a little perturbed by the provision which gives an administrative, or quasi-executive, function to the DPP and in a case where there has not been a complaint. As I understand it, the jurisdiction of the ombudsman in Northern Ireland&#151;I may be inaccurate about this&#151;derives from a complaint of maladministration. If the DPP is or has been considering a matter of criminal prosecution but there has not been a complaint&#151;there is no shortage of people to make complaints about anything under the sun in Northern Ireland&#151;I need to be persuaded <P>


<a name="column_850"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 850</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that a duty should be imposed on him to refer such a matter to the ombudsman in case the ombudsman believes that something has gone wrong.
<P>

<a name="40119-05_para12"></a>The position of the DPP, as the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General knows so well, is a very delicate one. I entirely endorse the graceful comments that have been made about the holders of that office. It is important that they should not be given anything to extend the duty that they have to prosecute cases and to bring an entirely independent and judicial mind to bear on matters. I realise that it is Recommendation 21 of the Criminal Justice Review, but in itself that is not decisive. I should like to hear a little more about the Government's thinking on that matter before the issue is concluded.

<A NAME="40119-05_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   The experience of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, in the office that I am privileged enough to hold, and otherwise in Northern Ireland, gives him particular knowledge of how the DPP operates.
<P>

<a name="40119-05_para13"></a>It is right to record that we are not proposing for the first time that the Director of Public Prosecutions should refer matters to the police ombudsman. We have already taken that step because under Section 55 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, as amended by the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, the director is already empowered, along with the policing board and the Secretary of State, to refer certain matters to the police ombudsman. Perhaps I may put the point in this way: the proposition that it is wrong that the director should do anything outwith the business of prosecuting is a bridge that has already been crossed. Here we are concerned with whether, following Recommendation 21 to a large extent, although not precisely, he should be under a duty to refer matters that come to his attention.
<P>

<a name="40119-05_para14"></a>As I said in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, it seems to me that one advantage of phrasing the clause in this way is that it makes a clear distinction between the jobs. It does not leave the director in a position of having the job of deciding what the criteria are by which he should decide that something needs to be investigated; for example, for a disciplinary matter. It simply says that if he comes across something in the course of his primary work, he should refer it to the ombudsman for the ombudsman to take on the job of examining it and deciding whether there is anything further with which to deal.
<P>

<a name="40119-05_para15"></a>I hope that that explanation helps to show that the director will not be put in a position that is difficult for him&#151;I certainly would not want that&#151;that it does not cast doubt in any way on his independence or professionalism and essentially that it leaves him to get on with the principal job of prosecuting.

<FONT SIZE=3>now. If the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, seeks to speak to Amendment No. 40, he should do so when Amendment No. 40 is called. Although the amendment will not be moved, I am sure that the Committee will be indulgent enough to allow noble Lords to speak to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for his reply to me. I particularly appreciated his assurance that there will be no delays in prosecuting serious, solid cases when there is plenty of evidence. I believe that the noble and learned Lord went on to say that overall the discretion that now resides with the Director of Public Prosecutions will be preserved. If I am wrong, I am sure that he will correct me. If I am right, I ask the Committee to give me leave to withdraw Amendment No. 36.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   If I do not intervene, the noble Lord will have put me in the position of appearing to accept what he has said. When he talks of the discretion that remains with the director, I believe he means the discretion of the director whether to prosecute or not. I see the noble Lord nodding. If that is so, I can certainly give that assurance. That remains unchanged.

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"took place before the coming into force of this section".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-06_para4"></a>
I actually tabled the word "after". I apologise if that is my error.
<P>

<a name="40119-06_para5"></a>Clause 6 makes yet another structure within our society&#151;the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which should be independent and immune from interference&#151;subject to conditions that will be dictated by the police ombudsman and it interferes with the chief constable's right to set, modify and impose appropriate standards of discipline.
<P>

<a name="40119-06_para6"></a>There is a practical aspect to my amendment. Already we have seen the so-called Bloody Sunday inquiry moving at enormous cost towards a conclusion that I predict will satisfy no one in Northern Ireland. It has impinged on police resources. Now in the aftermath of the Corrie report we are bound for four more major inquiries.
<P>

<a name="40119-06_para7"></a>In terms of police resources, neither manpower, money nor time are geared to cope with those huge extra burdens which I predict will be fruitless and inconclusive exercises that will satisfy no one. How, then, can we seriously consider adding another police <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I am not sure that I follow or agree with the noble Lord, Lord Rogan. Perhaps I missed what he said in relation to what is printed as the amendment. As I understand it, the amendment states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No reference shall be made in subsection (4A) if the conduct giving rise to the intended referral took place after the coming into force of this section".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-06_para8"></a>
My notes say, "Only conduct that took place after the Act has received Royal Assent will be referred". I believe that is the same thing. I believe we are trying to say that if we pass Amendment No. 40 only conduct that took place after this Act has received Royal Assent will be referred to the ombudsman. May I have clarification on that point?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-06_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   The amendment of the noble Lords, Lord Maginnis and Lord Rogan, as it appears on the Marshalled List, states that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No reference shall be made in subsection (4A) if the conduct giving rise to the intended referral took place after the coming into force of this section".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-06_para9"></a>
I understand that to mean that only conduct that took place before the coming into force of the Act or this section could be the subject of a reference. Although the record may suggest that the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, expressed the wording the other way round, it may be that when he used the word "after" rather than "before", or "before" rather than "after", he meant the amendment to include the word "before".
<P>

<a name="40119-06_para10"></a>In those circumstances, the intention is as I understood it, which is what I said when I spoke to this amendment during debate on the first group of amendments&#151;that is, to prevent retrospective referrals, or referrals of things which happened previously. I see that the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, nods his head. I intervened in order to clarify the noble Lord's amendment, but I leave the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, to complete his remarks unless he has already done so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I thank the noble and learned Lord. I had completed them; I simply wanted clarification.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-06_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   The amendment concerns the issue of retrospection. As I said in moving government Amendment No. 35, we accept, and were grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Laird, for pointing out, the need to deal with the possibilities of full retrospection. The way in which we propose to do so&#151;indeed, it is the way that the Committee has accepted because we have now agreed to the amendment&#151;is through Amendments Nos. 35 and 41.
<P>

<a name="40119-06_para11"></a>Those amendments would provide the same approach to time and retrospection in this situation as any referrals to which the RUC (Complaints etc.) Regulations 2001 apply. I shall simply repeat what I said then: that is, subject to certain exceptions contained in them, the regulations limit the ombudsman to investigating complaints about <P>


<a name="column_853"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 853</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>matters that are no more than 12 months old. The amendments which the Government propose would allow the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to make similar regulations in respect of this new subsection.
<P>

<a name="40119-06_para12"></a>Therefore, the government amendments are also intended to deal with retrospection. They do not deal with it in the same way as the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, proposes. They provide for greater consistency with the RUC complaints regulations than does his amendment. However, perhaps I may respectfully point out that his amendment could not be passed in the form in which it presently stands as it would do the opposite to what he seeks.

<a name="40119-06_para15"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.
<P>

<a name="40119-06_para16"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 6, as amended, shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-06_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   I have been trying to outline the iniquity of this entire clause, which legislates for something that is unnecessary, unproductive and, I believe, unachievable. Perhaps I may give an example of a potential outcome regarding Clause 6 where subsection (3) inserts new subsection (4A)(a)(ii). A police officer investigates a crime and the result of the investigation is considered for prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The DPP somehow becomes aware that the investigation was delayed by a week when the officer concerned took sick leave but was, in fact, watching a football match in Europe.
<P>

<a name="40119-06_para17"></a>That matter would justify disciplinary proceedings and, I imagine, would be dealt with fairly severely through internal police procedures. But it does not affect the outcome of the investigation; nor does it impede the prosecution in any way. Therefore, why should the independent Director of Public Prosecutions be obliged to inform the ombudsman and thus precipitate a welter of work for other hard-pressed officers, whose primary responsibility is to serve the public?
<P>

<a name="40119-06_para18"></a>I hope that Members of the Committee realise that this provision can be retrospective and that that would place an even greater demand on police time and resources. The police have an obligation to meet every request made by the ombudsman.
<P>

<a name="40119-06_para19"></a>On Thursday last, my noble friend Lord Maginnis, as I have done today, sought not to allude to other political parties as villains of the piece. However, I suggest that Clause 6, the intent of which was rejected by the Minister, Des Browne, is designed by the Government merely to help the nationalists. Your Lordships will neither want to legislate for the unachievable nor allow anyone to impinge on the <P>


<a name="column_854"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 854</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>efficiency and independence of the offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the chief constable. That is why I oppose the clause.
<P>

<a name="40119-06_time0"></a><H5>3.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-06_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   As we discussed during debate on the preceding amendments, the purpose of the clause is to place a duty on the DPP to refer all cases of suspected police malpractice to the police ombudsman. I also indicated that the director is already empowered to do that under the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002.
<P>

<a name="40119-06_para20"></a>I make clear, first, that I very strongly support the independence and professionalism of the director and his staff. I have made that clear already and I shall make it clear in debate on subsequent clauses, too. As the superintending Minister for the director's work, I feel that very strongly. I recently had the great pleasure of being able to commend his work and that of his predecessor when talking about the steps that were being taken to develop the new Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland. I believe that it will be an independent, professional and efficient service which will serve the people of Northern Ireland extremely well.
<P>

<a name="40119-06_para21"></a>I make a second point clear. I do not consider it likely that, where the director has taken a decision about prosecution and where there has been a thorough and complete police investigation, the ombudsman will consider a new investigation to be necessary. Of course, as I indicated to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, previously, a decision to prosecute or not to prosecute remains a matter for the director.
<P>

<a name="40119-06_para22"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rogan, was concerned that the director's independence might somehow be affected by having to judge certain questions, and he gave an example of what might have been a disciplinary offence by an officer pretending that he was on sick leave when he was, in fact, watching a football match. However, the merit of the clause as it stands is that the director does not have to judge such questions; he simply has to form a view on whether or not it may mean that the officer has behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings. If he comes to such a decision, he passes the case to the ombudsman. Whatever difficult decisions may arise for the ombudsman in considering whether further disciplinary investigations should take place, those decisions are for the ombudsman and not for the director. Therefore, I hope that the assurances that I was able to give previously will satisfy noble Lords that opposition to the clause standing part of the Bill can be withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, makes a final decision on what to do about the clause, can the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General give us an assurance that, before we reach the Report stage, one or two small parts of the clause can be softened somewhat so that a little more discretion is allowed? I think of changing "shall" to "may" and other similar single-word changes. I hope that the noble and learned Lord may be able to encourage us <P>


<a name="column_855"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 855</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that, before Report stage, the Government will consider one or two small areas; for example, those such as in Amendment No. 38, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"line 35, leave out 'may have' and insert 'has'".

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40119-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   As noble Lords who take part in debates on this legislation know, the Ministers concerned with Northern Ireland business are always happy to meet noble Lords to discuss any aspects of the Bill and to give further assurance or explanation. Of course I am happy to do that, but I would not like to hold out hope that any changes are likely to be made to the clause. Essentially, the clause simply says that where we come across conduct in the director of this sort or that sort&#151;or which may be conduct of this sort or that sort&#151;one should send the matter to the ombudsman for him to exercise his statutory discretion on whether to pursue it.
<P>

<a name="40119-07_para0"></a>There is a discretion as to whether the matter should be pursued; but it is a better discretion for the ombudsman to operate than the director. It avoids the director being directly involved in questions of whether a matter is worthy of further consideration and helps to preserve his independence. That is as far as I am able to go, but I hope that the noble Lord finds at least my last remarks of some comfort.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I thank the Minister. I hate to inject an element of real Northern Ireland politics into this very cultured debate, but I suspect that in various parts of the police force there are those who might start to look on the DPP as a spy on them.
<P>

<a name="40119-07_para1"></a>Clause 6, as amended, agreed to.
<P>

<a name="40119-07_para2"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 7 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I have opposed the inclusion of Clause 7 in order to probe the Government on its purpose. According to the Explanatory Notes, Clause 7 creates an offence of seeking to influence prosecution decisions without legitimate cause. We are told that the measures were suggested in the Criminal Justice Review at recommendation 46.
<P>

<a name="40119-07_para3"></a>New Section 32A(1) and (2) make it clear that guilt depends on intention to pervert the course of justice. Thus it would appear that an offence would already be committed under common law. The Minister knows far more than I about these matters, but my advisers ask what is added by the Bill. Is it an offence for which the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland has been calling? What sort of examples have prompted it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I support the comments of my noble friend Lord Glentoran. Paragraph 19 of the Explanatory Notes states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Case law concerning the common law offence of perverting the course of public justice is likely to be of use in the interpretation of this new offence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-07_para4"></a>
That strikes me as a polite way of saying that the provision is not necessary, but it simply applies the existing law explicitly to this set of circumstances. If <P>


<a name="column_856"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 856</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that is the case, it seems superfluous to legislate in particular for this context. We should be trying to avoid unnecessary legislation. If I am wrong, I should be glad to hear why.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   I identify with the remarks of the two Members of the Committee who have spoken. I wait to hear the Minister's persuasive explanation. Subject to that, the public is growing a little dissatisfied and anxious about the plethora of new criminal offences created by the Government&#151;some 600-plus offences since they came to power. Do we really need to create a new offence where a common law offence already exists?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   It is a wise principle that in legislation one does not over-legislate; nor does one legislate unless the current legislative provision is insufficient. I can see no need for legislation in relation to Clause 7. Obviously I shall defer to Members of the Committee who are experts in law, but I ask the Minister where the offences created by Clause 7 differ from the common law offence of perverting the course of justice. The provision limits the sentence for the offence, unlike the common law offence, which carries a greater term of maximum imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="40119-07_para5"></a>Furthermore, the common law offence can be tried only in the Crown Court. Will the Minister tell the Committee in which circumstances attempting to influence a prosecutor with the intention of perverting the course of justice is not an act tending or intended to pervert the course of justice? Interference with jurors or witnesses at common law in an attempt to persuade them to change their evidence is sufficient to constitute an act; therefore, so must be attempting to influence a prosecutor.
<P>

<a name="40119-07_para6"></a>The Minister will know that common law offences do not activate only after the instigation of proceedings, as may apply, for example, to a police officer's activities before the commencement of proceedings. Unless substantial justification is forthcoming, this clause should not remain in the Bill. If the explanation is that it was an undertaking given to the SDLP at Hillsborough, that is not sufficient justification for its inclusion in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-07_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   One thing stood out in our discussions on the previous amendments: a view shared on all sides of the Committee that the independence of the DPP and his staff was critical to the functioning of the justice system in Northern Ireland. Changes to the justice system in Northern Ireland will mean that that independence is even more warmly to be cherished. The role of Attorney-General will be changing; the director will be standing as an independent person with a different relationship to the new, local Attorney-General for Northern Ireland and indeed the Advocate General for Northern Ireland, which the English Attorney-General will continue to be.
<P>

<a name="40119-07_para7"></a>In those circumstances I am sure all Members of the Committee would agree that it is extremely important that we send a clear message that the director's <P>


<a name="column_857"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 857</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>independence shall not be interfered with without proper reason. In Clause 7 we seek to make it abundantly clear that improperly seeking to influence the Director of Public Prosecutions will be an offence.
<P>

<a name="40119-07_para8"></a>I can envisage many circumstances in which providing information to the director, even making representations, perhaps on behalf of a relative&#151;I do not constrain the examples&#151;would be perfectly proper and it would be proper for the director and his staff to be able to take them into account. But there will come a point at which an attempt to influence a decision will cross a boundary and begin to move into the area in which the director's independence is being subverted.
<P>

<a name="40119-07_para9"></a>At that point we believe that an offence should be created. We found it useful in those circumstances to have regard to an existing body of law in relation to the common law offences of perverting the course of justice, which help to identify what the point is. To my mind&#151;I hope that Members of the Committee will agree&#151;given that the director's independence will be at the heart of his role in the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland, it is right and desirable that we should specifically underline that through the creation of an offence.
<P>

<a name="40119-07_para10"></a>We have not followed precisely the proposals of recommendation 46 of the Criminal Justice Review, which proposed the creation of an offence, because we wanted a clearer provision that had regard to existing law that would enable people to judge whether conduct would break the law. I have consulted the Director of Public Prosecutions closely on this clause to ensure that it is workable and fair, and he is content with it.
<P>

<a name="40119-07_para11"></a>I invite noble Lords to view this as an important protection. One thing on which we are all agreed is the need to safeguard as much as possible the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions. That independence is the bedrock on which prosecution decisions will be made and accordingly of a fair and effective justice system for the people of Northern Ireland. That is why I shall ask that Clause 7 stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="40119-07_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </B>   Can the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General illustrate circumstances in which there would be a breach of this clause and yet not of the common law provisions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-07_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   I am disinclined to speculate on all the kinds of circumstance in which someone might attempt to form a view as to what would constitute a common law offence. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, will know perhaps better than anyone that the surrounds of the common law can be a little imprecise. However, I can say that it will be clear both in terms of a message and an offence that if, with the intention of perverting the course of justice, someone seeks to influence the director, the deputy director, a public prosecutor, a barrister or a solicitor to whom certain matters have been assigned, that will be an offence. Stating that clearly on the face of the statute will send a clear message to everyone as to the <P>

<P>
<UL>
<a name="40119-08_para3"></a>"Last year Britain's railways carried over 1 billion passengers for the first time in 40 years. That is a significant measure of success and one that has been achieved despite all the well-known difficulties facing the industry. Because in those 40 years the railways have suffered from substantial underinvestment, year after year. That was especially so in the years leading up to and immediately after privatisation under Railtrack.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para4"></a>"The Government will set out their spending plans through to 2008 in the spending review this summer. In advance of that, we need to look at the progress made through the increased investment already being put in place but at the same time to look at the structural and organisational changes we need to allow the railways to improve performance. This will enable us, as the spending review decisions are made, to publish proposals in the summer for a new structure and organisation for Britain's railways.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para5"></a>"Because of the history of underinvestment, as a first step it was necessary to put in place increased investment. In July 2000, therefore, the Government announced public investment of £33 billion over 10 years, doubling railway investment over a five year period. Total investment in the four years to 2006 will be almost three times the investment at the time of privatisation.

<UL><FONT SIZE=3>inefficiency in our railways, which built up over decades, was far greater than anyone believed at that time.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para7"></a>"The Hatfield accident in October 2000 exposed the poor state of much of the railway infrastructure and when Network Rail took over from Railtrack in October 2002 and started to go through the books, it became increasingly clear that Railtrack either did not know or did not admit to the sheer scale of the problems it was building up.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para8"></a>"It also became very clear that Railtrack had lost control of its costs. It had farmed out much of its decision making on what work was done, and therefore on costs, to private contractors. And, as everyone knows, forecast costs on the West Coast Main Line were totally unrealistic, rocketing from £2 billion to £13 billion in some five years.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para9"></a>"The recent regulatory review published last December confirms that the cost of upkeep of Britain's railways is £1.5 billion per year more than was thought necessary just three years ago. The review implied that Network Rail inherited a business from Railtrack with unit costs substantially higher than they ought to be. Network Rail is now tackling these inefficiencies and working hard to bring costs down.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para10"></a>"Taxpayers and fare-paying passengers alike need to know that their money is being well spent and that increased spending will improve performance. Cost control is essential.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para11"></a>"The £64 billion public and private investment announced in 2000 is making a difference. Over one third of train rolling stock is being replaced&#151;half on London commuter lines. Major projects are being delivered, like the West Coast Main Line upgrade and the power supply south of the Thames. There is track and signal renewal going on all over the country and there are now 1,500 more services every weekday than there were in 1997. There has been a 20 per cent increase in passengers since 1997.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para12"></a>"Reliability, which is highly dependent on track and signalling maintenance, and which fell dramatically after Hatfield, is now improving, but it still has a very long way to go.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para13"></a>"But there remains a further and very serious difficulty facing this industry; that is, its structure and organisation. The way in which it was privatised has led to a fragmentation, excessive complication and dysfunctionality that have compounded the problems caused by decades of underinvestment.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para14"></a>"There are too many organisations, some with overlapping responsibilities. It has become increasingly clear that this gets in the way of effective decision making and frequently leads to unnecessary wrangling and disputes. That is no way to run a railway.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para15"></a>"The Government are committed to a partnership between public and private sectors. It happens on railways throughout the world. But the long-term inefficiencies and costs of the privatisation <P>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 860</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>settlement have, as time has passed, become an even bigger barrier to the success of the railways. So, within the spirit of partnership between private and public sectors, we need to put right the problems that the authors of privatisation left behind.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para16"></a>"So we now need to build on the investment we have made and on the structural changes we have already put in place, not only to put the railway on a sound financial footing, but at the same time to provide it with the right structure and organisation to take it through the next 20 to 30 years.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para17"></a>"The Government will set out their spending proposals for transport at the conclusion of the spending review in the summer but that money must be well spent now and in the future. It is essential, therefore, that the railways establish far greater cost control so that the public and investors know that it is efficiently and effectively run. Before it takes on new projects we need to be satisfied that there is proper control over existing costs and a significant improvement in performance. The public expect no less.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para18"></a>"The Government remain committed to increasing spending on the railways because it is needed and because the railways are an essential part of the economic fabric of the country&#151;millions of people depend upon it&#151;but the public rightly expect rigorous cost control. After all, we pay for the railways through taxes and fares.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para19"></a> "That work has already started. For example, Network Rail is taking maintenance back in-house to control costs. It is also looking at other areas in which they can do things more cost effectively. The regulator's review, which I welcomed in my Written Statement on 15 December, identified substantial cost reductions. But more can and must be done.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para20"></a>"As a country we must be able to make informed choices and decisions about rail and other forms of public transport. Too often these costs are far from transparent. The Government also believe that the opportunity should be taken to consider how to devolve more decisions on public transport&#151;including rail&#151;to the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly, and at a regional level to PTEs within a nationally coherent framework.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para21"></a>"Local transport decisions are often best taken by the people who provide the service and who pay for it. They can be better placed to know what is needed and how best to provide it, as well as being able to make sensible and informed decisions as between bus, light rail and heavy rail, for example.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para22"></a>"Structural change is needed not just to make better spending decisions. It is also needed if rail is to operate effectively and to meet the needs of passengers and other customers.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para23"></a>"Privatisation had some disastrous and far-reaching consequences for the railway, such as Railtrack's performance, for example. But the private sector has brought considerable increased investment. In many cases, train companies have provided some innovation that was conspicuously lacking in the past. We want to build on that, which <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_861"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 861</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>is why the Government believe that renationalisation would not solve the problems that the railway faces. It is essential to put in place a structure that works and which can deliver not just cost control, but a safe, reliable railway that works efficiently.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para24"></a>"Since 1997, we have put in place reforms to deal with some of the worst effects of privatisation. Richard Bowker and the Strategic Rail Authority have worked extremely hard with the industry, bringing greater leadership and strategic direction to the railway. They do so with our full support. The SRA is making much needed changes to the franchising, planning and route development.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para25"></a>"The Government remain committed to the minute that I laid before the House on 3 February 2003 covering obligations to the SRA, other financial obligations and the Government's other contracts. As the House expects, we shall remain at least as closely involved in expenditure decisions, financial commitments to the industry and those who finance it.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para26"></a>"We need a railway that makes the most of what both the private and public sectors can offer. The first stage of reform was to set up Network Rail, a private sector company operating in the public interest. It is already making significant progress improving the performance of the track and signalling, and is getting a grip on costs. It has a clear focus to operate in the public interest and to build a safe, reliable and efficient railway, and it will continue to do so. We now need to build on that with more fundamental reform.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para27"></a>"The second stage is, therefore, to streamline the remaining structure of the railway, and to examine the way in which the industry works together. The Government will be publishing their proposals in the summer.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para28"></a>"There are two key principles to underpin these reforms. First, the railway must operate in the public interest, while protecting the legitimate interests of investors. It must be for the Government to decide how much public money is spent on the railway and to determine priorities. Of course, no government department can, or should, attempt to operate the railway. However, the Government can put in place a structure and organisation so that it operates effectively and efficiently, and with a single point of decision making. Rail privatisation failed to recognise that there are some things that only government can determine in the public interest that cannot be left purely to commercial interests.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para29"></a>"Secondly, the principle of public and private partnership is right for the railway and it will continue. It brings in money from two sources, which is important. We are spending £73 million every week on the railway, and a similar amount from the private sector is levered in. That is why the principle of independent economic regulation for the railway is essential, and will be central to our proposals.

<P>

<a name="40119-08_para30"></a>"The train operating companies have, in many cases, brought innovation to services that was lacking in the past. But we need to put in place the right organisation and structure so that both the public and private sectors can focus on meeting passengers' needs and delivering value for money. As rail also makes a valuable contribution to keeping lorries off the roads, we want to ensure that freight operators have access to the rail network on fair terms.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para31"></a>"We need the right framework to ensure that the railways operate effectively, so that key decisions can be taken in the best interests of passengers to provide a more reliable service.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para32"></a>"Our objective is a streamlined structure and organisation with clear lines of responsibility and accountability. Network Rail is already operating in the public interest, and with the right franchising arrangements so should the train operators. But we have a clear responsibility to examine the roles and relationships of all the other organisations with a view to streamlining the present structure.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para33"></a>"The review will, therefore, also look at regulation of safety which, at the moment, is the responsibility of the Health and Safety Executive, Health and Safety Commission and the Railway Safety and Standards Board. Safety is of paramount importance. All those involved undoubtedly work hard to ensure a safe railway. But there are now a plethora of industry standards, some of which are over-cautious, or which are being applied in an over-cautious way. Safety regulation needs to focus on the real risks to passengers and employees. It should not be an obstacle to providing reliable services. We need the right organisation to do that.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para34"></a>"Our reforms have to make the structure as simple and as straightforward as possible. The complex structure at privatisation has contributed to the daily frustrations of the public. Many of those frustrations are shared by the dedicated and committed people across the country who are working to improve the railways and deliver better services. There are many in the railway industry with ideas for reform. I am asking Richard Bowker and the SRA to evaluate ideas as they come forward, and then to let me have advice based on industry views, so that we can take them fully into account in reaching conclusions on the review.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para35"></a>"In the mean time, the priorities for the industry must be to focus continually on driving up performance and reliability and getting a grip on costs. Passengers are rightly impatient. Improvements have been made but more needs to be done. We are determined to bring to an end the problems caused by decades of under-investment, which have been compounded by an ill-thought-out privatisation. Rebuilding Britain's railways needs a long-term commitment, which we are determined to deliver. I commend this Statement to the House".

<a name="40119-08_para36"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-08_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating that Statement. I am afraid that it is another nail in the coffin of the 10-year transport plan that the Government published in 2002. It is a government policy that is caught between political dogma and Treasury concerns&#151;a conflict between the two about public spending restrictions.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para37"></a>At least the Minister admitted that privatisation works for the train operating companies. We need only look at the huge investment. It should have worked for Railtrack. I have always admitted that we did not get the interface between Railtrack and the train operating companies right. But the Government did nothing for six years&#151;before it was too late&#151;and then they renationalised it. Did that work? No. Network Rail has abandoned expansion plans and cut investment. Fares are rising and one in five trains runs late. The Government want to change it again, after only three years.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para38"></a>The Strategic Rail Authority was the brainchild of the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, and Network Rail was the brainchild of Stephen Byers. Let us not forget the creation of the Rail Regulator, the Health and Safety Executive, the Health and Safety Commission and the Railway Safety and Standards Board.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para39"></a>We said from the beginning that there were too many bodies with conflicting interests. Who set them up? This Government. At least the current Secretary of State now agrees with us that the bodies set up by his predecessor do not work. They conflict with each other.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para40"></a>What is rather surprising about the Statement is that in September Alistair Darling, Secretary of State, said to the Transport Select Committee:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am loathe to start spending overmuch time on structural changes when I really want everybody in the railway industry to concentrate on delivery".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-08_para41"></a>
What has happened since September to change his mind? Why the change of policy? Is the reason that the Secretary of State had to block the SRA strategic plan, which is due to be published this month, that he did not like its findings? When will it be published? Is it going to be published soon? If not, we shall begin to wonder why. What are the Government covering up?
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para42"></a>Almost the only important sentence in the Statement was in paragraph 39, which talked about the structure and organisation,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"with a single point of decision making".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-08_para43"></a>
What does the Minister mean by that? Will it be the Secretary of State, the SRA or some new person making decisions? Does it mean that the Government or someone else will be taking control? What is,

<a name="40119-08_para45"></a>We cannot respond to a rail Statement without saying that it is always the poor long-suffering fare-paying travelling public who suffer from government policy.

<FONT SIZE=3>Secretary of State. It was not really a Statement but a softening-up for further admissions of failure. It was a long Statement&#151;13 minutes&#151;which said very little. It could have said: "We have got it wrong; we shall go back to the drawing board and return to you in the summer".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may start by apologising for having missed the first few paragraphs of the Minister's Statement, but I was urgently called away.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para46"></a>We had looked forward to today's Statement with some enthusiasm, but I am afraid that we are very disappointed indeed. We are first disappointed that the Minister did not refer to the railways being in a deplorable state and that they have suffered from 40 years of substantial under-investment&#151;year after year. That was not the case before privatisation. There were low levels of investment but a management system which had learned to cope with them.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para47"></a>The railways were in a very good state when they were handed over on privatisation. The fact that Railtrack subsequently failed to invest, to control its contractors and to put the interests of its shareholders first lies at the heart of the problem. That is the fault not of the Government but of the previous administration.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para48"></a>We need to act radically and quickly if the Government are to salvage something from the deplorable state that the railways are now in&#151;and which are in fact getting worse rather than better. I suggest that the Minister must go for some simple solutions. He must combine the regulator&#151;who by the way was not invented by the Labour Party or its previous Ministers, but by the previous Conservative administration&#151;with some kind of oversight body that contains the economic regulator. That is the model under which the CAA has worked, and has worked extremely successfully. I doubt whether anyone knows the name of the economic regulator of the CAA&#151;Harry Bush&#151;but they certainly know the name of Tom Winsor very well because almost every statement is preceded by the personal pronoun.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para49"></a>We should make franchises longer. They should roll forward subject to meeting performance criteria, and they should be more comprehensive. In order to get the railways back into a manageable form, Network Rail should gradually surrender to the franchisees its responsibilities for timetables, for signal operations, for possession and planning, and then, in the fullness of time, it should surrender track and signalling in order to get the railway back into a manageable form. It was a fundamental error to split the track away from the trains, which were so deeply ingrained. Alone of the regulated industries, the railways have proved absolutely unsuitable for the form of nationalisation which was chosen&#151;mainly by people who did not know what they were doing.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para50"></a>All the safety responsibilities to which the Minister referred should go to the newly created Railway Inspectorate and not the Health and Safety Executive <P>


<a name="column_865"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 865</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with its "safety case" culture. While I agree that safety is paramount, it does not need layer on layer of bureaucrats supervising and interpreting responsibility, so that what goes for the fastest part of the railway is applied willy-nilly to the smallest branch line.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para51"></a>The Minister should tell the OFT that combined ownership of bus and rail is not objectionable and that bus and train companies should be allowed to co-operate in the public interest.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para52"></a>The rumours we have read in newspapers about the appointment of eight tsars may or may not be true. What I would say is that if there are eight good people available to direct the railways, they are needed to run the railways and not to direct them. If there are eight not so good people then the result will be more, rather than fewer, turf wars.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para53"></a>The SRA, the railway directing body, or whatever it is called, should be small and clearly aware which are its responsibilities and which belong to the Department of Transport. There should be no doubt in anyone's mind. Perhaps the Minister can clarify that issue.
<P>

<a name="40119-08_para54"></a>I conclude by saying that we on these Benches are very willing to help rescue the railways. The Government should not rely simply on advice filtered through Richard Bowker, who, despite the Financial Times describing him as an experienced railway manager, is in fact nothing of the sort. We are keen to see that the lot of the passenger and freight-user is put first.

<A NAME="40119-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the two Front-Bench contributions. It is a function of the Official Opposition, I suppose, to criticise and never at any stage either to admit mistakes of the past when it was in government or to advance a proposition that is remotely constructive in relation to our present problems. The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, fulfilled that role admirably. He referred to the issues with regard to Network Rail and its difficulties as though Hatfield had never happened. He must surely appreciate that the enormous problems which have engulfed Network Rail are a reflection of what the Hatfield accident threw up, and that the problems, therefore, of the railways were far greater than even the worst analysis had shown at the time of the botched privatisation.
<P>

<a name="40119-09_para0"></a>The noble Viscount asked me one specific question. He asked what will be the single point of decision making. He will recognise that the Statement's purpose is to make clear to the industry and to all those with a contribution to make in improving our rail performance that in the summer we intend to reform the railways' organisation to have this crucial single point of decision taking. We are aware that the plethora of competing points of decision is causing enormous problems in the railways by failing to produce a structure to tackle these outstanding issues.
<P>


<a name="column_866"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 866</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40119-09_para1"></a>Of course we are consulting on this issue. We expect the industry, and all those interested in it, to put forward ranges of proposals so that we can arrive at the right structure to stand the country in good stead for the decades ahead.
<P>

<a name="40119-09_para2"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. He addressed some crucial areas where he thought there were points that we should take on board. In his comments regarding safety, I accept that we need to rethink the position. It is quite clear that that has been one of the railways' significant problems. We all put the highest priority on safety, but we cannot run the railways solely on the presumption that safety takes predominance over every other factor. Otherwise, no train would ever move at any speed at all. We are aware that we need to look at the safety side. I am grateful for the noble Lord's constructive point.
<P>

<a name="40119-09_para3"></a>On combined ownership, the Statement indicated that we are looking at how we can devolve some areas of decision taking down to local passenger transport executives and local structures. The Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly can play their part on a rather more significant scale. The concept of seeking to devolve some aspects of decision taking to a more local level would fit in with the proposition that the noble Lord advanced. That needs to be considered further. I also accept that we cannot get this single point of decision right if we lack a clear definition of the responsibilities between such a body and the Department of Transport. That is absolutely critical to the effectiveness of the review.
<P>

<a name="40119-09_para4"></a>I conclude on the obvious point. If we had come along with a cut-and-dried solution to a very difficult problem, no doubt we would have been challenged about giving insufficient signals for consultation on what should be done. We are allowing five months which will ensure that we hit our intended objectives for the railways.

<P>
<A NAME="40119-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, the Front Bench speakers have had a long time. I am glad that Back-Benchers at last have their chance. Is the Minister aware that if he had gone further back into the past then his criticisms of privatisation would have been much more valid? The past is important in the railways. First, they were run into the ground by six years of war, very intensive use, and nothing was spent on them. After the war, the railways had the colossal misfortune&#151;visited on them by the party opposite&#151;of having the Treasury as a banker. That is an untold misfortune. I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Marsh, will be the first person to agree with that.
<P>

<a name="40119-09_para5"></a>The Minister has to understand that words will not help. A major casualty is that the morale and pride of railwaymen has been lost. That is the first thing to restore and only then will there be a competent organisation. I am quite conscious of the fact that privatisation as an attempt to get the railways off the back of the Treasury was flawed in many respects. There cannot be that confusion of responsibility and one cannot have too many players in the game. The <P>


<a name="column_867"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 867</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whole thing becomes too complex. It was a rather long Statement. I hope the Minister will lend himself not to words but to action.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I assure the noble Lord that the Front Benches had the time they were allocated for questions. If anything, they were slightly economical. If we did run over-run&#151;I did not notice that we had&#151;then the blame rests with me in my answers and not my two inquisitors from the Opposition Front Benches.
<P>

<a name="40119-09_para6"></a>On the more general issue of history, I bow to the greater knowledge of the noble Lord. He used to occupy a very significant position in transport and I have no doubt that he studied the history of the railways at that time. I agree with him that the present situation is too complex. There need to be clear points of decision and we need to get the relative rail responsibilities sorted out accurately. That is what we intend to do. I emphasised the other point that he will recognise; the future of the railways will not just be dependent on what the taxpayer contributes through the Treasury. There will also be additional investment from the private sector.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, I agree with every word said by the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, whose time as Transport Minister is still viewed by many people in the rail industry as perhaps the golden age in the post-war period. His comments about morale are ones that the Government must take very seriously.
<P>

<a name="40119-09_para7"></a>I say to my noble friend that there is a huge amount in the Statement today that will be welcomed by the travelling public and by the industry. There are aspects of it which are long overdue and very sensible. I particularly welcome the full support that it gives to the Strategic Rail Authority and its chairman, Richard Bowker. I hope that, contrary to the mendacious reports appearing in the press over recent days, he will have a long-term role in the industry and play a part in the new structure that emerges from this process. My noble friend's comments about safety in the industry will be welcomed. It is grotesque that there is such an imbalance between the way in which road safety and rail safety are treated. If that leads to a more satisfactory consideration in the future, that will be very welcome indeed.
<P>

<a name="40119-09_para8"></a>Finally, does my noble friend agree that while the review is underway the industry should not take its eye off the ball and lose sight of the need to continue with improvements and cut costs?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for reminding me that the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, introduced that very important concept of the morale of the workforce. There is no doubt that morale can lift with investment in the railways with people then driving and serving on vastly superior rail stock. One should bear in mind the speed with which the rail stock is being improved. However, as any railwayman will tell any passenger at any time, morale <P>


<a name="column_868"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 868</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is only as high as the punctuality of that train. Passengers wish to travel on a comfortable train but, above all, they want that train to arrive on time. Those are the issues that we have to address if we wish to raise morale of the rail workers who have such an important role to play.
<P>

<a name="40119-09_para9"></a>I would not go quite as far as my noble friend Lord Faulkner in suggesting that the press were mendacious over the weekend. I have too many friends in the media to accuse them in quite those trenchant terms&#151;inaccurate, certainly, wide of the mark and speculative in the extreme. He asked whether we will ensure that there will be no loss of activity on improvements while decisions are taken on the new streamlined arrangements. We are talking only in terms of four to five months. There is no intention on anybody's part to let up the drive towards improving the railways.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for losing a few minutes at the beginning of the Statement. The encouraging aspect is the speed at which a massively dangerous financial situation is now confronting whichever party is in power, not whether trains run five minutes late or 10 minutes late. In my view, the current organisation is financially totally out of control. Both parties have played a real role in that. Against advice from many people in the industry, the Conservative Party decided that not only would it seek to privatise the railway&#151;despite people arguing that it was not like the electricity board or the water board&#151;but also that it would separate the track from the operation of the organisation. That was a fundamental mistake. What has happened now is that there is such a multiplicity of management points that it is impossible to decide who is responsible for what.
<P>

<a name="40119-09_para10"></a>At the previous general election I was encouraged when reading through the Labour manifesto. I came to the conclusion that 99 per cent of it should be disregarded. Then I fixed on a small part which said it was the intention of the Labour Party to bring the railway system back under public control. I have the greatest respect to the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, whom I regard&#151;I have never made any secret of it&#151;as the best of six Ministers I encountered, not least because the two of us, whenever we met, cursed his colleagues with equal enthusiasm. However, there is no way that a passenger railway system of this size can escape a position where the Government are the ultimate bankers. That dogs the whole thing.
<P>

<a name="40119-09_para11"></a>This is a complex subject. I hope that nobody really believes that this problem will be solved in the next four or five months. There is a need to take what urgent action can be taken, but I think it would be perfectly sensible to have an outside commission go back to the drawing board and provide a number of options, because there is no simple solution to the problem.
<P>

<a name="40119-09_para12"></a>I know of no major passenger railway system in the world which breaks even, let alone makes a profit. The cosmetics of railway accounting are wondrous, but the realities are that ultimately they require very large subsidies for a number of reasons, one of which is the most simple and powerful of all. The passengers never <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>come in a nice neat flow&#151;they come in peaks and troughs throughout 24 hours. That requires a massive infrastructure investment for the whole of the 24 hours which could never be met by passenger fares.
<P>

<a name="40119-09_para13"></a>Many of these problems are fundamental and basic. I congratulate the Government on at least saying that they recognise that there is a serious problem. I think it will take longer; there is a need for a long-term look at the problem, because railways can be a very, very hungry beast.

<P>
<A NAME="40119-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, with his vast experience, for emphasising just how investment in the rail industry is such a costly burden for both taxpayers and farepayers, who are the only other source of revenue. The figures in the Statement about investment over the next decade are very substantial indeed.
<P>

<a name="40119-10_para0"></a>On staff morale, the noble Lord is also right that so long as crucial resources appear to be ebbing away because of a loss of control over crucial costs, morale in the railway industry will of course be low. By taking the projects in-house, Network Rail has set about getting a grip on those costs. I assure the noble Lord that the timescale of four to five months will give all those who have a clear interest in the industry&#151;all who have imagination and perspective&#151;the time to go back to the drawing board and present the Government with how the crucial decisions should be taken and what structure is necessary for that to happen. I am sure that we will benefit from that consultation over the next five months.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the fact that the Government have, albeit belatedly, agreed with what we on these Benches have been saying for some time&#151;that the structure of the rail industry is at the heart of the problems we face today. Indeed, the highly fragmented nature of railway decision-making and provision has resulted in a system which is far more costly than need be, and far more heavily regulated and bureaucratic. Most seriously of all, it has ended in a sort of institutional paralysis, so that the Government's efforts to invest more and Network Rail's efforts to cut costs have, to a large extent, been wasted because the structure is wrong.
<P>

<a name="40119-10_para1"></a>Can the Minister be a little more specific about the nature of the consultation and how it will take place? We should also like to pin him down a little more on the question of four or five months. I suggest that, on the subject of railways, it is not unreasonable to have a timetable.
<P>

<a name="40119-10_para2"></a>Finally&#151;and I say this with every respect for Richard Bowker and the Strategic Rail Authority, although I know it is not always shared&#151;I question whether the Strategic Rail Authority is the right body to carry out this study. I say that not least because it is crucial that whatever comes out at the end has, if not the agreement of all the players, the respect of all the players. I am nervous that the SRA will be seen as a partial body, and that we may start off doing the right <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>thing for the right reasons but end up with something that does not command the respect of the rail industry. That would be nothing short of tragic.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the noble Baroness's comments. I emphasise that of course the SRA will have a role to play with regard to this review. However, it is a Government-led review, and we intend to get the position clarified and the new structure proposed by the summer. So we are working to a tight timetable, with ministerial drive behind the review. As the noble Lord, Lord Marsh, indicated, a number of quite radical concepts may come forward in the review. The Government have made it quite clear what principles they will be working on for the new streamlined organisation. However, I emphasise again that this is a Government-led review and Ministers will take responsibility for the outcome.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the Statement, which is very positive. It is a positive commitment to freight&#151;I declare an interest as chairman of the Rail Freight Group&#151;and to the principle of economic regulation, which is so important in attracting private sector finance. I am sure that all noble Lords will agree on that point.
<P>

<a name="40119-10_para3"></a>I particularly welcome the review and its attack on costs. Several noble Lords have mentioned costs; we need to move on to the question of the causes of costs&#151;standards, regulations, and so on. There is a general feeling that costs in the railways are about four times what they were for the same output with British Rail. That is quite unsustainable.
<P>

<a name="40119-10_para4"></a>Back in the summer, when we were debating the Railways and Transport Safety Bill, my noble friend Lord McIntosh of Haringey spoke about common values for preventable fatality on safety between road and rail, which was very positive. The Minister of State for Transport, my honourable friend Kim Howells, has been saying similar positive things about road and rail safety since then. However, I do not see any leadership or action from the SRA, the Rail Safety and Standards Board or Network Rail on this issue. I urge my noble friend to ensure, in the five-month period, that the message continues to come from Ministers and that these organisations do what they should be doing with regard to leadership and action. When they report and the Government finally decide, at the end of July, what will happen, the industry will already have taken a lot of action.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend. I want to reassure him that the point he makes is central to government thinking. It came up a little earlier in this question and answer session in terms of the morale of the industry. While costs were escalating under Railtrack, this was deeply demoralising for the industry because scarce resources were clearly not being invested where they needed to be&#151;in improvements to the industry&#151;but were being wasted. I assure my noble friend that that is an important principle behind the structure of the outcome of the review. I also emphasise that, against <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>this background, he will recognise that we must not only get costs under control, but also that we need to build upon the much increased investment which the Government have pledged and are committed to over this 10-year period and which we are also deriving from private sector resources. Once the right structure and leadership are in place, that will give the industry real hope for the future.

<A NAME="40119-10_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </B>   My Lords, there are 57 paragraphs in this Statement&#151;no wonder there are varieties. Two paragraphs have been referred to specifically. In paragraph 39, the Statement refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a single point of decision making".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-10_para5"></a>
That, in my view, is centralising. Paragraph 27, however, talks about devolving more decisions. That is devolutionary. Which way are the Government travelling? I hope that they could be travelling in a devolutionary way by devolving to the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly and also at regional level to PTEs. Often the most important places where rail can make a contribution, particularly with congestion, is 10 miles further than the PTE boundaries. I worry that two-tierism is happening with that as well as the Government facing in two directions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I emphasise that parts of the Statement envisage greater participation by passenger transport executives. We have already seen illustrations in places such as Liverpool, Manchester and several other of our great cities of the integration of transport modes where rail plays a crucial part. It is right that local PTEs should make an increased contribution to that work. However, that in no way collides with the central thrust of the review, which is to guarantee that decisions affecting investment strategies, the shape of the railways and the obligations of the big players&#151;who account for a substantial amount of public money&#151;are taken along clearer lines than is now the case by a plethora of agencies. The railway industry is of overwhelming concern to our fellow citizens. The clearer decision-taking process will enable Ministers to exercise their proper judgment about the development of the railway and be answerable to the nation through Parliament.

"(1) The Attorney General for Northern Ireland shall issue, and as he thinks appropriate from time to time revise, a list of international human rights standards relevant to the criminal justice system."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40119-10_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 42, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 44 to 51. The amendment relates to another area where the Bill has failed sufficiently to reflect the review and the guarantee in the updated plan about the role of international human rights standards in the reform process. The updated plan stated that all criminal justice agencies would be under a duty to have due regard to international human rights standards. That has translated rather differently, however, to the published Bill.
<P>

<a name="40119-10_para13"></a>The Bill proposes a curious and convoluted formulation whereby it would be for the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland to issue guidance, as and when he thinks fit, to the listed criminal justice agencies on the exercise of their functions in light of relevant international standards. That raises doubts over the genuine commitment of the Government to finding a greater role for the application of international human rights standards in the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40119-10_para14"></a>Amendment No. 50 is slightly different. Clause 8(8) of the Bill exempts the prosecution service from having any regard to human rights guidance issued by the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland where that guidance would be inconsistent with a code of practice issued under Section 37 of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002. Our amendment simply asks why. It is difficult to foresee how the new and first-ever code of practice for the prosecution service, which is due to be published in draft form this month&#151;long before the operation of the Bill&#151;would be inconsistent with international human rights standards. Will the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General explain why the Bill has deviated from what was expected in the review and the updated plan? I beg to move.

However, I wonder if the amendment would achieve what we would all hope for. If it replaces guidance, are we not losing some flexibility that might prove valuable? While guidance would appear to be more open to interpretation than a set of standards, I wonder whether it really is. I suspect that one could argue equally convincingly that it is not.

<P>
<A NAME="40119-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   In speaking to the amendment, I too shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 44 to 51. The amendments would give me the power to produce only a list of the relevant conventions and standards in criminal justice for organisations in Northern Ireland, rather than a more comprehensive document. In that respect, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, is absolutely right.
<P>

<a name="40119-11_para0"></a>The guidance that we envisage would be given under Clause 8 would help interpret and explain the conventions and standards, as well as their effect on the criminal justice agencies, and not simply present them with a bare list. It would be significantly more helpful to the agencies for them to be provided with some kind of commentary and analysis of the relevant conventions and standards rather than with that simple list. In that way, the agencies would find it easier to accord with the conventions and standards and to do so consistently.
<P>

<a name="40119-11_para1"></a>That is important because the great differences that exist between the status and effect of some of the conventions and standards do require some degree of comment. Some are binding on UK and international law and some are not. Where only parts of a particular instrument or standard are relevant, it would not be helpful simply to list the standard. That is our principal reason for resisting the burden of the majority of the amendments.
<P>

<a name="40119-11_para2"></a>I note that the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, did not refer specifically to Amendment No. 44. That would change "regard" in Clause 8(3) to "due regard". Having sought the view of Parliamentary Counsel, we believe that that amendment would not be helpful.
<P>

<a name="40119-11_para3"></a>Amendment No. 50 would remove a safeguard in the legislation. I respond specifically to the question that the noble Lord, Lord Smith, put to me. The safeguard would allow the Public Prosecution Service to disregard so much of the guidance as may be inconsistent with the code of practice for prosecutors to be published by the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland as required by the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002.
<P>

<a name="40119-11_para4"></a>I agree that it is unlikely that the two will be inconsistent. I hope that they will not be so. I am sure that great effort will be made to ensure that they are not. It is still right to prepare for the possibility of that event, particularly if the guidance relates to a significant number of instruments. In those circumstances, unlikely though they may be, it is important to provide a clear steer as to which should take precedence. I assure noble Lords that in those circumstances we would want to move swiftly to address any apparent anomalies. With those explanations, I invite the noble Lord not to press his amendment.

I see that my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew, who takes part in that committee, is present.
<P>

<a name="40119-11_para8"></a>We support the principle behind Clause 8, which places a duty on the Attorney-General to issue guidance on relevant international human rights standards to certain specified criminal justice organisations in Northern Ireland, as referred to in subsections (4) and (5). The organisations are required to have due regard to the guidance in carrying out their functions. The guidance must be published and laid before Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40119-11_para9"></a>The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee is not altogether happy with that. On page 4, paragraphs 18 and 19 of the report say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The guidance must be laid before Parliament, but it is not subject to further scrutiny. The delegated powers memorandum mentions the precedents of the Code for prosecutors under section 37 of the 2002 Act and the Code of Ethics of the police under section 52 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. Those codes are addressed to one category of recipient only, though they have a wide effect. The guidance under clause 8(1) will apply both to the organisations listed under clause 8(4) and also to any other organisations added by order under clause 8(5).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-11_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   Much of the language of this clause has been debated before in various guises, through both the Northern Ireland policing legislation and the criminal justice legislation. To see that, one need only cast one's eye over the Hansards for the Commons Committee debates on the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 and the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002.
<P>

<a name="40119-11_para16"></a>The first question to consider is whether the guidance is necessary. We have a Human Rights Act that places a duty on public bodies. Is it the case that the Government consider that Act itself deficient in some respects, given that subsection (1) contains the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"consistent with international human rights standards"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-11_para17"></a><P>

<a name="40119-11_para18"></a>Subsection (6) places a duty on the Chief Constable and the Policing Board to have regard to guidance from the Attorney-General. It is already obliged to consult the police association, the Secretary of State, the ombudsman, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Equality Commission and any other person who may have an interest. What additional input is the Attorney-General going to provide that may be lacking?
<P>

<a name="40119-11_para19"></a>In terms of subsection (7), the Director of Public Prosecutions is already under a duty to be guided by the general principles of the guidelines on the role of prosecutors adopted at the eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, held at Havana between 27 August and 7 September 1990. He is also under a duty to consult the Attorney-General in relation to guidance by virtue of Section 42 of the 2002 Act. What other additional international guidance or standards do the Government have in mind in relation to the provision? Most importantly, the role of the Attorney-General was debated in 2002. Why is the proposal coming before us now and why was it omitted then? What has given rise to the proposed change?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-11_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   The clause provides for my office, and for me, to issue guidance to the listed criminal justice agencies and for the listed agencies to have regard to such guidance as is issued.
<P>

<a name="40119-11_para20"></a>Human rights were a key theme of the Criminal Justice Review, and the purpose of the clause is to enshrine human rights awareness even more emphatically in the criminal justice system. However, there is a difficulty, which the review recognised, in enshrining human rights duties in law, which is why it is better to produce guidance on human rights rather than placing a direct duty. We discussed the issue earlier, under another amendment.
<P>

<a name="40119-11_para21"></a>Noble Lords have asked what value the guidance would have. It will have to be taken into account in any revision of the code of ethics of the Police Service of <P>

<P>

<a name="40119-11_para22"></a>Parliament will have some control over the publication of guidance, as a result of the undertaking that I gave in relation to an earlier amendment that we would introduce an amendment that would take account of the recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.
<P>

<a name="40119-11_para23"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rogan, asked why the measure was not introduced as part of the 2002 Act. The Criminal Justice Review did not specifically recommend legislation on human rights, but the issue was revisited during the Hillsborough discussions. The Government's view is that the provision of guidance to criminal justice agencies on the relevant human rights instruments will help them to ensure that respect for human rights is kept at the heart of the justice system, while avoiding the difficulties that the review anticipated.
<P>

<a name="40119-11_para24"></a>I presumed to suggest before that the independence of the DPP and the prosecutorial discretion was something that all Members in the House and in Committee could agree. I hope and believe that the same would be true in relation to respect for human rights for all peoples in Northern Ireland. This clause will help to underline that importance.

<a name="40119-12_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 52, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 53 to 57. These amendments bring the procedure for the Crown appealing bail refusal into line with the current practice in England and Wales. They are, in a sense, probing amendments. I invite the Minister to justify that different approach. I have three simple questions. Why should appeals from the magistrates' court go to the High Court and not the Crown Court? Why should there be an automatic second bite of the cherry, rather than concentration on new information? Why should it read "imprisonable" rather than "triable on indictment"? I shall be grateful for the Minister's reply. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   It may assist the Committee if I confirm that we are now taking as a group Amendments Nos. 52, 53, 55, 56 and 57, to which the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, has spoken.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   I shall take these five amendments together. They broadly relate to the same issue.
<P>

<a name="40119-12_para2"></a>Amendments Nos. 52, 56 and 57 would have the effect of restricting the new prosecution right of appeal against the grant of bail to those cases where the <P>


<a name="column_877"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 877</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accused is charged with an offence triable on indictment. As the clause stands at present, its scope is wider, allowing an appeal in any case where the accused is charged with, or convicted of, an offence that can attract a sentence of imprisonment. As the clause stands, it would create a prosecution right of appeal to the High Court where prosecutors have concerns about a grant of bail by a magistrates' court.
<P>

<a name="40119-12_para3"></a>At the moment, unlike in England and Wales, there is no mechanism for the prosecution to challenge any grant of bail by magistrates. Having had the opportunity of discussing this with the chief constable and other senior officers of the police force, I am confident that it is an important new power. As to the detail, the clause provides that where a magistrate grants bail in a case where the defendant is charged with or convicted of an offence punishable by imprisonment, the prosecution can appeal the grant of bail to the High Court.
<P>

<a name="40119-12_para4"></a>There are important safeguards. First, an appeal can be made only if the prosecution opposed bail in the first instance. Secondly, oral notice of an intention to appeal must be given to the court before the person concerned is released from custody. Thirdly, written notice must then be given to the court and the person concerned within two hours of the conclusion of proceedings. The hearing of the appeal itself has to be commenced within 48 hours, subject to limited exceptions.
<P>

<a name="40119-12_para5"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rogan, asked three questions. The first was why the appeal should go to the High Court. That is dealt with by his Amendments Nos. 53 and 55. In Northern Ireland it is the High Court which has jurisdiction in bail matters. It is that court which currently has jurisdiction to hear appeals by the accused against refusal of bail by a magistrates' court. So it makes sense that the new prosecution right of appeal should also go to the High Court in Northern Ireland. It is a difference from the position in England and Wales where the appeal goes to the Crown Court, but this clause is tailored to the conditions in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40119-12_para6"></a>The noble Lord's second question was why there should be a second bite of the cherry, as he put it; that is to say, a right to appeal even though there is no fresh information. It is important that there should be the opportunity for a higher court to review a decision of bail, where that decision may have been erroneous. It can be very important. The consequences of granting bail where bail ought not to have been granted may be that the public are put at risk of further offences, of the defendant absconding or of interference with witnesses. This is an important decision and to limit the ability to appeal simply to the case where there is fresh information would render it a very limited power indeed.
<P>

<a name="40119-12_para7"></a>Thirdly, the noble Lord asked why the opportunity to appeal should apply to cases where there is the possibility of imprisonment, rather than some different category. I draw noble Lords' attention to the fact that, when it is commenced, Section 18 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 will amend Section 1 of the <P>


<a name="column_878"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 878</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bail (Amendment) Act 1993. That will mean that prosecution appeals against grants of bail in England and Wales can be made in relation to offences punishable by imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="40119-12_para8"></a>In short, once Section 18 is commenced, the position in this respect will be the same in Northern Ireland and in England and Wales; that is to say, the same formula of applying it to offences punishable by imprisonment will apply in both jurisdictions. If the noble Lord's amendment were carried that would not be the case. It seems to us that the reasons that led to that extension in England and Wales apply equally to Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40119-12_para9"></a>I hope I have given satisfactory answers to the noble Lord's three questions and invite him not to press his amendments.

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-12_para14"></a><P>

<a name="40119-12_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: This, too, is a probing amendment, seeking justification for this particular provision. It seems fair to have something fall on a particular date if the substantive Act has a renewal aspect, as we have been familiar with in Northern Ireland over many years. However, is it not fair to say that this is less so when one considers procedures?
<P>

<a name="40119-12_para16"></a>Secondly, why would one seek to permit the Secretary of State to remove bail provisions simply by order? Surely it should take something more substantial. Surely as we debate this as primary legislation its removal before a fixed date should also be debated? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-12_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   I shall try to address the question which has been raised by the noble Lord, Lord Cooke, in relation to the justification for this aspect of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40119-12_para17"></a>Clause 11 and Schedule 2 are clearly contingent on the Diplock bail arrangements set out in Section 67 of the Terrorism Act 2000 which, in accordance with Section 112 of that Act, will expire on 19 February 2006. Section 112 of the Terrorism Act would also allow Section 67 to cease to have effect by order before February 2006, hence the second limb of Clause 11(4). Clause 11(4) is simply a reflection of the status of Section 67. It is right that provisions that can have no effect should be removed from the statute book in the interests of clarity of legislation.
<P>

<a name="40119-12_para18"></a>As for the Secretary of State's ability to do this by order, the power to make an order, with the effect that the provisions will cease to have effect, is included to cover the situation in which Section 67 ceases to have <P>

<P>

<a name="40119-12_para19"></a>I hope that, with that explanation, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40119-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Glentoran </B>   moved Amendment No. 59:

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"in order to carry out an arrest under this paragraph, a constable may enter any premises where he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that person to be""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40119-12_para25"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment was prompted&#151;I think that that is the best way of putting it&#151;by discussions that I and colleagues had with the chief constable's office, the PSNI. It focuses on Clause 12, which makes very positive changes to the bail provisions in the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2003. Subsection (4) of Clause 12 amends Article 6 of that order, which deals with arrest for absconding or breaking conditions of bail.
<P>

<a name="40119-12_para26"></a>At present, police may arrest a person for breach of bail conditions, but they have no power of entry to effect the arrest. A person may have been released on bail and have been told, as a condition of that bail, to stay away from witnesses. Police may have reasonable grounds to believe that that person has been visiting witnesses, but officers would be unable to enter a private dwelling without consent to use their new power of arrest. The suspect can remain in his house or another's house and officers are powerless to do anything until they catch him in a public place. While the power of entry is not found in the English Bail Act 1976, there seems no valid reason to give a constable a greater power of arrest but to withhold the lesser power to enter.
<P>

<a name="40119-12_para27"></a>The criminal justice department has raised this matter with the Northern Ireland Office, I understand, but there seems to be no prospect of change at the moment. However, I understand that the noble Baroness the Lord President of the Council will tell me shortly that she will perhaps take another look at it. I therefore ask whether she will explain whether the Government are willing to concede the point and respond to the wishes of the police. There seems little sense in allowing powers of arrest when the police would not be able to enter a building to effect an arrest.
<P>

<a name="40119-12_para28"></a>The police have obviously found the status quo an impediment to their work and are frustrated about this loophole, which may allow those who have absconded or broken bail to escape arrest. This change seems a prudent one. I hope that the noble Baroness the Lord <P>

<A NAME="40119-13_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   As the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, has already made reference to my response, it might help the Committee if I gave that response now. He will be pleased to know that I have no reference in my notes to what is happening in the English courts.
<P>

<a name="40119-13_para0"></a>Our concern is that the power sought in Amendment No. 59 may be inappropriate and indeed disproportionate to the problem in hand. However, in the light of the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, I undertake to go away and reflect on the principle behind the amendment, with a view to deciding whether there should be a power of entry to effect an arrest where there has been an actual breach of bail. I have to say to the noble Lord that, in looking at the amendment, I have a concern about a provision to enter premises on "reasonable grounds for suspecting". I think that we really do need to re-examine that issue and the phrasing of the amendment. However, I undertake to talk to him and to return to the issue on Report if that is appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   In thanking the noble Baroness the Lord President I also wish to apologise. It was pointed out to me that I did not address her completely correctly when I was speaking before. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40119-13_para4"></a><P>

<a name="40119-13_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: I return to a point that I raised at Second Reading. The fact that Northern Ireland has only one maximum security prison now, whereas it used to have two or three, of itself makes prison management somewhat more difficult. There is nowhere in the jurisdiction that a difficult or disruptive prisoner can be moved to. I can therefore understand the need for a clause along the lines of this one. I was glad when the noble Baroness the Leader of the House said in reply on Second Reading that transfers, of the kind we are discussing, would,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"not be used if the particular prisoner could be dealt with in another way".&#151;[Official Report, 16/12/03; col. 1119.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-13_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40119-13_para7"></a>Despite that assurance I still think that the clause as drafted gives the Secretary of State powers to make compulsory transfers that are too sweeping. That is why I am suggesting that the power should be usable only as a result of an individual's "serious misconduct". "Misconduct" may not be exactly the right word and "misbehaviour" might be better. I am trying to cover serious or repeated violence against prison staff or other prisoners, persistent threats of death or injury, arson and other serious breaches of prison rules and discipline. Appendix A of the Steele review of prison safety at Her Majesty's Prison Maghaberry covered such serious cases.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40119-13_para8"></a>As to the expression "for his own protection", prisoners sometimes have to be segregated. That can be harmful, as well as protective, for the individual concerned. I am therefore suggesting that if the prisoner agrees, he might be moved to England or Scotland to avoid having to be placed in long-term segregation. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   We on these Benches support the amendment and the reasoning behind it. As the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said, this clause comes out of the report into the disturbances at Maghaberry last summer. Again as he reminded us, at Second Reading we were reassured that this clause would be used very much as a last resort. However, we would feel much more comfortable if the reasons for using this clause were more than just,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in the interests of maintaining security and good order in prisons".&#151;[Official Report, 16/12/03; col. 1094.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-13_para9"></a><P>

<a name="40119-13_para10"></a>We think that that is too wide. We believe that there should be a specific connection to a prisoner involved. Therefore, we support Amendment No. 60.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-13_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   I understand the concerns raised by the noble Lords, Lord Hylton and Lord Smith of Clifton. I hope that my comments on the amendment will reassure them.
<P>

<a name="40119-13_para11"></a>The concern has been expressed that the proposed amendments to Clause 13 are drawn too widely. However, I think that the test is in fact quite a strict one. The noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, referred to the fact that the power can be used only if it appears to the Secretary of State that, in the interests of maintaining either security or good order in any prison in Northern Ireland, the prisoner should be transferred. However, transfer is not something that will be undertaken lightly. Each case will be considered on its individual merits. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, asked for a specific connection in relation to the prisoner. We are looking at each case being considered on its individual merits by the Secretary of State or, in his absence, by a Minister. Transfer will be directed only as a last resort after all other methods of dealing with the threat posed to security or good order have been considered.
<P>

<a name="40119-13_para12"></a>The transfer power is required for the protection and safety of prison staff and other prisoners. The amendment would seriously reduce the effectiveness of the power and would mean that action could not be taken until there had been serious misconduct by a prisoner or until he was at risk of harm and consented to the transfer. It is important that where the Secretary of State has credible information that a prisoner is planning any action which will pose a threat to security or good order of a prison he can act to protect the lives of prison staff and other prisoners. The making of a transfer order might be an appropriate and proportionate response in extreme cases. If this amendment is accepted, such pre-emptive action could not be taken.
<P>

<a name="40119-13_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, spoke about the case where a prisoner agrees to a transfer. Where a prisoner consents to transfer this can be effected under the <P>


<a name="column_882"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 882</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>existing provisions of the Crime (Sentences) Act. Therefore, the Government take the view that the part of the amendment dealing with transfer with the consent of the prisoner is unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="40119-13_para14"></a>The new power set out in this clause is part of a package of measures required for the protection of prison staff and other prisoners and to prevent slippage from the new separated regime into full Maze style segregation. I believe that concern has been expressed. This amendment would seriously reduce the effectiveness of the provision and I ask the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, to withdraw it.

<a name="40119-13_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: I believe that this amendment is straightforward. It simply opens up the possibility for the Secretary of State to transfer prisoners to Scotland in addition to England and Wales. If one looks at this matter from the point of view of the families of the prisoner, it is almost certainly very much easier for them to visit across the water in southern or central Scotland as compared with the long and complicated journeys that are frequently necessary when travelling from Northern Ireland to England.
<P>

<a name="40119-13_para18"></a>In the nature of things, this amendment, if approved, would be likely only to deal in a more humanitarian way with a very small number of prisoners. The noble Baroness the Leader of the House said when replying on Second Reading that,

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   On this occasion I cannot support the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. The amendment would allow the Secretary of State to transfer a prisoner to a gaol in Scotland as well as to one in England and Wales. I am a little concerned about the amendment as Scotland also has a sectarian problem whereas Wales, so far as I know, does not.
<P>

<a name="40119-13_para20"></a>The noble Lord touched upon the devolution issue. I am not sure that the measure would work as justice matters are devolved to Scotland but not to Wales. I do not know whether the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would have the ability to transfer a prisoner to Scotland without the agreement of his opposite number in the Scottish Parliament. I believe that that adds a further complication, but primarily <P>


<a name="column_883"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 883</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>my concern is that the sectarian problem, although, thankfully, not as bad as in Northern Ireland, is nevertheless still present in Scotland. Therefore, I believe that it would not be conducive to the well-being of transferred prisoners if they were transferred to Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-13_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   This matter was raised at Second Reading by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and by the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, who is not present. The noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, is quite right. Prisons and prison transfers fall into the devolved field. Therefore, before the Westminster Parliament can legislate in that regard, the consent of the Scottish Parliament must be obtained by way of a Sewel Motion. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said he did not think it would be beyond the bounds of possibility that the Government could ensure that that happened. A Sewel Motion is being considered. If it is approved by the Scottish Parliament, the Government will bring forward an amendment to provide for compulsory transfer to Scotland as well as to England and Wales. In the light of that, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, feels able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40119-14_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: To some extent this amendment concerns the same topic. It is intended to probe some of the practicalities of a transfer order made under Clause 13. What we are concerned with here are any potential discrepancies between the length of the sentence a prisoner serves due to his transfer from Northern Ireland to England or Wales. Which jurisdiction is responsible, for example, in determining the release date of the prisoner? We are thinking in particular about early release or parole and the issues of good behaviour and misconduct. Will the noble Baroness the Lord President of the Council tell us whether the decision will be for the Northern Ireland system or the English/Welsh system to decide?
<P>

<a name="40119-14_para3"></a>Our amendment attempts to clarify this issue. As we have already discussed in earlier debates on this clause, transfer is envisaged as a consequence of misconduct. In such circumstances we think it right that the prisoner's release date remains as that which was originally set by the Northern Ireland jurisdiction when the sentence was imposed with one exception: that is, where the release date is later than that which <P>


<a name="column_884"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 884</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was first set due to the misconduct or bad behaviour of the prisoner. In those circumstances the English/Welsh prison in question may exercise its own disciplinary rules to delay the prisoner's release. The benefit of the amendment is to make clear that there would be no advantage to a prisoner in terms of release date if he were to be transferred. I beg to move.

<P>

<a name="40119-14_para4"></a>I can understand that the Committee wants to be clear that prisoners will not benefit from any transfer. I can assure your Lordships that any transfer under the new power will be on a restricted basis and the prisoner's release date will be determined according to the laws of Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40119-14_para5"></a>The need for the prisoner to remain in England and Wales will be reviewed on a regular basis and he or she will be returned to Northern Ireland as soon as it is assessed that his or her transfer is no longer necessary in the interests of maintaining security or good order in any prison in Northern Ireland. It is highly unlikely that any prisoner will be released while still held in a prison in England and Wales, because of the regular review and assessment.
<P>

<a name="40119-14_para6"></a>At present there no provision to delay the release of a prisoner in Northern Ireland because of his misconduct. Noble Lords may be aware that the Prison and Young Offenders Centre (Amendment) Rules (Northern Ireland) 2004 were laid before the House on 9 January 2004. They seek such a power in respect of breaches of prison discipline by separated prisoners only. If that power comes into force I can assure your Lordships that any transferred prisoner awarded loss of remission would have to serve out the period of that award before his or her release. Any prisoner transferred to England and Wales on a restricted basis remains subject to the law of Northern Ireland in relation to the loss of remission.
<P>

<a name="40119-14_para7"></a>The intention behind the amendment will be achieved as a consequence of our policy decision that all transfers will be restricted. I ask the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Glentoran </B>   moved Amendment No. 63:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 10, line 6, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-14_para13"></a><P>

"( ) Any order under subsection (1) bringing into force any of sections 1 to 5 shall not be made before the end of the period of 12 months beginning from the date on which this Act achieves Royal Assent."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40119-14_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is one of the main contentions that we have with the Bill. I shall not make another Second Reading speech, but inevitably I will go over some ground that we have covered before. The amendment proposes a sunrise provision which would delay the commencement of Clauses 1 to 5 for 12 months after Royal Assent. Throughout our discussions, both at Second Reading and in Committee, we have heard concern from all sides of the House about the timing of the Bill. We firmly believe that no changes should be made to judicial appointments for Northern Ireland before we have seen the Bill that brings forward legislation to tackle the same issues in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40119-14_para15"></a>The main Bill should be considered before this Bill and, therefore, we have asked for a 12-month delay in commencement. Our fear is that if this Bill is pushed through hastily and without due thought we will need in 2005 a third justice Bill relating to Northern Ireland. It would be a farcical situation. I remind the House that the previous occasion was in 2002&#151;not long ago&#151;and the Police Bill before that was in 1998. There is already deep disillusionment about the changes made in this Bill which were emphasised when we discussed Clauses 4 and 5.
<P>

<a name="40119-14_para16"></a>First, Clause 5 cannot come into effect because the Assembly is still suspended; so we currently have no First and Deputy First Ministers to give recommendations to the Prime Minister about appointments to the position of the Lord Chief Justice and the Lords Justices of Appeal. Secondly, Clause 5 takes away the right of veto of the Lord Chief Justice even though when the 2002 Act was being discussed, the Government claimed that they were happy with such a veto. The fear is that we will have a new Justice (Northern Ireland) Bill every year, because the Government change their minds every year with each new Criminal Justice Review and kowtows to pressures from certain political parties.
<P>

<a name="40119-14_para17"></a>The timing of the changes on judicial appointments are fundamentally wrong, due to the impending constitutional Bill with which we will be faced later in the year and the current suspension of the Assembly. <P>


<a name="column_886"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 886</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Now is not the time to destabilise the system by five clauses that would fundamentally undermine the current impartial system of judicial appointments in Northern Ireland. We see nothing but trouble as a consequence and the politicisation of the judicial appointments system which, we believe, will ensue. Clauses 1 to 5 are not needed. They will only negate and ruin a good and successful judicial system. There is no rhyme or reason, sense or logic in why the Government should have the clauses passed now. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-14_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   I hope what I have to say will reassure the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. In our earlier debates on the Bill we dealt with two of his specific comments&#151;on undermining the impartiality of the system in Northern Ireland and the politicisation of the system. The Government made it absolutely clear that it is their intention to maintain the impartiality and independence of the judicial system in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40119-14_para18"></a>Regarding the practicality of the amendment, Clauses 1 and 2 relate to the Judicial Appointments Commission. The practical steps to create a commission will necessarily take a little time and we will want to work in consultation with stakeholders. Our aim is to have the commission in place by spring 2005.
<P>

<a name="40119-14_para19"></a>Regarding the debate on a constitutional reform Bill, we expect some overlap between discussion of this Bill, which will have to go to the other place, and the constitutional reform Bill, which we expect to be introduced to the House quite soon. If it proves possible to have the Judicial Appointments Commission in place by spring 2005 we see no reason why the establishment of the commission and the start of its work should be delayed. I hope the fact that we expect some overlap between the two Bills will help the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="40119-14_para20"></a>Clauses 4 and 5, which amend provisions in the 2002 Act and are linked to senior judicial appointments and removals from listed judicial offices respectively, come into effect only after the devolution of criminal justice. I hope that my clarification will help the noble Lord and that he will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40119-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I thank the Minister for those explanations. First, I believe that the Government have got it wrong in relation to impartiality and politicisation and I will take a great deal of persuading otherwise. There is no way that Clauses 1 to 3 will improve that. They will open all kinds of doors, as will be seen in the next five years, to both impartiality and politicisation becoming apparent.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para0"></a>I am happy to hear that there will be an overlap between the passage of the constitutional reform Bill and the completion of this Bill. I hope that in practice, should things change during the progress of the constitutional reform Bill, we will be able to implant the changes into this Bill. I am looking for that because it would be a sound and more comfortable basis on which to go forward.

<A NAME="40119-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham </B>   rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 18 December 2003 be approved [4th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move that the draft Industrial Training Levy (Construction Board) Order 2004 be approved and, with the leave of the House, I shall speak also to the draft Industrial Training Levy (Engineering Construction Board) Order 2004.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para12"></a>The proposals before the House seek authority for the Construction Industry Training Board and the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board to impose a levy on employers in the industries they cover.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para13"></a>Industrial training boards&#151;or ITBs as we know them&#151;are non-departmental public bodies that operate under the provisions of the Industrial Training Act 1982. Their role is to ensure that the quantity and quality of training are adequate to meet the needs of the industries for which they are established.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para14"></a>They provide a wide range of services, including setting occupational standards and developing vocational qualifications, delivering modern apprenticeships and paying direct grants to employers who carry out training to approved standards.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para15"></a>The Act contains provision for a levy on employers to finance an ITB's activities and to share the costs of training more evenly between companies in an industry. It is for the employer members of a board to make proposals for the rate of levy for the industry it covers and for the Secretary of State to make an order giving effect to the proposals.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para16"></a>The order before the House would give effect to proposals submitted to the CITB and the ECITB for their 2004 levy. Each proposal involves the imposition of a levy in excess of 1 per cent of payroll on some classes of employer. The Industrial Training Act 1982 <P>


<a name="column_888"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 888</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>requires such orders to be approved by affirmative resolution of both Houses. In each case, the levies are based on employers' payrolls and net payments for sub-contract labour.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para17"></a>For both boards, the proposals involve levy rates in excess of 0.2 per cent with no exemption other than for small firms. In such cases, a levy order can be made only if the proposals are necessary to encourage training in the industry and that one of three conditions is satisfied.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para18"></a>The first condition is that proposals have the support of organisations representing more than half the employers who together are likely to pay the majority of the levy. The CITB proposals meet that first condition.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para19"></a>The engineering construction proposals are supported by the industry's employer organisations. However, currently those organisations represent fewer than half the employers, although together those employers are likely to pay the vast majority of the levy. The first condition in this case, therefore, has not been fully met. In this case, an order can be made only if one of the other two conditions is satisfied.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para20"></a>The second condition is that the order is made less than two years after the making of the former levy order giving effect to proposals in respect of which the first condition was satisfied. An order was made in 2003 that had the support of the employer associations representing more than half the employers. Those employers also paid the majority of the levy. This means that for the current proposals, the second condition is satisfied.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para21"></a>The Act requires ITBs to exclude small firms from the levy, but it does not set the minimum size threshold. Each of these proposals contains an exclusion provision that the industry considers to be appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para22"></a>In the order before your Lordships, the CITB proposes that both its levy rates should stay the same as those approved by the House last year; that is, 0.5 per cent of payroll for direct employees and 1.5 per cent of net expenditure on sub-contract labour. Employers whose combined payroll and net expenditure on sub-contract labour is less than £61,000 will not have to pay the levy. That equates to an employer who employs three people full-time throughout the year. It is estimated that the exemption will effect about 60 per cent of employers.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para23"></a>There is a higher levy rate on sub-contract labour because, according to the industry, the vast majority of training is carried out by those employers with a directly employed labour force. Employers who opt to use sub-contract labour tend to have a transitory arrangement with their sub-contractors and are not normally involved in their training.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para24"></a>The ECITB proposes to impose the same rate as last year on site contractors; that is, 1.5 per cent of total payroll and net expenditure on sub-contract labour. Contractors whose combined payroll and net expenditure on sub-contract labour is £75,000 or less will not have to pay the levy. This equates to an <P>


<a name="column_889"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 889</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>employer who employs four to five people full-time throughout the year. It is estimated that the provision will exempt 37 per cent of the sites.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para25"></a>This year, however, there will be no levy on head offices. This is in response to recommendations from the board's recent quinquennial review and its own strategy review, which was carried out by external consultants. Both reviews recommended that, for the short term, the board should focus its activities at craft, supervisory and first-line management levels. These are currently the areas of greatest skills shortage. The proposals are expected to raise for the CITB between £116 million and £120 million and for the ECITB £8 million to £9 million.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para26"></a>Your Lordships will know from our annual debates that the CITB and the ECITB exist because of wide support from employers and employer interest groups in these sectors. There is a firm belief that without them there would be a serious deterioration of training in these cyclical, peripatetic and project-based industries, leading to a real fear that their skill needs would not be met. That was again confirmed by the recent reviews of both boards, carried out by the Department for Education and Skills last year. The reviews found that the principle of the levy is still strongly supported in each industry. They recommended that CITB and the ECITB should continue to act as statutory industrial training boards with levy-raising powers.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para27"></a>The draft orders will enable the two boards to carry out their vital training responsibilities in 2004, and I believe that it is right that the House should agree to approve them. I commend the order to the House.

<P>
<A NAME="40119-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for outlining the measures in the orders. I understand that there is a general acceptance within the construction industry of the work done by industrial training boards and, as a consequence, there are no significant objections to the levy charged. We agree that boards are necessary because of the nature of the industry. Left to themselves employers are reluctant to take on the significant burden of training their employees. Therefore, in order for there to be a well trained workforce, the costs of training must be met collectively.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para28"></a>I am pleased to hear that the boards do a good job  setting standards, developing qualifications, facilitating modern apprenticeships and paying grants to employers. Today I have received a letter from CITB Construction Skills which says that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in 2002 for every £1 of levy received, 93p was paid out directly in training grants, allowances and college fees, and the industry received £1.61 in total benefits, payable from the total income from CITB-Construction Skills and not just the levy".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-15_para29"></a>
That is indeed worthy of congratulation.
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para30"></a>Small businesses are exempt from paying the levy, and the orders set out the maximum net expenditure on subcontract labour possible for a firm before it has to pay the levy. It is obviously important to get the amount right. Too high or too low would have a <P>


<a name="column_890"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 890</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>negative impact and distort the market. On the figures of £75,000 and £61,000, I ask the Minister whether there is consensus on this issue. In addition, is the issue of a firm falling within the remit of the two industrial training boards a contentious subject? What consultation has the Minister had with the industry or any part of it in the past year regarding a possible change in the definition of a firm covered by the order?
<P>

<a name="40119-15_para31"></a>I would also like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister about the progress of sector skills councils, of which one, out of only four that have been fully licensed so far, is for construction. Can he reassure the House that the progress made over the past year represents value for money, given the fact that £12 million has been paid out of public funds for all sector skills councils, and the chairman is quoted as saying&#151;this is a little unnerving&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we have the power because we have this big budget"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-15_para32"></a><P>

<a name="40119-15_para33"></a>The benefits that training brings to the economy and to the country in general is hard to underestimate and any measure that serves to enhance the number and quality of skilled workers must be welcomed. However, it is essential to keep an eye on the benefits that industrial training boards bring to the construction industry because we must avoid the levy becoming yet another tax on business. For the mean time, I am satisfied that the benefits are significant. They will justify the levy charged and, as a consequence, I will not be resisting the orders.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-16_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for introducing the two orders which come up regularly at this time of year. From these Benches we regularly welcome them. Both the Construction Industry Training Board and the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board represent what, in our eyes, is in many senses an ideal situation. The levy imposed is voluntary and it has the support of all sides of the industry. It enables the cost of training to be spread evenly across the industry with the exception of very small firms, whose turnover is, as the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, identified, respectively £75,000 and £61,000.
<P>

<a name="40119-16_para0"></a>Revenues obtained from the levy are used by the industry to provide a wide range of training. I particularly welcome initiatives that have been taking place within the industry to make employment in the industry contingent on all employees meeting minimum standards of training and commitment on the part of the major employers to ensure that that is so and to ensure that all employees are offered opportunities to upgrade their qualifications when appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40119-16_para1"></a>It seems to me that the differential levy on direct and subcontract labour, which has been a source of some contention within the industry, is justified. Within the industry there are the continuing problems of the cowboys who pay nothing for training and poach from others who have contributed to training. The great advantage of the levy is that it limits the degree of poaching; it limits the free-riders in the industry.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40119-16_para2"></a>I have very few questions because we have seen such orders on previous occasions. However, I would like to ask about the progress of sector skills councils. The construction industry is an area where we have seen a sector skills council established but it would be interesting to know whether other sector skills councils are in the wings waiting to be launched and how far progress is being made. I also wonder whether any other sector is showing an inclination to have an industrial training levy along the same lines. It is within the ambit of the Employment Act that was enacted some two years ago. It was left to each of the sector skills areas to decide whether they wished to go for a levy grant system of this kind. I wonder whether any other sectors are interested in moving in that direction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful for the response of both noble Baronesses who have spoken in this short debate. As they have both indicated, we have been here before. Exceptionally, this year there is no change to the levy. We feel that we are going over well tilled ground. None the less, it is essential as the levies are subject to the affirmative procedure and, therefore, we are duty bound to consider them with all the seriousness that we bring to such debates.
<P>

<a name="40119-16_para3"></a>I am extremely grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, for the figure of 93p in the pound. It was not contained in my notes. I have various measures of value for money, as I believe that we hold these boards in high regard for the work that they carry out, but I cannot think of a more graphic illustration than that given by the noble Baroness. I am grateful for it. I have no doubt that, if I am in the privileged position of addressing these issues again at the Dispatch Box, I shall keep an eye on that figure&#151;an excellent measure.
<P>

<a name="40119-16_para4"></a>The exemption criteria for small firms is not government-imposed. The industry itself brings forward a proposal for the cut-off point for levies. Therefore, it is the industry that has produced the figures of £75,000 for employers with about four employees and about £61,000 for employers with three employees. The noble Baroness asked whether there was consensus on that and the answer is that there is. As to whether everyone would agree with that, I can think of some on the margin who would clearly not agree. As with any other concept of this kind, there is bound to be fairly lively debate on the margin. However, this exemption formula has held for a number of years and has been considered to be representative of what the industry expects.
<P>

<a name="40119-16_para5"></a>With regard to sector skills councils, we have made considerable progress. It will be recognised that the Construction Industry Training Board was the first to get off the ground. We know the reasons for that. We know the way in which the industry is organised and how its specific skill needs have to be met from within the industry. That is one reason that the industry has a training board when so many other industries do not.
<P>

<a name="40119-16_para6"></a>On the question of what wider progress has been made, 10 sector skills centres have been established. We are on course for the majority of them, if not all, <P>


<a name="column_892"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 892</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be set up by the summer of this year. Therefore, considerable progress has been made in that respect, although it has not happened as rapidly as we might have liked. As soon as one sees one such skills centre in operation, one always thinks that everyone else is being a little tardy in getting on board. Nevertheless, within the realistic expectation that they would all be up and running this year, we are just approaching the half-way stage in terms of the numbers established and we are confident that we shall meet the target over the course of this year, as was the original expectation.
<P>

<a name="40119-16_para7"></a>I am grateful that the two boards receive the plaudits that they do. They carry out very valuable work. It is not surprising that the CITB is a trail-blazer in terms of the sector skills proposals. If our whole industrial life were organised to the patterns of these two bodies, I believe we should feel a good deal more optimistic about the general skills levels in our society. However, we also know the needs of these two areas and why they match up in such an excellent way. Therefore, I am grateful for the support expressed in the contributory speeches today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-16_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord concludes, I want to point out that there is a real concern among larger employers about the lack of training by small employers in the industry. Clearly such training must be carried out at a local level. However, these days, many small employers do not take on apprentices in the way that they used to do, and it is being left largely to the larger employers to do so. One reason for that is the sheer bureaucracy and the amount of paperwork involved in having apprentices. I believe it should be placed on the record that there is considerable worry in the industry about the lack of training by small employers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I accept what the noble Baroness says. She is well experienced in this area. This is one of the perennial debates that take place in any organisation. The larger employers usually blaze the trail for all the obvious reasons. However, the noble Baroness is right to call attention to the fact that all employers need to be alert to the fact that, without investment in their workforce and without the necessary training, they will render themselves vulnerable in the rapidly changing industrial and economic environment that we all face. We all know that we compare ill with many other advanced countries in relation to skill levels. Of course, the Government must take responsibility for their role in these issues. That is why it is an important priority for this Administration. However, it is also the case that employers in other countries are often far more committed to the concept of training than is the case here.
<P>

<a name="40119-16_para8"></a>I hear what the noble Baroness says about bureaucracy. Form-filling is irritating but I believe that, if it leads to effective training, it is both necessary and something to be desired. I am sometimes conscious of the fact that upbraiding bureaucracy is an easy way to shelve one's responsibilities, and I believe that that has been the case in certain areas of training. <P>


<a name="column_893"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column 893</B></P>

[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Ampthill) in the Chair.]



<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-16_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Ampthill): </B>  Before we begin the proceedings on the Bill I should mention two matters. First, all the faces before me are familiar with the procedures and I do not believe that it is necessary for me to read out the spiel about how we conduct ourselves in the Committee. Does anyone disagree with that? It would appear not.
<P>

<a name="40119-16_para21"></a>Before we get under way, I am told that there will be an informal discussion about the timing of the later stages of consideration of the Bill. This is innovative but it is in order, provided that no one attempts to move any Motion or divide the Committee. I therefore invite the Minister to launch this informal discussion, in which I shall play no part unless there is any violence.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-17_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  I should like to say a few words about the publication of the consultation document, Compensation and Support for Victims of Crime. I know that this issue was raised in the House when my noble friend Lord Bassam moved the order of consideration of the Bill on my behalf. Although I said on Second Reading that that would be published in the new year, I did not explicitly link any possible legislation to the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill. That was because at the time of Second Reading the date of publication was not clear and, as a consequence, it was not known whether the timetable for consultation would allow amendments to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para0"></a>In accordance with my usual practice, I should have liked to contact those with an interest in the Bill to inform them of the position in relation to the consultation paper. I realise that that was not done and I apologise unreservedly for that. I know that members of the Committee take a keen interest in such matters&#151;including those who are involved in support to victims and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority and its predecessors&#151;and I shall be more than happy to provide more detail and to discuss the proposals set out in the paper, should the Committee want me to do so.
<P>


<a name="column_GC192"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC192</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para1"></a>We are committed to a full and open consultation. At this stage, three areas require legislation. The first is the surcharge on fixed penalty notices for criminal offences and any fine, community or custodial sentence. The revenue recovered would be paid into the victims fund to provide support and services to victims of crime. That would fall within the territory currently covered by Part 2 of the Bill. The other two areas fall within Part 3. Those include transferring the liability to pay compensation to those criminally injured in the course of duty to the employer and giving the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority a right to recover what it has paid in compensation from an offender. However, we need to come to a view as to whether we choose to pursue those proposals and in what form, following the consultation process.
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para2"></a>I am grateful to the Committee for sparing the time for me to make that brief statement. I very much look forward to working with the Committee on the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. I had given her notice that I intended to raise this matter and she has been kind enough to write me a letter today setting out what she has just said.
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para3"></a>However, with respect, the issue goes further than that. Let me give the date order in which events occurred. On 23 October, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, wrote to me about a question I raised in debate on the Criminal Justice Bill&#151;whether a consultation paper on compensation for victims was under consideration. He said that it was and that it would be published in the next two months. The document was duly published in January&#151;not quite within two months.
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para4"></a>In the mean time, as the Minister said, the Second Reading of the Bill took place. During Second Reading, she mentioned that a Bill would be published but she did not at that stage refer to any legislation. In January, the consultation paper was published. That consultation states in terms that comments are invited:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Please respond to this consultation paper by 29th March 2004".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-17_para5"></a>
That seems reasonable and certainly no longer than one would expect on a major paper out for consultation. Immediately above, it states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subject to the outcome of this consultation exercise"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-17_para6"></a>
that is, the consultation to be completed by 29 March&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we propose to legislate to make the changes where necessary through amendments to the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill. We hope that this Bill will be enacted by the Summer 2004".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-17_para7"></a>
The Government are saying, therefore, that they do not expect consultation to be completed before 29 March. At that point, if they wish to make legislative changes, they will make them in a Bill which had its Second Reading in the December of the previous year and, should it be the wish of the Committee, should start its Grand Committee stage today.
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para8"></a>Needless to say, my noble friend Lady Anelay took up this matter on the Floor of the House, inquiring into the position and asking when amendments were to <P>


<a name="column_GC193"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC193</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be inserted into the Bill, which was the subject of a Motion relating to consideration in this Committee. She asked the Minister to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"give an assurance to the House that the Bill will not leave Grand Committee until those amendments have been tabled and noble Lords have been able to give full consideration to them".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-17_para9"></a>
My noble friend then said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If he is unable to do that, can he give the House an assurance that the new clauses will be considered by way of recommitment when the matter returns to this House after consideration by the Commons?".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-17_para10"></a>
The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, replied to my noble friend but, with great respect, he said absolutely nothing. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I cannot give commitments from the Dispatch Box today about recommitment and such issues. However, I can tell your Lordships that there will be ample time for consultation".&#151;[Official Report, 13/1/04; cols. 469-470.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-17_para11"></a>
However, it is not the time allowed for consultation which concerns us; we know that that is set out in the Green Paper. Rather it is the time allowed for consideration and discussion of any matters that may arise out of the consultation.
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para12"></a>The Minister, with her normal courteousness, has written to me about this, stating that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"At this stage it is difficult to be precise about the number of clauses"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-17_para13"></a>
that is, the number of clauses that will need to be added to the Bill as a result of amendments arising from the consultation&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"given that there are still some policy details to be worked through in light of any consultation responses. We are committed to a full and open consultation process. We will aim to legislate quickly where we can. However, should the consultation process bring new issues and complexities to light, we may have to take longer in policy development and consequently may not be able to amend this Bill".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-17_para14"></a>
In other words, the noble Baroness is rightly leaving the way open in case the Government have to introduce a completely different Bill.
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para15"></a>The Minister mentioned three of the matters that the consultation raises. Two of them are highly controversial. One is the intention that those who speed in motor cars should pay a surcharge into a fund that is to compensate the victims of crimes of violence, although they have had nothing to do with a crime of violence. In other words, what is at the moment coming out of general taxation is instead to be taken on by the individual motorist. Equally importantly, and equally controversially, and far more wide in the Bill, it is intended that anyone who is injured in the course of their work as the result of a criminal offence should be compensated not from general taxation but by the employer by way of insurance.
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para16"></a>A large proportion of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1995 deals with injuries caused to someone in the course of employment. I am talking not only about policemen and nurses, but anyone working in a shop or a restaurant. If a fight takes place and they are injured, they are in the course of their employment and therefore it is said that the employer should insure against that. I do not want to get into the merits of <P>


<a name="column_GC194"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC194</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those changes. They will be controversial, and they desire and require full consideration by this House before they are turned into law.
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para17"></a>Therefore, with great respect to the Minister, we are all entitled to know the intention of the Government before we start on any stage of the Bill. Is it their intention at this moment that major new clauses are to be added? In the normal turn of events, starting in Grand Committee on 19 January and ending on 9 February, the Bill would have been long though the Lords before the consultation period ended on the other paper. Is it the Government's intention that those amendments are to be introduced into the Commons, with the Lords merely limited to the consideration of Commons amendments? Is it intended to re-commit to a Committee the clauses that have been added? With respect, we are entitled to know.
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para18"></a>I appreciate that I will not be able to move any Motion, or invite a Division in the Committee, as both of those would be out of order. We are allowed, if everyone wished, to adjourn the Committee stage of the Bill until it is clear what will happen. If necessary, we could delay the start of the Committee stage of the Bill, so that we can be sure that the Bill will still be before the Lords when any major changes are made to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I ought to speak briefly to put the position of the Front Bench on this side. As a Front-Bencher, I am bound by decisions of the usual channels. That does not mean that in any way I fail to support the objectives and the principled intent of my noble friend. I am aware that an agreement has been made that the Committee stage will begin today&#151;of course I support that.
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para19"></a>As my noble friend has pointed out, however, the Minister properly referred at Second Reading to the fact that there would be consultation and legislation on the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority and other matters. At that stage, it never occurred to me, not for one second, that the Government's plan was to go out to consultation at the beginning of this year and to do so in such a way that it would be impossible for this House to consider those clauses properly, should they be brought forward in the normal procedure.
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para20"></a>Indeed, had any of us at that stage on 15 December had a modicum of suspicion that that was the Government's intention, it may well be that usual channels would have thought hard before agreeing to a Committee starting on this day. However, we are where we are. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, for his response last week that he would refer the matter back to the usual channels. I understand that discussions are afoot as to how the House may properly consider any clauses brought forward by the Government. One would of course hope that we would follow the best practice pointed out by my noble friend, or at the very least the next best practice, which would be that we would not start Third Reading until we had a re-commitment on the new clauses.
<P>


<a name="column_GC195"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC195</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para21"></a>The Minister wrote a very courteous letter to us dated 16 January, for which I am most grateful, in which she invited us to a meeting to discuss the possibilities of the new proposals. I wish to be the first to welcome that and to say that I would be delighted if such a meeting could take place, as it would be most constructive. However, like my noble friend, I am dismayed by the penultimate paragraph. It looks as though the Government are at sea about what might be the outcome. One can applaud that in one respect, because it means that they are thinking and listening to consultation when it is completed. On the other hand, in the context of a Bill that is starting in Committee today, one is dismayed because one does not know quite what will happen to it and what contribution this House will make.
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para22"></a>I am also advised that it would be proper for me at this stage to make a brief comment on another matter, of which I have given notice to the Home Office officials and the noble Baroness's office. It is the amendments on Northern Ireland that were produced last week and were in print on Friday. I was kindly approached by the Home Office, by fax, the day before with draft copies of those amendments. As the Government are producing proposals for the devolved legislature in Northern Ireland on matters in Clauses 4 and 5 that are highly controversial, our view was that we could not in all honesty say that those amendments should be agreed in Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para23"></a>Noble Lords are old hands at Grand Committee; they will know that any amendment may be made only by agreement of every Peer present. Although I am not necessarily hostile to the ultimate adoption of those amendments, I will not be able to agree to them being made in Grand Committee. However, I expect to listen very carefully to the government argument and have a full debate on them. From today, I shall also start to contact organisations in Northern Ireland&#151;they may have been consulted by the Northern Ireland Office, but we do not know that yet&#151;to take proper soundings so that we may then properly decide whether, at a later stage, we will need to amend the government amendments when they are tabled again on Report.
<P>

<a name="40119-17_para24"></a>I am indicating a procedure. Last Wednesday, I immediately phoned the Home Office to give it advance warning. I also gave the Liberal Democrats' Whips office notice. We will not hold up the ultimate delivery of the Government's provisions, but that procedure will enable the Opposition to give them proper consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   This is my maiden speech in a Grand Committee. I am not therefore experienced about such a Committee's procedures. However, I spent a good deal of time involved as part of the usual channels' discussions with the late Leader of the House, Lord Williams of Mostyn, about the concession&#151;and it was a concession&#151;of allowing Bills to come to Grand Committee to facilitate government work. It is my clear recollection that the experiment was based on the fact that the Government would not play fast and <P>


<a name="column_GC196"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC196</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>loose with a piece of legislation once the House had decided that it was suitable for consideration in Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para0"></a>Without the forensic persuasiveness of the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, I put it to the Minister very bluntly that that is exactly what the Government are doing. I give her fair warning that, if the Government conveniently reshape Bills in Grand Committee, they will bring Grand Committee procedure into disrepute and will find that they make the opposition parties very reluctant to go down that road. Therefore, although I shall not go into the noble Lord's points about the nature of the proposals, they have major implications not simply for domestic violence&#151;the point of the Bill&#151;but for fines, compensation and terms of employment. I give notice that we shall consider the urgency of the whole of Part 3 if it is to contain such provisions.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para1"></a>The problem is that the Government always feel that they can put opposition parties on the back foot when they produce measures that, like the curate's egg, are good in parts. When we point out the bad additions, they say, "Ah ha! You are trying to prevent the good parts coming into law". That is not true, but there is a substantial point of principle that we are unwilling to let pass. I associate myself with the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, about the Northern Ireland provisions&#151;also suddenly spatchcocked into the Bill in an arbitrary manner.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para2"></a>I hope that the Minister takes to heart the fact that the complaints of the opposition parties are extremely justified. If we were on the Floor of the House, I should have been willing to have followed the noble Lord, Lord, Carlisle, into the Lobby on this point of principle.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   Can I briefly support&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-18_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  I am not trying to curtail discussion more than I think necessary, but now we have heard from the opposition parties, it would be better if we were to hear from the Minister, not let everyone around the table have his go.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I have of course listened carefully to all that has been said. In response to some of the comments, I say gently that of course in an ideal world no government would ever amend a Bill after introduction, save in response to parliamentary scrutiny or real world events. In reality, however, we know that governments of all complexions do so from time to time. In this case, the Committee had the advantage of knowing what might be coming.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para3"></a>As I said, there is genuine consultation. I hear what the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said about that. We are firm in our view of what should occur, but we are not so arrogant that we think that we are the fount of all wisdom and that consultation is therefore not merited or that we should not listen carefully.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para4"></a>I hope that I have been frank enough to make clear that if, through the consultation, we feel that the timing is not right and does not elide with the Bill's provisions, we shall have to reconsider. I know that the <P>


<a name="column_GC197"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC197</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Committee is anxious about the whole issue of what we do to help and support victims and witnesses. The Bill is entirely directed to helping them. I am confident that the Committee would want us to take all appropriate opportunities to give them the support that they need.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para5"></a>When my noble friend Lord Bassam responded about consultation, he was talking about consultation through the usual channels, as opposed to the Home Office's consultation on the policy. Through the usual channels, there will be appropriate consultation, as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para6"></a>I tried in my outline&#151;the few remarks I made before we started this short debate&#151;to describe the nature and extent of the amendments that we think may be appropriate. Of course I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, said about the controversial nature of the provisions. That depends on the form of the consultation and whether we iron out those controversies.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para7"></a>The noble Lord said much about speeding and the inappropriateness of allowing all those who break the law to participate. The Government's proposal is that all offenders should pay into the fund for all victims. There is a great deal of concern that the victims of road traffic incidents should not be put into another category. I read a letter in the Guardian from Mr Graham Durbin, and I thought that it was very helpful. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Could the government's plans to surcharge . . . motorists be thwarted by a campaign of mass civil obedience, in which drivers refuse to break the law?".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-18_para8"></a>
I would certainly concur with that view.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para9"></a>These issues will take some time. I did not know specifically about the Northern Ireland issues that the noble Baroness mentioned, but, I am sure that she told my officials. I am most content to debate the matter in Committee, and the noble Baroness will be able to come back on Report and take whatever stance she deems appropriate. In no way will I construe that as meaning that she has acceded to the provisions. I think she will find that the Northern Ireland provisions are proper and do not excite much concern, but she will, of course, need time to consider the matter.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para10"></a>I hear what the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said about playing fast and loose with the Committee. None of us engaged in the process has ever attempted to play fast and loose. The Committee process has been extremely useful, and I assure the noble Lord that we do not seek to do anything in Committee that we would not do on the Floor of the House.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para11"></a>With that, I hope that noble Lords will join me in starting to discuss what is one of the most longed-for Bills for a long time. We have waited 30 years for it, and I invite the Committee not to wait a minute longer before we start discussing it.

<P>
<P>

<A NAME="40119-18_spmin1"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  We have had enough of this informal discussion. I am certain that many noble Lords have views that have not, perhaps, been expressed, but the main ground, in this <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>unprecedented situation, has been covered by those who have spoken. We should now get on with the Bill. The matters that have been discussed will, of course, all appear in Hansard tomorrow morning. They can be taken up through the usual channels or elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para12"></a>I am sorry, but I will not allow the noble Lord to prolong what has been a perfectly agreeable discussion between those who speak from the Front Bench for their respective parties. Therefore, I will not call the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-18_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Before Clause 1, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-18_para14"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "TRAINING
<br>
(1) No person mentioned in subsection (2) shall be required to carry out their functions in relation to matters covered by this Act unless that person has followed a course of training and development covering the matters dealt with in this Act.
<br>
(2) Subsection (1) applies to the following&#151;
<br>
(a) police officers;
<br>
(b) those involved in the conduct of domestic homicide reviews.
<br>
(3) A member of the judiciary may not carry out their functions in relation to matters covered by this Act unless that person has followed a course of training and development covering the matters dealt with in this Act." 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40119-18_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: The importance of the Bill is not reflected by its length or, at least&#151;as we have recently been debating&#151;its current length. As a precursor, I must say that the noble Baroness did not have advance notice of my intention with regard to Northern Ireland. As soon as I had received a courteous fax from her office on 15 January, I spoke to her private secretary by telephone, who, I know, is new in the job. I explained the procedure. I did not speak to the officials until we arrived today, and I am sorry that the message did not get through on an earlier occasion.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para16"></a>There are provisions in the Bill that break new legal ground in many respects and will involve statutory and voluntary organisations in their effective implementation. There are, of course, significant resource implications. The objective of my amendment is to draw attention to the importance of training for all those who will be involved in implementing the provisions of the Bill and to ask the Government to explain what steps they have already taken to ensure that there is the budget and the staff to do the training required.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para17"></a>So far the Government have only pointed us to what might happen in the future. A Written Answer by the Home Secretary in another place stated that the Inter-Ministerial Group on Domestic Violence will, over the next two years and beyond, oversee a programme of work and that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Among other things, we will be looking at education and tackling risk factors, improving the police and CPS handling of domestic violence cases".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 7/1/04; col. 416W].
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-18_para18"></a>
That is very welcome. I certainly congratulate the Government on that work and look forward to seeing the results of it.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para19"></a>However, I must point out that the Government also expect the Bill to be on the statute book by the summer. One hopes that its provisions will be in place in months and not years, unless of course there is a delay in bringing the Bill into force.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para20"></a>The Law Society pointed out that considerable funding will be required to implement the Government's proposals. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If, for example, injunctions are to be enforced by the police and criminal courts it is vital that there are sufficient funds available to ensure that there are adequate staff in both areas and that they are properly trained to deal with such offences".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-18_para21"></a><P>

<a name="40119-18_para22"></a>The Explanatory Notes state at paragraph 99 that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A full regulatory impact assessment is published with the Bill".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-18_para23"></a>
That was on 1 December. In fact the regulatory impact assessment is a bit of a Scarlet Pimpernel&#151;we seek him here, we seek him there, we seek him just about everywhere. The staff in the Printed Paper Office deserve a plaudit for retaining their patience with me as I went there almost every day to find out where it was. It was finally run to earth last week and I am grateful to the Home Office for e-mailing me an advance copy, which was very helpful.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para24"></a>The only direct reference to training that I can see is at page 7 in considering the costs and benefits of the Commissioner for Victims and Witnesses. Staff training has been put at £30,000, for what I assume is years two and three, but as I had only the draft copy at that stage it gave the figures for year two and was blank after that.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para25"></a>Much more training than that will be required as a result of the Bill. The importance of training for the police, judiciary, lawyers and voluntary organisations was highlighted at Second Reading by my noble friend Lady Seccombe, among others. It has certainly been of concern to several of the organisations that briefed noble Lords at Second Reading and beyond. For example, the Women's National Commission has issued a document Unlocking the Secret: Women Open the Door on Domestic Violence. In the executive summary it makes clear that there should be regular, mandatory training for all the front-line professionals as well as specialists&#151;the police, courts, social services, housing officers, health workers, teachers&#151;to recognise domestic violence and to know how to help. That was repeated by Women's Aid.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para26"></a>My amendment is very modest when compared to what other organisations require. I have narrowed down the training requirements to a limited number of people. I accept fully that other organisations outside the House would expect the training to be much wider.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para27"></a>Clauses 4 and 5 state that those subject to domestic violence could themselves be subject to prosecution unless there is a very careful settlement of the cases. I shall later be bringing forward amendments in that regard. But it will be very difficult to provide training for courts and professionals to deal with such cases. Clause 6, homicide reviews, is another area where training will be required.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para28"></a>At paragraph 29 of its briefing, Liberty states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We would welcome clarification of what training will be made available for those conducting such reviews".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-18_para29"></a><P>

<a name="40119-18_para30"></a>Clause 7 makes common assault an arrestable offence. That puts a huge responsibility on the police officer to determine whether to arrest a person. After all, it could be an accusation such as "He or she raised their fist to me just before you arrived". It places a <P>


<a name="column_GC201"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC201</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>huge responsibility on the officer to decide whether a common assault has taken place and whether they should arrest at that stage. Women's Aid states that training will be crucial if restraining orders are to be properly implemented.
<P>

<a name="40119-18_para31"></a>Many organisations have drawn attention to the need for training and my amendment gives the Government the opportunity to put on record their commitment to ensuring that the measures in the Bill will be implemented only after appropriate training has taken place. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40119-18_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I have a great deal of respect for the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, as she knows, but&#151;there is a big but&#151;whatever the merits of her proposals, it would not be appropriate to include any of them in the Bill. The matters may or may not be addressed in correspondence by my noble friend. It may be appropriate to discuss the noble Baroness's proposals. If she is saying that the matters should be dealt with in correspondence, she should at least make that very clear. But there is not a scintilla of evidence to support the view that any of the matters to which the noble Baroness has subscribed should be included in the Bill. What she has said is very important, but the Government have a duty to make the Bill workable&#151;in that regard, certain training may be necessary. I hope that, in outlining what the Government have in mind, my noble friend will subscribe to the view that none of the matters described so far should be included.

<P>
<A NAME="40119-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I shall take a little time on subsection (3), which reflects a recent judicial decision. While I am on my feet, I wish to tell the Committee, unless I am told that I may not do so, that I propose to report the Chairman's conduct to the Procedure Committee. His conduct was not within his power; it was a total abuse of power, as he had not heard what I had to say&#151;which had not been considered&#151;about the noble Baroness's comments. I shall not go into the matter; I shall deal with it before the Procedure Committee. I wished merely to point out that consultation between usual channels does not include myself or other Members of this Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   Would the noble Lord&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   Just a moment, please. I was ordered to sit down on pain of being told to leave the room. I have never been subjected to any such indignity by any chairman of any committee or by any Member on the Floor of the House. I make a firm protest that I shall continue to serve this Committee, to do my best, and not to retire as invited to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I, too, was rather surprised by the Chairman's attitude. I had assumed that the Grand Committee operated as the House does. I want to ensure that the Procedure Committee is clear on that. A very important principle is at stake: we take great <P>


<a name="column_GC202"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC202</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pride in being a self-regulating House, but if matters are referred to a Grand Committee where the Chairman apparently has powers greater than he would have on the Floor of the House, we have given away something rather more substantial than imagined initially. The matter should be looked at by the Procedure Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-19_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  This was an unprecedented occasion where an informal discussion was to take place. The proceedings had not formally opened; therefore, I had no particular authority to do what I have done. I do not regret what I did because I felt that it was important that we get on with the job of discussing Amendment No. 1. No increased authority has been given to me, just some advice from the Public Bill Office, and that is how I interpreted that advice. I am sorry if the noble Lord, Lord McNally, too, feels that that is a little severe for the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. For the third time, that is unprecedented leeway that I was invited to give to the Committee before the proceedings began. Now proceedings are under way. We are discussing training, about which the noble Lord did not feel inclined to talk. The matter is now closed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   Lord Chairman, it is closed here; let the Procedure Committee decide. I do not accept your explanation for one moment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   Perhaps I may seek a little assistance on Amendment No. 1. Subsection (3) of the amendment states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A member of the judiciary may not carry out their functions in relation to matters covered by this Act unless that person has followed a course of training and development covering the matters dealt with in this Act".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-19_para0"></a>
In a first-instance situation, that may be right. As regards appeals, might we find that the Court of Appeal, for instance, is divided into the trained and the untrained judiciary? That would be a novelty, to say the least.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-19_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   First, I apologise to the Minister for not being present during her opening remarks. I shall read them tomorrow in Hansard and wise myself up as to the various considerations that were taken on board. As regards Amendment No. 1, my knowledge of the courts is very restricted. I know a large number of magistrates, but, on the whole, I do not know judges in other courts except in an informal way.
<P>

<a name="40119-19_para1"></a>Magistrates faced with this Bill might undertake some training led by their clerks, who, I am sure, would draw their attention to any new and difficult issues, which, if the Bill goes through unamended, should be studied before cases come before them. There is nothing odd about that aspect. But, with my knowledge of the courts, I shall not contest what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, said because that would be idiotic.

<a name="40119-19_para2"></a>The phrase that caught my eye is in subsection (1) of the new clause. It states:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-19_para5"></a>
Who needs protection: is it the victim or the policeman?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-19_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I, too, apologise for not being here at the start. I lost the meeting, but now I have found it. I, too, have some anxieties about the amendment, although it is crucial that there is training. I declare an interest as a member of the new board of CAFCASS. I have considerable experience of courts in relation to children as witnesses, as well as within the domestic and criminal courts.
<P>

<a name="40119-19_para6"></a>It is clear that people will need training across the board, particularly in the voluntary sector where, often, they do not obtain training because they are marginalised by the Secretary of State from receiving any money. The Government often say that it should be shared, but I think that the noble Baroness knows that that does not always happen, despite encouragement.
<P>

<a name="40119-19_para7"></a>However, I should like assurance that if the details of training were not in the Bill, the guidance would certainly contain them. That is where this belongs and where the who and the how can be thought through in some detail. Here is a particularly complex group of people, and training will be different for the different groups.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-19_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   Perhaps I may make a very limited intervention on the case of judicial training. There always has been resistance among the judiciary to suggestions that it should be trained. Lord Devlin himself took the point that judges do not need training. That is an out-of-date concept. Judges of any first-instance kind may need training. That justifies the very considerable expenditure on the Judicial Studies Board. That is fully carried out.
<P>

<a name="40119-19_para8"></a>As a judge, one is required to attend these courses. As a judge, one is required to attend a number of training courses. That particularly was the case in relation to the European human rights legislation that we took on board. With great respect to my noble and learned friend Lord Donaldson, I do not think that there is anything the matter with that. The Court of Appeal is not required to take on training, for the simple reason that it is expected to understand the law. If it needs training, no doubt the Master of the Rolls could arrange courses. I therefore see nothing wrong with subsection (3) of the proposed new clause.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-19_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   If accepted, the clause would go to jurisdiction. That is the problem. <P>


<a name="column_GC204"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC204</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I do not disagree with my noble and learned friend Lord Ackner about the desirability of training. Nor do I disagree when he says that there is extensive training now undertaken through the Judicial Studies Board. That is thoroughly desirable, and I am sure that it will continue. No doubt, it will be broadened in the light of this Bill when it becomes an Act of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40119-19_para9"></a>My point is that it is a complete novelty. It is undesirable to have licensed judges in the Court of Appeal or, possibly, in the slightly lower courts. That is what this amounts to. There would be no jurisdiction in Lord Justice X's court unless he had received adequate training. It may be that, administratively, it could be arranged that he did not hear such an appeal, but that is another matter altogether. But this would mean that the man or woman had no jurisdiction, which I find strange.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-19_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   In replying to this part of the debate, I may say that I interpreted the noble Baroness's amendment as a generic way of asking what is to be done about training. Unfortunately, the flaws in the amendment&#151;I shall not trouble to go through them all&#151;are such that they would have some very unfortunate consequences, as already alluded to by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson. They are all correct.
<P>

<a name="40119-19_para10"></a>The Government recognise the importance of training for those working in the field of domestic violence. Quite properly, that was raised at Second Reading. I made it absolutely clear that the Government would review all the domestic violence training available, with a view to ensuring a more consistent, multi-agency approach.
<P>

<a name="40119-19_para11"></a>The amendment in the name of the noble Baroness and the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, would place a statutory requirement for training on the police, the judiciary, and those involved in domestic violence homicide reviews. Because of the scope of the Bill and the terms of the amendment, its effects would be felt throughout the civil and criminal justice system. For example, in the absence of judges with the new training that the amendment demands, there may be delays in the issue of non-molestation and occupation orders, and criminal cases dealing with everything from common assault to familial homicide could not be heard. That would throw the listings procedure into chaos and seriously delay or jeopardise the outcome of a large number of proceedings.
<P>

<a name="40119-19_para12"></a>At the other end of the system, as I think was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, senior police officers would be unable to order officers to attend most domestic violence cases, along with incidents of common assault or breach of a restraining order. Similarly, domestic violence homicide reviews, which are intended to be light touch, would also become difficult.
<P>

<a name="40119-19_para13"></a>I understand that that is not what the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, seeks. We all acknowledge that more work is needed to ensure that training for the police and the judiciary is of the highest standard, and that work already is under way. I should like to <P>


<a name="column_GC205"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC205</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reassure the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, that the days when judges denied the need for training have frankly long gone. The criticism, if there is one, of the JSB now is why they do not receive more training. There is no problem about judges wanting to be trained.
<P>

<a name="40119-19_para14"></a>The police and judiciary continue to make significant progress in training. In 2002, the Central Police Training and Development Authority&#151;Centrex&#151;and the Association of Chief Police Officers published a new six-part training pack on domestic violence, and the National Centre for Policing Excellence is developing new guidelines for police handling of domestic violence cases. In addition, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate will shortly publish a joint thematic review of the handling of domestic violence cases, and we look forward to any recommendations that the report makes on training.
<P>

<a name="40119-19_para15"></a>Training for the judiciary is provided by the Judicial Studies Board, which has recognised that training is not provided consistently throughout the magistrates' courts service. In order to support universal delivery, the Judicial Studies Board has developed training materials on domestic violence for use in the training of magistrates, and is providing training for magistrates' trainers in the use of that material.
<P>

<a name="40119-19_para16"></a>The Judicial Studies Board also provides a range of courses for judges that covers domestic violence. If and when specific legislation is introduced, the Judicial Studies Board will assess the training needs of the judiciary and make any necessary provision. Finally, a review is under way to determine how many judges are ticketed for different areas of work, after which an assessment will be made about any additional appointments that may be required to fill the gaps.
<P>

<a name="40119-19_para17"></a>No one disputes the fact that the police and judiciary need proper training to ensure that they understand the laws they are called on to enforce, and that they do so with proper awareness of the dynamics of particular types of case. I very much take on board what the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said about training generally and the needs being of importance to all the agencies. We are keeping that matter very much in the forefront of our minds.
<P>

<a name="40119-19_para18"></a>Training is an essential part of implementing new measures and making full use of existing powers, but the amendment would not improve matters. If anything, because of the way in which it is drafted, it is likely to make matters worse for the justice system and for victims themselves. For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendments.
<P>

<a name="40119-19_para19"></a>I have the privilege of chairing the inter-ministerial group on domestic violence. I reassure the noble Baroness that we are indeed trying to work right across government to see how we can raise the profile of the issue and make sure that there is better understanding. We are working with the Department for Education and Skills, the Department of Health, the ODPM, which deals with housing, and right across the board. The broad ministerial commitment is very strong, and <P>


<a name="column_GC206"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC206</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we can get the message across and make the situation better. We will look carefully at the whole issue of training. With that reassurance, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel that her amendments have done what she wanted; namely, to have the issue explored. I hope that the answers meet her concerns.

<P>
<A NAME="40119-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I would like some reassurance that guidance will be cross-cutting.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-20_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The inter-ministerial group is looking at the needs of multi-agency working, and is consulting carefully with all the other departments to try to ensure that we can all sing from one hymn sheet. I cannot give the noble Baroness specific assurances about guidance; she will know that it is issued by different departments. There is the Department of Health's guidance, the guidance that we would issue in the Home Office, DCA guidance and CPS guidance. We are trying to make sure that there is clarity in relation to all the guidance, and that synergy takes place, so that we all work to the same brief.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-20_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful for the Minister's response. She was right in her opening remarks to recognise that my invitation to the Government was to put on record a series of assurances about what steps had been taken and what was their attitude to training. I tried to make that clear in my opening remarks.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para0"></a>A multi-agency approach is certainly needed. The Minister referred to the inter-ministerial group. In long distant days, I served on just such a group as an also-ran&#151;as a non-political adviser, not a Minister. I realised early on in that group that the key to success lay in the person chairing it taking ownership of it to ensure that it was driven forward.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para1"></a>Without sounding too cloying, I think that we have the right person to do that. I hope that the Minister stays there to do just that. Otherwise, it is a most appallingly difficult job to get different government departments to work together. They often have a reasonable meeting, only, when they go away, to find that the matter is a low priority. I recognise that it is a difficult job; I am glad that the noble Baroness is performing it; we look forward to the results.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, did his usual friendly act in which he takes me to task for tabling a useless amendment and says that the matter could be better dealt with by correspondence. I am looking forward to carrying on our double act in discussing the Bill. I am sure that he will not be disappointed or offended if I give my usual answer, which is to say that, as I see it, my duty is to raise issues that have been raised with me as matters of concern by outside organisations.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para3"></a>In particular, I cited the Women's National Commission, which wants mandatory training. I appreciate all the proper reasons advanced by other members of the Committee why the amendment should not be accepted because of its drafting&#151;here, I <P>

<A NAME="40119-20_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I said that I wanted the Government to explain what steps they had taken to ensure that there was both the budget and the staff to do the training and, at the end, I invited the noble Baroness to give various assurances. Perhaps I did not make that as clear as I should have, but I tried.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para4"></a>Training is vital. I was delighted to be caught between two noble and learned Lords; I hope to repeat the experience in future. At this stage, I should declare a related interest. I am indeed aware of how seriously the judiciary takes its duty to provide training, and what good training the JSB provides. Tomorrow, my husband, as a lesser mortal in the judiciary, is off to Northampton to train in family law. So far be it from me to think that judges do not train.

<a name="40119-20_para5"></a>I am most grateful for the contributions of all members of the Committee. I shall in particular bear in mind the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, about guidance. That is an important matter. The Minister was right to point out that every department will need to consider it, but we can deal with the Home Office. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Before Clause 1, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-20_para7"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
<br>

"Definition of domestic violence
<br>
29A DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
<br>
(1) Violence against a person by any other person is to be regarded as domestic violence if that person is, or has been, in a domestic relationship with that other person.
<br>
(2) In this section, "violence" means&#151;
<br>
(a) physical abuse;
<br>
(b) sexual abuse;
<br>
(c) psychological or emotional abuse, including, but not limited to&#151;
<br>
(i) intimidation;
<br>
(ii) harassment;
<br>
(iii) damage to property;
<br>
(iv) threats of physical abuse, sexual abuse or psychological abuse;
<br>
(v) in relation to a child, abuse of the kind set out in subsection (3).
<br>
(3) Without limiting subsection (2)(c), a person abuses a child psychologically if that person&#151;
<br>
(a) causes or allows the child to see or hear the physical, sexual or psychological abuse of a person with whom the child has a domestic relationship; or

<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(b) puts the child, or allows the child to be put, at real risk of seeing or hearing that abuse occurring,
<br>
but the person who suffers that abuse is not regarded, for the purposes of this subsection, as having caused or allowed the child to see or hear the abuse or, as the case may be, as having put the child, or allowed the child to be put, at risk of seeing or hearing the abuse.
<br>
(4) Without limiting subsection (2)&#151;
<br>
(a) a single act may amount to abuse for the purposes of that subsection;
<br>
(b) a number of acts that form a pattern of behaviour may amount to abuse for that purpose, even though some or all of those acts, when viewed in isolation, may appear to be minor or trivial.
<br>
(5) Behaviour which does not involve actual or threatened physical or sexual abuse may be regarded as psychological abuse for the purposes of subsection (2)(c).""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40119-20_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: I come now to a matter which has been raised with us by many different groups; namely, the need for a definition of domestic violence as a crime. That is because no such definition currently exists. We have tried to draw up a definition that keeps within what is laid down in the Long Title, amending Part 4 of the Family Law Act 1996, and I am grateful to the Public Bill Office for its help. The noble Baroness will appreciate that when a Bill is so tightly drawn, it can be difficult to introduce an amendment of this kind. Were it completely new legislation, the task would have been much easier.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para9"></a>The definition we have provided in the amendment is drawn from New Zealand law and is an "off the shelf" form of words. As such perhaps it is not one that I would have advanced had I had the time to talk it over with others and start from scratch. What is set out is excellent, but I am more concerned with what is not included, in that it might cause some problems.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para10"></a>We are talking about defining domestic violence and violence committed within a family context or the context of a domestic relationship. It covers physical, sexual, psychological or emotional abuse, all of which are set out in detail, while subsection (3) addresses the psychological abuse of a child if the person committing the violence,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"causes or allows the child to see or hear the physical, sexual or psychological abuse of a person with whom the child has a domestic relationship".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-20_para11"></a>
That reflects the strong recognition among the many organisations working in this field that children can be damaged by the domestic abuse of one of their parents. However, the subsection goes on to provide that the person who suffers the abuse cannot be blamed for causing damage to the child. Again, that is an important point that was raised with us.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para12"></a>Subsection (4) provides a definition for a single act or, as is much more common, a pattern of repeated actions as a description of domestic violence. Finally, subsection (5) covers:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Behaviour which does not involve actual or threatened physical or sexual abuse may be regarded as psychological abuse".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-20_para13"></a><P>

<a name="40119-20_para14"></a>This amendment has been drafted in response to the concerns expressed by many organisations that the opportunity should be taken in this Bill to include such <P>


<a name="column_GC209"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC209</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>behaviour in any definition of the crime of domestic violence, and New Zealand law is fairly close in character to our own legislation.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para15"></a>There are three main strands to the argument in favour of attempting to set out a definition in the Bill. The first responds to the perceived problem on the part of victims and those offering them help, support and encouragement that the courts do not always understand the nature of the problem. Psychological abuse in particular is not always recognised for what it is&#151;namely, a form of violence&#151;and the repeat nature of the crime that is so characteristic of many cases is also not always recognised by sentencers. The result is punishment which does not always fit the crime.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para16"></a>I should add that certain groups are still left out of the proposed definition, groups to which the noble Baroness referred in response to my comments on the matter during our debate at Second Reading. Special attention needs to be paid to the position of members of certain minority groups, mostly women who are not only abused by their husbands or partners, but find that that abuse is supported by the community. The victims of such abuse literally have nowhere to turn. That is not reflected in the definition. At some point, it ought to be referred to. I may well return to the matter, depending on what the Minister says in response. That explanation covers what has been set out in the proposed new clause.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para17"></a>The second strand of justification is purely practical and was the basis of my first rationale for proposing a definition to include in the Bill. The Government are rightly concerned to reduce the incidence of domestic violence, but in order to measure something, one first has to define it. The Equal Opportunities Commission is one of several organisations to have made the point.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para18"></a>At Second Reading, the Minister responded to my comment about the unfortunate absence of any definition in the present Bill by pointing out how the definition of domestic violence has changed over time. She also acknowledged the problems that can be caused by the different definitions being used in various parts of public administration and confirmed that the Government are working on a broad definition of domestic violence with partners, but rejected the notion of introducing a statutory definition. I recognise the problems surrounding statutory definitions, but I am not yet prepared to yield to the Minister&#151;in particular since we do not yet know what the government definition will be.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para19"></a>That leads me to the third and most fundamental strand: the lack of understanding of the essential character of domestic crime shared by individuals, society and, often, the courts. In most situations where a person is facing the threat of physical assault, the old saying has it that he or she has two options: fight or flight. As it happens, the person is usually a young male. Sometimes there may be witnesses and there may be no former connection between the assailant and the victim. The assault may be a random and one-off event.
<P>


<a name="column_GC210"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC210</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para20"></a>The victim of domestic violence, in particular of domestic violence that results in serious harm, is almost always a woman. She may lack the physical or mental strength to fight. As for flight, where can she go? How can she take her children with her, yet how can she leave them behind? Domestic violence, whether physical or psychological, may be witnessed by no one except the victim and, perhaps, her children&#151;who, as I have said, may be damaged by witnessing that violence. The victim will have a close connection to the assailant, one in which she, or he, is the weaker partner. The violence will be what is most probably part of a pattern of behaviour which reinforces that power relationship. It is those considerations which have drawn many to say that UK law should reflect what is set out in the various human rights declarations to which the UK is a signatory.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para21"></a>Article 5 of CEDAW&#151;the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women&#151;requires states to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary . . . practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-20_para22"></a>
In terms of the attitudes towards violence against women addressed in the Government's consultation document, that article, broadly drafted as it is, seems pretty apt.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para23"></a>In 1993, the United Nations produced a declaration on the elimination of violence against women, and within that declaration introduced a definition:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-20_para24"></a><P>

<a name="40119-20_para25"></a>I do not want to speak at length about what some may perceive as a disagreeably feminist approach to the matter, but it is difficult not to be a feminist when so often the victims are women. For that reason, this Government in particular may well want to take a lead in the matter rather than merely following behind the changes in the definition of domestic violence referred to by the noble Baroness in her response to me.
<P>

<a name="40119-20_para26"></a>The amendment contains no reference to the particular problem of the domination of male over female. I do not try to say that the amendment, tabled on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, is perfect, but perhaps we shall be able to improve it at later stages. That will depend on the response of the Minister. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40119-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   This is a welcome amendment which has been clearly explained by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood. It is taken from the New Zealand law, subject to minor amendment, to provide a statutory definition. But the decision of the Court of Appeal regarding Lomas v Parle published on 13 January has created an entirely new perspective for debate on this and other amendments. That decision unanimously concluded in <P>


<a name="column_GC211"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC211</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a reserve judgment that the extant regime for domestic violence was wholly unsatisfactory. It further requested that Parliament consider, by amendment to this Bill, setting up an integrated court with civil and criminal jurisdiction, along with remedies, to adjudicate on domestic violence which, as a matter of principle, is to be found reflected in Amendment No. 8.
<P>

<a name="40119-21_para0"></a>It further found that, pending the setting up of an integrated court, mandatory guidance given by the courts on the operation of the parallel system should obtain in the interim, a point which also affects the proposed new clause. So on that basis, the amendment would serve alongside such guidance as a valuable staging post on the road to redressing the unsatisfactory regime.
<P>

<a name="40119-21_para1"></a>An interim measure, pending a report and a draft Bill from the Law Commission, would be required in order to set up the court. Such is the basis on which the amendment warrants the Committee's support as an interim measure. The machinery for setting up the court cannot be devised in the form of an amendment to this Bill. It will involve a series of amendments to extant law, revision for a new mode of trial, retention of criminal jurisdiction for certain types of crime and implementation by rules. All that would be totally beyond the scope of the Bill. But the principle of establishment is expressly sought by the Court of Appeal in the Lomas v Parle decision.
<P>

<a name="40119-21_para2"></a>During the process of gestation to achieve that Bill, the amendment will serve as a welcome and essential safeguard, albeit that I have certain reservations about subsection (5). I hope that it receives the support of the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   Perhaps I may raise one or two questions about the amendment. The first two words in the title of the Bill are "domestic violence". On the face of it, therefore, it would seem a good idea to include a definition. I shall make one or two more detailed points. Although I am not an expert draftsman, what should be defined as an act of domestic violence seems to be well set out in the amendment. But although there are certain criminal offences and certain procedural remedies for criminal offences set out in the Bill, no specific offence of "domestic violence" is created. If one does not have an offence so described, then surely we would be doing unnecessary work in seeking to define it.
<P>

<a name="40119-21_para3"></a>Clause 4 contains the most important offence of causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable person. A brand new criminal offence such as that, the main purpose of which was explained by my noble friend at Second Reading and is set out in the Explanatory Notes, will no doubt be discussed in considerable detail. The Committee will want to pay the closest attention to the definition of that offence. It is a new offence with penalties attached to it and, therefore, in the interests of both victims and defendants, it must be closely and carefully defined.
<P>

<a name="40119-21_para4"></a>Other provisions on the matter of definition in the Bill are perhaps less significant. For example, the provision set out in Clause 1 for the breach of a non-molestation order makes that, for the first time, a <P>


<a name="column_GC212"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>criminal offence. Because it is to be a new criminal offence, very careful attention must be paid to its definition.
<P>

<a name="40119-21_para5"></a>I could give other examples from the Bill, but there is no offence entitled "domestic violence"; it is a description given. Obviously, one wants to give it some meaning, but I am not sure that it would help to set it out in a Bill, which then becomes an Act&#151;rigid law. To my inexpert mind, the amendment seems well drafted, but it include phrases such as, "a person who is in a domestic relationship with another person". If one includes such a phrase, one needs to include a definition of "domestic relationship", and there is not one. I do not suggest that there should be; perhaps it would be as well, in these times of changing and developing social and domestic relationships, to allow the definition to be developed over time and as the courts deal with cases.
<P>

<a name="40119-21_para6"></a>The inclusion of a definition of "domestic violence" would make the law more rigid than necessary. Although it may help judges, social workers and others dealing with the Bill and the offences that it covers, I do not see any value in including a definition in the Bill when it is not defining an offence.
<P>

<a name="40119-21_time0"></a><H5>4.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I wish briefly to follow what the noble Lord has said. Since there is no offence of domestic violence, there seems no need to include a definition of it. Subsection (1) of the proposed new clause states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Violence against a person by any other person is to be regarded as domestic violence if that person is, or has been, in a domestic relationship with that other person."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-21_para7"></a><P>

<a name="40119-21_para8"></a>Immediately that requires a definition of a "domestic relationship". Until you know what a domestic relationship is, you cannot know whether the act of violence is an act of domestic violence occasioned in a domestic relationship.
<P>

<a name="40119-21_para9"></a>We are in danger of attempting to define words that do not need definition. We all know what we mean&#151;it is violence in a domestic surrounding. Courts know what it means. Since it is not a separate offence, I cannot see why it needs a separate definition.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   Not being a lawyer or a woman, I hesitate to intervene in this debate. At Second Reading, when the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, asked about a definition, I tried to cite one in the White Paper. I cannot judge whether it should be in the Bill, but it is good to be clear and to be reminded what domestic violence is. We may all know what it is, but about 10 years ago none of us did. Information on the nature of domestic violence has been developed by a lot of research. We are just beginning to understand its nature, because it is complex.
<P>

<a name="40119-21_para10"></a>As the noble Baroness pointed out, and as the definition in subsection (4) states, domestic violence is often a repeated offence, rather than a one-off offence. Secondly, it is an offence to which witnesses are difficult to find. It may be assault and battery, for example, or grievous bodily harm, but to which there <P>


<a name="column_GC213"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC213</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>were no witnesses, therefore the context must be clear. Thirdly&#151;this concerns me above all else&#151;as I mentioned at Second Reading, the notion of domestic relationships, especially in a multi-ethnic society, must be thought of completely differently.
<P>

<a name="40119-21_para11"></a>When the publication of domestic violence literature started in the social sciences, it was very much in the context of a man/woman relationship, with or without children, in which&#151;let us make it clear&#151;the man was battering the woman. That was the nature of domestic violence. Then we added the effect on children, direct or indirect, and so on. But, very often in a multi-ethnic situation, especially in joint families, a variety of people commit domestic violence against a woman, some of them women. There is no straightforward gender distinction. I do not know what should be done about the situation, but if we ever have to define "domestic relationship", we will take it in the context of a larger familial relationship as opposed to just a domestic relationship.
<P>

<a name="40119-21_para12"></a>In statistics "family" and "household" mean two different things. Similarly, "familial relationship" may have a meaning different from "domestic relationship". Whether or not the provision is included in the Bill, it ought to be set out somewhere so that people can refer to it. In that document we should err on the side of generality rather than tight specificity, as we do not know what shape domestic violence will take in future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-21_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I support the inclusion of the amendment. As has been said, the offence of domestic violence has very much come to the fore over recent years. I would wager that, although the Committee may know what area it covers, much of the population does not. There is therefore a need for some definition. Having listened to the experts, I agree that the definition in this amendment may not be perfect, but the more one thinks about the matter, the more important it seems to describe the range of sexual domestic violence. I agree that domestic violence is not carried out against women only; there are plenty of examples of domestic violence against men, although they are the minority. I hope that the Minister will consider further the inclusion of some such provision in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-21_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I feel somewhat ill at ease, as I do not support the amendment to include a definition of domestic violence. As a social worker and social scientist, I am aware that there would be huge temptations, in that people would believe that they had something against which they could measure cases. We have gathered statistics in this area for some considerable time, and, as some Members said, we can recognise domestic violence. In a changing society, there are dangers of getting it wrong. I have heard incidents of mothers-in-law in certain ethnic communities having the right to beat up their daughters-in-law as part of bringing them into line in the household. That is just an example, but there is a range of other issues.
<P>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC214</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40119-21_para13"></a>I am particularly concerned about allowing the person who has suffered abuse not to be found guilty, if a child is seriously harmed, of not bringing that harm to the attention of the authorities. That would be in direct conflict with Clause 4, which relates to two people being held responsible.
<P>

<a name="40119-21_para14"></a>I have concerns about having definitions, as they tend to narrow attention. They conflict with other issues. We are in such an extraordinarily changing society that no sooner will we have one definition than we will need another.

<A NAME="40119-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   As the longest serving Member of both Houses and a senior Queen's Counsel, the Committee may be surprised and pleased by the silence that I have kept today. I must confess that I have serious doubts about the need for the Bill at all. Although I have great respect for the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, and the noble Lord, Lord McNally, and have listened to the discussion of the amendment with much interest, I fear that it goes into too much detail by way of definition.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para0"></a>We must trust the courts to decide principles. We do not have the experience that the courts have in deciding whether justice should be done in one way or another. Too much of our legislation goes into too much detailed definition. For example, the amendment includes the words "domestic relationship", which is not defined here&#151;or anywhere else, as far as I know. The courts would not have difficulty in finding whether there was a domestic relationship: husband and wife, partner and partner, brother and sister or even first cousins. People living together or spending a lot of time together are all domestic relationships. If we provide a definition in too much detail, some occasion is bound to be considered as being outside of it. So the definition would be better not made.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para1"></a>I could go on for a long time&#151;I have tried to keep quiet today&#151;but I hope that the Committee will bear that point in mind.

<A NAME="40119-22_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I welcome the opportunity given to us by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, to debate this issue. I certainly go along with the noble Lord, Lord Desai, in believing that if we do not need a definition in the Bill, we need one somewhere&#151;or at least an understanding of what is domestic violence.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para2"></a>Some members of the Committee said that the amendment narrows attention so that matters that should be excluded from domestic violence can be excluded. Today we have seen how coming to some understanding of what is domestic violence is fraught with difficulties. But that is precisely what we expect our courts to decide in each and every case before them. We have placed that heavy responsibility on them.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para3"></a>Whether we like it or not, a definition of domestic violence is at present used by the Home Office. If the Home Office did not have one, it would be criticised; <P>


<a name="column_GC215"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC215</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because it has, we criticise it by saying that the definition is insufficient and not up to date. That definition is:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Any violence between current and former partners in an intimate relationship wherever and whenever the violence occurs. The violence may include physical, sexual, emotional and financial abuse".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-22_para4"></a>
The amendment does not appear specifically to cover financial abuse.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para5"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, has done us a great service by enabling us to debate the problems involved in updating the definition. As she said, there are flaws in the amendment's drafting. That is not the problem. She has focussed our attention on how difficult it is to decide what should be the definition. Members of the Committee have referred to the problem of defining a domestic relationship, whether it involves a family or a household.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para6"></a>The amendment starts with the circular definition that violence is to be regarded as domestic violence if a person has been in a domestic relationship, but without defining "domestic". "Violence" is defined in the proposed new clause but "domestic" is not. We must surely consider that.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para7"></a>I question how widely the word "domestic" should go. After all, when murder statistics are classified it is often said that most murders are "domestic" in the sense that a murder is committed by someone whom the victim knew. Already, my noble friend Lord Renton has talked about the definition of domestic violence including cousins, brothers and sisters. Some would say that that is not domestic violence. I would say that my noble friend is right to consider how widely domestic violence can extend. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, was right to avoid gender bias in her drafting; the problem is gender free.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para8"></a>I recollect the first interview that I had in a case of domestic violence that ended up with a conviction in the Crown Court. In that case, a gentleman was being beaten up by his mother-in-law and his wife. Both of them were smaller than he, but the mother-in-law performed a service by putting a pitchfork round his neck and putting him on the ground, so that his wife could do the rest. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, has recognised that it may be in a minority of cases that there is domestic violence against a man but that that must be covered properly, as she has done in her definition.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para9"></a>It is difficult to decide what kind of domestic relationship is covered. Is it only a household in which people live together? What about a long-distance relationship because of professional commitments? Is not that a domestic relationship too, even though each party might maintain and own separate homes and travel a lot? One may consider oneself, either married or unmarried, as being in a domestic relationship. A platonic relationship could even be included. As a relationship develops over the years, the sexual relationship may have gone out of it. There is so much that is difficult in drafting such a definition.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para10"></a>I sympathise with the way in which the noble Baroness has approached the drafting of subsection (3). She seeks to protect the victim of domestic violence <P>


<a name="column_GC216"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>from being held guilty for the child abuse offence described in the first paragraph of the subsection. That is a theme to which I would like to return, when we get to the offence in Clause 4 and the way in which it is dealt with in court, as set out in Clause 5. I recognise the huge difficulty in trying to absolve a victim of domestic violence from the responsibility of preventing other people suffering the same violence in the household.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para11"></a>I was interested to see in the Judicial Studies Board's training document, to which I referred a moment ago&#151;the training is going on this week&#151;that the participants would be invited to debate a preferred option of defining domestic violence. Her Majesty's judges will consider another possible definition, to test their mettle. It runs as follows:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Domestic abuse is essentially a pattern of behaviour, which is characterised by the exercise of control and the misuse of power by one person over another person, often within the context of an intimate relationship and affects the lives of children. It can be manifested in a variety of ways, including but not restricted to, physical, sexual, psychological, emotional and financial abuse, and the imposition of social isolation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-22_para12"></a>
That is not a perfect, preferred option, and one can immediately see problems with it. However, it takes us further forward, and I would be grateful if the Minister could indicate whether the Government have been made aware of that preferred option and have had the opportunity to consider it. If so, what is their reaction? If not, will they direct their mind to it in the future?
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para13"></a>We have made a good start in the debate today, in the hands of the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood. We may need to return to the matter, even if the definition does not need to go into the Bill. As noble Lords have correctly pointed out, there is no offence of domestic violence in the Bill, but it is essential that we know what we are talking about, if we are to be able to say whether the Bill should go forward unamended.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I found the debate that we have just had stimulating. It reflects the debate that the Government had, causing us to believe that there should be no definition in the statutory form. Several Members of the Committee highlighted the difficulties of defining domestic violence in a way that will remain flexible and capable of responding to changing circumstances. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, for tabling the amendment. It enables us to consider the matter and justify our decision not to have a definition. I want to say straightaway that I agree with the comments made by the noble Lords, Lord Borrie, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow and Lord Renton, my noble friend Lord Desai and the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, when they say that a definition would be misplaced in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para14"></a>The issue of definition arose at Second Reading. Members of the Committee will recall that I acknowledged the concerns voiced by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, about the different domestic violence definitions in use by <P>


<a name="column_GC217"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC217</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>different agencies, and assured noble Lords that the Government were working with partners towards a single definition.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para15"></a>I should say how grateful I am for the unnecessary and unfounded compliments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, about my chairmanship of the inter-ministerial group. Members of the Committee will know that domestic violence has been an issue about which I have felt passionately since 1977. That passion has not waned. As the chair of the domestic violence inter-ministerial group, I assure Members of the Committee that it is looking at the very issue of definition, not in terms of what goes into the Bill, but to have a working model that all practitioners across the discipline can seek to use as a first-point position. I do not want to restrict a definition but to enable one, in the parameters within which we currently understand domestic violence, to be better understood by all practitioners who have to apply it.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para16"></a>I endorse the comments of those who have spoken about the fear of rigidity, not least because the people whom we seek to protect are the victims of domestic violence. Tragically, we are discovering that the species of domestic violence mutate far more quickly than we can keep up with in statute. That is a change. One could say that we have waited 30 years for this new piece of legislation, and we do not know how quickly we would have to amend any definition. That informs what we think.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para17"></a>The amendment is unnecessary. Part IV of the Family Law Act 1996 does not use "domestic violence" and, if it did so, defining it might create another hurdle that applicants for orders would have to clear. At present, parties must be "associated" according to the definitions in Section 62 of the Act, and there must be evidence of "molestation". The case law indicates that a very wide range of behaviours may be classified as "molestation" for these purposes; for example, "pester" may be included, as in the case of Vaughan v Vaughan in 1973. Conduct that does not amount to violent behaviour can fall within the category, as in Davis v Johnson in 1979. Repeated telephoning was covered in Burnett v George in 1992; the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, talked about psychological issues and stalking. The courts can identify all those different species as domestic violence in its real form.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para18"></a>Making eligibility for an order further dependent on establishing some history of domestic violence as defined in the amendment would risk reducing the availability of orders to those who need their protection. Members of the Committee have said that there is often a pattern. It is right that the average is about 37 occasions before a woman&#151;it is usually a woman&#151;has the courage to come forward. However, we would obviously like, through education and better understanding, any person who suffers violence not to wait for it to be repeated, but to seek succour on the first occasion on which abuse takes place. Certainly, we would not like to have anything in the definition <P>


<a name="column_GC218"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC218</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that would discourage them, so that they felt that they had to be abused on a continual basis before they were able to receive the care and attention that they needed.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para19"></a>I shall pick up the point of the noble Lord, Lord Desai, about larger familial relationships. They are currently covered in the Family Law Act 1996. The definition of associated person in subsection (3)(d) includes relatives. We want to add to, and not subtract from, the protection that already exists. Clause 1 of the Bill talks about criminalising a breach of a non-molestation order, so a court will already have made an order determining that some form of domestic violence or molestation has taken place, and it is the breach of that molestation order that will then be dealt with under that clause.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para20"></a>I think that I can take it from everything that has been said without exception, by each Member of the Committee who has spoken, that our general intent is to enhance the protection given to victims of such abuse, to bring about greater clarity of understanding and question whether that would be better dealt with in the statutory definition, and to have a general approach that would be better understood by all. Through our attempts at education and raising the profile, we seek to do that.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para21"></a>We hope, very soon, to launch a domestic violence campaign to help others better to understand the nature of domestic violence. We understand that the issue may start with someone being silenced and not being able to express themselves. It may then move on to what equates to a form of bullying, to get control of a person, and may gradually move on to a violent act. It sometimes starts psychologically and moves on to the physical. Making sure that there is better understanding is certainly important.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para22"></a>I absolutely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, that we seek understanding between agencies which have to deal with the problem, so that there is clarity of purpose. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, that we are delighted that the Judicial Studies Board is taking a role. We will continue to work with it. The Department for Constitutional Affairs, which is the lead government department under which the JSB sits (although it is a an independent body), also sits on our inter-ministerial committee. We are looking across the piece so that we get the understanding that I know that all Members of the Committee seek.
<P>

<a name="40119-22_para23"></a>It has been a very helpful debate. It has clarified to me, if I needed further clarification, precisely why we should not have a statutory definition in the Bill.

<A NAME="40119-23_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   I thank everyone who has been kind enough to give the debate and my amendment such serious consideration. I shall start with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. It is the absence of the definition of the crime that I am trying to correct by providing one. His argument circulates one way and mine circulates in the opposite direction, so I do not think that we shall find a point of contact along that line of discussion. I think that the absence of a definition is a problem, and it is not the solution.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40119-23_para0"></a>I cannot go through every contribution, but I noticed that some have said that there is something wrong about creating an offence. We need to know what we are talking about. The noble Baroness did not contest that. Her attitude was different from that: it was not that one should not define it, but that it should be defined in a different place. In some ways, she and I are in fairly close alliance on the matter of whether the crime needs to be defined.
<P>

<a name="40119-23_para1"></a>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, for her support. It is true, as the noble Lord, Lord Renton, and others said, that the amendment is fairly complicated. However, I do not find "domestic" at all difficult to understand. It means living in the same house&#151;in the same domestic situation. It therefore includes all the relationships, whatever they may be, between the people who live in that house. So it includes any kind of familial relationship&#151;a cousin or whoever it may be&#151;as the noble Baroness said. Battered grannies and so on can all come under it. That is the meaning of the word "domestic". I know that I have not set that out in the amendment but to me, as an amateur, "domestic" means the people living in the household and that is the way in which I interpret it.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   A number of noble Lords have made the point that if we are talking about the same household, the term "domestic relationships" may be too narrow a definition because a number of the relatives may not live in the same household. That is one of the problems.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-23_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   I understand the Minister's point and I take it in the context of what the noble Lord, Lord Desai, said about various minority communities where extremely unfortunate abuse is vented upon people by all kinds of different connections and, indeed, as I said in my opening statement, where very often the abused person cannot obtain support outside of the household for the abuse that she or he is suffering within it. I understand the point and I know that the amendment is deficient in that respect.
<P>

<a name="40119-23_para2"></a>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for welcoming the amendment as a basis on which we can discuss these issues. She is quite right, the amendment does not cover financial abuse and it certainly should.
<P>

<a name="40119-23_para3"></a>I thank the Minister for her reply which I shall read it with great care. I have sufficient experience of the noble Baroness to know that one does not necessarily always get the full import of what she is saying when listening to her. I shall read what she said with great interest to ensure that I understand it. I may continue the discussion in correspondence with her or we may bring forward another amendment which satisfies the problems raised by members of the Committee at a later stage. That will depend on how matters pan out. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-23_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood </B>   moved Amendment No. 3:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Before Clause 1, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-23_para5"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS, COHABITANTS OR FORMER COHABITANTS: REPEAL
<br>
 Section 41 of the Family Law Act 1996 (c. 27) (additional considerations if parties are cohabitants or former cohabitants) shall cease to have effect."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40119-23_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are directed towards the same area of the original Bill&#151;that is, the question of occupation orders. Amendment No. 3 seeks to insert a new clause which would remove from the original Bill the additional considerations that a court may have in mind when discussing occupation orders and whether the parties are cohabitants or married. In other words, you may be disadvantaged&#151;in theory, at any rate&#151;by the court if you are not married. That is an absolutely unsustainable position today, particularly considering the large number of people living together unmarried for many, many years.
<P>

<a name="40119-23_para7"></a>A Member of your Lordships' House told me the other day that his son or daughter&#151;I forget which&#151;was about to get married, he or she having lived with their partner for seven or eight years. Many marriages do not last that long. We are in a completely different situation nowadays as regards how we treat married or unmarried people.
<P>

<a name="40119-23_para8"></a>The second amendment goes in a slightly different direction. It is concerned with the duration of occupation orders, which do not have the same minimum duration as non-molestation orders. The amendment provides that the various orders shall last for a minimum period of six months and can be extended on two occasions for further periods of six months unless an application is made to discharge the order. In other words, it would ensure that the orders are not too short.
<P>

<a name="40119-23_para9"></a>Currently, victims of domestic violence do not all have equal access to protection because of the legal differential regarding the nature of their relationships. That does not affect non-molestation orders, but it does affect occupation orders. An abused woman, who has directly contributed to or even fully met the costs of the family home through rent or mortgage payments for many years cannot, under present law, obtain an occupation order for more than a year simply because she is not married to the legal tenant or owner. That is a strange situation.
<P>

<a name="40119-23_para10"></a>We should bear it in mind that this law is to apply to single-sex partnerships and we should consider what effect it will have on those. The courts may well have to say that because they are not married, but only cohabiting, single-sex partners would be discriminated against in the same way. All discrimination is unacceptable and I hope that the Minister will consider these amendments.
<P>

<a name="40119-23_para11"></a>The matter of the duration of orders has been raised because so many women complain about their short period of effect. They must return to the court maybe every two or three months to get another order which may last for only another two or three months. They <P>


<a name="column_GC221"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC221</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do not feel sufficiently protected when the orders are so short-lived. That is why we have tabled a probing amendment to provide that orders are made for six months at a time, for a total of 18 months, unless an application is made to discharge them. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-23_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, gave the game away when she referred to the fact that many of these issues will be covered by the Civil Partnerships Bill. They will be better dealt with there, although I appreciate that she is rightly taking this opportunity to try to raise some of those issues. I understand that the Minister is to take the Civil Partnerships Bill through the House, so she is the ideal person to respond today. I shall not be dealing with it, since it is a DTI Bill. My noble friend Baroness Wilcox is the person charged with that task.
<P>

<a name="40119-23_para12"></a>I had difficulty following the reasoning behind Amendment No. 4. I was grateful when the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, explained that it is a probing amendment designed to tease out certain equality issues. She then put some of the arguments in favour of the amendment, which seemed to achieve the exact opposite of what I thought the amendment was about.
<P>

<a name="40119-23_para13"></a>Thank goodness for the Internet, because I did not see these amendments until Friday. Had the statutes not been available online, I could not have done a thing. I looked up the Family Law Act 1996 to see the basis on which the noble Baroness is working. I am puzzled by the way in which the noble Baroness has sought to amend the duration of occupation orders, by making the period specific to six months. That does not allow for a shorter period, as does the existing law. She says that she seeks a minimum period of six months, but she has not explained why there should be no flexibility for the courts.
<P>

<a name="40119-23_para14"></a>Why should not the court decide each individual case? A shorter order might benefit the victim of domestic violence. Victims of abuse have put it to me that sometimes there is an advantage in using a "quick fix" remedy. In a sense, it keeps the offender's eye on the horizon. Victims can apply for a further order.
<P>

<a name="40119-23_para15"></a>I am sure that the noble Baroness is aware that courts are normally enjoined to make orders for as short a period as possible; that is their duty. The amendment also says that an extension is allowed for a further period of six months on only two occasions, rather than at will. The noble Baroness says that she seeks a minimum six-month period because she wants longer rather than shorter orders. However, her amendment would take away from the courts the opportunity to reissue orders for as long as may be necessary. I am rather puzzled about that.
<P>

<a name="40119-23_para16"></a>I am also puzzled by the phrase,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unless an application is made to discharge the order".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-23_para17"></a>
Perhaps whoever has been assisting the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, may like to look at that again. As I read it, if one applies to discharge the order, the rest of the proposed new section cannot apply. If the noble Baroness wants to retable the amendment at Report, she may like to rejig it.
<P>


<a name="column_GC222"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC222</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40119-23_para18"></a>I certainly agree that it is important to ensure that the orders are fit for purpose and last long enough. However, perhaps the noble Baroness should consider circumstances where orders may serve their purpose by being shorter than six months. But, by golly, sometimes one needs the extra armoury that the courts can keep reissuing them more than just a couple of times.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-24_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I echo much that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said. I absolutely understand why the noble Baroness tabled Amendment No. 3. It will need consideration in the light of the proposals currently being considered under civil partnership provisions. Although I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for giving me the wonderful task of piloting the whole of that Bill through, I may find that the DTI Minister has a considerable part to play and that mine may be the minor role. But hope springs eternal.
<P>

<a name="40119-24_para0"></a>Clearly, it is important that the court should have regard to all relevant factors when considering whether to make an occupation order&#151;the nature of the parties' relationship will no doubt be highly relevant. I am grateful to the noble Baroness and the noble Lord for raising this issue in relation to Section 41. In its present form, it would apply only to opposite-sex cohabitants. As I said earlier, that is something we must address.
<P>

<a name="40119-24_para1"></a>For some of the reasons set out by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, I, too, have greater difficulty with Amendment No. 4. It would have the effect of standardising the length of the initial occupation order made under Sections 35, 36, 37 or 38 of the Family Law Act 1996 at six months, and would allow a court to extend the order on two occasions for a further six months when an application is made to discharge the order.
<P>

<a name="40119-24_para2"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said, at the moment, the Family Law Act 1996 provides for an initial order under those sections to be for a maximum of six months&#151;that is, for any period up to six months. It then draws a distinction between spouses or former spouses and cohabitants or former cohabitants. For spouses, it states that the court may extend the order on one or more occasions for a further period of not more than six months. For cohabitants, one extension may be allowed for a period of not more than six months.
<P>

<a name="40119-24_para3"></a>In general principle, I do not believe that it is right to prescribe the length of the initial occupation order as six months. The court should be free to determine the length of the order, depending on the facts of the case, and providing what it considers to be the right length of protection. The noble Baroness will know that no one case is the same as any other.
<P>

<a name="40119-24_para4"></a>The second effect of Amendment No. 4 is to harmonise the position of spouses and cohabitants. I understand that the current provision of the Family Law Act might appear strange. However, the purpose of the distinction was to reflect the different level of commitment involved in marriage and cohabitation. I know that those relationships are very similar, but the <P>


<a name="column_GC223"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC223</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Baroness will concede that marriage allows both partners to share property as of right. Many people who do not marry wish to keep their property rights separate. There are other provisions which, as a result of the duration of the relationship, will give one party rights in relation to property on the basis of certain conditions being met. They are two differently structured relationships.
<P>

<a name="40119-24_para5"></a>For cohabitants, the courts may provide protection for up to a year in total. That should be sufficient for the parties to arrange suitable alternative accommodation. For married couples, where there is a lifetime commitment&#151;or, at the beginning of the marriage, there purports to be a lifetime commitment&#151;the courts may find instances where they consider it necessary to make a longer order in favour of the non-entitled spouse, and that should be left to the discretion of the court. If there is a need for further protection, an application for a new occupation order could be made, with the court having the opportunity to reconsider the full facts of the case.
<P>

<a name="40119-24_para6"></a>We do not believe that the way in which the rules work at the moment is either discriminatory or unjust. It reflects the different relationships between the parties and the likely complexity of their financial and property arrangements, and allows the court to reflect that in the occupation order. I can be seduced into considering Amendment No. 3, but, for those reasons, I am more resistant to the noble Baroness's lures in relation to Amendment No. 4.

<A NAME="40119-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   I thank both noble Baronesses for their thoughtful contributions and their comments on my amendments. As I said, they are probing amendments, particularly the second one.
<P>

<a name="40119-24_para7"></a>I am a little concerned at the Minister's response about the difference between married and unmarried partners. I have been both. In both cases, I have had half ownership of the house in which I have lived. There must be many other people in long-term unmarried associations&#151;if that is the right term&#151;who, similarly, share their property, for obvious reasons. One partner at least obtains half of the property tax free on the death of the other partner. Of course, that partner cannot obtain the other partner's half of the property tax free. My point is that the relationships between unmarried and married people are much less dissimilar than might be supposed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-24_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I hesitate to interrupt, but reassure the noble Baroness that I was not, in any way, detracting from that fact. It is simply that the legal relationship about which the noble Baroness spoke can be different. For instance, the noble Baroness is right to say that people may share the house in joint names. That is a decision they both make.
<P>

<a name="40119-24_para8"></a>We are considering where there is not such an expressed declaration of sharing. Perhaps the couple is unmarried and the property a previously-owned property in the name of one of the parties, but not the other. If one marries, one is deemed to give the other <P>


<a name="column_GC224"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC224</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>person an interest in one's property. That is the operation of marriage and the vows that should have been listened to very carefully. Then there are others who&#151;some would say&#151;are wise enough not to enter into that estate because they wish to protect their property from any unmerited claim made by the unassociated partner whom they have chosen judiciously not to marry.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-24_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   The noble Baroness described various relationships that can exist between married and unmarried people. I do not propose to go any further down that line. It seems that what we are talking about here is the balance of good, and, in terms of both amendments, where the balance should be struck. I shall read the criticisms made of Amendment No. 4 by both noble Baronesses, because they seem to agree with each other. That is always a good indication that I may have got something wrong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   If the noble Baroness is considering tabling the amendment again on Report, will she bear in mind that she uses the same phrase four times when it need be used only once, after which the four occasions to which it applies can be set out?

<a name="40119-24_para12"></a><P>

<a name="40119-24_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: We reach Clause 1 after two hours; I wonder whether we have set a record in that respect. Clause 1 inserts new Section 42A into the Family Law Act 1996, which makes breach of a non-molestation order a criminal offence. I am aware that, for the most part, the provision has been welcomed by professional and voluntary organisations, but that there are some concerns. My amendments are intended to probe the operation of the clause. I look forward to the opportunity, when we debate Amendment No. 7, to probe the whole principle of the clause and whether it should be replaced by contempt proceedings.
<P>

<a name="40119-24_para14"></a>The maximum penalty for breach is five years. The Government have made clear their intention that the police will always be able to arrest for breach of a non-molestation order without the need for the courts to attach a power of arrest, or for the victim to apply to the civil court for an arrest warrant. Just about the only protection for the person who will be arrested is in proposed Section 42A(2), which provides that an individual would be guilty of the criminal offence only <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>if he or she was aware of the existence of the order. My probing amendment would add an extra layer of protection by requiring that the person should also be aware of the contents of the order. I note that Liberty supports that approach, although it would prefer the word "content" to be used rather than "terms". I bow to its superior knowledge on such drafting.
<P>

<a name="40119-24_para15"></a>Can the Minister confirm that the present drafting of the Bill would mean that an order would not have to be served upon the person who may be arrested, and therefore that they could be unaware of the exact content of the order? If so, will the noble Baroness explain the Government's reasons for providing that? Are there any other situations where a person can be guilty of an offence without being aware of the terms of an order? What will be the definition of "service"?
<P>

<a name="40119-24_para16"></a>The Family Law Bar Association responded to the Government's consultation on the basis that it supported the proposal to criminalise breach of orders:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"with the caveat that we do not support the criminalisation of breaches of orders that have been made 'without notice' and which have not been served upon the defendant".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-24_para17"></a>
I tabled the amendment in the light of that response. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40119-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   I see the point of giving the added protection of needing to have knowledge of the terms. But surely one can have a situation in which, although someone has no idea exactly what the terms of the order are, he is jolly certain that it covers what he proposes to do. Perhaps there ought to be a slightly different formulation, such as, "provided that he knows that he should not be doing it in accordance with the order". I have a nasty feeling that, at some stage, some bright lawyer will say, "He did not know about the terms", particularly if they are complex. We should not allow ourselves to get caught by that trap.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-25_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I support that view. I understand the difficulty as regards justice in knowing what is in an order. But given the number of cases in which I have been involved where a man has made certain that an order could not be served on him so that he did not know what was in it, in order not to meet the requirements, I am very uneasy about not having such a provision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-25_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   It was the concern expressed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, that caused us to draft the provisions of the Bill in the way that we have. The Government's intention in framing Clause 1 was to avoid one of the problems identified by many of those who responded to the Safety and Justice domestic violence consultation paper. Respondents to "without notice" orders often go to great lengths to avoid the service of such orders.
<P>

<a name="40119-25_para0"></a>Orders must be served in person and, by refusing to open their doors to the processors, respondents can continue to harass the applicant while truthfully claiming not to have been served with the order. This <P>


<a name="column_GC226"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC226</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>makes a mockery of court orders and the protection that they are supposed to provide. As the clause is currently drafted, a respondent who is aware of the existence of an order but who has evaded service or made no effort to ascertain its terms could be held to account for breaching the order.
<P>

<a name="40119-25_para1"></a>However, a person can be found guilty of breaching the order only if the breach is without reasonable excuse. That is covered by subsection (1). This could operate, for example, to protect a respondent who co-operated with the service of an order but who, because of blindness or illiteracy, was unable to discover its terms before inadvertently breaching one of them. The circumstances of such a failure to comply would be considered by the court. We believe that this provides the safeguard intended by the supporters of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40119-25_para2"></a>The amendment tabled in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, would allow respondents to non-molestation orders to evade service of the order and then to breach it with impunity on the grounds that they were not aware of its terms. I know that that is not the intention behind their amendment.
<P>

<a name="40119-25_para3"></a>I understand entirely the concerns that have been properly expressed to ensure that justice is seen to be done to both parties and not only to the complainant. We believe that the way in which subsection (1) is currently drafted enables a person who feels that he or she has genuinely not been served with an order, and/or has been unable to ascertain its content, to make use of that reasonable excuse and to put it before a court to make a determination on it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-25_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   The noble Baroness is right&#151;my noble friend and I were definitely not trying to define a situation where people could get out from under and fail to obey the terms of an order that had been properly imposed by a court, merely by evading finding out what the order was about.
<P>

<a name="40119-25_para4"></a>Can the noble Baroness indicate whether there is any other case in English statute law where someone can be convicted for the breach of an order when they do not know its terms? Is this brand-new legislation or is it replicated from a previous statute? If the Minister cannot answer today, I would be happy for her to write to me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-25_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I shall certainly look at other legislation. However, "without reasonable excuse" is a catch-all phrase that has been interpreted in other circumstances. It will enable a person who has been accused of a breach to come forward and say, "I was not served; I had no notice of it; and, even if I had had notice of it, I could not have read it". That will be a question of fact in any given case because, for instance, for those who seek to evade improperly, there would doubtless be evidence to say, "The process server came and put his foot in the door. You slammed the door shut. He shouted the contents of the order through the door. You obviously had a discussion where you could have heard it and you sought to evade it".

<a name="40119-25_para5"></a>It comes down to a question of fact, to be determined by the court in any given case, as to whether the person had a reasonable excuse or not and should have known about the order or not. The court will then determine whether, having that knowledge, they were improperly or wrongfully in breach of the order. I shall certainly look to see if there is any other legislation and write to the noble Baroness.

<A NAME="40119-25_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful that the noble Baroness will ascertain whether this is new legislation or whether existing legislation covers a similar point. I am grateful also for her further explanation of the "without reasonable excuse" part of subsection (1). I wholly accept that it provides a route of protection. In my limited experience as a magistrate, not only are there occasions when someone may try to evade knowing what is in an order but, conversely, in some situations there is no attempt to evade finding out that there is an order but service is not affected. Even when service is available, it may be a very low priority for the police, the Post Office or whoever is delivering the order. Things can go wrong. One does not want a situation where a person who would have obeyed the order if he knew the contents&#151;he is, in that respect, innocent&#151;suffers the full punishment of the provision. I am grateful to the Minister. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40119-25_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 6:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 2, after "punished" insert "or dealt with"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-25_para7"></a><P>

<a name="40119-25_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment raises a minor probing point on drafting. I hope for an explanation to clear up something that I find puzzling. Subsection (4) provides that a person cannot be convicted on a breach of a non-molestation order where he or she has been punished for that conduct by way of contempt of court proceedings. My amendment seeks an explanation of what the Government define as "punishment" in the context of this subsection.
<P>

<a name="40119-25_para9"></a>In a case where only a costs order is made, does that fall within the definition of "punishment"? That point has been put to me by organisations outwith this House and I want to place it on the record. I note that the Explanatory Notes contain a form of wording different from that in the Bill. There is no harm in that; we merely seek an explanation.
<P>

<a name="40119-25_para10"></a>Paragraph 25 of the Explanatory Notes states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"where an individual has been convicted of a breach of a non-molestation order, he cannot be punished subsequently for contempt, and vice versa".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-25_para11"></a>
Why is there a reference to "convicted" in the Explanatory Notes but a reference to "punished" in the Bill? It has been pointed out that the Government <P>


<a name="column_GC228"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC228</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>may have followed the drafting of Section 3(8) of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A person cannot be convicted of an offence under subsection (6) in respect of any conduct which has been punished as a contempt of court."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-25_para12"></a>
Whether or not the Government are following that drafting, I would still be grateful to know whether the provision covers the situation where only a costs order has been made. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-25_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I shall try to respond to this amendment more fully than I would have done otherwise in the hope of addressing the points raised by the noble Baroness. In making a breach of a non-molestation order a criminal offence, Clause 1 retains the option for breach of an order to be dealt with as a civil contempt of court. For instance, there could be a situation where the first person to arrive at the scene of a breach is a police officer, and therefore that is how the incident is dealt with. Alternatively, the complainant may assert that there has been a breach and bring the matter back to the court, which will then adjudicate on whether there has been a breach and deal with any breach.
<P>

<a name="40119-25_para13"></a>As the noble Baroness knows, the punishment for dealing with contempt could take a number of forms. The person could be sent to prison as a result of the contempt; there could be a suspended imprisonment order; the person could be made to make a payment; there could be any kind of response. The court may say that there has been a technical breach but that it will not impose a punishment save for costs and an additional warning. For instance, someone could put his foot over the threshold, not raise his voice and remove his foot when asked. That is technically a breach, but it might not be punished by imprisonment; it might be dealt with in another way. Thus subsection (4) provides that a person cannot be convicted of the criminal offence of breach of a non-molestation order if the same conduct has already been punished as a contempt of court. The Government's intention is to prevent someone being punished twice for the same breach.
<P>

<a name="40119-25_para14"></a>As the noble Baroness has rightly highlighted, the same issue is dealt with in the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, where breach of an injunction taken out under Section 3 is a criminal offence. That Act took the approach that we are taking in the Bill: preventing double jeopardy without preventing separate proceedings for separate offences arising from the same incident.
<P>

<a name="40119-25_para15"></a>The amendment would put this Bill out of step with the Protection from Harassment Act. However, I understand that the noble Baroness has sought to probe the Government's thinking. It is also unnecessary because, in practice, the Crown Prosecution Service is most unlikely to bring a case in the criminal courts if the alleged breach has already been the subject of contempt proceedings in the civil court. However, noble Lords know that the breach of the order is a separate matter from something like an offence of grievous bodily harm that may flow from it, and those would have to be separated. However, this <P>


<a name="column_GC229"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC229</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is to prevent double jeopardy. For these reasons, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel that her amendment is not necessary.

<A NAME="40119-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford </B>   moved Amendment No. 7:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Leave out Clause 1 and insert the following new Clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-26_para1"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "POWER OF ARREST
<br>
 In Part 4 of the Family Law Act 1996 (c. 27) (family homes and domestic violence), for section 47(2) substitute&#151;
<br>
"(2) If the court makes a relevant order, it shall attach a power of arrest to such provisions of the order as will adequately protect the applicant or child from the risk of significant harm attributable to the conduct of the respondent."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40119-26_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: Noble Lords may recall that when Albert was eaten by the lion, Ma's reaction was to say, "Someone's got to be summonsed". Clause 1, although under the heading "Domestic violence etc", is a small provision being trumpeted as much more than it is.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para3"></a>Making the breach of a non-molestation order&#151;a civil order&#151;a criminal offence will cause delay, waste resources and will not advance the Government's policy objectives to give further protection to the victims of domestic violence. I suggest that those objectives can be much better realised by strengthening the powers of the civil judge who made the non-molestation order in the first place. Noble Lords should always bear in mind that, before these provisions can come into effect, the person who is the victim of the conduct of the respondent has already gone to the civil court and obtained, with legal advice and assistance, a civil order from the judge.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para4"></a>The victim of domestic violence has at all times the full protection of the criminal law: protection against assault, against rape, and all other similar types of conduct. So a non-molestation order is no substitute for the protections that are given by the criminal law to the victims of domestic violence as they are to everyone else. But although victims report such criminal acts to the police, they will frequently withdraw their complaints or, if they go to court, fail to give the necessary evidence. If one pauses to consider why that should be, it is because wives and partners do not necessarily want to make their partners criminals and send them to prison. What they want is for the offending conduct towards them to stop. Because criminal proceedings against a partner are so frequently withdrawn, in the past the police have failed to take domestic violence as seriously as they ought. That is the reason why I said at Second Reading that it is good to learn that the police are now being trained to take domestic violence much more seriously than they did in the past.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para5"></a>Why therefore should it be assumed that victims who have already taken the step of going to the civil court and obtaining the required order will wish to pursue their partners for breach of that civil order in <P>


<a name="column_GC230"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC230</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the criminal court? Why, in those circumstances, would they be willing to face the publicity and unpleasant atmosphere in the criminal courts to pursue the criminalisation of their partner? As I have said, all they want is for the conduct to stop; they do not necessarily want the person concerned to be sent to prison so that he can no longer support them or fulfil the maintenance order.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para6"></a>The first criticism made by the Government of the present civil procedure is that there is no automatic power of arrest attached to an order. Amendment No. 7 would provide that a power of arrest shall be attached to every non-molestation order and occupation order made by a civil judge. Of course, it may not be necessary to attach a power of arrest to every provision contained in a non-molestation or occupation order, but it will be at the discretion of a civil judge to decide just what merits the application of the power of arrest. The amendment is worded to provide that the court shall attach a mandatory provision, a power of arrest,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to such provisions of the order as will adequately protect the applicant or child from the risk of significant harm attributable to the conduct of the respondent".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-26_para7"></a>
Noble Lords will note that, unlike in the Bill, it is our view that the protection should extend not only to a non-molestation order, but to an occupation order.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para8"></a>The Government said at Second Reading that the police were confused about their powers of arrest. Amendment No. 9 therefore makes provision for registering orders with the chief officer of police in such a way that the provisions of that order can readily be made available to an officer on the beat. Already, under the Family Law Act 1996, he is entitled to arrest on the reasonable suspicion that the order has been breached, with the provision that the arrested person must be brought before the court within 24 hours.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para9"></a>We argue that the contents of a civil order should immediately be made available to an officer so that, if necessary, he could radio in to check on the computer what precisely is stated in the order; that is, what conduct it actually prevents. The converse is that, as at present, unless the victim making the complaint can produce the order, the constable will have no idea what particular matter is covered by the order.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para10"></a>A further criticism is that contempt of court carries a maximum penalty of only two years' imprisonment under Section 14(1) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981. But that maximum is stated in the section to be subject to any other provision, so that in a specific case it would not prevent the sentence being limited to two years' imprisonment. Amendment No. 10 therefore extends the power of the court to the same degree as the powers given to the Crown Court and the magistrates' court in Clause 1. In practice, it is unlikely that lengthy sentences of the kind proposed in the Bill would ever be given in either the civil or criminal jurisdiction. If the defendant is to be imprisoned for up to five years, he certainly must have committed another criminal offence such as assault to merit a sentence of that length. However, in drafting the amendments, I followed the maximum of five years' imprisonment and the same level of fine.
<P>


<a name="column_GC231"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC231</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para11"></a>As I said, the amendments extend to occupation orders as well as to non-molestation orders. According to paragraph 26 of the Explanatory Notes, the Government have decided not to make the breach of an occupation order a criminal offence because,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"[a] history of violence or molestation is not a prerequisite for the grant of an order".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-26_para12"></a>
But occupation orders play a very important part in protecting victims of domestic violence. There is no logical reason why such a distinction should be drawn if it is thought right to go down the criminal route. It has already happened, of course: breach of a civil order against harassment was made a criminal offence by the Government in contentious legislation that they passed some time ago.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para13"></a>I urge the Government to think again on this principle. Making the breach of a non-molestation order a criminal offence really does nothing. The objectives can be better achieved through the civil route. The advantages are manifold. Amendment No. 10, for example, contains a provision that would permit the hearing of committal proceedings, where it is in the interests of justice to do so, to be held in private. It may be far easier for victims of domestic violence to go before the judge in private, as happens in children's cases at the moment, and make their complaint&#151;provided, as the amendment sets out, that the results of that application are fully publicised in open court, with the terms of the order, the reasons for it and so on.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para14"></a>The evidence provisions in the civil court are more favourable to the victim. Evidence can be given by affidavit; the judge has discretion whether to order cross-examination; and he may decide in a particular case, having regard to the circumstances of the victim, that it would not be appropriate to do so. The civil evidence rules, which permit hearsay and have other advantages, also apply. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, for pointing out that I was quite wrong in suggesting at Second Reading that the civil standard of proof would apply. Where the liberty of the subject is concerned, it is virtually the criminal standard of proof that applies, even in the civil courts.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para15"></a>There is a great deal more speed in the civil courts. Applications can be made ex parte. There was a discussion earlier about the possibility that a respondent could avoid service of the order or service of the application for committal. But an ex parte order can be made which could result in the respondent being arrested and brought before the judge who made the order as soon as he is arrested so that whatever he has to say about the matter can be properly heard. The ability to make orders of that nature is a very useful power; they cannot be made in the magistrates' court or the Crown Court.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para16"></a>In civil courts, applications can be made out of hours and expeditiously. Where speed is essential to protect the victim or the children, it is possible to make an application for an order of committal even in the judge's home. Those of us who have intervened in the dining arrangements of judges know that, although it is not particularly popular, such a power can be exercised.
<P>


<a name="column_GC232"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC232</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para17"></a>The judge also has a discretion, which the magistrate's court does not have&#151;for example, not to commit a person to prison for a technical breach of the order. A magistrate's court, faced with the crime of disobedience to a non-molestation order, would be obliged to find a person guilty and to impose a punishment. But the civil judge does not have to do that. He can decide that it is simply a technical breach and that on such an occasion he would not order committal to prison.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para18"></a>He may also, in his discretion, have the defendant or respondent before him and give him a last chance. Magistrates cannot do that; if they find a person guilty they have to make an order of some kind. On the other hand, a judge can say to the respondent, "This is the last time you are going to do it. If you breach this order again you will be back in front of me and you know what will happen to you".
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para19"></a>Furthermore, the judge can suspend the committal. There is a limited power to suspend sentences. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 might have extended that power a little, but it is not normally done in criminal proceedings today. It is open to a civil judge to suspend committal if he believes that it is right to do so.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para20"></a>Finally, if a judge is satisfied that a person has purged his contempt and given satisfactory undertakings&#151;perhaps the relationship is finally accepted as having come to an end&#151;he can discharge the respondent from prison. All those discretionary powers make the use of civil powers much more flexible than is proposed in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para21"></a>Then there are practical matters. The papers whereby the non-molestation order was obtained in the first place from the civil court will no doubt have to be passed to the magistrates' court. If there is a breach of the non-molestation order, the matter must go to the police, who make recourse to the CPS, which then decides whether to prosecute. It may take a long time for the matter to come to court. The magistrates will then start from scratch and will have to be informed of the background and all the circumstances between the applicant and the defendant. They will have to come to a conclusion in the light of all the information that they have to learn from scratch. So the bringing of proceedings for a criminal offence are less flexible, certainly less speedy and do not add to the protection that the victim is entitled to expect.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para22"></a>There is much to be said for leaving the matter in the hands of the judge who made the original order. He can always tell the respondent, "If you breach this order, you will go in front of me as soon as you are arrested". That is a far greater deterrent than the possibility of appearing in front of the magistrates' court, with the possibility that the wife or partner will not give evidence against you in those circumstances, and the publicity. It is therefore a much greater deterrent.
<P>

<a name="40119-26_para23"></a>It is in those circumstances that I suggest that the Government, in Clause 1, are doing no more than making a gesture that is of no practical use to victims of domestic violence. If there are problems in the civil courts&#151;I do not suggest that there are&#151;and the <P>

They will serve, alongside the guidance that the Court of Appeal has given in that case, as the staging posts along the road to redress of this unsatisfactory regime. The integrated court in New York is an example of the proposed new integrated court, in which both civil and criminal jurisdictions are merged. The Court of Appeal referred to that court with considerable approval. Until the proposed new court exists, the noble Lord's amendments would serve as an essential safeguard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   Anyone who listened to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, could not be other than impressed by the force of the argument he makes. His case is really unanswerable.
<P>

<a name="40119-27_para0"></a>Let me make three brief points. First, I agree entirely that using the civil court would mean the retention of the same judge, who would have knowledge of the facts of the case. That in itself is important. Secondly, as the noble Lord made clear, the means of getting before the courts is likely in practice to be more speedy in the civil courts than in the criminal court. Thirdly, I agree with his point that people may wish to go back to court on the breach of a non-molestation order without wishing that the person against whom they originally made the complaint should be criminalised for life as a result and in ways that may affect themselves.
<P>

<a name="40119-27_para1"></a>There is much force in the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. The only difficulty at the moment is that the civil courts are perhaps unwilling to use adequately the power to attach an arrest warrant at the time when the original non-molestation order is made. If, as the amendment suggests, they could be encouraged to exercise that power more frequently than they do at the moment, I cannot see what victims have to gain by making the breach of a non-molestation order into a criminal offence. For the reasons outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, they have much to lose.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   Perhaps I may make one very small point. I am impressed by the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas. It may well be that the Contempt of Court Act ought to be strengthened by altering the maximum penalty. But it would be very difficult to justify putting the breach of a non-molestation order higher than, say, contempt of court by interfering with judicial proceedings, which might have cataclysmic consequences, not only for the <P>


<a name="column_GC234"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC234</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people concerned but also for a much wider public. It is a very minor point&#151;this is a probing amendment&#151;but I thought I should mention it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-27_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   Being among so many lawyers, I again feel that I am in the lion's den. I support the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, although I recognise that the Government may not want to take such a radical step.
<P>

<a name="40119-27_para2"></a>Many people involved in social care have long suggested more radical changes in the legal system, looking to family courts as alternatives to the split between the criminal jurisdiction and the civil jurisdiction. Clearly, one set of circumstances can be split simply by the way in which we have put our courts together.
<P>

<a name="40119-27_para3"></a>I know that women, having taken themselves to the civil courts, find it extremely difficult to take action which criminalises their partners. Not only do they not want to do it because it may affect the fathers of their children but also because they are quite fearful. There is a range of different reasons why women do not want to take such action, from criminalisation to fear of the person involved.
<P>

<a name="40119-27_para4"></a>The suggestion for one court, which could attach orders to give women the protection they need in one fell swoop and to where they could return to a judge with knowledge of the case, has huge merit. However, I fear that that is the kind of radical option that the Government may not yet be ready to take.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-27_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   Turning first to Amendment No. 7, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, I have sympathy with his objective. However, I certainly cannot support the amendment today, for two reasons. First, because I only read it on Friday, there was no way that I could get policy clearance to accept it at such short notice. Secondly, I have some problems with the drafting. I am sure that the noble Lord moved it to advance the debate on the matter of principle, rather than being wedded to the detail.
<P>

<a name="40119-27_para5"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, I am concerned about delay in Clause 1 by making the breach of non-molestation orders a criminal offence. We must bend our minds to how we may reduce delay, which will benefit both parties, because they will know what is to be their situation.
<P>

<a name="40119-27_para6"></a>I noticed that when introducing Amendment No. 7, the noble Lord referred to the fact that the new clause used the phraseology,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such as will adequately protect",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-27_para7"></a>
to give the court some discretion on whether it acted. As he made clear, non-molestation orders and occupation orders are not exclusively made where there has been violence or a threat of violence. They can be made on other occasions&#151;I shall return to that.
<P>

<a name="40119-27_para8"></a>So I was puzzled why the noble Lord had diverged so considerably from the existing provision of the Family Law Act 1996 in his proposed new subsection (2), because his amendment would remove the <P>


<a name="column_GC235"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC235</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>requirement for some evidence of violence or threat of violence before the power of arrest was attached. Perhaps he will reconsider that before Report&#151;when I suspect that he will retable the amendment. After all, this is a domestic violence Bill.
<P>

<a name="40119-27_para9"></a>I can see the initial attraction of a scheme such as proposed in Amendment No. 9 for the register of orders. The noble Lord was beguiling, because he made it sound such good common sense that one ought to have such a register so that the police could readily have access to information that would make it easier for them to do their job. That point has been well made by organisations outwith this Chamber.
<P>

<a name="40119-27_para10"></a>However, before one moved an amendment later, when one might try to test the opinion of the House, one would need some information about what administrative burden and cost that would impose and what research had been done into how effective such a register could be. That is especially true because, as I said on Amendment No. 7, non-molestation orders do not necessarily come within the remit of the type of breach of order that would properly be the subject of such a register. Are all non-molestation orders to be subject to the register? If so, I dread to think how much information the police will have to wade through to reach the nugget of information that, as the noble Lord rightly said, they should be able to reach easily so that they can take proper action. So, again, I like the objective; I am not sure that the amendment delivers what the noble Lord wants.
<P>

<a name="40119-27_para11"></a>Returning to the principle of the amendment, when I read it, I reread some of the original material that we have been sent by outside organisations. For example, I knew that the Women's National Commission had referred to the matter in its report&#151;I shall not repeat its title, which is long; we have been there and done that. On page 17, it states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Women had mixed feelings about the proposal to maintain a register of injunctions and domestic violence offenders, which would work along the lines of the Sex Offenders Register. Records were of great importance, but women wanted to be able to access a register themselves"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-27_para12"></a>
not just the police, the women want access too. It continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Some women were frightened that the men would blame them for putting them on the register".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-27_para13"></a>
So there is ambivalence in some of the research on the matter.
<P>

<a name="40119-27_para14"></a>The report continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"women felt strongly that the police must know whether there was a history of domestic violence when called to an incident".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-27_para15"></a>
It then makes a policing point that goes wider than the amendment, but which is core to the problem:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Community police officers should have that knowledge at their fingertips".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-27_para16"></a>
The report then recognises that if we cannot have the continuity and level of policing that we want, at least a register of current and expired injunctions would provide that information. We will need carefully to consider what kind of register is intended under the amendment.
<P>


<a name="column_GC236"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC236</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40119-27_para17"></a>I was really puzzled by Amendment No. 10. When he introduced it, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, was clear, but the amendment puzzles me for the simple reason that it refers to "an inferior court" in circumstances that make it appear that that means the county court. I think that he misunderstands the implications of that. After all, magistrates' and county courts are inferior courts. A magistrate has no power to commit in such circumstances. Because the country court is an inferior court, it would have no inherent jurisdiction. That would undermine what the noble Lord is trying to achieve by the new clause. It looks as though the noble Lord is increasing the maximum penalty for contempt from two years to five years in the superior court. That is the issue to which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, referred in relation to the Contempt of Court Act. However, the noble Lord seems to reduce the penalty to 12 months in the inferior court. Because the county court is an inferior court, as I understand it, its jurisdiction would go down. I do not think that that is what the noble Lord intended. Perhaps I misunderstood.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I can assist the noble Baroness by telling her that the wording is lifted straight from Section 14(1) of the Contempt of Court Act, as I recall. It had not occurred to me that "an inferior court" would refer in those circumstances to the county court, which has wider powers of dealing with contempt.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-27_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   This is a problem that one would have to look at, because breaches of non-molestation orders are, and almost invariably will be, held in the county court under the procedure. With that recognition, my puzzlement continues a bit. Perhaps I will be enlightened at some later stage. I certainly welcome the noble Lord's attempt to address the important issue by extending the contempt procedure, but I am not sure that he is there yet.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040119/text/40119-28.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   The noble Baroness is entirely right. The county court undoubtedly is an inferior court, because the divisional court has jurisdiction over it. It has no jurisdiction over the superior court.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-28_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I thank the noble and learned Lord for that comment. He has saved me a few words, for which I am most grateful.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para0"></a>I want to start by telling the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, that, although he feels that the matter has been trumpeted overmuch and is of little utility, that is not the response of those who have been subject to domestic violence. Members of the Committee know that the provisions went out to quite extensive consultation, and the respondents were overwhelmingly in favour of the proposals. However, some felt that there was a need to retain the option of enforcement through the civil courts. We have done that. Nothing in the proposals seeks to expunge the role of the civil court through the county court. Nothing in them would limit or prohibit a person going through the civil route, if they were minded so to do.
<P>


<a name="column_GC237"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC237</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para1"></a>A complaint that has for many years been a running sore with complainants is that those who have an officer come to their door seeking to assist sometimes do not have the clarity of their position sufficiently understood by the officer, in terms of whether the person can be arrested. Sometimes the fact that the complainant is able to call for assistance, so that the officer can arrest and remove the perpetrator from the scene, provides valuable succour to the complainant. Therefore, I was troubled to hear how the noble Lord described the matter. I am sure that he would not wish to cause offence to victims of domestic violence, for whom the provisions have been much sought.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para2"></a>With the indulgence of the Committee, I will deal with Amendments Nos. 7 and 10 at the same time, as it appears that they are linked. Amendment No. 7 would remove the criminal sanction from a breach of a non-molestation order as envisaged by Clause 1, and would instead retain contempt of court as the sanction for breach. Amendment No. 10, as we have just discussed, would increase the term of imprisonment available to the courts for breach of non-molestation and occupation orders from two to five years.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para3"></a>There are a number of reasons why contempt of court is not a sufficient or effective sanction. Contempt of court is of course a very serious matter and has always been so. However, many victims with whom we have spoken have stressed to us the disdain in which the offender holds the non-molestation order&#151;even where a power of arrest is attached to that order. We are concerned that the sanction for breach of a non-molestation order must bring home to the respondent the seriousness of that breach. That is why we wish to make breach a criminal offence.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para4"></a>Members of the Committee will know that a difficulty that has plagued those who have sought to address domestic violence is that there is an erroneous belief that, somehow, beating and abusing one's partner differs significantly from beating and abusing a stranger in the street. It is thought that one can beat a stranger in the street and expect to be arrested and brought to justice for assault, grievous bodily harm and so on, but there is an erroneous belief that abusing and mistreating a spouse or partner is somehow permissible and differs in nature to what is visited on a stranger. That has caused us difficulty in the system for some time.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para5"></a>Making breach a criminal offence would also extend the range of sanctions available to the courts to punish the offender. Contempt of court limits the sanctions to imprisonment or fine. Where a breach is a criminal offence, the courts would also be able to impose the usual range of community sentences. I listened with great interest to the comments that the noble Lord made in relation to criminal cases, but I wondered whether he had forgotten the many hours that we enjoyed together on the then Criminal Justice Bill. Sections 189 and 190 of that Act provide that, on conviction, conditions can be imposed to do with curfew, mental health, drug treatment, voluntary activities, residence and supervision. If the person does <P>


<a name="column_GC238"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC238</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not comply with those conditions, a suspended sentence can take effect. Until now, it could do so only if another offence were committed.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para6"></a>That gives the court an opportunity to deal with the offending behaviour. Many partners who find themselves involved in domestic violence are in need of anger management, drug treatment and a whole series of other interventions that will inure to the benefit not only of that partner, but of partners who may come afterwards. Members of the Committee will know that, in the analysis of partners who kill, it is very unusual indeed if those persons have not had a series of partners whom they have abused on the way to the murder that they eventually commit. It is not simply the complainant on the day whom we have to protect, but all the other partners who may come afterwards. That should exercise our attention, because of the nature of domestic violence.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para7"></a>There is a separate issue of enforcement of non-molestation orders and the potential for operational confusion. Information on orders and powers of arrest is not recorded centrally and the arrangements for passing such information both within and between police forces can be inconsistent. That can be a problem if both the applicant and the respondent have moved to a new police-force area. As a result, the police may be unclear to which part of the order any power of arrest may be attached. As it stands, Amendment No. 7 would not remove that potential for confusion because it does not require the power of arrest to attach to the whole of the order. Rather it specifies that it would attach to those provisions which adequately protect the applicant or child from significant harm.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para8"></a>Our aim is to ensure the immediate safety of the applicant and any children, and we want to underline the seriousness of any breach. That is why Clause 1 makes a breach of the order a criminal offence. We also want to ensure an effective police response, so that in all cases the police will know what powers they have when called to incidents of domestic violence where a non-molestation order is in place. So Amendment No. 7 would not provide the clarity needed to enforce the order and, even when coupled with Amendment No. 10, would not underline the seriousness of the breach.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para9"></a>I turn now to the issue of attachment to occupation orders. Noble Lords will no doubt have noted that paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 4 puts the court under a duty to consider whether a non-molestation order should be made when considering whether to make an occupation order ensuring that any necessary protection is in place. We understand that there may be cases where it is not appropriate to make a non-molestation order, but a specific duty is provided to make sure that the court is aware of the difficulty and can address it.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para10"></a>Amendment No. 10 also seeks to allow a court to hear applications for an order of committal in private if it appears to be in the interests of justice to do so. Those noble Lords who have participated in committal hearings will know that, like criminal trials, they are generally heard in public with counsel or a <P>


<a name="column_GC239"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC239</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>solicitor fully robed. If one is talking about contempt, one may be considering the removal of an individual's liberty. That is something the court always takes seriously and which in the ordinary way takes place in open court. This is important to maintain confidence in the justice system, ensuring&#151;in that time-honoured phrase&#151;that justice is seen to be done. However, the court has the power to sit in private in certain situations, such as where the case relates to the welfare of a child or to a person suffering from a mental disorder. We believe that this strikes the right balance.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para11"></a>Amendment No. 9 would oblige a court that made an occupation or non-molestation order under the Family Law Act 1996 to cause a certified copy of the order to be sent to the chief officer of police for the place where the applicant resides. It also imposes a duty on chief officers of police to prepare and maintain a register of such orders for use by officers under their command. I should say that the comments by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, on how in practice this would operate were well made.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para12"></a>We suggest that Amendment No. 9 is unnecessary because the Government are already working to create a register of orders, a point I made clear at Second Reading in my response to the noble Earl, Lord Rosslyn. The register does not require legislation. Instead of the separate register for each police force implied by this amendment, we intend to create a single database of orders. This will deal with one of the problems raised in the responses to Safety and Justice: if an applicant travels to a different area and the respondent pursues them and breaches the order, the police in that area will not be aware of the existence of the terms of the order. A central register would give all police forces access to information about orders and with that the ability to enforce them wherever a breach occurs.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para13"></a>Rules of court already make provision for service of orders on the police, and we intend to look at revising them to clarify the obligations. Placing the courts under a statutory obligation to do so in primary legislation is not necessary. The effect of Amendment No. 9 is also unclear as it does not specify the time frame within which courts would have to send the order. I hope that I have dealt with the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para14"></a>In response to the concerns raised by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, which we shall discuss shortly when we deal with the amendment on integrated courts, the requirement for a court to be able to respond appropriately will not necessitate the change advocated by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. It is to be hoped that the way in which the provisions will be applied by all courts that deal with domestic violence will give us an integrated and appropriate approach. I should add how pleased I am that the noble Lord has stayed with us in Committee. I hope that we will have a long and fruitful association through the many days on which we will enjoy together the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, in many ways took up the refrain on the concerns echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. As regards <P>


<a name="column_GC240"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC240</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>continuity, all the provisions will continue to be in force. I take on board the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, and echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, that some women do not wish to criminalise their husbands but wish to have the abuse stopped. It will be possible to continue to do that through the civil route. But we should also take on board that the very abusive nature of domestic violence often erodes the will of the woman, who may need the greater support offered by the criminal court as well as that of the civil court, and that an intervention of that nature may prove necessary.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para16"></a>Many have said that they have benefited from having a police officer come to the door to arrest and remove the assailant. The courts can apply those provisions with flexibility and speed. We do not accept that they will be longer drawn-out as a result of the procedures. We will be assisted greatly by the way in which case management is currently dealt with and the fact that the CPS is working very closely with the police and the courts to get together protocols so that we have a holistic approach to domestic violence.
<P>

<a name="40119-28_para17"></a>I respectfully disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. In fact there will be equal&#151;or greater&#151;opportunity to respond to technical breaches as a result of the new provisions in the Criminal Justice Act as ever there was in the county court. This is not least because the criminal courts are likely to have a more extensive palette from which to operate. We cannot accept the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-29_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I think there has been a reference to the gender Bill. Suddenly I seem to have changed my gender even before the Bill has been enacted. That is a worry.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   It is no longer important. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for her criticisms.
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para0"></a>In Amendment No. 7 I seek to get away from the necessity for proof of violence before a power of arrest is added to a non-molestation order. There are other ways of molesting people that do not involve violence&#151;for example, excessive telephone calls, e-mails and so on&#151;all of which should be subjected to a power of arrest.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-29_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   The noble Lord has raised a very important point. I wondered whether that point lay behind his original argument. There is concern that how one interprets behaviour is a matter of balance. As the noble Lord says, excessive e-mails&#151;what is excessive?&#151;and pestering might amount to <P>


<a name="column_GC241"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC241</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>violence. As the noble Lord will know from his own experience, the courts have had to take careful consideration of when behaviour alleged to be excessive by one party is not so at all. There is particular concern that improper allegations of such behaviour can be made. It is a very delicate area. I am glad that the noble Lord mentioned it as we will need to consider it very carefully before returning to the subject.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I am grateful for that contribution.
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para1"></a>I turn to the contribution made by the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal. I maintain that Clause 1 is a gesture that has no significant practical effect. Organisations that are concerned with victims of domestic violence may have supported the Government's plan to criminalise the breach of a non-molestation order, but the Government have been promoting the Bill. They have not trumpeted the defects, as I have outlined them, in the proposed procedure, nor have they trumpeted the advantages of strengthening the present civil powers. I am not surprised that the organisations concerned with victims are ready to seize on anything that appears to advance their cause.
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said that one of the problems of following the civil procedures is that, often, the victim's will has been eroded by a long series of acts on the part of a respondent who is in breach of a non-molestation order. Why should it be assumed that a person whose will has been eroded will turn up in a magistrates' court and give evidence, rather than withdraw the complaint of breach of a non-molestation order? Such people do not turn up to give evidence and support claims of assault, and so on, that have already been brought before the court.
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para3"></a>The noble Baroness referred to the disdain that respondents had for the non-molestation order. Why do they have such disdain, if they are to be locked up, as proposed? If the non-molestation order is enforced and a person is brought before the courts for contempt and sent to prison, it is difficult to see why, within the prison walls, he should maintain such disdain. That argument carries no weight.
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para4"></a>The Minister made a good point about sanctions. I considered whether it would be possible to include in my amendments the range of community sentences that is open to the criminal courts. It is possible, but I did not have time to do it. Between now and Report, I propose to consider whether it is possible to include in the powers of the civil judge a power not simply to imprison and to fine but to put into effect the sort of community sentence that may, in certain circumstances&#151;not in all&#151;be advantageous.
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para5"></a>The other matter that the Minister mentioned was the effectiveness of the police response to civil orders. They have no clarity about powers of arrest and no clarity about the terms of the order. I seek to deal with that through the amendments, and I propose to improve those provisions, with regard to the criticisms made by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay of St Johns.

<a name="40119-29_para6"></a>As for hearings in private, we in our party would be the first to demand open justice, but the provisions of the Family Law Act at present permit, as the noble Baroness said, for hearings involving children and people with a mental disorder to be heard in private, which is exactly along the lines of the amendment. Proposed new Section 58B(2) mirrors those provisions for children and people suffering from a mental disorder. It is arguable&#151;it should be considered further&#151;whether the victims of domestic violence should, where it is in the interests of justice, have the protection of private hearings.
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para7"></a>If that were put to organisations concerned with the victims of domestic violence, would they support it? I am certain that they would. They know that it is the publicity of the criminal courts that deters victims from seeking the protection to which they are entitled.
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para8"></a>As for Amendment No. 9, the criticism made is that I have not gone far enough. One often hears such criticism of resolutions in Liberal Democrat assemblies. It is often said: "Your resolution does not go far enough". That is the case here. I am pleased that there is the suggestion of a central database. I did not dare to suggest it. But if the Government prefer that suggestion and are pursuing it, it would be far better than the provisions I have set out in the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para9"></a>Consequently, I shall adopt it in a further amendment on Report and hope that the noble Baroness will feel ready to support a better database than the one I have suggested. The proposed database will have a wider application and will make clear, wherever she may be in the country, what order and protection a victim is entitled to and where the powers of arrest of the police officers concerned will arise.

<P>
<A NAME="40119-29_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I hesitate to interrupt the noble Lord, but I should make plain that we are not proposing a statutory database and therefore we do not seek any amendment to this or any other Bill. My response to the noble Lord is likely to be, "Yes, we are doing that, but not under the auspices of a statutory regime".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   We can discuss at a later stage why it should not be under the auspices of a statutory regime, which would ensure that the principle is carried out with as little delay as possible. Rules can be promulgated and brought into force at any time. It might be better to use this opportunity to lay down the framework of a central database that would cover such orders.
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para10"></a>There is much more to be done on my part in drafting further amendments for Report. I shall return to the topic. I will consider everything that has been said on all sides. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40119-29_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway </B>   moved Amendment No. 8:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 1, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-29_para13"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "INTEGRATED COURT FOR CASES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
<br>
 An integrated Court shall be set up having criminal and civil jurisdiction and remedies over cases of domestic violence."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40119-29_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: The circumstances in which the amendment was tabled at the request of the Court of Appeal have already been spoken to on Amendments Nos. 2, 7, 9 and 10. The only practical effective response the Committee may give to the request of the Court of Appeal is to support the amendment and to assert the principle that the integrated court should be set up. This is no occasion on which to examine a closely reasoned judgment of the Court of Appeal. Put quite simply&#151;although it is not simple&#151;the two jurisdictions operate in parallel; they are not mutually exclusive; they deal at diverse times with the same offence and afford disparate remedies. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth of Breckland, said that the parallel system was not satisfactory. Some of the reasons she gave certainly square with the reasons given by the Court of Appeal.
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para15"></a>The amendment is wholly consistent with the intention of the Bill. It is free standing of the Bill and of any amendments. There is an urgency to introduce some measure. I hope that the amendment commends itself to Members of the Committee and, in particular, to the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland. It is quite apparent that she is all too familiar with these matters. I assume that she has read the transcript of the judgment of the Court of Appeal. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-29_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend for tabling the amendment, giving the Government the opportunity to respond to views expressed by the Court of Appeal in Lomas v Parle, and to the views expressed by several organisations which briefed noble Lords at Second Reading.
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para16"></a>The Women's National Commission report of its consultation exercise recorded strong support for dedicated domestic violence courts. It noted that going to court was an ordeal and that very few women were afforded vulnerable or intimidated witness status, which would have made the process of giving evidence easier. It also noted that some areas around the country have pilot specialist courts which are considered to work very well.
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para17"></a>I was also intrigued by the response of the Family Law Bar Association&#151;which supports my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway's proposal&#151;when the matter was the subject of government consultation last year. The FLBA stated that the advantages of specialist courts are clear. First, it would provide a streamlined process that should help to address delays in listing. Secondly, a specialist court would be better placed to deal with issues around disclosure and publicity. Thirdly, the special jurisdiction would be better informed in terms of sentencing for first offences and reoffending, and could also deal with breaches of civil orders.
<P>


<a name="column_GC244"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC244</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para18"></a>Fourthly, the FLBA argues that an holistic approach would be more likely to ensure the protection of the victim and family than is the case when different issues are assigned to different courts. Fifthly, family judges are highly experienced specialists well able to deal with evidential issues arising between civil and criminal proceedings. Family courts are familiar with the kind of expert evidence presented in these circumstances; namely, evidence of the impact of domestic violence on the victim and the family.
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para19"></a>Finally, if courts with special jurisdiction were incorporated into the family court structure, the FLBA believes that there could be a reduction in the number of hearings required, potentially providing greater continuity of approach. The association acknowledges that for the proposal to work there would have to be a commitment to create an infrastructure able to cope with the additional demands of such a scheme.
<P>

<a name="40119-29_para20"></a>Have the Government considered fully the proposals of the FLBA and the response from the Women's National Commission? Do they have any thoughts about creating a specialist court in the future? Is it a discussion in the background that may continue? I am grateful to my noble friend for giving us the chance to have this debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-30_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I, too, am grateful to the noble Lord for providing me with the opportunity to place on record what the Government are currently doing and why I shall suggest that the amendment is unnecessary. I hope that the noble Lord will be minded to agree with me when he has heard my remarks.
<P>

<a name="40119-30_para0"></a>The Government recognise the importance of ensuring that civil and criminal courts make consistent decisions and provide "joined-up" protection for the victims of domestic violence. Criminalising breach of non-molestation orders, as proposed in Clause 1, will ensure that future breach hearings usually will be heard in a criminal court. That should prevent the current situation whereby there could be proceedings in the civil court for breach of a non-molestation order at the same time as prosecutions in the criminal court for offences arising out of the domestic violence that caused the breach.
<P>

<a name="40119-30_para1"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, would require the establishment of an integrated court, with both criminal and civil jurisdictions and remedies in domestic violence cases. The Government share the noble Lord's objectives, but the effect of the amendment is somewhat less clear. For instance, it does not explain how the integrated court should be set up, how it should operate and what categories of case it would be able to deal with.
<P>

<a name="40119-30_para2"></a>In addition, we do not think that the amendment is necessary for some further reasons. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, pointed out at Second Reading that the Government made a manifesto commitment to consider whether specialist domestic violence courts would offer more effective protection for victims than the current system. Specialist courts typically reserve one day a week to hear criminal <P>


<a name="column_GC245"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC245</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>domestic violence cases. They emphasise close co-ordination among relevant agencies, including the civil and criminal courts. Five such courts are now operating, in Leeds, Cardiff, Derby, Wolverhampton and west London.
<P>

<a name="40119-30_para3"></a>Local agencies in Croydon are also establishing a specialist domestic violence court and are considering how it might develop into a more integrated system. The CPS and the Department for Constitutional Affairs are undertaking a full evaluation of specialist and integrated courts in fulfilment of our manifesto commitment. Once we have had that assessment, we will be able to judge how and if these courts could or should be rolled out.
<P>

<a name="40119-30_para4"></a>I remind noble Lords of the good work that we did together in the then Courts Bill, now the Courts Act 2003. We now have the benefit of far greater flexibility and will further enable courts to operate under integrated systems. Section 4 of that Act provides for the establishment of courts boards for each area of England and Wales, which will have the specific statutory duty to scrutinise, review and make recommendations about the way in which the Lord Chancellor is discharging his general duty in relation to the Crown Court, county courts and magistrates' courts in the area. Your Lordships will remember that Section 66 provides that every judge or deputy judge of the High Court, circuit judge or deputy circuit judge and recorder shall have the powers of the district judge magistrates' court in relation to criminal and family proceedings. Obviously, that is subject to training, which we spoke about earlier.
<P>

<a name="40119-30_para5"></a>Section 69 provides for common criminal procedure rules in the criminal division of the Court of Appeal, the Crown Court and the magistrates' court. Section 75 provides for common family procedure rules in the High Court, county courts and magistrates' courts. One can put that package together with the fact that the Children Act 1989 and the Family Law Act 1996 apply across all courts; that is the High Court, county courts and magistrates' courts. I hope that your Lordships see that we now have the tools to provide an integrated system in those areas where that would benefit the local people and is justified on the facts. I hope that that will give the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, a little pleasure and comfort him after events earlier today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I attempted to send a copy of the transcript of Lomas v Parle to the Minister at Christmas time. I suggested that it might make good Christmas reading for her. However, there is some rule in the Government that prevents attachments to an e-mail from being received, in case there is something scurrilous in it. It was bounced back, so I apologise that she does not have it at this time.
<P>

<a name="40119-30_para6"></a>That judgment demonstrates the problem outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. As some Members will not have seen the report, perhaps I may refer to the judgment in which Lord Justice Thorpe tried to discuss the interrelationship between the Family Law Act 1996 and the Protection from <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Harassment Act&#151;it is a criminal offence to breach a civil order made under the Protection from Harassment Act. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"However effectively the proceedings are managed a perpetrator may face sentence for the same act which amounts to both a breach of an injunction made in family proceedings and also a crime under the Protection from Harassment Act. Of course the sentencing courts do not share the same objective and operate in different ranges. The judge in family proceedings has to fit a custodial sentence within a range of 0-24 months. An important objective for him is to uphold the authority of the court by demonstrating that his orders cannot be flouted with impunity. Nevertheless there will be a shared deterrent objective in the punishment of domestic violence by imprisonment.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-30_para7"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Clearly therefore the first court to sentence must not anticipate or allow for a likely future sentence. It is for the second court to sentence to reflect the prior sentence in its judgment in order to ensure that the defendant is not twice punished for the same act. It is essential that the second court should be fully informed of the factors and circumstances reflected in the first sentence. The defendant is often publicly funded to defend the proceedings in each court and may well have different solicitors and counsel in each justice system".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-30_para8"></a>
That is the cost that arises if you go to both jurisdictions. The judgment continues:
<P>
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-30_para9"></a>
That is an example of having to move the papers from one court to another.

<a name="40119-30_para10"></a>
That is the delay to which I referred earlier. It continues:
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-30_para17"></a><P>

<a name="40119-30_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 11 stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Bridgeman. It is supported by the noble Lords, Lord McNally and Lord Thomas of Gresford.
<P>

<a name="40119-30_para19"></a>I have tabled the amendment to probe whether the Government's drafting of the relationship that is given the protection by this clause is appropriate. I have adopted the drafting put forward by the Law Society, whose objective is to ensure that victims of domestic violence can be given protection by the Bill even when their relationship is short-lived.
<P>

<a name="40119-30_para20"></a>Clause 3 extends the availability of non-molestation orders to those in domestic relationships who have never co-habited or have never been married. The new category of "associated" persons will be able to apply for an occupation order under Section 33 of the Family Law Act 1996 so long as the requirements of Section 33(1) are met.
<P>

<a name="40119-30_para21"></a>In paragraph 31 of the Explanatory Notes the Government state that the definition of the relationship in Clause 3 is intended to cover,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a long-standing relationship which may, or may not, be a sexual relationship, but which is an intimate and personal one".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-30_para22"></a>
The notes go on to say that it does not include one-night stands. I recall that, when the noble Baroness gave the helpful briefing to noble Lords on the Bill, she referred again to the fact that the Government were trying specifically to exclude the very briefest of relationships.
<P>

<a name="40119-30_para23"></a>One then has to go back and answer what the definition actually includes, because the court will need to consider that on each and every occasion. Surely the test should not be whether the relationship is a one-night, two-night, three-night stand or whatever. The court should be able to make a decision based on the information before it that the relationship is or has been of such significance that it justifies the making of the order.
<P>

<a name="40119-30_para24"></a>The Law Society points out that the Government's use of "duration" suggests that there is a particular length of time for which a relationship must exist before its members are given the protection of the Family Law Act. However, there are relationships that are very intense but very short in duration. Where there is violence or the threat of violence, one partner may require protection from the other, regardless, one might argue, of the actual duration of the relationship. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   We support the amendment. It is a question of definition. A "significant duration" is, of course, what appears to the judge to be a significant duration. That can mean anything. However,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such significance as to justify the making of an order",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40119-31_para0"></a>
limits the interpretation to something that we can all understand. The intimate personal relationship may last a very short time but, as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said&#151;I think that I have it right this time&#151;it can still be of sufficient significance to justify the making of an order. We see no reason why the amendment should not be accepted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-31_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The Government's intention in Clause 3 was to close a significant loophole in the protection afforded by the Family Law Act 1996, by including within it non-cohabiting couples. The aim was to include within it intimate personal relationships of significant duration. That would cover long-standing relationships which might or might not be sexual in nature, but which were none the less intimate and personal. It was not our intention to include long-term platonic friends or the briefest of sexual encounters, such as one-night stands, as the Family Law Act is concerned with relationships of some standing where the opportunity for abuse and control is greater. It is that combination of abuse and control that is usually the trigger.
<P>

<a name="40119-31_para1"></a>The provision does not mean that the court would not be able to determine for itself a significant duration on a particular set of facts. The noble Baroness and the noble Lord are right: certain relationships, because of their intensity, become significant. Although they may not be as long as others, they are still of significant duration. It is a qualitative issue that the courts will have to determine.
<P>

<a name="40119-31_para2"></a>As drafted, the clause already assumes that the court would decide whether there was a relationship sufficiently significant to justify making the order. If the court did not judge that there was in fact an intimate personal relationship, it would not go on to make the order. The amendment attempts to spell out that element of significance in the clause. We do not believe that it adds to the clause or clarifies the way in which the court would approach the making of the order. However, I reassure the noble Baroness that the reason that "significant" and "duration" are put together is so that the court may make that determination, which may differ given the facts as presented.
<P>

<a name="40119-31_para3"></a>The amendment has one other effect, which may or may not have been intended by the noble Baroness. By deleting the reference to "significant duration", it would be possible for the courts to make an order on the basis of the shortest relationship or sexual encounter, provided that the court considered that it was of sufficient significance. That would be a fundamental shift in the scope of the Family Law Act 1996, which deals with relationships of standing and the issues of abuse and control within them.
<P>


<a name="column_GC249"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column GC249</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40119-31_para4"></a>Other remedies exist for those not in relationships of standing; for example, the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and the general criminal law, where an offence has been committed. For those reasons, we are not attracted by the amendment, but we hope that the noble Baroness will feel satisfied by our response to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-31_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   The amendment seems to place importance on the significance of a relationship rather than its length. When a judge or anybody else must determine the significance of a relationship it seems unlikely that they will deem particularly significant a relationship that consists of a one-night stand. It is unlikely that, under this Act or the Family Law Act 1996, the courts will be diverted to take on a new line of business that they do not already carry out. They will continue to treat date rape or violence against a partner during a single sexual episode, with no other encounter before or after, exactly as they do today. If, on the other hand, judges must consider the significance of a relationship, they will almost inevitably consider its duration also. As I understand it, under the amendment, the significance, not the duration, would carry the main weight. That would be a significant change, but one that is entirely beneficial, not the reverse.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-31_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I hope that I made clear in responding to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, that it is both. The noble Baroness is right in saying that there is a distinction between a date-rape type of situation or a one-night stand and a relationship of some standing that brings about domestic violence. We are dealing with a different species of activity. We are trying to address a situation where two people are in a relationship of some significance for some duration, and the operation of control that comes with that duration disables one of the parties better to protect themselves from domestic violence.
<P>

<a name="40119-31_para5"></a>Our problem is that the Family Law Act 1996 was predicated on dealing with married couples or those in quasi-marital relationships of long standing that could equate to marriage. If we enact the Bill, the court will have a panoply of options: is it a relationship of some duration, standing or moment that should be covered by this legislation; is it a more transient relationship in which someone has been abused and/or continually harassed, where the Protection from Harassment Act applies; is it a date rape or offence that falls within the usual ambit of criminal legislation, in which case all the relevant Acts that impinge on it apply?
<P>

<a name="40119-31_para6"></a>The court now has three species from which to choose; therefore, the duration and significance of the relationship will determine whether it goes into category one&#151;this category of domestic violence, involving a relationship of some standing; whether it is a more transient relationship that could be better dealt with under the Protection from Harassment Act; or whether it should be dealt with under criminal legislation. In this context, duration is significant.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-32_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </B>  The full report of the independent review of government communications, chaired by Bob Phillis, has been published today. The Minister for the Cabinet Office is grateful to the review for its work and consideration of these issues.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para0"></a>The report builds on the review team's interim report published in the summer. The Government accepted the interim report's recommendations. Central to the process is the appointment of a new Permanent Secretary, Government Communications, which the Cabinet Office is currently in the process of recruiting.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para1"></a>Departments have the responsibility to devise and implement communications operations and strategies appropriate to their needs. Bearing this in mind, the new Permanent Secretary will take forward, in consultation with departments, recommendations relating to a redefinition of the overall role of government communications, the structures necessary to deliver this activity and the improved training and development of all communications specialists.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para2"></a>The Permanent Secretary will also consider whether the existing rules and guidance are fit for purpose and whether any additional clarification is required. We note the committee's conclusion on ministerial involvement in the selection processes for communications professionals, which will be taken forward in discussions already under way with the Civil Service Commissioners.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para3"></a>The Government also agree that they must communicate with the public in the widest possible way, including greater use of regional briefings and electronic communications. We will look at how departments' websites could be better co-ordinated and structured to encourage greater public participation in the development and communication of government policies.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para4"></a>The Government remain committed to the principle, reflected in the Ministerial Code, that when the House is sitting announcements of Government policy should, in the first instance, be made in Parliament. We agree that more Ministers should host lobby briefings and that these should be open and televised. The Government will now enter into discussions with the relevant public authorities, including Parliament and the parliamentary Lobby, on how best to pursue these proposals.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para5"></a>The Government also note the review's recommendations on the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act. A great deal of work is going on to ensure that departments are fully prepared <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>for the legislation that comes into force on 1 January 2005 and the Government are fully committed to ensuring full and effective implementation of the Act across the whole of the public sector. The review's recommendations will be taken into account as part of this implementation process.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para6"></a>On the use of statistics, the Government welcome the review's acknowledgement that some important steps have been taken to reinforce the independence of the statistical service. The Government note the review's recommendations on access to pre-release national statistics. Under the national statistics code of practice and its associated protocol on release practices, issued in September 2002, there are already long-established and effective procedures in place to restrict early access to certain data to a small number of Ministers and officials, so that they are able to provide an authoritative response when questions arise at the time of release. There are no plans to change this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-32_spmin2"></A><B>The Attorney-General  (Lord Goldsmith): </B>  Today's judgment in the Court of Appeal in the appeal against conviction of Angela Cannings has serious and far-reaching implications. The judgment has demonstrated that, in relation to unexplained infant deaths, where the outcome of the trial depends exclusively, or almost exclusively, on a serious disagreement between distinguished and reputable experts, it will often be unsafe to proceed. I share the unease expressed by the Court of Appeal in relation to such convictions.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para7"></a>Following similar reported comments of concern by the Court of Appeal at the conclusion of the hearing of this tragic case in December, I asked for all cases potentially involving sudden infant death syndrome to be identified as quickly as practicable. To date, some 258 convictions over the past 10 years have been identified involving the murder, manslaughter or infanticide of an infant aged under two years by its parent. These cases will be considered further as a matter of urgency to establish whether they bear the hallmarks of a conviction which the Court of Appeal judgment today has indicated may be unsafe. I expect this process to be completed swiftly over the coming weeks. I propose that in all cases which appear to meet the criteria laid down by the Court of Appeal the convicted person will be informed of these developments as soon as possible. The possibility then will be for the case to be referred to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) or for the convicted person, with legal advice, to consider an appeal out of time to the Court of Appeal. The CCRC has the power under the Criminal Appeals Act 1995 to consider whether the convictions should be referred to the Court of Appeal.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para8"></a>I am particularly concerned about cases where the defendant has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment which is still being served. We have so <P>


<a name="column_WS39"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column WS39</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>far identified 54 such cases which may involve sudden infant death syndrome. These will be accorded the highest priority.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para9"></a>I have already spoken to the chairman of the CCRC and will be meeting him in the coming week to discuss how the review of these cases can be expedited.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para10"></a>I have also asked the Crown Prosecution Service to conduct a review of the 15 ongoing cases involving an unexplained infant death of the sort described in today's judgment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-32_spmin3"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  Article 40 of the Schengen convention sets out the basis for cross-border surveillance by police officers from member states. Subject to a Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council decision authorising the United Kingdom to begin applying the relevant provisions of the Schengen <i>acquis</i>, we have decided that in strictly pre-planned operations, and on a basis of full reciprocity, overseas surveillance officers should be able to travel armed by sea or rail to the UK, but not by air.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para11"></a>Foreign officers would not be able to carry their firearms beyond the confines of the port or rail station at which they arrive. The purpose of this agreement is to allow for continuing, without putting officers at additional risk, the surveillance of a dangerous individual leaving the UK or of one coming to the UK who will then be followed from the port by armed UK surveillance teams.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para12"></a>Each foreign officer will require authority from the Home Secretary to carry firearms under Section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968, and an import licence. Before an authorisation is given to allow the carriage of firearms, the operation will be risk assessed by an UK police officer of at least Assistant Chief Constable rank.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para13"></a>Foreign officers on urgent operations under Article 40(2) of the Schengen convention will not be able to carry firearms in any circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119-32_spmin4"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  Air links between the Falkland Islands and the South American mainland are the subject of two understandings reached between HMG and the Argentine Government, under a sovereignty umbrella (which protects both sides' positions on the question of sovereignty). Following the UK/Argentine Joint Statement of July 1999, LAN Chile resumed its weekly flight between Punta Arenas (in southern Chile) and the Falkland Islands. Once a month this flight makes a <P>


<a name="column_WS40"></a>

<B>19 Jan 2004 : Column WS40</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>stopover in each direction in Rio Gallegos (in southern Argentina). In February 2001 a further understanding was signed to permit private flights. Under these arrangements aircraft, including Argentine aircraft, can undertake private flights between Argentina and the Falkland Islands. These arrangements continue in place and are unaffected by developments set out below.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para14"></a>In recent years there have also been a number of charter flights to the Falkland Islands, mostly originating in Chile and servicing tourist cruise ships. These charter flights are not covered by either of the two understandings described above. They require permission to use Argentine airspace between Chile and the Falkland Islands. Until this season Argentina has not raised any difficulties with these charter flight authorisations, though it had periodically indicated that it would wish to review the situation at some point.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para15"></a>On 3 November 2003, without warning, Argentina announced the suspension of permission for charter flights to use Argentine airspace and proposed that a scheduled air service between Argentina and the Falkland Islands by an Argentine carrier be put in place. The weekly LAN Chile scheduled flight was not affected by this announcement.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para16"></a>We made clear to Argentina that while we were prepared to enter into discussions about ways of building on existing arrangements for air links between the Falkland Islands and the South American mainland, any future arrangements must be acceptable to the Falkland Islanders, and that the Falkland Islanders were not prepared to accept a scheduled service by an Argentine carrier. We also made clear that such discussions needed to take place against the backdrop of charter flight authorisations proceeding normally.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para17"></a>Regrettably, despite considerable efforts it has not been possible to reach agreement with the Argentine Government on opening talks on air services on acceptable terms. This means that there is little prospect of charter flights to the Falkland Islands being authorised to overfly Argentine airspace for the rest of this tourist season. Unless such an understanding can be reached with the Argentine Government, it seems likely that charters for the next tourist season will also be affected. Falkland Island councillors have been kept fully informed of our exchanges with the Argentine Government.
<P>

<a name="40119-32_para18"></a>The cancellation of the charter flights will obviously have some negative impact on the tourist industry in the Falkland Islands. However, Falkland Islanders believe that there are principles at stake here which outweigh short-term economic costs. We respect and agree with that view. Argentina is fully aware of our position and we hope that an acceptable arrangement can be reached in the interests of all parties to resolve the charter flight issue.

<P>
<A NAME="40119w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Norton of Louth  </B> asked the Chairman of Committees:
<P>
<UL>What was the monthly average of the number of items of post received in the House of Lords in 2003; and how this compares to the figures for 2002 and 2001. [HL736]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees   (Lord Brabazon of Tara): </B>  The total number of items of post received in both Houses of Parliament in 2003 was 12.5 million items. The House of Lords receives an estimated 20 per cent of the post received, giving an annual figure for the Lords of approximately 2.5 million items, or an average of just over 208,000 items per month.
<P>

<a name="40119w01_para0"></a>Prior to 2003, the volume of post received was measured by weight rather than by number. There has, however, been an estimated annual increase of 2.5 per cent in the number of items of post received since 2001.

<A NAME="40119w01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Amos:  </B>  The 2004 budget for the North/South Language Body has not yet been announced. The recommended budget allocation for the North/South Language Implementation Body will be subject to agreement by Ministers North and South in accordance with the arrangements under the agreement made by the exchange of notes between the two governments dated 19 November 2002. This process has not been completed in respect of 2004. Proper procedure is being followed in line with the budgetary process as set out in the North/South Language Body's Financial Memorandum. The business plan as required by the financial memorandum has not yet been agreed.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119w01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos:  </B>  The main reason for the delay in publication of the 2000 accounts for the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission was due to the auditor of the Foyle Fisheries Commission, the predecessor body, not certifying the commission's final accounts until October 2002. This was because the accounting standards applicable to the FFC were changed and the new standards created difficulties with regard to the funding of the FFC Pension Scheme. Previous assurances with regard to the funding that had been provided by the commission's sponsoring departments were no longer adequate to allow the auditor's certificate. Lengthy discussion with the Department of Finance (ROI) eventually agreed that resolution would only be achieved if a qualification of the accounts was provided by the auditor.

<P>
<UL>What evidence they have of the achievement of universal primary education in those African countries where they sustain an active education programme.[HL715]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119w02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos:  </B>  Good progress is being made towards the goal of universal primary education (UPE) in countries that fall under our public service agreement, such as South Africa, Ghana, Lesotho, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe.
<P>

<a name="40119w02_para1"></a>We have substantially increased our support to governments with credible plans for achieving UPE. These countries include Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia. We do envisage however that some may continue to have difficulties in reaching this goal. Decisions taken recently by some governments, notably Kenya, to make primary schooling free will have a major impact. We judge that the situation will continue to improve in our partner countries as we project to spend &#163;1 billion on UPE in the years 2002&#150;07.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119w02_wqn2"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they have received any reports on the effect of the abolition of school fees, as in Malawi, on the achievement of universal primary education; and whether this experience may be relevant to other countries.[HL716]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119w02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   There has been a marked increase in enrolment in Malawi since school fees were abolished in 1994, resulting in a national net enrolment rate of 65.7 per cent <sup>1</sup> . The free primary education (FPE) policy, almost resulted in universal primary education (UPE) with an extra 1 million children enrolling at this time. However, there is still much to be done if UPE is to be achieved and maintained. Approximately 24 per cent <sup>2</sup>  of primary school-age children are currently out of school. Families continue to bear other costs (i.e, school materials and uniform costs), and the increase of the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the region results in some school-age children not going to school.

<a name="40119w02_para4"></a>Malawi's experiences in the introduction of FPE have been widely shared in the region through our country offices. A key lesson from this experience is the need to ensure that the education system can cope with a large influx of enrolling children before FPE is introduced so as not to affect the quality of education. Also, strong government commitment is crucial to achieving UPE.

<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Answer by the Lord Chancellor on 5 July 2001 (WA 51), in respect of how many discrimination cases in employment tribunals has exceptional funding been granted; and what proportion of such funding has been granted for claimants alleging (a) sex discrimination, (b) race discrimination, (c) disability discrimination, and (d) other forms of discrimination, as the case may be.[HL685]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </B>  Ministers can consider an application for exceptional funding under Section 6(8)(b) of the Access to Justice Act 1999 only when the Legal Services Commission recommends it. The provision came into force in April 2000. In 2000 and 2001, no exceptional funding applications for employment tribunals were recommended. In 2002, the commission recommended funding one application, for disability discrimination, which was approved. In 2003, one application for alleged discrimination under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 was received, but funding was refused, as alternative funding was available. A further three applications for exceptional funding for employment tribunals were recommended in 2003, which are currently being considered. One concerns allegations of sexual discrimination, one of racial discrimination and the other of disability discrimination.

<a name="40119w02_para5"></a>On 6 November 2003, together with other members of the Tokyo Group (the EU, US, Japan and World Bank), we called for improved access to Aceh for international agencies and NGOs, and the impact of the people of Aceh to be minimised.

We hope that this will provide an opportunity to obtain clearer information about the situation there.

<P>

<a name="40119w02_para7"></a>Local education authorities and schools have an important role to play in ensuring that all children receive a good quality education.

<P>

<a name="40119w02_para8"></a>In July 2003, to support schools and LEAs to meet the needs of gypsy/traveller pupils, the Department for Education and Skills published a good practice guide on raising the achievement of gypsy/traveller pupils which offers advice and practical guidance on actions to take to raise the achievement of gypsy/traveller pupils. The department is, additionally, funding a project in six LEAs at secondary school level which aims to improve attendance, raise attainment and engage gypsy/traveller parents through encouraging best practice.

<A NAME="40119w02_wqn8"></A><B> Lord Tebbit </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they intend to legalise marriage between persons each possessing the XX chromosome (or each possessing the XY chromosome) and each possessing the genitalia of the same sex.[HL611]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119w02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   The Government believe that marriage should only be possible between people of opposite gender in law. The Gender Recognition Bill will enable transsexual people who have gained legal recognition in their acquired gender to marry someone of the oppposite legal gender. Whether a transsexual person is able to marry someone of the opposite legal gender will depend on their gender in law and not their chromosomal make up or whether they have completed sex reassignment surgery. Marriages contracted by transsexual people once their change of gender has been legally recognised will be valid marriages between a male and female.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119w03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   No. It is, however, a fundamental proposition of the Gender Recognition Bill that, following legal recognition in their acquired gender, a transsexual person will be regarded in UK law as being of the acquired gender for all purposes and that in law that acquired gender will be the same as any legal definition of their sex. This means that, following legal recognition, if the acquired gender is the male gender, the person's sex in law becomes that of a man and if the person's acquired gender is the female gender, the person's sex in law becomes that of a woman. Where under any legislation it is necessary to decide the sex of a person who has an acquired gender, or to say whether that person is a man or a woman, or male or female, the question must be answered in accordance with the person's acquired gender.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119w03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin:  </B>  According to data collected by the Department of Health from primary care trusts in England, there were 364 finished admissions for operations for sexual transformations in the NHS between 1998 and 2003. That figure does not account for those being treated within the NHS for gender identity disorders, but who are yet to receive in patient care. Records are not available for the number of people who have undergone, or are undergoing, sex change treatment abroad or in private practice.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119w03_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Tebbit  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will make it a criminal offence to lie when a person is asked about his or her biological sex by a member of the clergy in connection with a marriage ceremony. [HL615]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119w03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin:  </B>  There is nothing to prevent a minister asking a parishioner whether they have lived previously in another gender. Whether the parishioner chooses to volunteer the information, or answer a question that has been asked, is a matter for that individual and for the relationship between the parishioner and the clergyman. This is not an area in which the state should get involved. Ultimately, it seems unlikely that a person who has changed gender would place him or herself in the embarrassing position of forcing the issue before a minister who, in conscience, did not want to marry him or her. The Government agreed in Grand Committee on 14 January to look again at the detail of the "conscience clause" within the Gender Recognition Bill and to consider providing further protection for the conscience of the clergy.

<P>
<UL>Whether it will be possible for biological male persons whose births have been registered as female under the Gender Recognition Bill to be charged with, and found guilty of, rape of a female person. [HL674]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40119w03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin:  </B>  A transsexual person who has been legally recognised as a woman by law in the UK under gender recognition legislation could be charged with, and found guilty of, the rape of another female person. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 in England and Wales is very specific about the relevant act, rather than the gender or sex of the defendant or complainant. Because many sexual offences in Scottish law remain gender-specific, the Gender Recognition Bill includes a clause relating to Scottish gender-specific offences. Northern Ireland is currently reviewing its legislation on sexual offences with the intention of recasting this to be gender neutral.

<A NAME="40119w03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport   (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </B>  After discussions between the Inland Revenue and representatives of health cash plan providers, it was agreed it was necessary to tailor solutions that took account of the differing circumstances of the providers. Inland Revenue staff have been working with the individual cash plan providers on an agreed timetable to ensure a smooth change to the tax treatment of surpluses.
<P>

<a name="40119w03_para0"></a>For those health cash plan providers who opt to change their constitution to comply with the requirements for mutual trading, the Inland Revenue is allowing tax exemption to apply through the transition. For these, there is no impact on charitable donations.

<a name="40119w03_para1"></a>For those that prefer not to change their constitution, their surpluses will, from a date to be agreed with their inspector, be chargeable to tax as trading profits. However, they can make donations to charities, which qualify for tax relief under gift aid rules, so in practice, they will see little change from the previous situation.
<P>

<a name="40119w03_para2"></a>The impact of these changes depends largely on decisions taken by individual health cash plan providers.
