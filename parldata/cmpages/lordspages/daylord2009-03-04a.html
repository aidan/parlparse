We are working with volunteer organisations to ensure that every volunteer is properly treated and has a positive experience. However, the diverse nature of volunteering and the varied relationships between volunteers and the organisations that engage them mean that equality legislation does not apply to volunteers in the same way as it does to employees. However, volunteers are currently protected from discrimination in so far as the organisation is providing goods, facilities and services to the public. These provisions will be retained in the equality Bill and extended to cover age.</p>

However, sometimes the good name of volunteers is ruined by unfair dismissals or accusations. In the light of the very important contribution that they make, would it be possible to allow them access to an ombudsman so that they have a route to clear their name?</p>

I know that this Question has been precipitated by the fact that the citizens advice bureau in York, where she is from, has experienced some serious issues concerning the way in which volunteers have been managed over the past year. I am happy to say that they have been resolved through an independent review by John Stoker. I can appreciate that those volunteers might wish to draw some broader lessons from their experiences about where volunteers should seek support and advice when they need it. We are not convinced that seeking employment rights under equality legislation is the solution, although exploring the possibility of an ombudsman may be one.</p>

The important point here is that the York CAB resolved the issue through an independent review by John Stoker. I do not wish to discuss the details of the case but it is important to learn the lessons from that review and ensure that those lessons are taken on board by other charities and organisations with volunteers. I assure the noble Baroness that the Government will examine the issues that the review raised and we will certainly take action where appropriate.</p>

If the Minister is inclined to consider further regulation of charities, will she bear in mind that they are currently under considerable stress, financial and otherwise, given the economic circumstances, and be careful about the additional burdens that she puts on a sector that carries out such valuable work for our society?</p>

We have, through the Charities Act, for example, modernised the legislation as it applies to charities, and we have supported volunteering organisations to ensure that volunteers get a better deal. We know that in the economic downturn charities such as Crisis are seeing an increase in the number of people coming forward to volunteer, and we wish to support them in providing support. This Government have put an enormous amount of resource into supporting the third sector because we regard it as a very important part of our civil society.</p>

If I understood the Minister correctly, she seems not to welcome the idea of including protection for volunteers in the equality Bill. Does she have any other legislative route to improve the situation for volunteers?</p>

Indeed, it will be extended to cover age. The equality Bill will include powers to ban and justify discrimination, for example, against older people in the provision of goods, facilities and services. We are currently taking forward those developments but we are not considering legislation applying particularly to volunteers. The nature of volunteering is something that evolves through support and encouragement by the organisations that deal with volunteering.</p>

It is the new national youth volunteering programme; a charity that encourages 16 to 25 year-olds to volunteer. For example, the British Red Cross, through V, offers opportunities for volunteering. In April, it will be offering full-time placements for those who want to commit themselves to 30 hours a week over 13 weeks. V also points to its success in getting young people who are not in employment, education and training back into employment through their volunteering work.</p>

Noble Lords who are involved in the law will know that being a volunteer is quite different from being an employed person. We think that we have drawn the line of protection in the right place. There would be significant difficulties in extending to volunteers the protection from discrimination that currently applies in employment. That is because of the diverse nature of volunteering and the relationship between volunteers and the organisations that engage them. By its nature, there is not a contract that has the obligations that exist between employer and employee.</p>

It took two weeks to be there for 56 hours. Does he agree that, in the DfID annual report, the overall budget for overseas development is &#163;5 billion and that the year-on-year cost of the airport for St Helena is likely to be less than 1 per cent of that? Does he agree further that, although the developed world has responsibilities for international development, the United Kingdom has a specific duty to those dependent overseas territories such as St Helena?</p>

I am briefed that it was a pleasant experience. It is a wonderful island. I also congratulate him on his assiduous study of the DfID annual report&#151;if only more would do that. I cannot entirely agree with his conclusion that the amount would be less than 1 per cent, but it is in the order of magnitude of 1 to 2 per cent. It is a little more than people realise. It is a significant sum of money and one has to take account of that in these difficult times. We accept that we have a specific responsibility for the three territories, to look after them and to sustain communications with them, but I can go no further on any assurances on this project.</p>

I made a number of speeches to the same effect. Many years have passed since then, during which St Helena has not prospered and the population has fallen dramatically. I do not want to make a party-political point, but I urge the Minister to do his level best to get things cracking, because time is not on the side of St Helena. Something has to be done and done quickly.</p>

As an ex-aeroplane driver, I can say that that means that you can cater for very large aeroplanes, but to get the sort of range that you need for St Helena, which, as has been illustrated, is in the middle of nowhere, you would be talking about relatively modest 737-type aeroplanes, producing the average journey to, say, South Africa.</p>

The United Nations promoted its new draft framework for humanitarian access. We hope that this will be endorsed at the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee meeting in April, which Israel will attend. The UK Government will continue to press Israel at the highest levels to increase access.</p>

In view of the present Israeli Government&#146;s flat refusal even to consider reopening the crossing points into Gaza, how on earth will rebuilding materials and equipment get in as soon as possible, bearing in mind the urgent humanitarian need?</p>

The Israeli Government&#146;s position is not a flat refusal, but there is no question that Israel can do most to help this situation by addressing the whole issue of access. Her Majesty&#146;s Government take the access position extremely seriously. We have put particular effort into diplomacy, going back to 19 January when Mike Foster met Isaac Herzog, the Minister responsible for access. On 21 January, the Foreign Secretary had a private luncheon with the Israeli Foreign Minister to urge access and joined EU Foreign Ministers. On

On 16 February, the Foreign Secretary met Isaac Herzog again and the Secretary of State for International Development met him on 1 March. There is no question that the key issue in the short term is access. We are putting all our efforts into trying to break through the access deadlock.</p>

What assurances have we received or sought from Mr Netanyahu that his continuing threat to destroy Hamas will not reduce any rebuilding done in Gaza to rubble yet again?</p>

We in DfID are trying to ensure that there are methods of getting aid through. We are using the present agencies that are working in Gaza. They are getting some aid through. We recognise that those agencies have to treat with Hamas. As noble Lords know, we do not believe that it is proper at this time to treat with Hamas, but that does not stand in the way of aid getting through. We certainly agree with the general thrust of the noble Lord&#146;s question that a long-term solution to peace in the area will need Arab and Palestinian reconciliation. The need for all countries to work together for a long-term solution is crucial. We praise very much Egypt&#146;s role in the recent past and we are very pleased to see the emphasis that the Obama Administration are putting on that.</p>

Gaza has a border with Egypt. Presumably, the Egyptians have as many anxieties as Israel about the diversion of funds by Hamas for the purchase of arms, just as it has hijacked the funds going through the UN and UNRWA. What steps can we take to ensure that the aid will reach the needy Palestinians rather than Hamas?</p>

Is the Minister aware that, on 1 March, Douglas Alexander announced an extra &#163;20 million in funding for reconstruction? Can the Minister give us further details on exactly how this and the &#163;10 million not yet allocated from the previous announcement will be spent?</p>

This is not a money problem: the outcome of the Sharm conference, as the noble Baroness rightly says, was to bring our aid commitment up to &#163;50 million in the short term and something above &#163;250 million over the long term.

It is a problem of Palestinian politics, in which we and the international community are trying to help, and of achieving peace in the region so that proper, long-term reconstruction can start.</p>

It has been even-handed in getting across the importance of stopping the smuggling; that is part of it. Tony Blair is doing the right job at the right time. The international community really does seem to be putting together a good, co-ordinated effort on this. It is now a matter of getting the Palestinians to work together, and of getting long-term peace in the region.</p>

The all-party group is, in fact, holding an important meeting with the Minister, Gillian Merron, as we speak. I am sorry not to be able to be there to hear her remarks, which could have a bearing on these amendments.</p>

<a name="90304-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09030469000062"></a>As the Committee will be aware, the plight of the dispossessed Chagos Islanders has been considered by the courts, and what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hoffmann, called &#147;the whole sad story&#148; of how,</p>
<ul><a name="09030469000217"></a>&#147;the removal and resettlement of the Chagossians was accomplished with a callous disregard of their interests&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="09030469000158"></a>is related in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the case of Bancoult. It is also being considered by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee in another place as part of its report of July 2008 on the overseas territories. In response to that report, the Government said that they regretted,</p>
<ul><a name="09030469000218"></a>&#147;the way the resettlement of the Chagossians was carried out and the hardship that resulted for some of them. We do not seek to justify the actions taken in the 1960s and 1970s. These regrets have been repeated on many occasions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030469000159"></a>Those pious sentiments have not been any benefit to the children of the Islanders born in exile. Although some of the 1,000 who are resident in the UK have become full UK citizens, they have to pass the habitual residence test and, even then, many cannot afford the enormous fees that are payable for full citizenship.</p>

<a name="90304-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09030469000063"></a>The Home Office does not seem to be properly aware of these problems, although they were highlighted by the Foreign Affairs Committee. I wonder whether the Minister could at least tell us how many of the 1,000 people in the UK have managed to get full British citizenship.</p>

<a name="90304-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09030469000064"></a>We are asking your Lordships now to consider the rights of the Chagos Islanders and their descendants to full British citizenship. Under Section 6 of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002, a person who was born after 26 April 1969 and before 1 January 1983 to a woman who was a citizen of the United Kingdom colonies by virtue of her birth in the British Indian Ocean Territory, and who was neither a British citizen nor a BOTC immediately before commencement of Section 6, became a British citizen by descent. The omission of subsection (2) would mean that they became a full citizen and thus able to pass on their citizenship to their own children.</p>

<a name="90304-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09030469000065"></a>Amendment 101A would delete the requirement in Section 6(1)(a) that a person be born after 26 April 1969 to be eligible for British citizenship. That was the date when the removal of the population from the islands was authorised. It appeared in Section 6 without consultation with the Chagossians or their advisers. I believe that the idea was that, before that date, anyone who left the islands was free to return. In that scenario&#151;for example, if they went to Mauritius&#151;they were voluntarily absent and any mother who wished to do so could have returned to give birth and thus to confer citizenship on her child.</p>

<a name="90304-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09030469000066"></a>That was not in fact the case. It has now been made clear that difficulties of return arose much earlier. The planning for the evacuation of the islands was started in August 1964; the Exchange of Notes with the USA on Diego Garcia was at the end of 1966; and the  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_736"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 736</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>shipping link between Mauritius and the Chagos Islands was severed when Mauritius became independent in March 1968. In the 1950s and in the 1960s up to that date, people came and went, almost entirely to Mauritius, and had no way of being aware that giving birth outside the islands would seriously handicap their child 40 years down the line.</p>

<a name="90304-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09030469000067"></a>In response to the Select Committee, the Government said that there was no precedent elsewhere in nationality law for citizenship to be extended to a third generation born outside the UK or in an overseas territory. But that is not correct. They concede that, until 1914, there were exceptions, but even under the British Nationality Act 1981 a person serving in the Armed Forces or in a community institution who was a British citizen by descent could transmit his or her citizenship to a child. Even if there were no precedents at all, equally there is none that I am aware of for the expulsion from the dependent territory of the whole population. That was a shabby and disreputable episode. It becomes even more despicable if we now prevent the children of the victims regaining rights that they would have had if their parents had been able to remain in their ancestral lands. I beg to move.</p>

My interest was heightened when, three years ago, I was invited by the Mauritius Government to inspect their prison system and was made aware of the situation regarding the Chagos Islanders, which was represented to me as being rather a blot on the UK&#146;s human rights record. At that time it was mentioned that the Foreign Office had carried out a feasibility study on the return in 2002, but it had been turned down for, among other things, being too expensive. I suggest that that feasibility study of 2002 is now totally out of date. It may be of interest to the Committee to know that the Chagos Islands all-party group brought this situation to the personal attention of the new President of the United States, because not only is Diego Garcia a United States base but the agreement with the United States is due for renewal in 2016. It is extremely appropriate to press ahead with what is required; while it may seem strange to attach the issue to this Bill, in the whole context of nationality and our records in this area it is an extremely appropriate vehicle. I hope that the Government will listen to what is being said.</p>

However, I should like to suggest a different approach. In responding to Amendment 90&#151;it seems a long time ago, but it was on Monday&#151;I gave an undertaking that the Government would consider amendments from the noble Lord. I suggest that we should consider Amendments 92 and 101A, along with the remaining amendments to clauses in Part 2, with the exception of Amendment 105A which, to my embarrassment I must return to, having failed to deal with it on Monday.</p>

<a name="90304-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09030469000073"></a>The purpose of my suggesting that I discuss those amendments not in the form of a considered debate today, which would take a very long time, but in the form of a discussion, is to look at the cases that have caused noble Lords to table the amendments, to consider the decisions taken in respect of those cases and the principles behind those decisions, and to see whether policy and other practical measures can be found to resolve them. The noble Lord will, of course, be perfectly able to bring back any or all of his amendments at Report, but I hope that we can at least make some progress on some of them in the intervening period. That would be the most practical way in which I can offer the House urgent attention to the points raised, with the opportunity for a fuller debate at Report.</p>

I accept with alacrity his offer of further discussions on these matters before Report, and particularly on the one currently under discussion, on the situation of the Chagos Islanders. I am sure that my colleagues who are meeting Gillian Merron in Portcullis House at this very moment will be delighted to hear what the Minister has said. I hope that Gillian Merron will have been on message and will have told the special meeting of the Chagos Islands APPG about the Minister&#146;s kind offer to your Lordships this afternoon. For the time being, I am happy to withdraw this amendment. We will no doubt be able to dispose of the subsequent amendment on Part 2 in good time so that we can finish by 10 pm.

That is, he or she will not be able automatically to transmit citizenship. It is not always possible for the children of British citizens to satisfy existing provisions for registration to obtain citizenship for want of compliance with residence requirements in the UK or in the British Overseas Territories. In certain circumstances, where the state of residence prohibits the acquisition of its nationality, often on racially discriminatory grounds, the children of such persons are left stateless.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09030469000077"></a>There is a problem here. Bearing in mind what the noble Lord has said about discussions in between times, I will not go through all the cases that I have before me, save to say that it would be interesting to learn from the Minister whether this applies to many people. In the briefings that I have received, we have been talking about, perhaps, a few dozen here or there, as in, for example, the case of children in Zambia, where it is conservatively estimated that about 20 children of Asian descent are affected by statelessness. We are not talking about hundreds or thousands in such cases. I want to put the scale of the problem on record.</p>

<a name="90304-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09030469000078"></a>The current provisions, as the Minister will know, are found in the British Nationality Act 1981 and are very restrictive. They demand three years&#146; residence in the UK, with up to 270 days&#146; absence, in circumstances where the stateless child has no passport with which to be lawfully admitted to the UK or thereafter reside. They also provide for the registration of the child in a category of British nationality&#151;meaning British overseas citizenship or British subject status&#151;that is little better than statelessness. That is one of the categories of British nationality that carries with it no right of abode in the UK or any other country.</p>

It would further ensure that the person is entitled to be registered in a category of British nationality that carries with it the right of abode so as to be entitled to live and work here&#151;that is to say, to be registered as a British citizen and, as the case may be, as a British Overseas Territories citizen.</p>

The amendment would remove the requirement to have to be registered within 12 months of birth, the status of their grandparents set out in paragraph (b) and the requirements relating to their parents&#146; residence in the UK and absences of no more than 270 days set out in paragraph (c). This gives us an opportunity to probe why these requirements individually as well as collectively are held to be necessary. Not all British citizens realise that children born outside the UK or a qualifying territory will not be British citizens. Many people fail or have failed to register their children through lack of knowledge of the provisions. This is an equally crucial area to address when it comes to looking at the rights of children and to ensure that we have not left any of these issues unexamined. I beg to move.</p>

This means that where an applicant is deemed to have or to have had some other nationality, he has to obtain a certificate from the authorities of the state in question showing that in fact he is not its citizen. The Minister will no doubt say that the requirement has operated reasonably in the sense that the UKBA will not demand proof of non-citizenship of countries with which the applicant manifestly has no connection. However, where the applicant is connected with a country by reason of his ethnicity, they do ask for proof, which can be difficult or sometimes impossible to obtain. It is alleged that there are instances where individuals with no other citizenship who are unable to extract a letter by normal means from their consulates have obtained one by giving a present to the appropriate official.

In the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the law was changed so that children born to British fathers who were not married to their non-British and not-settled mothers were born British if their fathers could prove paternity. This only assisted those born after 1 July 2006, when the provisions were finally given full effect, under Section 162(5) of the 2002 Act. The person can be registered by discretion, while still a child, under Section 3(1) of the British Nationality Act 1981, but the Home Office does not always agree to register these children, and not everyone who was born out of wedlock to a British father is capable of being registered.</p>

<a name="90304-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09030469000093"></a>The fourth condition is designed to cover two situations; first, that of children born in the UK or a qualifying territory after 1 January 1983. If they had been born prior to that date in the UK, that would have sufficed to make them British. It will also cover children born to a British father otherwise than by descent; in other words, someone who can pass on his nationality to his children born overseas, outside the UK or in a qualifying territory. It really fills an anomaly in a period of time for which these children do not have rights because their mothers were not registered. We hope that the Minister will cover it as he has covered other amendments to this Clause. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09030469000096"></a><b><a name="90304-0003.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="09030469000321"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I imagine that this will be another amendment that we can bundle up in the discussion. The first part will assist the small number of children born overseas to parents who were British citizens by descent, and were thus, as my noble friend has explained, unable to transmit their nationality to their children born overseas where those children were born in a qualifying territory in which the parents were not settled. &#147;The qualifying territory&#148; means the British Overseas Territories other than the sovereign base areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia.</p>

<a name="90304-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09030469000097"></a>The amendment would not affect the children born to BDTCs before 2002, because they derive their British citizenship from the British Overseas Territories Act 2002. Nor does it affect whether the child has the citizenship of the overseas territory. It is thus about the situation only of British citizens who live overseas, rather than those who are also British Overseas Territories citizens in their particular territory.</p>

<a name="90304-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09030469000098"></a>If that sounds complicated, and if some of the things that my noble friend said sounded complicated, I agree. I had an e-mail this morning from a lady who said that she had three law degrees and, looking at what we said on Monday, could not make head or tail of it. She has asked me to suggest to the Government, and I do so most gladly, that they should produce a wall chart showing each path to citizenship contained in the law. That would make them a great deal easier to follow for members of the public and those who have to advise them, compared to trying to thread their way through the British Nationality Act 1981&#151;particularly as the BNA 1981 does not include the amendments that we are considering in this Committee, although the Minister was kind enough to let us have the Keeling schedule showing how that Act will appear as amended by the Bill. I leave that with the Minister as a helpful suggestion from a member of the public who has been trying to follow our proceedings.</p>

<a name="90304-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09030469000099"></a>The second part of the amendment would amend Section 1 of the British Nationality Act 1981 so that the children of British passport holders, other than British citizens born in the UK or a qualifying territory, are British citizens. British nationals other than British citizens have no right of abode by virtue of their British nationality alone. They are in a weaker position than third-country nationals settled in the UK or an overseas territory, and so are their children. The child of a person who is settled in the UK or an overseas territory is born a British citizen. It is a remarkable consequence of this Bill that, because probationary citizens will have limited, not indefinite, leave to remain, the children born to people on probationary citizenship will not be British citizens at birth and will have none of the rights and entitlements of citizenship. Thinking about that should help Members of the Committee to understand the position of British nationals other than British citizens, whose British passports give them no right of abode in any country.</p>

<a name="90304-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09030469000100"></a>Taking a quick canter through the international treaties that are relevant to this issue, there is, first, the European Convention on Human Rights, which the UK has signed but not ratified, because of the application of Protocol 4 to British nationals who are not British citizens, including BN(O)s. Article 3 provides that:</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_744"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 744</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="09030469000202"></a>&#147;No one shall be expelled, by means either of an individual or of a collective measure, from the territory of the State of which he is a national ... No one shall be deprived of the right to enter the territory of the state of which he is a national&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030469000162"></a>Then there is the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which says that the child shall have the right to acquire a nationality. As we know, some children are born stateless and many are born without the right to enter the territory of the state to which they are supposed to belong.</p>

<a name="90304-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09030469000101"></a>Thirdly, there is the European Convention on Nationality, with its provisions on the transmission of citizenship to children. The UK withdrew its reservation to this convention in 2008 and we invite the Minister to say&#151;perhaps not now but in the course of the discussions that we are looking forward to&#151;what changes in the law, particularly on the transmission of citizenship to children, enabled us to do this. Are British nationals other than British citizens our nationals or not? If they are, do the obligations that we have undertaken in international law have relevance? If they are not, what are they, and when and by whom is that determined? The noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, said in his review, <I>Citizenship: Our Common Bond</I>, which I have already mentioned:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="09030469000203"></a>&#147;If citizenship should be seen as the package of rights and responsibilities which demonstrate the tie between a person and a country, the present scheme falls short of that ideal&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030469000163"></a>I hope that in the course of discussions with the noble Lord, we will approach a little more closely to the ideal. I beg to move.</p>

When trying to get my head round this area&#151;on Monday I manifestly demonstrated that I had failed to do that in some ways&#151;I tried to do my own wall chart. I would not recommend my draughtsmanship to anybody, but if that were possible, it would be excellent; it might not be for wider dissemination but it would help at least those of us struggling with discussions over the next few weeks. It fits well for the discussions that are coming and I endorse the route.</p>

I understand that some of the cases raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, may require clarification. But most of the issues that have been raised are matters of principle, and they have been raised as amendments to the Bill. After the discussions, what is the procedure for then deciding, first, whether these come within the ambit of the Bill; secondly, whether Parliament is going to agree to the changes&#151;if any&#151;that will be made; and thirdly, how to dispose of the amendments that are now before us. I am always happy to see the Government talk to the Opposition, but I am a little concerned that the procedure now seems to be extremely unclear.</p>

The point is that there is a genuine attempt to move to resolve a number of difficulties that the noble Lord and the noble Baroness have instigated and which, as they have said on a number of occasions, in many cases involve only a small number of people who are seen by many to have been badly treated.

I am pleased to see the noble Lord, Lord West, in his place. As I pointed out on Monday night, those eligible to serve in the British Armed Forces are British citizens, British nationals other than British citizens, Commonwealth citizens and Irish citizens. A person who is a member of the Armed Forces should know that children born to him or her will be entitled to British citizenship. Amendment 102 is a very simple amendment to the British Nationality Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09030469000114"></a>Clause 40, which we debated on Monday, was concerned with children born in the United Kingdom to members of the Armed Forces. Clause 42 is concerned with children born outside the United Kingdom or the qualifying countries to members of the Armed Forces. For some reason that I do not understand, a distinction is drawn between them. Clause 42 does not take the same approach as Clause 40 to children born outside the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09030469000115"></a>Members of the Armed Forces, who are the people most affected by these provisions, are posted where they are required&#151;and that may not be within one of the qualifying countries. Since they have to go when they are ordered, they have no choice. Families who wish to be together at the time of their child&#146;s birth may be posted in some place that does not come within the definition of the United Kingdom or the qualifying countries. Given these circumstances, on what basis have the Government decided to draw a distinction? If service in the Armed Forces of this country, which is a very worthy undertaking, entitles children to become British citizens in one instance, why should they not become so in the other? Why should citizenship depend on where the family has been posted at a particular time? I cannot see the reason for that principle and I await with interest what the Minister will say. I beg to move.</p>

First, in discussing the previous amendment, the noble Lord indicated that he would allow no conditions to what he would commit to in discussions of that amendment. The Government are not committing themselves either ahead of that to make changes in the law. However, it does need an understanding of why those conditions were sought so as to allow a more sensible, temperate and&#151;in the eyes of some&#151;more sympathetic decision to be made. It might be useful to read into the record my response to the noble Lord and questions and answers can be taken afterwards in a more general discussion.</p>

<a name="90304-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09030469000118"></a>The Government would resist the amendment as it appears in the Marshalled List. The proposed amendment would remove in its entirety the proposed Section 4D. The amendment proposes that British citizenship otherwise than by descent be acquired automatically at birth by any child born outside the UK to a parent serving in the Armed Forces at the time of birth. The proposed amendment would therefore deal with children born to British citizens serving in the Armed Forces. However, this class of persons is already provided for by Section 2(1)(b) of the Act which deals with British citizens serving outside the UK in Crown Service as Crown servants, including those in the Armed Forces. The proposed amendment would therefore in part replicate the effect of existing statutory provisions.</p>

<a name="90304-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09030469000119"></a>However, I also understand that the purpose of the amendment may be to enable those born overseas to foreign and Commonwealth service personnel to acquire British citizenship automatically rather than by registration. We have elected to provide that citizenship be acquired by registration under the proposed Section 4D because we believe that it is right to enable foreign and Commonwealth nationals who are not themselves British citizens to determine whether they wish their child to acquire British citizenship where that child is born outside the UK. This will enable those parents to  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_748"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 748</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consider, first, for example, whether acquisition of British citizenship would lead to the loss of another citizenship that they feel is more important for their child to acquire. Secondly, even if there is no conflict in regard to dual nationality and the domestic law of another state, it is still possible that the parents may nevertheless not wish their child to acquire British citizenship. As a result, it is right that the parents of those born overseas decide what citizenship their child acquires.</p>

<a name="90304-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09030469000120"></a>The second and third amendments in this group would allow a person to register as a British citizen under the proposed Section 4D if born in the relevant circumstances before commencement of the provision&#151;that is, those born outside the UK and qualifying territories where, at the time of the birth, at least one parent was a member of the Armed Forces. Children born in such circumstances are currently able to register as a British citizen at the discretion of the Secretary of State under Section 3(1) of the British Nationality Act 1981 following, in the main, their return to the UK with the family unit on conclusion of an overseas posting. Alternatively, those individuals who return to the UK, do not register as a British citizen while a minor and remain resident in the UK can naturalise as a British citizen under Section 6(1) of the British Nationality Act 1981 when they are an adult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09030469000121"></a>It is also right to remember that the proposed Section 4D, which Clause 42 inserts, is based on a desire to remove obstacles to the acquisition of British citizenship for those born overseas to foreign and Commonwealth service personnel on active posting at the time of birth. This is a government commitment made clear in the Command Paper presented to Parliament in 2008, <I>The Nation's Commitment: Cross-Government Support to our Armed Forces, their Families and Veterans</I>. This is principally to ensure that, as has historically been the case, the mother of the child does not need to travel to the UK when heavily pregnant in order to ensure that the child acquires British citizenship automatically at birth as a child born to a parent who is settled for nationality purposes in the UK or qualifying territories. Such a mother will instead be able to give birth to her child overseas and the child can be registered as a British citizen from abroad. This is what our foreign and Commonwealth service personnel want and it will encourage ongoing service in our Armed Forces by removing current obstacles faced by the family unit.</p>

<a name="90304-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09030469000122"></a>Persons born outside the UK to foreign and Commonwealth service personnel since commencement of the British Nationality Act 1981 have been able either to register as a British citizen when a minor on their return to the UK or to naturalise as a British citizen as a result of ongoing residence in the UK when an adult. For those who are still children but have not yet been registered, Section 1(3) remains open as an avenue to registration as a British citizen. This means that no one is currently losing out. The proposed Section 4D is designed to facilitate the acquisition of citizenship by those yet to be born overseas in the relevant circumstances. Children born before commencement already have routes to citizenship.</p>

<a name="90304-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09030469000123"></a>For those reasons, the Government are confident that there is no strong argument for accepting the amendments. Further, when considering this matter, it is important to be conscious of the fact that the majority of those posted overseas in the UK Armed Forces are single men, the majority being in the Army, and that they travel alone and are without a spouse or civil partner. We estimate that currently fewer than 200 children a year are born to a parent serving overseas at the time of birth. Most of these have in any case been born in the UK and have acquired British citizenship automatically at birth.</p>

<a name="90304-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09030469000124"></a>That is the reasoning behind the Government&#146;s resistance to these amendments. However, as I said previously, were the amendment to be withdrawn, we think that it would be useful, if the noble Lord wishes, to continue the discussion on this and other matters.</p>

I want to take a simple situation. Let us imagine that I am a Fijian member of the Armed Forces of this country, playing rugby for a Scottish regiment, as many of them do, and that I am posted to Edinburgh. My wife has a child in Edinburgh and under Clause 40, that &#147;person&#148;,</p>
<ul><a name="09030469000219"></a>&#147;shall be a British citizen&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030469000164"></a>There is no question of applying to register. The suggestion that there is some conflict with dual nationality and that another country may not allow them to do that does not arise in Clause 40. As that same Fijian soldier, I may be sent to guard the embassy in Australia. I am not on active service but as part of my responsibilities I am sent there. The Government allow my wife to go as well and we have a child. That child does not become a British citizen by reason of membership of the Armed Forces. The child has to apply for registration, and if over the age of 10, has to pass the good character test.</p>

<a name="90304-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09030469000126"></a>It is exactly the same situation. The soldier has been sent to serve abroad, so what is the difference? In the five or 10 minutes that the Minister was talking I was hoping that he would elucidate the principle behind that. I cannot find one. I welcome the possibility of future talks and I will read in <I>Hansard </I>what the Minister said and try to understand it, but I still do not know the principle. If we are to reward Commonwealth citizens&#151;if British citizenship is regarded as a reward&#151;for serving in the British Armed Forces by giving citizenship as of right to their children born in this country, why do they not have the same reward if they are posted abroad? It is very simple: what is the difference?</p>

The registration route to British citizenship is designed for certain minors of a British parent born outside the UK, people already holding a lesser form of British nationality and others with family connections to the UK whose circumstances are treated as justifying a less rigorous path to citizenship than naturalisation. In the BNA 1981 the people in these groups are also classified according to whether their members were to be registered by entitlement solely on production of evidence that the prescribed criteria were satisfied or by discretion, with a good character requirement added to the test by Section 58 of the IAN Act 2006. It was only in 2006 that we began to insist on the good character test for any of these groups.</p>

<a name="90304-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09030469000131"></a>Initially the Government applied the test to everybody who was granted citizenship by registration under the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill of 2006 but we persuaded them to remove some groups from the list, such as the de facto stateless, British overseas citizens with no other citizenship and minors under the age of 10. However, we know from Monday&#146;s debate that some of the first of these categories are still out in the cold. Unfortunately, the Government still left the Hong Kong war wives and widows in the list, although when the then Home Secretary, David Blunkett, introduced registration for this group he said:</p>

In an Act sponsored by the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, in 1996, these wives and widows had been given the right to register as British citizens. There was no requirement then, or for the next 10 years, that they would have to pass a character test. Today, the UKBA says that, at most, there are some 53 of them still alive. They were not brought into the system, nor was any explanation given by the Minister about why these very elderly ladies should be subjected to the indignity of the test. I hope noble Lords will agree to take them off the list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09030469000135"></a>I shall tell noble Lords a little bit about Jack Edwards. He came from Cardiff and served as a sergeant in the Army during the Second World War. He was captured by the Japanese in Singapore and was held in Japanese camps for a long time. When he was released, he made it his business to seek out war criminals. It was as a result of his efforts that he discovered the only surviving copy of a Japanese order to massacre all prisoners of war if the allies landed on the Japanese home islands. Jack Edwards then moved to Hong Kong, where he was chairman of the British Legion and much involved in tireless efforts to obtain monthly pension awards from the British Government for ethnic Chinese veterans and their widows. In 1996, he fought for and won the granting of British citizenship to the wives and widows of those veterans. We are told that there are about 53 of them left. I met Jack Edwards; indeed, he was patron of the Hong Kong Welsh Male Voice Choir. I declare an interest as I followed him as its patron and have sung with it in the Sydney Opera House and the Royal Albert Hall. I therefore have a personal interest in Jack Edwards, who unhappily died in 2006. He was married to a delightful Chinese lady&#151;Polly&#151;who I met at the Armistice service the year before last.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09030469000136"></a>Why should these 53 widows be asked to pass a good character test? They must be in their 80s and 90s, and there are probably far fewer than 53 of them. I regard it as an insult that a clause of this sort should be put into the Bill, presumably as a result of a desire for bureaucratic tidying up of the legislation relating to the good character test. I am sure the Government will, on reflection, remove it from the Bill.</p>

I ask noble Lords to bear with me, as I was given the brief at the last minute. Both my colleagues on the Northern Ireland team were hoping to speak to the amendment but cannot do so.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09030469000140"></a>The common travel area has been very much part of my life. In 1946, I was taken as a child to the Isle of Man. I have been there in most years since, and 20 years ago my wife and I bought a cottage in the Republic of Ireland, so I am very much aware of the common travel area as it affects these isles.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09030469000141"></a>In effect, the clause abolishes the common travel area by removing the provision that means that persons departing from or arriving in the UK from within the common travel area are not subject to immigration controls. Since its advent, the common travel area has been suspended only during World War II. Even at the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s, the common travel area was maintained. The rationale given by the Government for these changes is set out in the impact assessment of the recent consultation on strengthening the common travel area. However, little empirical evidence is provided to support or explain the need for the changes, which seem to be unconnected to the reality of the situation on the border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09030469000142"></a>There is also an expressed intention to increase the number of intelligence-led ad hoc immigration checks on the land border. In practical terms, Clause 46 means that immigration officials can challenge an individual whom they suspect of not being in compliance with immigration rules to prove their nationality. This will apply not only to those travelling by sea and air but to those stopped by an ad hoc immigration check near the land border. As this power can be applied to any individual, including British and Irish nationals, it will mean that those living in the border area could be subject to frequent immigration checks on any journey near the border and could therefore feel compelled to carry identity with them on all journeys.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09030469000143"></a>Given our concerns about the basis for the intelligence-led operations, we are concerned that this pressure may be felt most strongly among the ethnic communities living on or near the border and by individuals from these communities contemplating travel between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This amendment aims to prohibit explicitly the practice of immigration checks on land crossings of the border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09030469000144"></a>We are extremely concerned at references to mobile checks being made on a risk-led basis. The CTA consultation proposed the introduction of,</p>
<ul><a name="09030469000221"></a>&#147;ad hoc immigration checks on vehicles ... to target non-CTA nationals&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030469000166"></a>The Home Office has subsequently stated that such checks would be intelligence-led on persons both arriving in and leaving Northern Ireland. The Government have not set out what criteria will be used as the basis for these operations or set out transparent monitoring to ensure that they are not relying on racial profiling.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09030469000145"></a>While the Government have stated that no fixed passport or identity document will be required for British and Irish citizens to cross the land border,

The clear question, in the context of ethnic diversity, is: will those policing the land border be able to tell who is a British or Irish citizen and who is not? Who, on indicating that they are not carrying particular travel documents, will be allowed to proceed and who will be subject to further examination and even detention until identity is verified?</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09030469000146"></a>Experience of these actions, in the form of Operation Gull, has been that immigration officers have carried out investigations on a discriminatory basis. On a number of occasions, the High Court has criticised the practices of immigration officers in cases involving Operation Gull which have come before them. The speed and secrecy under which Operation Gull is carried out results in individuals being unable to access independent legal advice that would be able to determine whether they have been detained lawfully. One of the chief concerns is that individuals could be questioned under Operation Gull on grounds of ethnicity or nationality, irrespective of their intentions.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09030469000147"></a>The proposed powers in the CTA consultation will only increase the likelihood of Operation Gull-type operations. It is essential that the circumstances in which such checks may be made are carefully defined, to avoid establishing a broad power of internal immigration control. We are concerned that these measures could have a disproportionate impact on ethnic minority persons crossing or even just living and working near the land border. The potential outcomes of these circumstances would mean that an ethnic minority person would constantly have to carry identity papers or face frequent questioning regarding their status.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09030469000148"></a>A number of cases came before the Northern Ireland High Court, the most recent of which was an application for judicial review by Jamiu Olanreaju Omikunle, a Nigerian student who had obtained a proper student visa and was unlawfully detained by immigration officers at Belfast International Airport on a local journey. The court held that he was detained unlawfully. He had recently been awarded a significant amount of money in compensation for his unlawful detention and the appalling treatment to which he was subjected while in detention.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09030469000149"></a>Approving this provision will endorse such discriminatory policies where ethnic and racial profiling is at the core of their rationale. The significant number of people being adversely affected by Operation Gull prompted the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to conduct an investigation into the implementation and conduct of this operation. We understand that the Human Rights Commission is soon to report its findings in relation to its investigation. The Government&#146;s attempt to introduce this provision at this stage is to neutralise its findings.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09030469000150"></a>We would also like a reassurance from the Government that they do not intend to make checks on those travelling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. The measures proposed in the Bill mean that UK citizens in Northern Ireland will be

It would be completely unacceptable for the Government to place controls on British citizens travelling from Belfast to the rest of the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09030469000151"></a>Moreover, the powers of examination detailed in Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 refer to and are understood as usually applying to aircraft and ships, and air and sea ports respectively. The Government, through regulation, can determine otherwise. However, in relation to the CTA, they have not indicated an intention to do so and such a move would contradict the stated objective of not introducing fixed control requirements on the land border. This contradiction would also emerge if the Government pursued the extension of examination powers to international railway stations and trains, and even in-county, without exempting CTA routes.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09030469000152"></a>Presently in Northern Ireland, international railway stations would include Newry, Portadown, Lurgan, Lisburn and Belfast Central, all of which are served by the Enterprise express between Belfast and Dublin, which crosses the land border, as well as being used for journeys within Northern Ireland. If the Government&#146;s intention to effectively extend the definition of a port to international rail did not exempt the CTA, this could introduce passport control, control areas and e-Borders to these stations. None of this is referenced as planned in the present CTA reforms. We would like the Government to assure the House that they are not planning to operate such checks. The Home Office has given clear indications that there will be no passport control on the land border for CTA nationals, despite stating its intention for CTA passport control to be introduced only on air and sea routes. That is not explicit in the Bill and is what we hope to achieve with this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09030469000153"></a><b><a name="90304-0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09030469000348"></a>Viscount Bridgeman:</b> I support the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Shutt. The Government&#146;s utterances on identity checks at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic have been unclear. In truth, that reflects either muddled thinking by the Government or a reluctance to come clean about what they are planning. The Government have said that there will be no question of establishing full-scale checks on the border, which reflects the practical and political impossibility of doing so. Instead, we will see ad-hoc checks, which we have been assured will be intelligence-led and carefully targeted, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09030469000154"></a>I do not consider that very reassuring at all. How will this work in practice? If people travelling across the border are to be stopped at random, how will they prove that they are British or Irish citizens, or otherwise have a right to be in the country? If the checks are entirely ad hoc, they will not know when these checks might take place. In other words, the Government are  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_756"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 756</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>requiring British citizens to carry identity documents at all times in case they stray over the border to go shopping, buy petrol or countless other legitimate everyday purposes in order to prove who they are. That is a very unsatisfactory way to sneak in ID checks on British citizens by their own Government. What will happen, for instance, to those people who are stopped but have not remembered to put their identity papers in the glove box of their car or their pocket? Will they be detained on the spot, followed home, made to report to a police station later or simply waved on their way?</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09030469000155"></a>If we swallow the argument that these stops will be carefully targeted, we must ask how that will be done. I have also seen the briefing from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, and I agree with the point that it makes. There is a great danger that the targeted checks will focus on people who look a bit different or foreign. Is that compatible with the noble Lord&#146;s statement on the front of this Bill that this is,</p>
<ul><a name="09030469000222"></a>&#147;compatible with the Convention rights&#148;?</ul>
<p><a name="09030469000167"></a>If the security and intelligence services have a genuine suspicion that someone is up to no good, it has ample powers at its disposal already for dealing with them. The Government have utterly failed to explain this measure, which will inconvenience thousands of people going about their lawful business and will not make the borders any more secure.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09030469000156"></a>That raises another point. Why are the Government proposing border checks into Northern Ireland on an ad hoc basis, but making those into Great Britain mandatory? What, exactly, is the threat posed to the people of the British mainland from which they must be protected, and why are British citizens in Northern Ireland to be deemed less at risk from that threat? Why would Northern Ireland need only ad hoc border protection if Great Britain needs stronger protection? If, as my noble friend Lord Glentoran suggested at Second Reading, this Bill is to protect the Great Britain border and not the United Kingdom border, why will the Government not at least be open about it?</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09030469000157"></a>Bearing that in mind, will the Minister please spell out the future position of British citizens seeking to travel from Northern Ireland to Great Britain on an entirely domestic journey? Will they be subject to immigration controls to compensate for the ad hoc or non-existent controls on the land border? These government proposals are likely to be so ineffective in their stated aim that either they have not been thought through or are paving the way for an entirely different and more far-reaching measure. I will be most interested to hear the Minister defend this clause, but at this stage I support the amendment from the noble Lord, Lord Shutt.</p>

Many British citizens take the common travel area for granted, in some ways&#151;when they go to Dublin, perhaps, or when British citizens within Northern Ireland travel within the island of Ireland&#151;but it does not generally receive a great profile. The common travel area is,

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09030480000002"></a>The group of amendments following this one might go more profoundly into Clause 46, but when starting to read about this I took out the Immigration Act 1971 from the Printed Paper Office, to try and understand what this clause does in relation to it. I found great difficulty in following it through, but although I could not understand this entirely from the legislation, I noted that the Explanatory Notes produced for the Bill say, in referring to Clause 46(1), that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="09030480000191"></a>&#147;This amendment will enable the routine control of all persons arriving in or departing from the UK via the CTA by aircraft or ship&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030480000188"></a>Perhaps this amendment is not necessary, because if the notes are true it is somehow suggested that the new provision does not include travel over land, but only &#147;by aircraft or ship&#148;. That seems entirely illogical if it is true, so I will be interested in the Minister&#146;s explanation of the Explanatory Notes.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09030480000003"></a>Clearly, it makes no sense at all to control access to the United Kingdom by aircraft or ship if we do not control it by the land border as well. Anybody wanting to enter Great Britain who we would not want here but who is already in, say, the Republic of Ireland&#151;although I understand that this would also include the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man&#151;will clearly just travel by land to Northern Ireland, and thereafter by air or ship on an intra-United Kingdom journey. I do not understand this to be giving any extra security or control to us as British citizens, let alone to those of other jurisdictions within the CTA.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09030480000004"></a>I will be interested to understand from the Minister exactly what benefit this provision has, at the expense of starting to erode strongly something that we should view as precious: the right of all citizens within the CTA to travel freely and without hindrance. As my noble friend Lord Shutt said, that was never seen as something that should be restricted during the Troubles, and I see no reason why it should be the case now.</p>

Indeed, we do not believe that anything in the Bill goes anywhere near to doing that. The CTA has been important and valuable to us in the past and will be in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09030480000006"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, mentioned, we are coming on to a series of other amendments on this clause, so I might not go into as much detail on this amendment as on them. There is also a clause stand part question as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09030480000007"></a>The Bill looks at the common travel area because we have found that a large number of people are slipping through the hoop, with some very real risks and problems. Therefore, when I was asked after the attacks on Tiger Tiger and Glasgow Airport in 2007 to look at a number of issues, I flagged up elements of border control. We were able to draw on work that had gone on in dealing with loopholes in the arrangements with the Republic of Ireland whereby some unpleasant and nasty people had been moving backwards and forwards, and problems relating to crime, trafficking,

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09030480000008"></a>Amendment 108ZA would restrict the power to control persons travelling across the land border, which would undermine the purpose of the CTA reforms&#151;as I said, we have gone to great length to discuss that with the Republic of Ireland&#151;and prevent the UK Border Agency carrying out effective controls on this route. That would prevent important improvements in our ability and flexibility to combat illegal immigration, terrorism and wider crime.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09030480000009"></a>As has been stated by noble Lords, political and practical considerations&#151;we all know this&#151;mean that fixed controls on the land border are not a viable option. It is clear that they are impractical. I have been on patrol there enough times. It is quite easy to get lost and end up drinking in a pub in the Republic of Ireland rather than Northern Ireland because it is such a difficult border. We have made it clear that we will not introduce routine border controls on the land border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. We have also made it clear that we will not require persons to carry a passport or national identity document on this route&#151;I shall come back to that shortly&#151;but we may want to check that a person is entitled to enter the United Kingdom without leave where we have intelligence that they might be entering unlawfully. We will not collect e-Borders data on those who cross the land border, although we will do so for those who travel on aircraft or ships, as e-Borders will spread to all aspects of ship and aircraft travel. We have made it clear that Clause 46 is only part of a process of reform of the CTA and that we will consider further the approach to intelligence-led, risk-based operations to tackle illegal movement over the land border as part of the wider simplification of immigration law. However, we are committed to retaining the CTA. It is an incremental process. It is the first step in making us safer and resolving some of the loopholes.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09030480000010"></a>I was asked by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, and the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, about the intelligence operations. The controls will not be fixed. We shall not ask every passenger arriving to present their passport to an immigration officer. We will target those who have no entitlement to enter the UK who we think pose a threat. We will use information obtained on the air-sea routes between the Republic of Ireland and the UK through our e-Borders system and other available intelligence.</p>

<a name="90304-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09030480000011"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, asked about ethnic-minority communities, which are clearly an issue. Passengers are selected very much on the basis of direct intelligence and risk, drawn from a number of sources&#151;to which I shall come. No passengers will be selected on the basis of race, and we are developing operating procedures, intelligence audit trails and ethnicity impact assessments to ensure no negative impact. We do not employ racial profiling. Under the land border operation on the quieter roads, we often stop a whole number of vehicles. That is not possible on the main Dublin-Belfast road, so we target the odd bus, minibus or taxi, because our experience has shown that those are much more likely to be a threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09030480000012"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, mentioned Operation Gull, which has highlighted to us the huge number of problems and difficult cases that we have. In the operation, we asked passengers for identification. Ninety per cent carry passports, even though they do not need to. We asked the remaining 10 per cent questions about their nationality and their UK immigration status. We verified that by checks with CID, WICU, CRS, Irish records, and fingerprint checks on the QuickCheck, re-interviewing the people concerned as appropriate when there were discrepancies. We found that a skilled immigration officer can weigh up a person&#146;s nationality and status very quickly through a mixture of good interviewing, IT and mobile databases, and a bit of common sense&#151;which is sadly lacking, very often&#151;both on the border and in Operation Gull. The Irish, of course, do exactly the same in reverse when they are checking persons entering Ireland who have no passport, so it is not an unusual thing to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09030480000014"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, asked about checks made on those travelling by air and sea from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. This is not covered in the CTA reforms, as it is a domestic journey, like a journey from, say, London to Liverpool. Persons are, therefore, not subject to immigration control. Section 14 of the Police and Justice Act 2006, to which the noble Lord rightly referred as enabling us to do certain things, introduced a new power that would allow the police to capture passenger, crew and service information on air and sea journeys. That is exactly the same sort of data that we are getting for our e-Borders. We will launch a separate consultation on domestic travel requirements in due course to cover that.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09030480000015"></a>On the travel documents needed to travel between the Republic of Ireland and the UK by air and sea, we will require all persons, including those who are British and Irish, to prove their identity and nationality with a passport or national identity card. Interestingly, I flew into Dublin about 10 days ago to have some talks with people and for other reasons, and I had to produce a passport on that occasion. That seemed to go against the grain of what has been said here&#151;but it is hardly surprising, when there are so many nasty and unpleasant people around, that one sometimes has to prove one&#146;s identity.</p>

I will speak to Clause 46 stand part with other noble Lords because, unless the Government can persuade us of its merits, we see no justification for Clause 46 standing part of the Bill. There are many reasons for this. It is partly because of the very high cost, with benefits unknown but probably negligible; the practicality of implementation; the lack of consultation; and the Government&#146;s confused thinking in this area, which does not seem to warrant the endorsement of your Lordships&#146; House or inclusion in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09030480000022"></a>I turn first to the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. These three self-governing dependencies are referred to as the Islands. They are sometimes referred to as the British Islands for the very good reason that they are dependencies of the Crown and are inhabited, for the most part, by British nationals. As my noble friend Lord Glentoran asked at Second Reading, in what possible way will putting up a barrier between the United Kingdom and these islands help to protect our borders? It really is not enough for the Government to give an assurance that any checks will be on an ad hoc basis, as indeed the Minister just has again. If the power is there, it is there to be used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09030480000023"></a>We have seen correspondence from the Isle of Man Government and the States of Jersey that makes clear their opposition to this clause. There is a long-established protocol that the Islands will be consulted on changes to UK immigration laws. To my knowledge, they have always adapted corresponding provisions. Perhaps the Minister will be kind enough to tell the Committee why the Government did not bother to consult the Islands about the changes proposed in this Bill. There are constitutional issues here, which the Government appear to have failed to address. The Bill makes no distinction whatever between the constitutional relationship between the Islands and the relationship with the Republic of Ireland, which is, of course, entirely different. Was this was just a simple difficulty in the drafting, or a failure by the Government to think through this proposal?</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09030480000024"></a>The main thrust of this clause is, I suspect, aimed at the border between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. We would not be able to guess at the reasons, although the Minister has outlined some of those in dealing with the previous amendment. What will the Government gain from intervening in the common travel area, which has survived the Second World War and the Northern Ireland Troubles? The CTA is an internal immigration arrangement and nothing more. By messing around with it the Government will not magically shut down the flow of illegal goods or change the face of illegal immigration to the UK. They will simply hinder the free travel of British and Irish citizens.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09030480000025"></a>The impact assessment produced by the Government explains in Section 2.6:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="09030480000193"></a>&#147;Notwithstanding the principle of free travel within the CTA, it is not lawful for a person who is not a British Citizen to enter the UK (including the Crown dependencies) where their presence was unlawful in another part of the CTA, unless they are given leave to enter. The practical effect of this is that if someone with valid leave in the UK or Islands travels to another part of the CTA, and their leave subsequently expires, and that person then returns to the United Kingdom or Islands without obtaining further leave, that person becomes an illegal entrant. This enables enforcement action to be taken when appropriate and reduces the risk of abuse within the CTA&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030480000189"></a>In other words, the lack of an internal border has no magic effect on the rights and entitlements of those under immigration control. The most dramatic effect of the reimposition of controls will be on those not

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09030480000026"></a>The cost of implementation, according to the impact statement, could be as much as &#163;75 million and that will mainly fall on the tourism industry. Is it clever in any circumstances, particularly in the current economic climate, to affect the tourism industry in that island? Thousands of people will presumably find that they need a passport to visit friends, family and colleagues where before they did not. Have the Government considered the knock-on costs on hauliers, ports and the countless businesses that rely on them?</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09030480000027"></a>Again, the impact assessment rather damningly cannot put any figure at all on the benefits to be accrued under this clause. That speaks for itself. Any claims that this clause will improve the United Kingdom&#146;s security sounds rather unlikely given that this measure was not deemed necessary even in the security crisis of the 1970s and 1980s. If the Government are serious about wishing to protect our borders, our citizens&#146; way of life and our good relations with our only land neighbour, they would engage constructively with the Republic of Ireland and with the Islands to construct a secure e-Border system that would encompass the whole of the British Isles and allow free travel therein without unwarranted and costly intrusion from the state. We do not believe that this clause is justified and we believe that its removal would make this a better Bill. I beg to move.</p>

Amendment 108CA deals with visas. Given the benefits that the common travel area has brought to the UK and the Republic of Ireland, we would be in favour of legislation that formalised the increase of transparency in the common travel area. For that reason, we support moves to introduce a common visa system or a system of mutual recognition of visas between common travel area members. For that to be effective and just, it should apply to those in the common travel area on long-term visas and be easily affordable for those applying.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09030480000031"></a>Such a system should include not only short-term visas but the right to rely on a residence permit issued in one state in order to travel to the other. That would be of use to many including those on long-term study visas or who work within the border regions. Furthermore,

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09030480000032"></a>The Republic is currently working on its own e-Borders programme. In the light of this, we feel that it would be more appropriate for the Government to work closely with the Irish Government effectively to draw a line around our two islands and allow the free flow of movement between them. To that end, will the checks be relaxed if a complementary system of e-Borders and visa checks is developed between Ireland and the UK?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09030480000033"></a>Amendment 108CB concerns various forms of identity. Clause 46 will allow immigration officials to challenge an individual whom they suspect of not being in compliance with immigration rules to prove their nationality. This will apply not only to those travelling by sea and air, but to those stopped by an ad hoc immigration check near the land border. This power can be applied to any individual, including British and Irish nationals. Clearly, there will be a considerable socio-economic impact on CTA nationals who travel between the UK and Ireland and who do not have passports or identity cards, because they will now have to purchase them.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09030480000034"></a>A friend of mine recently decided to leave home and get married. He was of mature years, but because he lived at home, he did not have gas bills in his name. He has never driven a car and he has never been abroad. He had great difficulty in getting a mortgage. The whole business of identity is important. One can see how this can be replicated, with people having to understand their identity and prove it.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09030480000035"></a>Communities on the border will be affected, especially those near sea crossings and where tourism is a cross-border pursuit by virtue of the proximity between the north and south of Ireland. The lakes of Fermanagh straddle the two jurisdictions and are major tourism destinations both in the Republic and Northern Ireland. It would be severely inconvenient for people there to have to carry identification. There could be a particularly significant impact on ethnic minority communities in these locales. The impact of these measures will be disproportionately felt in Northern Ireland. It is our belief that they will impact negatively on levels of trade and tourism.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09030480000036"></a>I turn now to the clause standing part. The UK Border Agency&#146;s figures suggest that implementing these measures would lead to an economic cost from loss of tourism revenues of up to &#163;12 million in the first year. However, it is not clear where the figures come from, or to whom they apply. Is the Minister able to elaborate? Does this cost apply to tourism in the UK, Northern Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands? Have the Government had any discussions with the Irish Government about the potential impact on tourism? The tourism industry is one of the most important sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, and to introduce a measure that could damage it in current economic circumstances is quite irresponsible. One effect of the downturn in the economy is that people

This measure would put a dampener on that.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09030480000037"></a>I will deal with one other area. Reference has been made to the Isle of Man. As I indicated, I have had a love affair with the Isle of Man since 1946. The Isle of Man received the draft Bill on 18 December, with the First Reading due on 14 January. It seems that there was very little notice. I do not understand that, because under the Belfast agreement there was to be something called the Council of the Isles. The Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England would all be represented in the Council of the Isles. Has this subject been taken to the Council of the Isles? I cannot think of anything more suitable for a discussion there than this. If it has not been discussed by the council, the Government should frankly withdraw it and have proper discussions, and then consider these matters.</p>

<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="09030480000038"></a><b><a name="90304-0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09030480000218"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> I admit that I favour the proposition to remove the clause altogether, although I agree with my noble friend&#146;s suggestion of a common visa policy. In a broader context, the Bill clearly says that the UK Government look upon the Irish Government as incapable of properly managing their own borders. The common travel area should revolve around both those jurisdictions being able to sensibly and effectively keep out people who are not supposed to be there. Instead, we seem to have an attitude of, &#147;Well, that&#146;s not going to work properly. We don&#146;t trust that system and must therefore bring in something else&#148;. But that something else clearly cannot work effectively; it is incapable of doing so.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09030480000039"></a>I agree entirely with a common visa system between those different jurisdictions in the common travel area. But let us be plain about it. Even though I am sceptical about how effective we can make all our borders, if we feel that the Republic of Ireland cannot come up to what we require for e-Borders, perhaps we should say so. However, this is not an answer to that.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09030480000040"></a>Without destroying my own argument, my solution would be for both Ireland and the United Kingdom to join the Schengen acquis. That would be far more effective. Although a government Minister has recently said that that is not on the agenda at the moment&#151;I was interested to hear &#147;at the moment&#148;&#151;I understand that that will by no means be a practical solution within the timescale of the Bill; it is not currently a politically feasible solution. However, I see this as throwing something valuable away and replacing it with something that just cannot work.</p>

I am sure, however, that this has been a helpful opportunity to have a wide ranging debate on the issue raised by Clause 46.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09030480000042"></a>I begin by outlining why we are making these changes. We do not go and make changes for no reason, just to rock things up for everyone and be a

We do them for reasons. We have made clear the value that we attach to the political, economic and social benefits of the common travel area. We are committed to maintaining the common travel area, and preserving those benefits. However we know that the current CTA arrangements are being abused. So do the Irish, because we have had long talks with them. So do the people in Northern Ireland, because we have talked with the Administration there as well.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09030480000043"></a>Part of the reason that I said that we need to do something when I looked at this in 2007 is that we have become more aware that serious organised criminals are using the CTA to facilitate their criminal activity, illegal migration and trafficking. We were aware, from the clear evidence of Operation Gull, of immigration abuse between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. The sorts of numbers that we are talking about are just under 4,000 immigration offenders. This is possibly just the tip of an iceberg.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09030480000044"></a>There is also clear evidence of abuse of both the United Kingdom&#146;s and Ireland&#146;s asylum system, where persons who have lodged a claim for asylum in one country then travel to the other and make a further claim.</p>

<p><a name="st_121"></a>

Everybody has to have their fingerprints recorded in the first country of asylum. When they go to the second country and their fingerprints are compared with the Eurodac database, it is found that they have already applied in another country. It cannot happen.</p>

As I say, we have found that there are cases of this, which is why we have discussed it with the Irish. The noble Lord looks puzzled by that, so I will get back to him in writing on that point. He would be amazed how people get around the little systems in place. We are clear that there is abuse of the system.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09030480000047"></a>I will come to costs in a little more detail later. I am not sure how accurate those costs are, as the figure I had quoted was about &#163;7 million for tourism costs. The noble Baroness and a number of others raised that. The key thing is that we are doing these things because a lot of rules are being broken and a lot of dangerous people are involved in it, which causes a lot of harm to innocent people and puts us at risk. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, mentioned that in the 1970s and 1980s, when some terrible things were going on in relation to Northern Ireland and the Troubles, there were an awful lot of other provisions in place at that stage. I was involved in some of those, and they helped us a little more. A lot of those things have been dismantled, for various reasons.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09030480000048"></a>Amendment 108BA would remove the islands&#151;that is, the Crown dependencies&#151;from Clause 46. That would mean that a person coming from the islands would, unlike now, require leave to enter. This would treat the Crown dependencies differently from the Republic of Ireland; they would be treated less favourably. I think the intention is to ask why the islands are subject to Clause 46, and that is the point I will address.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_766"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 766</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90304-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09030480000049"></a>We accept that there is not the same need for heightened supervision of routes from the Crown dependencies to the UK as there is on routes from the Republic of Ireland. We have no intention to introduce routine controls on routes from the Crown dependencies, but we want to continue to treat the CTA as a single entity and to maintain a secure platform for the range of intelligence-led activities which will be necessary at different times and in different places within it. We do not think we can readily differentiate provision for the Crown dependencies without prejudicing those aims&#151;in other words, without prejudicing the status of the CTA. Clause 46 leaves intact the broad framework for the CTA contained in the Immigration Act 1971, including the general provision that those arriving on local journeys do not require leave to enter.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09030480000050"></a>The Crown dependencies were consulted at length. Part of the problem is that, after all the consultations, they were a little surprised when they saw the legislation as it stood. We will have to talk to them a little more about exactly why we have done this, because we believe it is important to keep the CTA as it stands.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09030480000051"></a>Amendments 108A to 108D would provide that persons both arriving and departing from another part of the common travel area are not subject to control. Amendment 108CB would widen the forms of acceptable documentation for travel on air and sea routes between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. A passport or national identity document provides the most secure way of establishing nationality and identity, and it ensures that carriers may discharge their legal responsibility to transmit valid passenger data. The requirement to carry a passport or national identity card is consistent with practice on all other international routes, and we think that accepting less secure forms of documentation will threaten our border security. The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, gave a very good argument as to why identity was so important&#151;it was also a very good argument for why we should have identity cards, so I thank him very much for that.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09030480000052"></a>Amendment 108CA would allow those who have been issued visas in the Republic of Ireland to enter the UK without leave. We do not think that this is the correct approach. Instead, we will continue to work closely with the Government of the Republic of Ireland, and the Crown dependencies, to secure the external CTA border and explore the merits of a common visa with the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09030480000053"></a>All of these amendments would undermine the clause and prevent the UK Border Agency from carrying out effective border controls on air and sea routes between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, preventing important improvements in our ability to flexibly combat illegal immigration, trafficking, terrorism and other wider crime.</p>

<a name="90304-0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09030480000054"></a>I will now deal with the Question whether the clause should stand part. The UK already has some of the toughest borders in the world. The e-Borders programme has tracked 80 million passenger movements, leading to 34,000 alerts and almost 3,000 arrests, and we have brought forward the timetable for the full roll-out of e-Borders, including to the CTA.</p>

As I say, these are real worries because there is a chink there that is being exploited by the bad guys.

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09030480000064"></a>The modest change in the Bill will allow important improvements in our ability to combat illegal immigration, terrorism and wider crime. It should be considered as one aspect of the wider reform of the CTA which will preserve its special nature. Those aims of improving security while preserving the benefits will guide our consideration of any further reforms. We must also recognise the facts of geography. The practical challenges of introducing routine border controls on the land border would entail costs that outweigh any theoretical gain. As with a lot of counterterrorism, you could expend our national wealth on it, and it has to be risk-based. That is not on the agenda.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09030480000065"></a>Some have tried to argue that there is no point in having the new controls on air and sea routes between the Republic and the UK which we propose if they are not replicated at the land border or on journeys from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. But our aim is not uniform and impregnable defences, which are of course unachievable. Our aim is to change the odds and make life significantly more difficult for people who are trafficking, illegal immigrants, other criminals and terrorists. Variable, selective and intelligence-led action can be particularly effective in doing that; we know that historically. CTA reform needs to be considered together with all the other things we are doing to strengthen our border and immigration systems both now and in the next few years.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09030480000066"></a>The e-Borders programme is particularly relevant as it will be the platform used to collect data. The platform will collect and analyse passenger, service and crew data provided by air, sea and rail carriers in respect of all international journeys to and from the United Kingdom in advance of travel. That will allow resources to be targeted on those intending harm to the UK or to deceive the UK authorities, while enabling the majority of bona fide passengers to continue their journey with minimal disruption. The e-Borders platform will receive and process travel document information for 100 per cent of passenger and crew movements by March 2014. Under e-Borders, it is the responsibility of carriers to submit passenger information via pre-defined interfaces to the operations centre in advance of travel.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09030480000067"></a>The legislation will mean that passengers on air and sea journeys from the Republic of Ireland to the UK will need to hold travel documents that satisfactorily establish identity and nationality so that carriers may discharge their legal responsibility to transmit valid passenger data, regardless of whether an immigration control is being exercised on that particular route at that time.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09030480000068"></a>Outside the CTA reforms we are also considering other changes. Under Section 14 of the Police and Justice Act 2006, the police have the power to require carriers to provide passenger data on specified domestic air and sea routes. That power could be extended to

Those routes offer the most suitable screening and intervention opportunities to address vulnerabilities from those crossing the land border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland but we are not proposing setting up immigration controls on this route or requiring passengers to carry a passport or national identity document.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09030480000069"></a>The Police Service of Northern Ireland and other UK police forces would then be able to use data collected to support intelligence-led interventions to counter terrorism and tackle serious and organised crime such as trafficking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09030480000070"></a>The Government have yet to complete consideration of when the 2006 power to capture data on Northern Ireland-Great Britain routes would be introduced. We intend to consult in the spring, with the consequent secondary legislation&#151;for affirmative action&#151;being taken forward in autumn 2009.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09030480000071"></a>I was asked many questions and will address some of them now. The Irish are fully supportive of our reform plans. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked whether that means that we do not trust them. I would put it the other way, because the Irish are very keen on receiving the data from us: on that basis, perhaps they do not trust us. Let us put it differently: we both want to be absolutely certain what movement is happening because some of the bad guys are coming from us, from Northern Ireland to the Republic. The programme is there to obtain a handle on how bad they are and what they are doing.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09030480000072"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, asked whether the plans had been discussed with the Council of the Isles. My right honourable friend Phil Woolas has written to the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body and the British-Irish Council about our proposals.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09030480000073"></a>I think I have covered why we were operating a different policy on the Republic of Ireland and Crown dependencies routes. The Republic of Ireland operates its own separate immigration control and the Crown dependencies are in practice very closely aligned and operationally integrated with those of the UK. Of course, international routes into the Crown dependencies are very limited.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09030480000074"></a>On the Crown dependency-to-UK route, we will increase the frequency of intelligence-led controls and we will not introduce fixed or routine controls or a document requirement to come from there. We have been in negotiation with the Crown dependencies. All I can assume is that this was not quite what they had expected to come out of the prolonged negotiations and we must have more discussions with them.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09030480000075"></a>On consistency with Ireland&#146;s approach, I have already mentioned that since 1997 the Republic has maintained immigration control on third-country nationals.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09030480000076"></a>In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, the impact statement considers all impacts of public, private and third sectors. I have a very comprehensive breakdown of the costs and so on, and perhaps I may write to her and others who are interested in seeing them.</p>

The point of doing it is to get at the criminals and the terrorists, but there will also be an impact on tourism, although exactly what that impact will be is not quite so clear-cut. Perhaps I may write with the details because the figures are not very precise, but it is appropriate that we should look at that. A balance has to be struck. If the cost is &#163;7 million, for example, we have to ask whether the extra safety that we will get as a result of the measures that we are taking is worth that &#163;7 million.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09030480000078"></a>If there are any questions that I have not covered, perhaps noble Lords will get back to me and I shall try to respond to them in writing on the specific points. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, raised the question of Schengen. As I said, there is no intention of our being part of that or of going in that direction at the moment. I think that we have more effective and secure borders because we are not part of it, and that is a good thing, bearing in mind some of the risks that there have been in the past.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09030480000079"></a>As I said, I do not regard the decisions on Clause 46 to be consequential on a decision on the amendments, and I should be very grateful if the noble Baroness would withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="09030480000080"></a><b><a name="90304-0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09030480000226"></a>Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> Perhaps I may make a brief intervention. I have taken an interest in the subject of security amid these islands and have alluded to it during this Committee stage. I did not speak to the amendments moved by my noble friend Lady Hanham because I realised the Government&#146;s motivation behind this clause and therefore gave them the benefit of the doubt until I had heard their case.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09030480000081"></a>However, I make one small warning on a matter which the noble Lord mentioned in his concluding remarks, and that relates to the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body. It was founded in 1990, arising out of the Anglo-Irish agreement, and the unionists were not prepared to join it because that was its origin. My noble friend Lord King of Bridgwater, who had been Secretary of State in Northern Ireland at the time that the agreement was signed in 1985, served on the body from 1992 to 1997, when I took his place and served until 2007.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09030480000082"></a>The body has been an outstanding success in improving relations and reducing suspicions between Members of this Parliament and Members of the Dáil. After the Belfast agreement, we were joined by elected representatives from the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. I understand that the unionists are now to join the body, which is a good index of improved relations within Northern Ireland, but ironically it occurs at the very moment when the body is wondering what its purpose will be from now on. At least in the short term, I congratulate the Government on having given a raison d&#146;être to the body, which is shortly to meet for one of its semi-annual plenary sessions in County Donegal&#151;a meeting which may well occur before this Bill concludes its passage through this House. The body meets alternately between the Republic and Great Britain.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09030480000083"></a>The one cautionary word that I utter is that, if this Parliament has had difficulty in knowing what the Government are about, it may well be that, when the

I mention quietly&#151;the noble Lord will already have realised this&#151;that, because it is on Irish soil, it will be Irish Ministers who answer the questions.</p>

<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="09030480000084"></a><b><a name="90304-0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09030480000227"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> I thank my noble friend for that helpful intervention. I feel very inadequate as he has a great deal more experience of Northern Ireland than probably many of us here today, except those who live there. I am grateful to him.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09030480000085"></a>I have two questions. I tell the Minister now that I shall withdraw the amendment but I shall come back to it on Report because I think that there are still too many issues outstanding here. At least two of those concern the amount of consultation that has taken place. The Minister says that there has been a great deal of consultation with the Government of the Republic of Ireland, who are in favour of it, and I have nothing that gainsays that. However, I am a little perturbed when he says that he feels that they should probably talk to the Council of the Isles to try to reassure it about what is being proposed. It ought to have been reassured before the measure was put forward&#151;it is too late. Our information is that the consultation process with the islands was not adequate. I hope that by indicating now that I will come back to this, perhaps by the time we get to Report the Minister will have been able to ensure that at least proper discussions have been undertaken with the island authorities so that they are clear and support what is being done in their name.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09030480000086"></a>I am also interested that the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body will be discussing this in a month&#146;s time. Presumably the group has not discussed it before. Again, one would have thought it to be a major body to give consideration to the issue.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09030480000087"></a>There is concern about the Government&#146;s proposals. The Minister said that the common travel area is not being dismantled but it depends how you define the common travel area. If it is to give unfettered movement between one country or countries and another, clearly that is being put in jeopardy by these proposals. The Minister has said a great deal about the bad guys; there have always been problems within Ireland and elsewhere and difficulties with people coming into this country. Indeed, I remember the Troubles very well and the problems there, but at that time there was still pretty much freedom of movement. I am not convinced that the measures are justified. It would be helpful to have a little more idea of how deep the consultations have been, particularly with the islands, and perhaps for us to have some idea of what the Irish Government feel, although the Minister said that they were in favour. For today&#146;s purposes, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I shall also be speaking to Amendments 109 to 110A, and Clause 47 stand part is included in the group so that we can have a wider discussion on what is proposed.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09030480000089"></a>I oppose the clause as it stands as there are not enough safeguards on what the Government are doing, so I shall give a brief outline of each amendment. Amendment 108E would restrict the power to impose a condition regarding studies so that it could be imposed only on migrants who had been given leave for the purposes of study rather than anyone with limited leave to enter or remain. Amendment 109, which is a probing amendment, would limit the condition on studies that could be imposed on someone with limited leave to enter or remain, thereby allowing the imposition of a condition that tied the person to study at a particular institute. Amendment 110 would require the Secretary of State to consider immediately any application to vary a condition regarding studies, and Amendment 110A would ensure that these conditions could not be imposed retrospectively.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09030480000090"></a>The amendments would improve the clause and assist with the intention by ensuring that the scope of the power properly matched its stated intention. In other words, it would allow the permission granted to overseas students to be linked to the particular institution that sponsors them under the points system.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09030480000091"></a>When the Minister replies, will he confirm that if a student wishes to change a course within his sponsored institution, he will be able to do so without having to appeal again or make a new application to the UK Border Agency? Clause 47 appears to allow for any condition to be imposed restricting the studies of anyone with limited leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. This could include restrictions that would tie a foreign student to a particular institution and require it to inform the UK Border Agency of a wish to change institution for the purposes of sponsorship and regulation of the points-based system. It could also include restrictions on any migrant with limited leave to remain or enter, including those who are undertaking, or wish to undertake, studies, who are not here as foreign students under the point-based system, migrant workers, those joining partners or other family members and refugees.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09030480000092"></a>I should like to see Clause 47 work effectively and to its purpose. For that, students must be sure of where they stand&#151;hence our amendment on retrospectivity. They must be sure that in any dealings they have with the Home Office if they wish to change their studies within an institution&#151;I hope the Minister will tell me that that is not necessary&#151;or to change institution, it will deal with those applications speedily and efficiently. I have previously raised concerns that a student can get stuck on a course that is wrong for him  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_773"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 773</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because he cannot get a decision from the Home Office that would enable him to change his course or institution and he would require sponsorship by the new institution. Can the Minister give me assurances about how those applications will be handled and that they will be done with some speed?</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09030480000093"></a>The Minister will recognise, as we do, that the huge majority of overseas students come here to study and, by doing so, to enhance their own learning, skills and abilities and that the reputation of this country relies, to some extent, on their view of what happens when they come here. Many of them bring with them, as they have to, financial assistance to those institutions in the form of substantial fees. We must get right the balance between the need to ensure that people coming to this country to study are bona fide and making it impossible for them to change their course if they are here. If someone suddenly finds that he does not want to be a consultant engineer but a doctor, we must make clear that that can happen, the process by which it can happen and the fact that it can be done in a timescale which will enable him to move from one course or position to another within the ambit of time that would enable him not to get left behind for too long.</p>

Happily, at the moment, I have none from outside the European Union, but several of my colleagues at the London School of Economics do. I recognise this clause as an old friend. We have been through this over many years, and my first question has to be whether the Government have fully consulted Universities UK and whether Universities UK has expressed itself happy with this. On previous occasions over at least the past 10 years, we have had problems when those in Government concerned with higher education have taken one view and those in the Home Office concerned with stopping overstayers have taken an entirely different view, and it has been clear that there has not been a coherent government position. I hope that that is not the case now.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09030480000095"></a>We recognise that there is a problem with overstayers. Nevertheless, we also recognise that, given the nature of research degrees and the quality of research in this country, it is very difficult to tell people that they will spend only three years examining a particular problem. Very often, when you start out on a research degree, it is very difficult to say how long it will take. Over the years, we have seen limitations on how long people are allowed to enter for and rising costs for renewing their visas when the time comes. We are putting obstacles in front of bright young people who want to study in Britain.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09030480000096"></a>Many of us have argued that the answer had to be in the registration of institutions since, as I have understood on several occasions, the problem has been most acute with fly-by-night colleges or second-floor colleges setting themselves up as the London college of whatever it is that attracts people in from obscure parts of the world. It would have been, and remains, relatively easy to sort out which are genuine institutions of further and higher education and which are fly-by-night operations. I am conscious, however, that it is not

I was lobbied on my way home the other night by a woman who used to be my Alexander technique teacher and who is currently training Alexander technique students from Latin America. It takes two to three years to train them through an apprenticeship, and one of her immediate concerns is precisely Clause 47.</p>

<a name="90304-0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09030480000097"></a>I therefore register the unhappiness throughout the higher education sector at this whole process and would like reassurance that there has been very full consultation in government with what I think we are now supposed to call DIUS&#151;no doubt it will have a different name in a couple of months&#151;and effective consultation with Universities UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09030480000099"></a>The amendment raises very important points and highlights concerns that have been expressed about the clause. I will confine my remarks to medicine. Students entering to study medicine at Oxford, Cambridge or St Andrews have no idea when they enter where they will do their clinical studies after their first three years. In fact, where they go depends on how they perform in those first three years, so it is completely unpredictable.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09030480000100"></a>The other difficulty is that the courses are for six years. At the end of the six years, the students have to enter a pre-registration year. Although they are paid and employed, they still fall under the supervision of the undergraduate dean. At the end of the pre-registration year, the Medical Act requires the undergraduate dean to state that the student is fit to be fully registered. The length of the undergraduate course alone does not determine the completion and registration of a medical degree. Without being registered&#151;they are registered with the GMC&#151;their degree has very little currency. The other problem is often that they do undergraduate studies and then wish to progress on to postgraduate studies. Indeed, they come to this country in the first place because that type of training is simply not available in the country in which they have been, because the places are so restricted or because there have been restrictions against the ethnic group to which they belong in their country of origin.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09030480000101"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick of Undercliffe, outlined at Second Reading, the amount of money that is brought into this country is not inconsiderable. She estimated that it was more than &#163;100 million. I think that that is probably an underestimate, because postgraduate students come over as well. Those who come over as postgraduate students present a different set of problems. We now have an increasing number of distance-learning courses. The students come across for study days but do a lot of study in their own country on their own clinical base. They then come back for their exams and to graduate. They may be on such a course, which is a part-time course, for up to six years. The length of time will depend to some extent on how quickly they progress through the course and

When they are the lead in their specialty in their own country and they want to undertake postgraduate study abroad, it takes very little to make the workload insurmountable, leading to them having to take a temporary leave of absence from their course.</p>

Perhaps I may refer to the course that I run which takes students up to MSc level.

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09030480000103"></a>During this debate, we have heard much about those of mal-intent, but I do not think that we should underestimate the economic, cultural and scientific advantage to this country of many of the students who come here. We are in very stiff competition for those students with other parts of the world, particularly the USA and Australasia, but increasingly with other countries, particularly in the Far East. The current economic climate means that any students have to be very careful about the fees that they pay and the obstacles which are in their way to coming here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09030480000104"></a>In summing up, I ask the Minister to confirm that all these points have been considered in discussions that he has had with Universities UK, to inform the Committee how extensive his discussions have been with the Medical Schools Council and to say how postgraduate students on distance learning courses in particular would be affected by this clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09030480000106"></a>For a long time, I have been conscious of the campaign to get students to come to this country. I was directly involved as higher education Minister between 1983 and 1985 when full-cost fees for overseas students were introduced. The legislation for full-cost fees was deliberately ambiguously defined, but not quite enough use was made of that ambiguous definition by some of the higher education establishments.</p>

Normally the Commonwealth education Ministers met every four years, but UNESCO was meeting in Sofia the following year. Mr Ramphal reckoned that most of the

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09030480000108"></a>I understand Governments&#146; 20-year balancing act between ensuring that recruitment to our higher education institutions was reinforced and their concern about individual controls. Hence, I understand the logic of the amendments which my noble friend Lady Hanham has tabled. However, for 24 years, I was a central London MP, in a constituency which had a large number of language schools. Are students in language schools, but not in higher education, covered by this legislation? I assume that they are because I see no wording to suggest that they are not, but it would be helpful to have that confirmed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09030480000109"></a>In that regard, over that quarter of a century, I had a huge postbag of immigration cases. I was conscious how often Lunar House and the Home Office, on the one hand, and the language schools, on the other, totally lost track of students who had arrived at a language school and might well have disappeared into the larger community. I am sympathetic towards, and supportive of, what the Government seek to do. I also wholly understand the questions raised by my noble friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09030480000113"></a>In speaking to this group of amendments, I do not regard the Question that the clause stand part to be consequential on any decision on Amendments 108E, 109, 110 and 110A. I have listened very carefully to a wide range of points made in the debate on the amendments and more generally on the clause. I must resist the amendments, but I want to go into the reasons very carefully. I do not apologise for going into detail in this longish script. I went through it in great detail with my team to ensure that it answered most of the questions. I think that is useful for <I>Hansard</I> and the Committee.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09030480000114"></a>Members of the Committee may be aware that we have reconsidered the proposed policy for tier 2 with regard to the maximum length of leave. We have changed our policy and will now grant a tier 4 general student studying a course at degree level or above leave to enter or remain for the duration of their course, as under the current system. I think this is a significant change and one which makes a lot of sense. I am grateful for the conversations I have had with a number of Members of this Committee in reaching this decision. I am sure noble Lords will appreciate that the change is intended to ensure that international students wishing to study comparatively longer courses, such as medicine, are not deterred from coming to the United Kingdom to undertake their studies.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_777"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 777</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90304-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09030480000115"></a>Thus, I hope I have provided the House with reassurance that flexibility in the rules allows the Government to make very rapid decisions such as this. This is a fundamental part of the points-based system but, for understandable reasons, primary legislation is needed to underpin certain aspects of the system. Clause 47 is thus essential to the operation of tier 4 as it allows for the control of foreign students once they have entered the United Kingdom to study at a licensed institution.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09030480000116"></a>It is the Government&#146;s intention that the restriction on studies would be placed on those migrants granted leave to enter or remain as tier 4 migrants; that is, students. Furthermore, such a restriction will restrict a migrant to studying at a specified institution, rather than restricting their chosen course of study. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, that I can provide an absolutely clear and unequivocal reassurance to the Committee that the Government do not intend to use this provision to prevent students from moving courses within the same sponsoring institution. By imposing a restriction on a migrant, so that he can study only at a specified institution, he would have to apply to the UK Border Agency to vary the conditions of his leave should he wish to change institution. This will allow the UK Border Agency to check that the institution to which the migrant wishes to move is a bona fide education provider, with a sponsor licence. Having the ability to link a student to a particular licensed institution is integral to the successful operation of tier 4, the student tier of the points-based system.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09030480000117"></a>I note that these amendments seek to probe why the Government believe the clause should provide a broad power to restrict a person&#146;s studies. I understand why Members of the Committee may wish to restrict this power further so that, on the face of the Bill, we are very specific about what this restriction means and on whom it may be imposed.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09030480000118"></a>However, it is usual practice for the overall architecture of the immigration system to be set out in primary legislation, with the Immigration Rules containing the detail of how the power will apply. While I appreciate that noble Lords may have their reservations about this approach, the ability to amend the Immigration Rules, rather than having to amend primary legislation, is an essential tool which is vital to ensure that necessary legislative changes can be implemented quickly and effectively, as shown with the point I mentioned about the maximum length of stay for people doing a study.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09030480000119"></a>As Members of the Committee will be aware, we take seriously our duty to consult widely before making changes to the Immigration Rules and, more often than not, our rules have been prayed against to allow the opportunity for debate in the House. With that in mind, Clause 47 was deliberately drafted in this way in order to achieve consistency with the wording used in relation to the imposition of other conditions under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1971&#151;in particular, the condition restricting a migrant&#146;s employment or occupation.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09030480000120"></a>Under the skilled-worker tier, tier 2, of the points-based system, the Immigration Rules set out the conditions on a migrant&#146;s employment, including a restriction on taking any employment other than with his licensed  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_778"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 778</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sponsor, supplementary employment that is outside of his normal working hours and voluntary work. We envisage that the condition this clause will allow us to impose on a migrant in relation to his studies will operate in much the same way, with the Immigration Rules specifying where these restrictions will apply, clearly stating that the restriction will be in relation to where the migrant studies and will be imposed on those granted leave to enter or remain under tier 4.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09030480000121"></a>As I explained earlier, a student applying for leave to enter or remain under tier 4&#151;the general student category of the points-based system&#151;will be granted leave for the duration of their course. With such potentially long grants of leave that will cover a student&#146;s entire course, it will be of even greater importance that we make clear the procedures a student will need to follow should he wish to change to a new institution.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09030480000122"></a>I must resist Amendment 110 because I am confident that the revised guidance, which I will address shortly, that will be published when we make changes to the Immigration Rules in order to impose this condition on tier 4 students, will specify exactly what a student will need to do if he or she wishes to change institution, in terms of the requirement for him to submit a new application to the UK Border Agency. The revised guidance will also make clear the likely timeframes for consideration of an application, so that a student is able to submit his application to allow him to take up his studies at the new institution in good time.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09030480000123"></a>I also think it would be inappropriate to specify in primary legislation that this type of application merits more prompt consideration than any other type of application for leave to remain as Amendment 110 suggests. Other applications for leave to remain may have equally or more compelling reasons for immediate consideration, and for which a migrant is paying a fee and expecting similar high standards of customer service.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09030480000124"></a>Provided a student meets the points requirement for tier 4, which he will be able to do by having a valid visa letter from a UK Border Agency-licensed sponsor and by meeting the maintenance requirement for extension applications, the application to change institution should be relatively straightforward and therefore considered within our published service standard timescales for postal and in-person applications.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09030480000125"></a>The border force aims to decide 70 per cent of postal applications within 4 weeks, 20 working days, and 90 per cent within 70 working days. In addition, albeit subject to higher application fees for a premium service, the border force aims to decide 90 per cent of applications made in person at a public inquiry office within 24 hours.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09030480000126"></a>Turning to Amendment 110A, we believe that amending the clause in this way will seriously undermine one of the key parts of tier 4 of the points-based system, essentially creating two distinct categories of student; namely, those granted leave to enter or remain under tier 4 before enactment of this clause and those granted leave under tier 4 after enactment. Let me first make clear to Members of the Committee that the provisions of subsection (2) are not retrospective. While we wish to be able to add the condition to all those who have been granted leave as a tier 4 student, if such  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_779"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 779</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a student changed institution between the launch of tier 4 and Royal Assent, without notifying the UK Border Agency of this change, he would not be subject to prosecution under Section 3(1)(c) of the Immigration Act 1971, nor would he be subject to removal under Section 10(1)(a) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 for breaching his conditions of stay.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09030480000127"></a>Furthermore, there is no intention to impose this condition on any of the students already in the United Kingdom under the terms of the current student rules that will be deleted on the introduction of tier 4. Only those students that UK Border Agency-licensed education providers bring to the UK under tier 4 from the end of March, or those existing students who will need to apply to extend their leave to remain under tier 4 after its launch in March, will be subject to this condition.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09030480000128"></a>It may be helpful to the Committee if I explain how we will implement this condition. As soon as we have secured Royal Assent, it is our intention to amend the Immigration Rules, specifying that in addition to the conditions restricting a student&#146;s employment, we will also add a further condition restricting the student to studying at the educational institution that is acting as the student&#146;s sponsor under tier 4. As is usual practice, the Immigration Rules will be laid before Parliament for 21 days before coming into force, and we will look to publish revised guidance for tier 4 students around what this change will mean for them when we lay the rules.</p>
<a name="time_15"></a>
<a name="90304-0008.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="09030480000208"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09030480000129"></a>Once the rules are in force, the UK Border Agency will write to all migrants who had been granted leave to enter or remain under tier 4, informing them that they will, from the date of the letter, be subject to this condition. Hence, the condition will apply only from when the student is notified. At the same time, we will also inform these students of the potential consequences of any subsequent breach. Once subject to this condition, a tier 4 student would need to apply to the UK Border Agency to vary the conditions on their stay before moving to a new institution.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09030480000130"></a>If we were not able to apply this condition to those granted leave between the launch of tier 4 at the end of March and enactment of the clause, there would be a pool of students who could move institution without our approval throughout the duration of their stay. We have revisited the policy on the maximum length of leave a student may be granted so that he may be granted leave for the full duration of his course, which could be five, six or even seven years in some instances. It is vital that the conditions of stay are applied equally to all students in the United Kingdom under the new system. If this were not the case, genuine students would risk being duped by bogus colleges which may charge high fees for non-existent courses. These colleges damage the UK&#146;s excellent reputation for education provision abroad, which has been referred to by a number of speakers, not least the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay. The noble Baroness referred to value. These students are of great value to the United Kingdom, both culturally, as has been said, and financially, to the sum of &#163;2.5 billion in tuition fees alone last year. That is a very significant amount of money and it is very important for this nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09030480000131"></a>Applying this condition to all those granted leave under tier 4 will make it much simpler for all such students to understand what is required of them when changing institution. It will be easier for the education providers that advise their students on what they will need to do when seeking to change institution. Applying the condition across the board to all tier 4 students will mean there is just one process for all. I do not apologise for going through that background because it is important to understand where we are coming from.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09030480000132"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked how applications will be considered. Provided the student meets the points&#146; requirement for tier 4, an application to change institutions should be very straightforward and will be considered within our standard service timescales, which are clearly laid out, and I touched on them earlier. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, asked whether we have fully consulted with Universities UK. Yes, we have consulted it on this provision. Officials at the Home Office and the UK border force have regular meetings with Universities UK to consult on tier 4 of the points-based system.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09030480000133"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, asked about PhD students. As now, we will grant leave for the duration of the student&#146;s course, as specified by the sponsoring education institutions. If a PhD student does not complete his course within this time period&#151;I know that happens because, goodness me, they really go on sometimes&#151;he will be able to apply for an extension of his leave. The revised maintenance requirement for extension applications recognises the progress that a student has made to date without recourse to public funds.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09030480000134"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, mentioned distance learning. Students coming to the UK for short periods of study and do not intend to work will be able to come as student visitors. That route sits outside the points-based system and does not require the same sponsorship and maintenance requirements as under tier 4 because they may only stay for up to six months and cannot work. The tier 4 requirements do not apply. The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, asked whether students in language schools were in higher education. The answer is yes; students who intend to study are counted within this category.</p>

<a name="90304-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09030480000135"></a>I hope that that covers most of the extra points. Perhaps Members of the Committee will come back to me if there is anything that I have not covered and I will get back to them in writing.

I would be certainly be willing to withdraw my opposition to Clause 47 standing part, subject to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, doing so, but I wish to stress a few issues further. The bogus college issue has been with us a long time; in this House, we have been round it for 10 years or more. There have to be other ways to get at it. It is relatively easy, when our missions abroad consider visas, to tell them which are the reliable further and higher education colleges and which are not. That is always raised by the Home Office in this context, and it is not half such a difficult problem as some others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09030480000139"></a>We all wish to emphasise that effective co-ordination between the Home Office and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills is an important part of this process. One cannot stress too much that at the top end of our education market, dealing with visiting students sympathetically is important in a host of ways. In the scientific and medical fields, there is the contribution that makes to British scientific and medical excellence, and the extent to which that maintains an international scientific community. In the social sciences, we are talking about soft power and cultural diplomacy.</p>

It is important to maintain them as friends of the United Kingdom as they pass from one generation to another, so it matters how we treat them. Part of what we need to get across is that we will deal with them sympathetically and not treat them all as potential criminals and, while we all know the Home Office of old, we hope that in this respect the Home Office recognises that one has to keep some doors open as well as having one or two closed.</p>

As long as I heard the Minister correctly, his reply demonstrated a sort of sympathy and pragmatism toward students. First, those who may want to change their course within the institution that sponsors them will, as I understand it, be able to do so without coming back to the UK Border Agency. Secondly, for those who need or want to change institutions, there should be a reasonably rapid turnover from the agency as long as that institution is licensed to sponsor and they have the sponsoring letter. That was really what the amendment was all about, and we have had a clear explanation from the Minister. Unless I choke when I read <I>Hansard</I> afterwards, I may not need to return to this issue.

<a name="09030480000142"></a><b><a name="90304-0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09030480000241"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> On Friday 31 October, I had a telephone call from Mr Yousif al-Khoei, the distinguished head of the al-Khoei Foundation, which is a Shia charitable and religious organisation in north London, about the detention of a British imam who had arrived earlier that day at Heathrow Terminal 1 on a flight from Damascus. I spoke to immigration officials at Terminal 1 three times&#151;the third time, to the chief immigration officer&#151;and was told on each occasion that no British citizen was being detained, although on the third occasion I was asked whether I might have been talking about somebody with a slightly different name.</p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09030480000143"></a>Finally, the helpful immigration duty officer to whom I spoke at about 2030 told me that the imam had been arrested on the landed side of immigration control, and was under investigation by the Special Branch. She got the senior Special Branch officer on duty at Terminal 1 to ring me at my request, and he confirmed that the imam, Mr A, had indeed been detained for questioning, that he had been fingerprinted and had a saliva DNA sample taken, and that he had then been released after something like two hours. A minicab sent by his wife to fetch him from the airport was waiting all that time. The numerous questions asked during the interview, I subsequently discovered from Mr A, mainly concerned the reasons for his frequent visits to places such as Syria and Kuwait, and he answered that he attended religious conferences and meetings in those countries.</p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09030480000144"></a>Later, Mr A sent me a copy of the notice that was served on him under the Terrorism Act 2000, a copy of which I have passed to the Minister, explaining that the requirement to be questioned did not necessarily mean that the examining officer suspected him of being concerned with acts of terrorism, but was in order to enable the officer to discover whether he was such a person. The notice required him to give the officer any documents of a kind specified and said that the officer had the power to examine his luggage and to detain anything, including a document which the search revealed. The notice said nothing at all about Mr A&#146;s duty to give biometric samples; so, as my first question, is an examining officer supposed to notify the person separately of the intended taking of samples? If he is not, why is that not referred to in the main notice of examination served on a person at the airport under the 2000 Act?</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_783"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 783</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90304-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09030480000145"></a>Following that incident, I looked up Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000, which quite properly gives the examining officer power to stop a person at a port in the border area, to question the passenger, to search him and his luggage and to detain any item of his property, while Schedule 8 provides that an &#147;authorised person&#148; may detain the passenger being examined. However, the taking of fingerprints and biometric samples is regulated by a different statute, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. It appears that the power to demand these samples does not even require that the examining officer suspects that the person has committed a criminal offence. In the case of Mr A, he was being examined not as a suspect but, as I explained, to determine whether he was a suspect. Nothing said in the course of the interview would have given the officer reason to suspect that he had committed any terrorist offence. Can the Minister confirm that the power to demand samples from a person being interviewed for this reason under the 2000 Act does not rely on any evidence that the person has committed such an offence?</p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09030480000146"></a>It appears, further, that under Section 64 of the 1984 Act as amended, fingerprints or samples may be retained after they have fulfilled the purposes for which they were taken. In the case of Mr A, the Special Branch told me that the samples were to be retained indefinitely. Although I got no elucidation of the purposes, I imagine that the idea is to build up a vast database of samples, which can be compared at later dates with biometric information obtained from crime scenes, whether terrorist or of any other kind. As of four months ago, I understand that there were 5 million samples on the National DNA Database, of which something like 850,000 related to persons either subsequently acquitted or not charged with any offence at all.</p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09030480000147"></a>On December 4 the European Court of Human Rights, in the case of S and Marper, ruled that the indefinite retention of biometric samples from innocent persons was a violation of Article 8 of the ECHR, on the right to respect for personal and family life. I wrote to the Secretary of State the following day, referring to the case of Mr A, drawing attention to the judgment and asking her to make a statement that she intended to destroy the samples of persons who were acquitted or not charged with any offence. In a reply dated 14 January, Mr Vernon Coaker, the Minister of State, said that the Government were considering the implications of the judgment and would agree with the Council of Ministers on how to implement it. For the time being, the law on the taking and retention of DNA samples and fingerprints would remain in place. I noted from an Answer that the Secretary of State gave to my honourable friend Mr Chris Huhne on January 14 that among the profiles on the database were 137,000 relating to children under 16 and that she had taken steps to have removed those that related to children who were under 10.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09030480000148"></a>The Government have now had three months to consider the S and Marper judgment and consult the European Council of Ministers. Can they give us an update on the number of profiles now held and on

Or are they continuing to collect and retain samples, and how many have been taken since the date of the judgment, 4 December? Will they now say what consultation they have had with the Council of Ministers and issue a detailed statement on the steps that they are taking to bring us back into compliance with Article 8? Have they suggested any other means of achieving this than the destruction of innocent people&#146;s samples?</p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09030480000149"></a>Everybody accepts and recognises the importance of combating terrorism, but if the Government think that it is necessary to sacrifice human rights for this purpose, we have to disagree. It is our human rights and the rule of law that we are defending against the terrorists. A society in which everyone&#146;s personal data are kept on record just in case they may commit a crime in the future is not our vision of the future of this country. I beg to move.</p>

I think that an order is coming up in the very near future, which I hope will indicate that we are about to take some suitable action.</p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09030480000151"></a>This clause relates to the fingerprinting of foreign criminals liable to automatic deportation. I want to ask the Minister, first, the reason for taking those fingerprints. I presume that it has something to do with stopping them coming back in. Secondly, how long is automatic deportation taking? We all know that a number of criminals are waiting to go. We are foxed at every turn, it seems, by the legal system. If their fingerprints have been taken and are still within our purview and control, I am not sure about the relevance of the fingerprinting to which the clause refers. Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to tell us what is going on.</p>

I learnt that there are instances when it is extremely useful to have on file the DNA records of people convicted of a criminal offence. Some detail was gone into about exactly how they were used. However, in the instance that my noble friend talked about, where an innocent person&#146;s records were taken and stored&#151;it could apply to anybody coming through immigration&#151;what provision have the Government made in the design of the database and the way that it operates for the deletion of innocent people&#146;s material. We know that it is very difficult: you have to go to the chief constable and get special agreement from him, which almost never happens. Is the database in any way designed so that deletion can take place without it being an incredibly time-consuming and expensive process? In the light of the European ruling, should not the Government be thinking about that urgently?</p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09030480000154"></a>As the noble Lord noted, my honourable friend the Minister for Policing has written to him explaining the Government&#146;s view on the case of Mr A. I believe that that reply still stands in this case. If it might be helpful to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, I would be very happy for her to see a copy of that letter, which explains the detail behind that case.</p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09030480000155"></a>As noble Lords may be aware, in the light of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights on 4 December 2008 in the case of S and Marper, we are now considering how to implement it in a way which recognises the value of fingerprints and DNA data in protecting the public. A key part of the implementation process will be to engage in a public consultation on how best to bring the judgment into effect. Progress on implementation of the judgment is subject to review by the Council of Europe&#146;s Committee of Ministers, and the Government have submitted a report for the committee&#146;s next meeting on 19 March. The judgment recognises that other jurisdictions do not apply a &#147;blanket&#148; destruction policy to biometric data of those arrested and not convicted, but indicates that there is a need for a retention policy to reflect the fact that they were not ultimately convicted.</p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09030480000156"></a>As the Home Secretary explained in her speech to the Intellect trade association on 16 December, the Government will publish a forensics White Paper later this year. Included in it will be the Government&#146;s proposed response to the S and Marper judgment. There are clauses in the Policing and Crime Bill which are intended to allow for regulations to be made which set out the detailed provisions on the retention of fingerprint and DNA data. The contents of the consultation paper and the outcome of that process will inform the content of the regulations to be submitted to Parliament. </p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09030480000157"></a>The ability for police Special Branch officers to take fingerprints and samples at ports of entry has become an increasingly important tool in countering the activities of known or suspected terrorists. We would not wish to undermine the thrust of policy in relation to the strengthening of border controls&#151;through, for example, biometric visas&#151;by weakening this specifically counterterrorism measure. It would not send the right message to those who pose a threat to the UK or reassure the public at large.</p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09030480000158"></a>In 2006, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, wrote to the then Home Secretary following a meeting with operational counterterrorism police officers. The noble Lord endorsed the use of fingerprints taken at ports, under Schedules 7 and 8 to the Terrorism Act, and considered them to be of potentially considerable value in the investigation and intelligence-gathering work of the police at ports.</p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09030480000159"></a>In the context of international travel, it is not unusual for individuals to enter or leave the United Kingdom for periods exceeding one month. It is obvious that the value of the police checking and capturing fingerprints at a port and holding them for a month in the context of a long-term visit or period of study is limited for counterterrorism purposes while the suspect  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_786"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 786</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>remains in the UK beyond one month. Furthermore, should information be received from, for example, abroad, the police&#146;s efforts to identify a suspect who may be involved in terrorism, or perhaps locate how he left and entered the country, would be undermined dramatically if fingerprints had to be removed from records.</p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09030480000160"></a>Without wishing to prejudge the outcome of the Marper consultation, our view is that restricting the retention period to the extent that the amendment proposes would severely hinder the authorities&#146; efforts to counter and investigate terrorism and the movements of suspected terrorists, and, potentially, remove a hindrance on terrorist activity provided by the examination powers in Schedules 7 and 8. However, we will of course revisit all those issues as part of our consultation.</p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09030480000161"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked about the reasons for taking fingerprints. The proposed power to take fingerprints allows us to get fingerprints and fix the identity of the individual whom we have put in prison for crimes in the UK and whom we wish to remove from the UK. Then we have a record when he tries to come back into the country. That is the reason for the specific measure in the Bill. Those individuals whom we seek to remove are those who have been sentenced to up to 12 months in prison and are eligible for automatic deportation under the UK Borders Act 2007.</p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09030480000162"></a>The amendment in Clause 48 is a very minor amendment to the UK Border Agency&#146;s existing powers. I hope that that provides an answer to why we are taking fingerprints.</p>

<a name="90304-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09030480000163"></a>On the specific amendment&#151;and bearing in mind that a consultation is ongoing&#151;I hope the noble Lord will await the Government&#146;s wider response to S and Marper, as committed to by the Home Secretary. I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

Will we at some stage be able to know who is being consulted? The people who tend to get left out of consultation are those who live in this country&#151;the inhabitants. There is always consultation with lots of organisations, but it looks as though the ordinary man in the street, who at the moment, if you tested him, would think that the whole thing of DNA and fingerprints was totally alien, may not get consulted. Will the Minister assure us that he will be?</p>

I do not necessarily share the noble Baroness&#146;s view; the average man in the street often sees DNA as rather important, particularly in a case such as the one the other day when someone was found guilty of rape and killing a girl some years ago. The matter is not as clear-cut as might be said. DNA is an extremely useful tool and I do not think that the average man in the street necessarily is against it. However, this is a highly complex area, which merits much further debate. I have been told by my Box that there will be public consultation.</p>

I believe that our system has more personal profiles on it than any other country in Europe, but that may be effective in enabling us to catch criminals.

Is there any time limit for that process in the ECHR? It was on 4 December last that the judgment was issued, and I am certain that the Council of Ministers would not be happy about an indefinite extension of the time within which the Government must comply with the judgment. They say that they are exploring this by means of a public consultation. I was not aware of that, to be quite honest, and I would be grateful if the Minister could place details of the public consultation either on the Home Office website or in the Library of your Lordships' House so that we can all engage in the discussion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09030480000171"></a>Obviously, one realises that in the first instance, when the samples are taken, you do not know whether the individual will be charged with an offence. But since the purpose of the Schedule 7 interrogation at the airport is to ascertain whether a person is a suspect or not, one would think that the information then obtained would enable the police&#151;and, in particular, special branch&#151;to determine that, and thereupon either to destroy the samples or to pass them to the prosecuting authorities, which will issue a summons for the offence in question. If neither of those things happens and, after two years, let us say, the samples have not been used to incriminate the person on any other offence that may have been committed in the mean time, by a

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09030480000173"></a>The issue is not as straightforward as one might think. The judgment was complex in some ways, and I do not think really that it would do much good for me to go into some of the detail of it now, although I have a huge page of speaking notes with all the complexities of it. We are looking at this matter, and there will be consultation. We are going back to the court about this. Clearly, we will have to recognise the judgment of the court, which we do, and implement its findings. It indicated that our blanket policy of retaining fingerprints and DNA of people who had been arrested but not convicted, or of those against whom there was no further action, was in breach of Article 8. However, then there are a lot of complexities. Clearly, we will absolutely take notice of that and not do that, but the complexities mean that we have to go into this in some detail.</p>

Will the Government produce their own amendment along these lines or, better still, set statutory time limits for detention prior to deportation or more generally? Such limits exist in several European Union states, often specifying six months or less. Can the Minister tell the Committee what use is being made of bail, tagging and reporting as alternatives to detention? Why were the automatic bail hearings, provided in 1999, abolished by the 2002 Act? The numbers involved are not large, yet the cost to taxpayers is high. It has cost &#163;96 million this year and will cost &#163;107 million next year. I am sure that your Lordships will agree that it is wrong in principle that people should be held indefinitely, often without legal advice and usually without any judicial hearing at all.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09030480000179"></a>In January the London Detainee Support Group published a useful report called <I>Detained Lives</I>. It shows that up to 3,000 people are detained under immigration powers at any one time. It studied 188 cases of individuals who were held for one year or longer in prison-like conditions. The report is particularly good on the human consequences of indefinite detention. A significant number of detainees develop mental health problems or attempt suicide or self-harm. Riots and destruction of property are other bad consequences.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09030480000180"></a>I will now quote two particular cases. The first is that of Mr Ahmed Abu Bakar Hassan, aged 24. He comes from the Massaleit ethnic group in Darfur. In Sudan he was a political activist, opposing the persecution of his people. He was forced to flee the country and arrived in Britain in October 2004. His asylum was refused. When he was told to leave his government-funded accommodation, he slept rough in parks for a while. He eventually claimed asylum again in another name, not knowing that it was a crime to do so, and hoping that he would be given somewhere to live. He served four months in prison and was then detained. He has agreed to return to Sudan, but the Sudanese embassy has refused to admit him. He has been detained for 28 months since finishing his sentence in October 2006.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09030480000181"></a>The second case is that of Mr Ali Saifi. He is aged 27 and lived in Birmingham when he arrived in this country in 2002. He received no benefits or support from the Government, since he was never advised that he may be entitled to asylum support. As an asylum seeker, he did not have the right to work. However, he worked informally on building sites for a while, but lost his job because he did not have any papers. He moved to London and ended up on the street. He stole food from a market to eat and was arrested and convicted of theft. Early in his sentence he applied for early deportation, signing to forgo his right of appeal. However, the Home Office&#151;not, perhaps, for the first time&#151;had lost his passport and the Algerian embassy refused to give him a travel document. He has been detained for 22 months since April 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09030480000182"></a>The men in the two cases quoted were de facto stateless, but according to the Home Office there were only 25 stateless people held at a recent date. Statelessness is therefore not the main cause of detention. I conclude by asking if the Government are studying the report that I mentioned, and whether they will respond to its recommendations at least by Written Statement. Will they take full account of the criticisms by the Council of Europe&#146;s Commissioner for Human Rights? In April 2008 he urged the Government drastically to limit administrative detention of migrants, and to introduce a maximum time limit. Will the Government also examine methods used in Sweden and Australia to achieve high rates of voluntary return for unsuccessful asylum applicants? The issue of detention has come up regularly over the last 20 years, and its improvement is long overdue. I look forward to the Government&#146;s response.</p>

When the UK Borders Act 2007 went through your Lordships&#146; House there was great discussion, in which I took part, about why Scotland was not included in the provision that enabled a designated immigration officer to arrest somebody whom they suspected. We were told that it was quite unnecessary because the police would always be present at a port in Scotland. I remember arguing that this was not the case and that the Scottish border would leak like a sieve. Can the Minister tell the Committee why the Government have changed their mind on this matter? I think it is excellent that they have done so, but I wonder what their reason is. I am sorry that I did not give the noble Lord notice of my query, but as the clause is being considered, I wonder if I might ask.</p>

The Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 set up a new system of tribunals, but the transfer of immigration and nationality judicial reviews was excluded. What was the purpose of, and reason for, that? The noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, told us in Grand Committee that judicial reviews in immigration cases were particularly sensitive, as indeed they are. They engage absolute rights against torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, and involve complex issues under the Human Rights Act. The noble Baroness also said that there was no question of removing the statutory bar on the transfer of judicial reviews at that time because it would be necessary to review how the transfer to the Upper Tribunal of all the other tribunals had worked in other less sensitive cases.</p>

She said it would be invidious for there not to be a judge of that rank dealing with it. Your Lordships will recall at Second Reading that the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, was inclined to support this clause, not for any reason other than the pressure on the judiciary in the administrative court by the number of judicial reviews that are brought in immigration cases. However, after arguments in all directions, eventually a compromise was struck in which the Government accepted that, if they sought to remove the exclusion of these types of cases, it would be only by way of primary legislation, which is no doubt why this clause appears in the current Bill.</p>

That was the position only some 18 months ago. The Upper Tribunal commenced its work in November 2008, only two or three months ago, but the consultation on the inclusion of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in the two-tier tribunal service was started in August of 2008, before the Upper Tribunal ever came into existence. It was a Home Office-led consultation. The working group included representatives of the judiciary and the Home Office, but no other body was involved in that working group.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09030489000004"></a>The consultation set out two primary aims, which are interesting. The first was to reduce the immigration workload of the High Court and the Court of Appeal judiciary. The second was to assist the Home Office in its immigration work, particularly in relation to the speed with which asylum claims are dealt. Relieving the load on the one hand was of interest to the judiciary and getting immigration business through was of interest to the Home Office. All the previous assurances that this House received that it would not happen until the Upper Tribunal was up and running and we were able to assess how it worked fell by the board.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09030489000005"></a>As was recognised when we were discussing the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill, immigration judicial reviews may be especially contentious because of the failure by the Home Office as a litigant&#151;as a party&#151;to show proper respect for the procedure in the court and for the rule of law. Your Lordships will be aware that the Home Office has been taken to task by the courts on many occasions.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09030489000006"></a>The risk now in allowing the transfer of these judicial reviews without any opportunity to assess the capacity and the competency of the Upper Tribunal to deal with them is threefold. First, there is an immediate risk of injustice to the individual litigant in relation to his fundamental rights, including rights to liberty, life and so forth. That was not one of the aims of the Home Office-led consultation I outlined. Secondly, there is a risk that inadequate handling of these judicial reviews by an untested tribunal will result in an increase in the workload of the supervising court&#151;the Court of Appeal. If judicial reviews go to the Upper Tribunal, which has only just started, that will result in a greater workload for the Court of Appeal. Thirdly, there is the risk of reduced supervision of the Home Office resulting in it taking greater liberties, leading to more instances of injustice and increased litigation.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09030489000007"></a>The introduction of Clause 50 to this Bill is completely premature and contrary to the assurances given to this House when we were discussing the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill only a very short time ago. That is why this clause should not stand part of the Bill. I now move to the particular amendments which raise other important issues in any event. We will press these amendments if your Lordships agree this clause.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09030489000008"></a>Amendment 111BA deals with nationality decisions. Immigration issues are concerned with administrative decisions. The granting of certain rights to people who come to this country is an administrative decision taken by government officials. Nationality issues, on the other hand, are concerned with status. They are concerned with the declaration of whether an individual  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_793"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 793</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is or is not a British citizen. Immigration issues and nationality issues are two completely different things. Under the present proposals in Clause 50, both immigration and nationality claims are to be transferred. The judicial reviews of administrative systems are presently heard in the administrative court of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court by High Court judges. The judicial review in that context is frequent and there is a great deal of expertise in the administrative court in that regard. But nationality judicial reviews are very few. In 2007, only three cases concerning nationality law were heard in the High Court and in the Court of Appeal that led to final judgment after a substantive hearing. In 2008 there were just two.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09030489000009"></a>Unlike immigration claims, some nationality law claims can also be brought in private law proceedings as well as by public law claims for judicial review. Nationality law claims concern challenges to the refusal to register or naturalise a person as a British national of a particular description. Those are public law claims. Nationality law claims can also be an issue for declarations about whether a person has automatically acquired a form of British nationality at birth, for example. It is a completely different sort of animal from the immigration judicial reviews that are part of the subject of Clause 50. We would like to probe why the two types of issues are lumped together in Clause 50. I look forward to hearing the noble Lord on that topic.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09030489000010"></a>The other issue raised is that of Scottish claims. The Scottish Court of Session would be allowed to retain the jurisdiction to hear asylum and immigration appeals under the terms of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, at least until full and proper consideration is given to removing that jurisdiction. The clause transfers asylum and immigration appeals from the Court of Session to the Upper Tribunal. The clause proceeds on the basis of the publication <I>Consultation: Immigration Appeals. Fair Decisions, Faster Justice</I>. However, there has been no separate consideration of the Scottish issues in the consultation, when the issues are very different. The proposal in Clause 50 relating to Scotland pre-empts the civil justice review currently being conducted by Lord Gill, although the Minister, Vera Baird MP, told the Public Bill Committee when the 2007 Act was being debated, that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030489000202"></a>&#147;we concluded that the judicially led review of the Scottish civil courts announced by the Minister for Justice in the Scottish Executive in March 2006 would be best placed to consider the detail of possible application for second appeals in Scotland&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill Committee, 20/6/07; col. 36.]</ul>
<p><a name="09030489000187"></a>It also pre-empts the Scottish Administrative Justice Steering Group&#146;s final report. The group&#146;s first report left open the question of whether proposals made in the consultation paper are a preferable option.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09030489000011"></a>There is no obvious demand in Scotland for transfer from the Court of Session to the Upper Tribunal. In June 2008, in its submission to the civil justice review, the border agency suggested this proposal as one of a range of possibilities. However, it did not receive a great deal of favour. Thus, for separate reasons, the Law Society of Scotland, which put forward this amendment, says that the clause is premature. I beg to move.</p>

I am puzzled by the fact that the clause is being promoted by the Home Office. The Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, to which it relates, was promoted by a department that is now part of the Department of Justice. The Home Office is a party to all immigration and asylum proceedings and therefore, for reasons that do not need elucidating, should not be, or even be perceived to be, an advocate for one form of procedure over another.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09030489000013"></a>The Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act allows for the transfer of certain judicial review applications from the High Court to the Upper Tribunal. However, as we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, primary legislation is necessary before immigration and asylum matters can be so transferred. Noble Lords may recall that this was a concession made to your Lordships by the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, in the course of the proceedings on the Bill. The reason is clear; it is principally because disputes in that area raise issues such as the right to liberty, and the right not to be put in danger of torture, cruel and unusual punishment or capital punishment, which are distinct from those rights that are dealt with under the new integrated tribunal regime.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09030489000014"></a>When the 2007 Act became law, the Government were not confident that the transfer of applications for judicial review in this area to the Upper Tribunal was appropriate. The noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, stated in your Lordships&#146; House that she wanted to see how the new regime worked before making changes. The new Upper Tribunal, as we have also heard from the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, began its work as recently as November 2008, leaving hardly enough time to come to a mature conclusion about its appropriateness as a vehicle for judicial review cases in immigration and asylum matters. Moreover, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, has also pointed out, in August 2008 the Home Office launched a consultation on the merits of moving immigration and asylum matters to the new integrated institutions. The response to this consultation may be complete, but it has not yet been published. I find astonishing the timing of the consultation. What was the point of initiating it at a time when no one could possibly have had any experience of how the Upper Tribunal would fare? There was no evidence to submit to it, and upon which to opine. I regard Clause 50 as a straightforward breach of faith with your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09030489000015"></a>I suspect that pressure for premature change is being generated mainly by members of the administrative court. It is no exaggeration to say that High Court judges, there, are inundated by applications to judicially review immigration and asylum decisions. Statistics suggest that 70 per cent of that court&#146;s resources are absorbed by such matters. However, the only consequence of passing these matters to the Upper Tribunal would be to create a similar problem there.</p>

This in turn is a function of two features. The first is the structure of the immigration and asylum tribunal system, following the move by the then Home Secretary, the right honourable gentleman David Blunkett, to change from a two-tier to a single-tier system. As was widely predicted, this has proved a disaster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09030489000017"></a>The second feature is that the procedure of the tribunals is determined not, as one might expect, by a tribunal service responsible to the Department of Justice, but by the Home Office. As I have stated, the Home Office is invariably a party to a dispute. So unsatisfactory are these procedures that it is often impossible for an appellant to know what the case against him is. The procedures also often lead to lengthy delays, so that many applications for judicial review are made, for example, in the field of deportation orders, on the grounds that circumstances have changed since the initial decision to deport was handed down.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09030489000018"></a>The Home Office has indicated that the Government intend to publish a draft immigration simplification Bill in the autumn. If that is so, it would provide us with an opportunity to address the issues that underlie the explosion of judicial review applications. Until those questions are addressed and answered, there is little point in proceeding to the measure outlined by Clause 50.</p>

<a name="09030489000019"></a><b><a name="90304-0010.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09030489000232"></a>Lord Lloyd of Berwick:</b> I, too, was surprised to find Clause 50 tucked away in the Bill so soon after the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill received Royal Assent in 2007. A key feature of the Act was that asylum and immigration cases were excluded from the operation of Section 19, so that High Court judges sitting in the administrative court are not obliged to transfer such cases to the Upper Tribunal, and indeed are prohibited from doing so. The purpose of Clause 50, as has been pointed out by both noble Lords who have spoken, is to remove that prohibition. So there are two related questions for the Minister. First, why were asylum cases excluded from the operation of Section 19 as recently as 2007? Secondly, why is he seeking now to reverse that exclusion?</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09030489000020"></a>The answer to the first question is relatively easy and has already been given by both noble Lords who have spoken. Asylum cases have always given rise to sensitive issues, and they often give rise to difficult questions of fact and law, some of which end up in the House of Lords, as I know from my personal experience. As the late Lord Bridge said of one such case, R v the Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex parte Bugdaycay, decisions in asylum cases may, and sometimes do, put the applicant&#146;s very life at risk. They therefore call, as Lord Bridge pointed out, for the most anxious scrutiny. That must be right, and is one good reason why such cases should be dealt with by judges of the standing of High Court judges in the administrative court.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09030489000021"></a>However, there is a second reason. The current workload of the AIT is very heavy. It may have been thought that the judges of the new Upper Tribunal should gain experience in other, less sensitive and less pressurised, areas before being swamped with asylum and immigration cases. It is not only the difficulty of such cases, but their number, which is of concern.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09030489000022"></a>A third possible reason for excluding immigration cases in 2007 is that immigration law and practice seem to be in a constant state of flux. We are at this moment anxiously awaiting the so-called simplification Bill that the Minister has promised for this Session. It may have been thought that it would be more sensible to keep immigration cases where they are, at least until the law has settled down a bit. Indeed, I think that I am right in saying that there is an important immigration case currently being heard in the House of Lords at this moment, but I may be wrong about that.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09030489000023"></a>Each of those three reasons is a good reason&#151;there may be others&#151;why immigration cases were left out of Section 19 when the 2007 Act was given Royal Assent. I suggest that they are still good reasons why we should not act too quickly now.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09030489000024"></a>That brings me to the second question that I hope the Minister will answer: why are we changing direction now, so soon after the 2007 Act was passed? Why are we having second thoughts when we have as yet, as has been pointed out, so little experience of how the Upper Tribunal is working? It has only been in operation for three or four months.</p>

<a name="90304-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09030489000025"></a>The answer can only be the enormous pressure under which the administrative court is currently operating. There can be no other explanation. It is important to draw a distinction between the ordinary work of the AIT and applications for judicial review. I see no reason why the ordinary work of the AIT should not be transferred to the First-tier and Upper Tribunals as soon as the judges have sufficient experience. That would be the logic behind the 2007 Act, and I hope that we will follow it through. I also hope that such cases will, when transferred, be dealt with in a separate chamber, of which the president should be a High Court judge.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90304-0011.htm"/>


<a name="90304-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09030489000026"></a>However, applications for judicial review in such cases stand on an entirely different footing. These are the sensitive cases that raise the difficult questions of fact and law, and should be dealt with by judges of the status as a High Court judge. It is for that reason that it is so important that the applications for judicial review in asylum cases should continue to start in the administrative court as they always have. However, the problem, as has been pointed out, is that there are just too many of them. Applications for judicial review are currently running at a rate of about 4,000 a year. What is needed is some way of sifting out those cases that must be dealt with by High Court judges in the administrative court as they always have been, and as, I think, everybody agreed that they should be, from those cases that could be transferred by the administrative court to the Upper Tribunal. If the Minister could find a way of doing that, then he should by all means let us have a look at it. However, as I said on Second Reading, it is to my mind essential that we should know from him what exactly is proposed before we are asked to agree to Clause 50.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09030489000027"></a>Lastly, I have spoken of the high status of High Court judges. The High Court judge is the key figure in the whole judicial hierarchy. The quality of the present High Court judges is very high indeed, and it is vital that that quality should be maintained. There is at least a risk that we will not get enough High

That may be a question for the Lord Chancellor rather than the Home Secretary, but I thought it worth making that point in this context.</p>

<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="09030489000028"></a><b><a name="90304-0011.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09030489000233"></a>Lord Cameron of Lochbroom:</b> I speak only to Amendment 111DA, which affects the Court of Session. Section 20 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 provided for the transfer of judicial review applications from that court to the Upper Tribunal subject to four conditions.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09030489000029"></a>Under the Act, transfer was statutorily barred in two cases. The first is if the subject matter of an application to the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court of Session was a devolved Scottish matter. As the Minister has already pointed out, immigration is not a devolved matter. The second statutory bar related to judicial review applications relating to immigration or nationality decisions. This was constituted by Section 20(5) of the 2007 Act as condition 4. Clause 50(3) would remove that bar.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09030489000030"></a>It is important to have in mind how Section 20 operates. It contemplated two situations: first, where there was mandatory transfer, the court must transfer an application to its supervisory jurisdiction if certain conditions are fulfilled; and secondly, where transfer could be made at the discretion of the judge of the Court of Session hearing the application. In either case, transfer could only take place if the application did not seek anything other than an exercise of the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court of Session. That was condition 1.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09030489000031"></a>Condition 2 made provision for the Court of Session to specify classes of case apt for transfer by passing an Act of Sederunt made with the consent of the Lord Chancellor, an Act of Sederunt being the instrument by which the Court of Session exercises its statutory power to regulate its jurisdiction and procedures. Thus, unless and until the Court of Session exercised its power to determine which, if any, specific class of applications to its supervisory jurisdiction is to be transferred to the Upper Tribunal, and the Lord Chancellor consents, there can be no mandatory transfer to the Upper Tribunal of any class of applications.</p>
<a name="time_20"></a>
<a name="90304-0011.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="09030489000211"></a>7.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09030489000032"></a>In the absence of any act of sederunt, there remains a discretion in a particular case for the judge hearing the application to determine that the application be transferred to the Upper Tribunal, even though the Court of Session has not specified the class of case into which the application falls as being one for mandatory transfer. That discretion would extend to immigration and nationality appeals, with the removal of the statutory bar created by condition 4. At Second Reading, the Minister referred to the judiciary&#146;s responses to the consultation paper <I>Fair Decision, Faster Justice</I>, which has already been mentioned. Can the Minister confirm that in their response to the paper, the judges of the Court of Session indicated that they were not able to express firm views on the proposal to amend Section 20 until Lord Gill, the Lord Justice Clerk, had reported on his review of the civil courts in Scotland? In  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_798"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 798</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>paragraph 39 of its consultation paper, the UK Border Agency acknowledged that the process for judicial review in Scotland was,</p>
<ul><a name="09030489000203"></a>&#147;currently subject to any changes that may or may not be introduced following the review ... currently being undertaken under the chairmanship of Lord Gill&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90304-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09030489000204"></a>Lord Gill has not yet reported. It might be thought premature at this stage to remove the statutory bars so far as they affect the Court of Session, pending publication of that report. This factor is fortified by a further consideration, which has already been mentioned&#151;as I understand it, further primary legislation would be required to enable the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal to be replaced by the two-tier system which has been established by the 2007 Act. Perhaps the Minister would confirm that this is the case.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09030489000033"></a>As a footnote to that observation, I draw attention to the provision in Section 21(3) of the 2007 Act. This section gives the Upper Tribunal the function of deciding applications transferred to it by the Court of Session under Section 20. Subsection (3) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a><a name="09030489000196"></a>&#147;In deciding an application by virtue of subsection (1), the Upper Tribunal must apply principles that the Court of Session would apply in deciding an application to the supervisory jurisdiction of that Court&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030489000034"></a>Can the Minister provide any assurance to the Committee as to how that provision is to be secured? At first blush it would suggest that the judge presiding at the hearing of the application should be a judge of the Court of Session. I refer in passing to the provisions of the 2007 Act, including Section 18(8), which contemplate a judge of the Court of Session being a member of the Upper Tribunal.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09030489000035"></a>A question may arise whether there is likely to be any saving of time or expense in the transfer of applications to the Upper Tribunal from the Court of Session. That is not a question, I suggest, which can be answered until Lord Gill has reported. Indeed, in the consultation paper the agency stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a><a name="09030489000197"></a>&#147;The Upper Tribunal would need to be well-established before any such a provision on transferring judicial review applications would be commenced and any transfers could be made. First, it would be important to ensure the Upper Tier had the capacity to deal with the additional workload quickly and efficiently. It would also be necessary to consider the best use of judicial time, the desirability of allocating cases to the appropriate level of judiciary, and the impact on judicial resources within the higher courts and the Upper Tribunal&#148;.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09030489000036"></a>While I remain open to the view that perhaps at this stage the Court of Session could make sure that there was no mandatory transfer of applications, and using its discretion judges would have to be persuaded that any application should be transferred, I suggest the better course at the moment is to defer consideration of the type of matters under review in Clause 50.</p>

<p><a name="st_164"></a>

The reason is that a very large proportion of the immigration cases that are heard currently in the High Court raise issues of no great difficulty, based on the particular facts and circumstances of the individual applicant. For that reason, many of these cases at present are heard in the High Court not by High Court judges but by deputy High Court judges&#151;circuit judges sitting as High Court judges, a reflection  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_799"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 799</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the lack of complexity of these cases. Yet these cases do constitute a very substantial proportion of the workload of the High Court, taking up a very large proportion of the resources of the court. I can see good reason why many of these cases should be heard by the Upper Tribunal, especially as there will be a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal&#151;if permission is granted&#151;on any point of law.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09030489000038"></a>However, I have two concerns about Clause 50. First, is it really the Government&#146;s intention to transfer all immigration judicial reviews to the Upper Tribunal? Do the Government recognise and accept that although many of these cases could be heard in the Upper Tribunal, there are undoubtedly some judicial reviews in this context which by reason of the complexity of the case, or by reason of the significance of the issues either generally or for the individual applicant, should indeed be heard by a High Court judge? If that is right, surely it is open to the Minister to think again about this matter and to come back to the Committee with a power that is more appropriately circumscribed.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09030489000039"></a>My second concern has already been expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. I simply do not understand why nationality cases should be sent to the tribunal. These cases always, in my experience, involve complex issues of law and there are very few of them.</p>

We have had a very useful discussion and very useful input. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asked why this clause is being promoted by the Home Office. This is a Government Bill on which the Home Office is leading. We have worked very closely with the Ministry of Justice on Clause 50. It fully supports and is pushing this, as are quite a large number of judges. As always when it comes to issues like this I feel rather like Daniel in the lion&#146;s den, surrounded by some many experts in this field.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09030489000043"></a>Amendment 111BA retains the general effect of the clause, allowing immigration judicial reviews to be dealt with in the Upper Tribunal. However, this amendment would remove the power of the relevant senior judiciary to direct that cases relating to nationality decisions must be transferred. It has been suggested that as some nationality claims may be brought before the High Court in private law proceedings, judicial review cases should also remain before the High Court.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09030489000044"></a>Clause 50 allows the judiciary to ensure that public law judicial review cases are handled in the most efficient way, including transferring them into the Upper Tribunal if that is appropriate; not necessarily to do it, but if it is appropriate. It is true that Clause 50 does not address the issue of private law cases being  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_800"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 800</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>brought before the High Court. The fact that it is possible to bring a private law case before the High Court does not justify restricting the ability of our most senior judiciary to decide how public law cases should be heard.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09030489000045"></a>Nationality decisions do not currently attract a right of appeal, except a decision to deprive a person of British citizenship, which has rarely been used to date. This means that senior immigration judges, who would become judges of the Upper Tribunal under the unified system, do not currently have the same level of expertise in handling nationality cases as they do in immigration and asylum cases.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09030489000046"></a>It is worth being clear, however, that the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 specifies that judicial review applications in the Upper Tribunal can be heard by judges of the High Court, Court of Appeal or Court of Session, and indeed these are the only judges with an automatic right to hear the applications by virtue of that Act. Other judges, including senior immigration judges, can hear applications only where the relevant Lord Chief Justice or Lord President has agreed for them to do this with the Senior President of Tribunals, who is already required to consider the need for judges to be experts in the subject matter or law relating the types of cases that they hear.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09030489000047"></a>We believe that the decision as to whether particular judges outside those specified in the TCE Act are suitable to hear applications should rest with the relevant Lord Chief Justices and Lord President. As an example, decisions to deprive people of British citizenship carry a right of appeal. If tribunal judges hear a significant number of these appeals, the chief justices and the Senior President of Tribunals may take the view that they have acquired sufficient expertise to hear judicial review cases relating to other nationality decisions. This amendment would limit their ability to make that decision and therefore to manage cases in the best interests of justice.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09030489000048"></a>Amendment 111DA retains the full powers of the clause for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but excludes Scotland. I am aware of the concern that we should not pre-empt the ongoing reviews in Scotland and, of course, I recognise that the Scottish legal system is different from that in the rest of the United Kingdom. It is worth pointing out, however, that the power to transfer most judicial review cases into the Upper Tribunal is already in place in Scotland, and the Lord President has already made an Act of Sederunt designating a class of cases which must be transferred. All that Clause 50 does is extend existing powers to immigration and nationality cases.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09030489000049"></a>We should be clear that the powers contained in Clause 50 are permissive powers only; that is important. The Lord President is not required to designate a class of cases which must be transferred, and the judges of the Court of Session do not have to transfer specific cases if they do not believe that it is right to do so.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09030489000050"></a>If we give judges in the rest of the United Kingdom the power to transfer cases, it seems right that we should ensure that judges in Scotland have the same powers and let the Scottish judiciary decide whether to use them. The chief justices exercise their powers with the responsibility that is expected of them and fully

We should not restrict the ability of our most senior judiciary to manage judicial review cases as they see fit, and I therefore urge the Committee to resist both these amendments.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09030489000051"></a>I will now deal with the Question that Clause 50 stand part of the Bill. Clause 50 allows immigration judicial review cases to be transferred into the Upper Tribunal on a case-by-case basis. The clause also allows the Lord Chief Justice, the Lord President and the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, with the agreement of the Lord Chancellor, to specify a class of case which must be transferred into the Upper Tribunal. These powers are already available for non-immigration cases.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09030489000052"></a>This clause does not remove access to the remedy of judicial review. The Upper Tribunal has exactly the same jurisdiction in judicial review matters as the higher courts and may grant the same kinds of relief. It is important to make the context of this clause clear. We are hopeful that we will be able to transfer the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal&#151;I will refer to this using its usual abbreviation, AIT&#151;into the unified tribunals system. The unified tribunals system has been operating for other jurisdictions since November last year.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09030489000053"></a>The AIT is a single-tier appeals system, and there is a statutory right to apply to the High Court for an order for the AIT to reconsider its decision. There are clear benefits to transferring into the unified system&#151;which is a two-tier system&#151;in terms of removing the burden of those immigration reconsideration applications from the higher courts. That burden has been referred to by a number of noble Lords. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, pointed out the huge pressure that there is at the moment. There is no need for a reconsideration process in the unified tribunals system, as there is a right of appeal against a First-tier Tribunal decision to the Upper Tribunal.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09030489000054"></a>Before we can make the decision to transfer the AIT, however, we must be sure that the new system will be faster, final and respected. Officials in the UK border force and the Tribunals Service are finalising work on this at the moment, and we hope to make an announcement very shortly. Other, non-immigration judicial review cases can already be transferred into the Upper Tribunal and, if we transfer the AIT, it makes sense to remove the existing bar to transferring immigration judicial reviews.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09030489000056"></a>One of the aims of those proposals was to reduce the existing burden of immigration matters in the higher courts. As a result, we are deciding whether to transfer the AIT into the unified tribunals system. We are still working with colleagues in the Ministry of Justice to ensure that if we bring the AIT into the unified tribunals structure, it will result in a system which is faster, final and respected, delivering the benefits that were set out in the consultation paper last year. This clause forms part of that package of reforms. I am pleased to report that the senior judiciary supported this provision in their response to the consultation.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09030489000057"></a>We will not commence this provision unless and until the AIT has been transferred into the unified tribunals system, which may be done under existing powers. Although existing powers also enable certain members of the AIT to sit in the Upper Tribunal, we do not think that it makes sense for immigration judicial reviews to be considered in the Upper Tribunal unless and until the AIT is fully integrated within that system. This provision is needed to give the higher courts greater flexibility in dealing with immigration matters, and it is a significant part of the wider reform of immigration appeals currently under consideration. If it is considered right to transfer the AIT, we wish to be in a position to implement this clause to complete that package.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09030489000058"></a>Concerns were expressed on Second Reading that the Government intended to retain existing arrangements for the making of procedure rules in respect of immigration cases. I have written to noble Lords to advise that this is not the case, and that if we do transfer the AIT into the unified system, the procedure rules will be made by the Tribunal Procedure Committee in the same way as for other cases in the Upper Tribunal.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09030489000059"></a>A number of specific questions were asked. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asked about procedure rules made by the Home Office. This is incorrect. The procedure rules for the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal&#151;AIT&#151;have been made by the Lord Chancellor since at least 2002. We have indicated that if the AIT transfers, the rules will be made by the Tribunal Procedure Committee. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron, was absolutely correct in what he said about the response made by the judges of the Court of Session. However, the important point is that this is a permissive power; the judges in the Court of Session do not have to use it if they feel that it is too soon. That point was made also by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron, also asked about the primary legislation required to transfer the AIT. That is not necessary. A statutory instrument to transfer the functions is what is required, and that will be subject to affirmative resolution.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09030489000060"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, asked whether there was an intention to transfer all judicial reviews to the Upper Tribunal. The answer is no. It is a matter for the judiciary which case should be transferred. That is the point: they will be able to judge it themselves and they are the people who really understand those issues.  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_803"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 803</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is not for the Government to dictate because they are very sensitive issues and the judges are the right people to make those decisions.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09030489000061"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, also raised questions about nationality decisions. We recognise that nationality cases often raise very complex issues, but if we exclude them they will be almost the only judicial reviews that cannot be transferred. Again, we think that it is better to leave it to the judiciary to do that on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09030489000062"></a>I know that this has been a rather long-winded response but I hope that it has covered most of the points and removes the remaining reservations on the matter. As I have said, I do not regard the decisions on Clause 50 to be consequential on decisions on the amendments, but I would be grateful to noble Lords if they would withdraw their amendments.</p>

<a name="09030489000063"></a><b><a name="90304-0011.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09030489000238"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, put his finger on the problem which was created by Mr Blunkett&#146;s abolition of appeals in immigration cases and the creation of a single tier. I am sure that when he did so&#151;although I have not had the opportunity of checking <I>Hansard</I>&#151;he said that it would be a faster and more efficient way of dealing with immigration cases, which is almost exactly the language that the Minister has used in his response. He is looking for efficiency and speed. What we are looking for is justice. When you are concerned with people&#146;s lives, as all these issues are, efficiency and speed is all very well from the Home Office&#146;s point of view but it may not be the proper approach at all from the individual&#146;s point of view.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09030489000064"></a>Just as an illustration of how the problem has been created, I have been instructed while the Minister was responding that Government inaction over Zimbabwe in the last two years has led in the High Court to 150 applications for judicial review for fresh claims but 500 applications for reconsideration. It is the abolition of the second tier that used to exist that has created all the pressure on the administrative court. As the Minister has admitted, it has also caused the matter to be brought back to us prior to all the procedures that we were assured would happen and before we have the opportunity to consider how the tribunal system is going to work.</p>

<a name="90304-0011.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09030489000065"></a>I detected in the contributions of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, suggestions that we should be looking to some proper way of sifting these applications and determining which should go to the Upper Tribunal and which should be retained in the High Court. The Minister refers to a case-by-case approach but this particular clause does not refer to such an approach. The clause would permit all cases of this of type judicial review to be transferred to the Upper Tribunal without there being any sifting process as to which are more important and complex and which should be heard in the High Court.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09030489000066"></a>Perhaps a way forward is that between now and Report stage for us consider whether applications for judicial review should remain in the High Court, which is the traditional role of that court over centuries  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_804"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 804</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in supervising inferior tribunals. The judge who considers applications for judicial review should have the power to direct that the individual case could go to the Upper Tribunal. As the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, has pointed out, many of these cases are concerned with factual rather than with complex, legal issues. An expertise would no doubt develop eventually so that a proper sifting process should occur. However, that is not in the Bill now and I believe that we can put our heads together and come forward with something that is far more satisfactory and in accord with what we were discussing when the 2007 Act went through this House. For the moment, in the hope that the Minister will respond to further consultation, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I also beg to move that the Draft of Alterations to the Northern Ireland Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2002, a copy of which was laid before this House on 17 December 2008, should also be considered. I welcome this opportunity to put these proposals before the House today.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09030489000068"></a>I will deal first with the Draft of Alterations to the Northern Ireland Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2002. The Northern Ireland Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2002 was established by the Criminal Injuries Compensation (Northern Ireland) Order 2002. The Scheme, which came into force on 1 May 2002, is important in providing compensation, at taxpayers&#146; expense, to the blameless victims of crimes of violence. The scheme reflects the Government&#146;s commitment to supporting people who are the innocent  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_805"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 805</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>victims of violent crime and to ensuring that they receive some form of financial recognition of their injuries from the community by way of criminal injuries compensation.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09030489000069"></a>Compensation payments are based on a tariff of awards for criminal injuries of comparable severity. A tariff scheme sets out the amount that may be awarded for certain specified criminal injuries, covered by injury descriptors in the tariff scheme. Some 280 such injuries are listed in the tariff of awards, attracting compensation ranging from level 1 at &#163;1,000 to level 29 at &#163;280,000. In the more serious cases compensation can also be awarded for loss of earnings, loss of earning capacity and the costs of special care.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09030489000070"></a>In administering the scheme, the Compensation Agency in Northern Ireland received 4,922 claims for the period 2007-08 and paid a total of &#163;13.8 million in criminal injuries compensation. The staff of the agency have provided the people of Northern Ireland with a sterling service, often in very difficult circumstances. It is only fitting that I register the appreciation of this House for the work that they do on behalf of victims of violent crime.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09030489000071"></a>Since the 2002 scheme came into operation, and in accordance with its provisions, the Compensation Agency has, from time-to-time, had to make payments to victims for injuries not included on the original list of injury descriptions. Since 2002, some 500 separate claims of this type have been processed and payments of around &#163;4.3 million made. Noble Lords will be relieved to know that those who have suffered these injuries have had their claims met in full. However, under the terms of the tariff scheme, the claims cannot be officially closed until the new injury descriptors developed to address these injuries are formally added to the 2002 scheme.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09030489000072"></a>The 2002 order makes provision for the Secretary of State to add new injury descriptors, with corresponding levels of new awards. Such alterations to the scheme have to be approved by the affirmative resolution procedure. It is to seek that approval that I have brought this measure before the House this evening.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09030489000073"></a>The new descriptors reflect consultation and agreement between the Compensation Agency and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel for Northern Ireland. The agency has assessed the respective values in each case with regard to the current Northern Ireland rates for equivalent injuries. These descriptors can be added to the tariff by replacing the existing list of injury descriptors with a new list which includes the new descriptors and by updating the index.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09030489000074"></a>The Compensation Agency, with the agreement of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel for Northern Ireland, has recommended an additional 74 new descriptors, shown in the copy of the tariff included with the Explanatory Memorandum. That version of the tariff is identical to the augmented tariff for which approval is being sought, but it helpfully highlights those injuries which we are seeking to add to the list.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09030489000075"></a>I move on to the Northern Ireland Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2009, a draft of which was laid before this House on 28 January 2009. The Northern Ireland Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2002,  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_806"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 806</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>known as the tariff scheme, provides compensation to victims of violence in Northern Ireland who have been physically and/or mentally injured, or who are a dependant or relative of a deceased victim. The governing legislation is the Criminal Injuries Compensation (Northern Ireland) Order 2002.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09030489000076"></a>Arrangements in Northern Ireland for criminal injuries compensation have, since the 1960s, been broadly similar to those in the rest of the United Kingdom. In 1996, a tariff scheme based on fixed payments for specific injuries was introduced in Great Britain, and in 2002, after a review led by Sir Kenneth Bloomfield in Northern Ireland, a tariff-based scheme was also introduced in respect of all levels of injury. The current arrangements for criminal injuries in Northern Ireland are therefore already similar to those in Great Britain, with compensation for criminal injuries set through a tariff scheme. However, as a legacy of the past 30 years, the individual value of tariff points in the Northern Ireland 2002 scheme is different from, and generally higher than, that of the scheme in Great Britain. Aside from these differences in tariff rates, the two schemes are similar in structure and concept.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09030489000077"></a>A characteristic of criminal injuries compensation in Northern Ireland has always been the comparatively high take-up rates and higher levels of compensation. Expenditure on tariff payments in Northern Ireland in 2006-07 was running at a rate almost three times that of Great Britain per capita. There remains a greater propensity to apply for compensation in Northern Ireland, even though rates of violent crime per head of population in Northern Ireland are now lower than those of England and Wales.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09030489000078"></a>I move on to the reason for change. In November 2007, the Government announced a review of criminal injuries arrangements as part of their agenda for normalising life in Northern Ireland. On 6 March 2008, we announced the publication of a consultation document proposing a new scheme under the Criminal Injuries Compensation (Northern Ireland) Order 2002. The scheme does not require primary legislation but, given that this issue will be the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Assembly when policing and justice powers are devolved, we wanted to ensure that a 60-day consultation exercise was conducted to take account of the views of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09030489000079"></a>The proposed 2009 tariff scheme brings Northern Ireland&#146;s scheme closer to the Great Britain criminal injuries compensation scheme of 2008. It removes a number of anomalies which we are convinced are no longer justifiable. For example, how can we pay different amounts of criminal injury compensation in different parts of the United Kingdom for the same injury? In addition, why should someone who suffers an injury in Belfast receive more compensation than someone with the same injury in Bristol or Brixton?</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09030489000080"></a>We propose this change at a time in Northern Ireland when the security and political situations have significantly improved and the need for special measures has, in the main, ended. The proposed scheme is not a precise copy of the Great Britain scheme and limited differences have been retained, but the introduction of a new criminal injuries scheme will bring about a greater uniformity of entitlement to criminal injuries  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_807"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 807</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>compensation across the United Kingdom. However, a small number of differences between the two schemes remain. The new Northern Ireland scheme retains the position of setting no cap on compensation that can be paid in any one case. In contrast, the GB scheme sets a cap of &#163;500,000 on the maximum payment paid under the tariff for loss of earnings and special expenses.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09030489000081"></a>Another difference is in the area of multiple injuries. Arrangements in Northern Ireland currently take greater account of the overall effect of multiple injuries than those in Great Britain. In both schemes, awards are made on the basis of adding the tariff value of the first injury, 30 per cent of the tariff for the second and 15 per cent for the third injury when calculating an award. In Great Britain, payments for subsequent injuries are not made, whereas in Northern Ireland there will be a payment of 10 per cent of the tariff rate for each further injury.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09030489000082"></a>We are also retaining the use of trusts for minor applicants. In Northern Ireland, when an application is from a minor, under the age of 18, the award is held in trust until the applicant becomes 18 years old. No equivalent provision exists in Great Britain. This arrangement ensures that payments made before an applicant turns 18 are safeguarded from misuse either by the claimant or by any other family member.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09030489000083"></a>The new scheme does not completely replicate the descriptors in the Great Britain scheme; there is one difference. The 2009 scheme does not include a descriptor for temporary mental anxiety, which in Great Britain allows for one-off payments of &#163;1,000 for mental anxiety lasting more than six weeks. Previous experience in Great Britain regarding this particular injury has been mixed, and the Northern Ireland priority has been to focus resources on the more serious injuries.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09030489000084"></a>In Great Britain, under the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, the Criminal Injuries Appeal Panel ceased to exist and appeals are now made to the First-tier Tribunal. The relevant legislation covering criminal injury compensation in Northern Ireland remains the Criminal Injuries Compensation (Northern Ireland) Order 2002 and existing arrangements for making appeals through the appeals panel remain unchanged under the proposed scheme.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09030489000085"></a>The Northern Ireland Office consultation on the proposed Northern Ireland Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2009 was launched on 6 March and concluded on 4 June 2008. The responses to the consultation are summarised on the Northern Ireland Office website. There were a total of 11 responses, which, on a general level, provided a range of views from those who agreed that compensation levels should be the same throughout the UK to those who took the opposite view and argued against any reduction in criminal injury compensation levels in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09030489000086"></a>All the issues raised by respondents had been previously raised and considered as part of the development of the proposed policy change. Having considered all the responses from the consultation exercise, no amendments were made to the proposed scheme.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09030489000087"></a>I am pleased to bring forward these proposals. The Government consider all the award levels and additions to the 2002 scheme to be appropriate. The measure is limited and modest, but welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09030489000088"></a>Separately, a new criminal injuries compensation scheme is an opportunity to bring the Northern Ireland scheme into closer alignment with the Great Britain scheme and so to bring about a greater uniformity of entitlement to criminal injuries compensation across the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09030489000089"></a>As Northern Ireland moves closer to an ever more politically stable society, improvements in security and politics continue to evolve to produce a place where special arrangements for compensation for criminal injuries are no longer needed. This new scheme is a significant advance towards that place.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09030489000090"></a>I commend the Draft of Alterations to the Northern Ireland Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2002 and the draft Northern Ireland Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2009 to the House.</p>

I also thank her for making her officials available at short notice this afternoon to brief me and my team. We found that very useful.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09030489000092"></a>I can say at the outset that it is not our intention from these Benches to oppose these orders. Indeed, in so far as they can be said to represent a normalisation of the position in Northern Ireland, we wholeheartedly support them.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09030489000093"></a>Perhaps I may deal with the criminal injuries compensation scheme. I accept that the amendments to the 2002 order are necessary as a housekeeping exercise. I welcome the convergence that the 2009 order helps to bring about between the Northern Ireland scheme and that operating in the rest of the United Kingdom. This is a very positive step in the transformation of the Province into a post-conflict society. It is our belief that the sooner this happens the better, not least for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09030489000094"></a>There is just one point in the Minister&#146;s explanation on which I should like clarification. I hope that I did not miss it. Will she explain why there is no upper limit in the Northern Ireland scheme when there is one for the rest of Great Britain? I certainly take her point about the greater propensity in Northern Ireland for claiming compensation, despite the rate of violent crime being proportionately lower than in England and Wales. Will the noble Baroness share her opinion on whether the changes made by the order can be expected to have an influence on bringing the rate of claims in Northern Ireland more into line with the rate of claims made in the rest of the United Kingdom? With those two reservations, I very much support the order.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09030489000097"></a>Referring to the alteration to the criminal injuries scheme initially laid down in 2002, it is both important and timely that when previously undetected injuries are sustained our legislative provisions are able to provide just as adequately as they do for more conventional offences. Acknowledging that until now compensation has been available in the event of a victim sustaining a criminal injury that was not included in the 2002 tariff, it is important that our system for administering such a scheme is able fully to process an individual application. As this alteration will allow just that, I offer it my full support.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09030489000098"></a>Turning to the Northern Ireland Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2009, which not only amends the rates of compensation available across the injuries outlined in the original tariff but includes the additional 121 injuries that would be provided for if the scheme is amended by the aforementioned alterations, I shall make the following observation. Without anticipating any opposition in your Lordships&#146; House, may I say that the tenor of some of the responses received to the consultation missed the point? While criminal injuries compensation and the tariffs generally are higher in Northern Ireland than those in place for the English and Welsh schemes for reasons of historical legacy, it is not appropriate to argue that such a disparity should be maintained. Although all noble Lords have been advised through the briefing papers that victims of violent crime in Northern Ireland are three times more likely to apply for criminal injury compensation, the scheme should not be approached from the belief that either compensation satisfactorily deals with the pain and suffering caused by a criminal injury or that compensation is what victims expect. It simply ameliorates the unnecessary and unwarranted effects they have suffered. Therefore, an effective reduction in line with the scheme that exists in England should not be feared. I support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09030489000100"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, asked about the upper limit in Northern Ireland, to which I shall respond swiftly. He wondered whether the changes might contribute to the rate of claims made in Northern Ireland being lower and more in parallel with claims made in the United Kingdom. I can only suppose that that is a possibility. It will be monitored and it will be interesting to see what the rate of claims is in future. Of course, we strongly believe that all those who suffer injury should and must claim. It is their right to do so. I am also grateful to the noble Baroness for her support.</p>

<a name="90304-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09030489000103"></a>This amendment arises from concerns about an increase in attacks on community halls in 2007. This increase ran against the trend of a low and reducing number of such attacks in previous years. The increase in criminal attacks on community halls has highlighted both their general vulnerability and the difficulty that they may have in meeting the current criteria for eligibility for statutory compensation under the 1977 order. Their location and relative isolation has often affected claims for criminal damage compensation, where the PSNI has experienced difficulty in obtaining evidence on whether the damage was caused by either three or more people, or to certify that damage was the result of terrorist or paramilitary activity.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09030489000104"></a>The aim of the draft order is to create an additional route to compensation for community halls. There is no readily available definition of what constitutes a community hall, so it is proposed that buildings which are exempt from rates under Article 41(2)(e) or Article 41A of the Rates (Northern Ireland) Order 1977 should be eligible for statutory compensation.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09030489000105"></a>Article 41(2)(e) and Article 41A cover all properties that have been granted rates exemption on the basis that the rates authorities are satisfied that their use, or availability for use, is for charitable purposes as set out in the Recreational Charities Act (Northern Ireland) 1958. The 1958 Act defines as charitable the provision, or assisting in the provision, of facilities for recreation or other leisure-time occupation, if the facilities are provided in the interests of social welfare. I understand that a very wide range of facilities will benefit from the order. By way of illustration, it will cover facilities as diverse as the Ardoyne Youth Club in Belfast, the Loup Women&#146;s Group in County Londonderry, the Indian Community Centre in north Belfast and Ballinderry Road Orange Hall in Lisburn.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09030489000106"></a>The Northern Ireland Office consulted widely on these proposals and also referred them to the Northern Ireland Assembly. Ministers also met the Orange Order, the Gaelic Athletic Association and the insurance industry in considering how to frame this proposal. Broadly, the draft legislation was welcomed by all respondents. The majority of responses&#151;14 out of 21&#151;called for a sunset clause to be removed. The SDLP expressed concerns that coverage was not wide enough, thought the measure had not been adequately equality-proofed and suggested that any approach should focus on the nature of the attack, not the status of the building. The Gaelic Athletic Association also called for the draft legislation to be amended to include the GAA and other sporting, cultural and heritage organisations. The Government noted the concerns that including a sunset clause might in some way limit the effectiveness of this legislation and, after careful consideration, removed the sunset clause from the draft order.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09030489000107"></a>An equality screening exercise on this proposal was carried out. It determined that there might be a higher uptake by the Protestant or unionist communities and men, reflecting the greater number of community halls owned by the Protestant or unionist communities and the fact that some of these properties have been specifically targeted for attacks. By linking with rates legislation relating to charitable usage, the Government are seeking to focus on the disadvantage that arises to users of community halls, not just those who own them. The proposed additional criterion applies equally to all claimants that will fall within the definition of community halls, regardless of their membership of Section 75 groups.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09030489000108"></a>The Government have concluded that the Northern Ireland Office has met its statutory obligations under Section 75 and that further assessment of the policy&#146;s impact on the promotion of equality of opportunity is not required. In reaching this conclusion the Government have taken careful account of the screening exercise that was carried out, the purpose of the proposed legislation, which has the same policy intent that underlies the current rating legislation on which it  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_812"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 812</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relies for its definition of community hall, and further analysis of community halls that are currently exempt from rates under Articles 41(2)(e) and 41A of the rating legislation.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09030489000109"></a>The calls for the provisions to be extended to include sporting, cultural and heritage support organisations would widen the scope of the legislation far beyond its intention of being a focused measure. That would have far-reaching and indeterminate implications for criminal damage budgets, as it would move the Government into the position of being virtually the insurer of first resort and seriously distort the commercial insurance market. It would also take scarce resources from other priority areas.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09030489000110"></a>It is clear that the GAA and other cultural and heritage organisations provide valuable services and facilities to local communities, and I acknowledge that they have on occasion been subject to criminal attacks. However, where a GAA hall, or any hall, is exempt from rates under Article 41(2)(e) of the Rates (Northern Ireland) Order 1977 it will be eligible to claim compensation under this proposal. The Government&#146;s conclusion is that the legislation should not be broadened to include properties that do not meet the proposed criterion.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09030489000111"></a>The Government have looked carefully at the SDLP&#146;s suggestion that access to compensation should focus on the nature of the attack, not the status of the building. However, this would require a fundamental change in the Government&#146;s approach and would offer a less certain mechanism by which to determine eligibility for compensation. The Government do not think this suggestion sufficiently addresses the practical difficulties in obtaining the necessary evidence regarding intent. On balance, the Government&#146;s approach provides a surer approach to sustaining community infrastructure when it comes under criminal attack.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09030489000112"></a>The Northern Ireland Assembly&#146;s ad hoc committee made recommendations on the sunset provisions, equality-proofing and publicising the new arrangements. I have already spoken about the sunset clause and equality impact assessment. In relation to publicising the new arrangements, the Government propose that the commencement of this legislation is publicised by means of a press campaign. Furthermore, the Compensation Agency will amend its forms and processes so that the rates exemption status of future claimants will be readily identified.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09030489000113"></a>Future costs will depend on the scale of attacks on community halls. However, based on historic levels of claims received and acceptance rates, the Government estimate that up to an additional &#163;300,000 per year will be paid in criminal damage compensation relating to attacks on community halls.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="09030489000114"></a>The Government&#146;s intention is to provide an additional route to statutory criminal damage compensation to assist all eligible community halls where they are subject to criminal damage. This order will provide support and assurance to community halls, facilities that play a vital but often underappreciated role in maintaining and sustaining the social infrastructure in the areas they serve. I am pleased to bring forward these proposals. I consider the additional criterion to be timely, proportionate and welcome, and I commend the draft to the House.</p>

As she said, it relates to a tightly defined category of community halls, which I understand includes not only halls used by one of the two main communities in Northern Ireland, but facilities used by youth groups and ethnic minorities. The Lord President gave us examples. This order provides an easier route for them to receive compensation in the event of criminal damage. We on these Benches are content that this list is narrowly defined. I agree with the Lord President that the Government should be providing assistance to isolated community halls with limited resources, which have little other recourse in the event of suffering criminal damage. I was given examples of community halls that were burned at night, when it is obviously quite impossible to know how many people took part in the crime. We also accept that it is impractical to widen the scope to sporting and other organisations. Indeed, the Lord President made the point that that could be seen as the Government becoming the insurer of first resort, which must clearly be avoided. I have a certain admiration for the ingenuity with which the rates criterion was invoked. It is a very tidy. We support this measure.</p>

The Lord President spoke about the concern expressed by the ad hoc committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly about the equality impact screening of the proposals. That has been addressed, which addresses the Assembly&#146;s concern. I have only one question for the Lord President: what work has been undertaken to ensure that the order is not vulnerable to challenge? Otherwise, we support the order.</p>

Unlike the instrument we discussed earlier, this order is not so much a mark of Northern Ireland&#146;s progress towards normalisation but of the phases of disruption during that progress. The spike in attacks on, for example, Orange halls, is unfortunately part of the context of this order.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09030489000118"></a>In the case of the previous statutory instrument, the trend was towards normalisation. On the tendency of the people of Northern Ireland to claim three times more than citizens in the rest of the United Kingdom for criminal injury, I am informed that not so long ago they claimed six times more than the citizens of the rest of the United Kingdom, so even there the trend is towards normalisation.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="09030489000119"></a>In this case, however, we are dealing with something different: the remaining abnormality of the Northern Irish situation. The steps that the Government have taken to tackle the situation of isolated community halls and the context created by the attacks on some of them are entirely wise and reasonable. I have only one difficulty. The Lord President referred to the fact that the GAA and the SDLP disagreed with aspects of this proposal. My essential difficulty lies not in any  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_814"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 814</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>disagreement with the Government; the case can be made that the GAA is a very wealthy organisation, is perhaps more akin to some of the wealthier rugby clubs in Northern Ireland and is therefore not like the essentially penniless organisations that the Government are trying to help tonight. My difficulty is that, although I agree with the Government, I am uneasy that there is no one in this House to put the other case. It brings home to us again the problem of the absence of representation from the nationalist community in Northern Ireland. That, to some degree, is the product of a decision by the political representatives of that community, but does the Lord President share my unease on that point?</p>

<p><a name="st_181"></a>
<a name="09030489000120"></a><b><a name="90304-0013.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09030489000251"></a>Lord Browne of Belmont:</b> My Lords, I am pleased to support this legislation, which will give the trustees and users of community halls across Northern Ireland a much needed boost. Those who once had the unenviable burden of trying to prove that their community hall or meeting place, which was most likely in an isolated rural setting, had been attacked by three or more people, often in the dead of night, should now have one less hurdle to jump if their hall is attacked.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09030489000121"></a>Since 1977, one feature of the criminal damages compensation system in Northern Ireland dictated that, for criminal damage of more than &#163;200, a chief constable&#146;s certificate was required to receive compensation. The most difficult part of that process was proving how many perpetrators had carried out the attack. To satisfy the criteria, you had to prove either that three people had carried it out or that one individual had done so on behalf of a proscribed organisation. In rural Northern Ireland, that was and still proves to be an almost impossible task. As a result, not-for-profit community halls were faced with unbearable repairs and limited resources and, as time passed, insurmountable insurance premiums that inevitably led to the closure of many necessary facilities that offered a much needed focal point in their local community.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09030489000122"></a>This amendment to the criminal damage legislation is regrettably necessary simply because such attacks are not rare. When the Northern Ireland Assembly considered this legislation before producing its report for Parliament&#146;s consideration, representatives of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland gave a breakdown of attacks on their halls from 1971. The total was almost 300 attacks throughout that period. In 2007, a time of peace in the Province, 28 Orange halls were attacked. There were four major incidents, and in a fifth incident a JCB was driven through a set of gates. A further three halls were completely destroyed and razed to the ground.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09030489000123"></a>Such attacks are undoubtedly politically motivated and have continued since that time. As a result, members and the local community at large have been frustrated in their attempts to socialise both culturally and religiously. Regardless of one&#146;s political beliefs, that should be abhorred and condemned. That is why the legislation will have a very positive effect. Until we reach the stage at which people no longer feel motivated to carry out such attacks, we will be in a position to ensure that they do not succeed in their aim of closing halls and removing facilities from those who wish to use them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09030489000126"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bew, quite rightly said that the trend that necessitates the order is contrary to the trend that we discussed earlier. That is regrettable, as was clearly articulated by the noble Lord, Lord Browne, to whom I must apologise for calling him the noble Lord, Lord Morrow, earlier. The recent trend is regrettable, but we trust that it will be temporary. I am sure that the Northern Ireland Assembly will reflect on these issues in due course when the trend has gone the other way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09030489000127"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bew, also mentioned the GAA. I assure him that my colleague, Paul Goggins, has had meetings with the GAA and that very strong views have been expressed, quite rightly, by the nationalist community. I also have some sympathy with his view that the views of the SDLP and other nationalists cannot be expressed in this House because there are no Members from that community. I am very conscious of that, and I regret it in many ways. I am delighted that Northern Ireland has such a strong voice in this House, but it would be very good if there was a voice from the nationalist community as well as from the Ulster Unionist and other Protestant communities. I hope that this will be addressed in due course, but I do not wish to comment further at this stage.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09030489000128"></a>I hope that communities in Northern Ireland will continue to be sustainable and that the facilities which they use will be properly maintained, thanks to the order. I am grateful for all contributions this evening.</p>

<a name="09030489000129"></a><b><a name="90304-0013.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09030489000254"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> Clause 51 brings in a duty regarding the welfare of children in the carrying out of immigration and nationality functions. We certainly welcome this duty to act in regard to the welfare of children. We feel that it would have been even better if the new Bill incorporated the key sections of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, we certainly welcome the recognition in this clause of the importance of including those functions.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="09030489000130"></a>The purpose of my amendment is to see the extent of this duty. My amendment would insert the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09030489000205"></a>&#147;who are in the United Kingdom&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09030489000188"></a>as it is not clear whether the clause covers the UKBA staff based abroad, immigration functions at juxtaposed controls, entry clearance points and escorted removals from the UK. Of course, the clause is modelled on Section 11 of the Children Act 2004, which, interestingly, is not restricted to children who are in the UK. The inclusion of this caveat might be because the Government continue to be very worried that if they make this clause any stronger and have a need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children beyond a point that they remain in the UK, it might impede UKBA staff from carrying out their immigration functions; for example, removing a child and their family from the UK at the end of the asylum process if their claim has failed and their appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="09030489000131"></a>We do not think that such a fear is founded. The Government&#146;s own admission is that that would not be the case because during the passage of the Section 11 legislation, to which I have just referred, Ministers stated in the House,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="09030489000199"></a>&#147;We have been very careful in the way in which we have worded this clause: we do not put a duty on agencies that would make them unable to fulfil their primary functions".&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/6/04; col. 995.]</p>

<p><a name="09030489000189"></a>The exploration of exactly what the Government mean is important when it comes, for example, to the forcible removal of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children to their countries of origin. That has raised a number of issues. Although it is not always easy to obtain information on exactly what happens in such cases, they continue to cause some concern. I hope that the Minister will be quite clear on the extent of this clause and on the functions of UKBA, which it will cover. I beg to move.</p>

In particular, if you go through the implications of the amendment, the training of people in the issues concerned with children is important for those officials as well. I understand that the Home Office has suggested that this amendment might be inappropriate because it might suggest that British officials overseas should

That is not the point. The point is that all people who deal in any way with children being returned from the United Kingdom should understand all the issues, including those to do with child safety, so that they can give proper advice to those who are responsible for making decisions in this country, which makes the training and understanding of those people all the more important.</p>

<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="09030489000134"></a><b><a name="90304-0013.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09030489000257"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> I, too, have added my name to this amendment. There should be a requirement to care for children in transit. There is a danger that children who are passing through the country may not get quite the same attention from the border agency as others who are coming in. That might be helpful.</p>

<p><a name="st_188"></a>
<a name="09030489000135"></a><b><a name="90304-0013.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09030489000258"></a>Lord Hylton:</b> I agree with my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham that it would be better to leave out the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09030489000206"></a>&#147;who are in the United Kingdom&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030489000190"></a>However, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has made a very important point about transit. In the past year or two there have been more suspicions and perhaps some actual proof of children being trafficked into or through Britain for purposes of benefit fraud. This is a fairly new kind of trafficking, which I ask the Government to take very seriously.</p>

<p><a name="st_189"></a>
<a name="09030489000136"></a><b><a name="90304-0013.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09030489000259"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I wish to underline what my noble friend said about the juxtaposed controls. That is particularly important, bearing in mind the powers of officials to detain any person in the juxtaposed controls, the Channel ports, where people, including children, may be questioned and detained for a certain length of time. The juxtaposed controls are so important because oversight of them is less intense. I think I am right in saying that the chief inspector has once been to look at them. They do not have the same intense scrutiny by the voluntary agencies that places of detention in the United Kingdom enjoy. The risks to a child of being ill treated in such a place, where a lot of the staff contractors employed by the Secretary of State are not direct UKBA officials, must be accentuated.</p>

<a name="90304-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="09030489000137"></a>I am really puzzled as to why it was thought necessary to confine this obligation to the United Kingdom. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain how the UK Border Agency code of practice for keeping children safe from harm applies in the juxtaposed controls as it does in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="st_190"></a>

A lot of points have already been identified. Clearly, to have on the other side of the border, from which various people will want to come into this country, staff who are not as well educated and trained to have proper regard for the welfare of the child&#151;I agree entirely with my noble friend on that point&#151;as we are all now rightly required to do, can be very dangerous. I hope, with other noble friends, that either this can be explained to our satisfaction or that the Government will go and think carefully about removing

It is, however, an important phrase because all of our officials should be having regard to the welfare of the child, and all of us are pretty worried about the number of children who have entered this country. We do not know the numbers or why they are here but mostly, whether for benefit fraud or whatever, it is not for very desirable reasons.</p>

<ul><a name="09030489000207"></a>&#147;to safeguard and promote the welfare of children&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030489000191"></a>We won by a resounding number, because it was the right thing to do.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90304-0014.htm"/>


<a name="90304-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="09030489000140"></a>However, I share the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and my noble friend Lady Hanham that these amendments express: that duty should not just apply to children who are in the UK, but have equal application to children who come into the sphere of activities of the UK Border Agency staff abroad or when a child is in transit, particularly as it could enormously help the identification and early support of trafficked children. We should never underestimate the high regard in which this country is held. That extends to our embassies, to the British Council and to all other agencies of the state operating beyond our shores, where people would, quite rightly, expect to be treated with courtesy and consideration&#151;and that should be especially true of children.</p>

<a name="90304-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="09030489000141"></a>During the passage of the Children and Young Persons Act, I met an exceptional young man from Afghanistan. His parents saved all the money that they could, then they sent him, with a group of others, to England to live a safer life&#151;and who could blame them? He was 15, and it took him a year and a half to walk most of the way to England. He is now in care, flourishing and enjoying school, and wants to be a doctor. For all of the children and young people who, for whatever reason, find themselves in his position, I should like to think that their experience of Britain will be good and positive, and that they will be properly looked after&#151;wherever and for however long they are in our care.</p>

It was arranged at fairly late notice late last week and I was involved in a conference and visiting a children&#146;s home outside London.

<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_819"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 819</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this clause to be our own&#151;I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, referred to that&#151;so I can be sure that it is generally welcomed and the right way to go. I understand that these probing amendments define some of the details and I welcome the opportunity to debate this important clause, which places a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that immigration and customs functions are discharged</p>
<ul><a name="09030489000208"></a>&#147;having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030489000192"></a>Subsection (4) places a similar duty on the Director of Border Revenue.</p>

<a name="90304-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="09030489000144"></a>I begin by considering Amendments 112 and 114, since they both seek to extend the duty to children outside the United Kingdom. As your Lordships know, Clause 51 seeks to replicate the effect of Section 11 of the Children Act 2004, which already applies such a duty to a range of public bodies including local authorities, the National Health Service, the police and youth offending teams. Section 11 applies only to England, whereas the duty in Clause 51 applies throughout the United Kingdom, which sensibly reflects the geographic extent of the jurisdiction of the UK Border Agency.</p>

<a name="90304-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="09030489000145"></a>However, these amendments seek to take the duty a step further, and to require the border force to discharge its functions having regard to the welfare of children not just in the UK, but worldwide. On the face of it, this may seem an attractive proposition, but it is not practical. The duty in Clause 51, supported as it will be by guidance which we will discuss later, is based on the systems in place in the United Kingdom and cannot simply be transplanted to other countries, which may have entirely different arrangements. Moreover, it is likely that those countries would consider it to be interference in their jurisdiction if the UK border force were to seek to assume the same level of responsibility for local children as it would for children in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90304-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="09030489000146"></a>We think, therefore, that our formal responsibilities under this duty have to be confined to children who are in the United Kingdom. This common-sense approach is in line with, for example, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which also limits the responsibilities of state parties to children within their jurisdiction.</p>

<a name="90304-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="09030489000147"></a>However, we accept that UK border staff have a responsibility to take appropriate action if, in the course of their duties, they come across children overseas whom they believe to be at risk of harm. They might, for example, be suspicious that a visa application for a child was being made for the purposes of trafficking. If harm is suspected, we would expect the staff to inform the local law enforcement authorities and/or deny a visa, as appropriate.</p>

<a name="90304-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="09030489000148"></a>The UKBA introduced a statutory code of practice for keeping children safe from harm, which came into force on 6 January. That code sets out the expectation that the border force staff overseas will make referrals to overseas authorities where local or other international agreements permit or require it.</p>

<a name="90304-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="09030489000149"></a>Amendment 112A seeks to ensure that the duty in the clause applies to children whose presence in the United Kingdom is for the purpose of transit to  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_820"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 820</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>another country. I remind the Committee that the duty will apply to any function carried out in relation to immigration, asylum, nationality and any general customs or border revenue function carried out on behalf of the Secretary of State. This will include the handling of children whose contact with the border force is as passengers who are in transit through the UK and who seek a short stay of 48 hours to accomplish that.</p>

<a name="90304-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="09030489000150"></a>Passengers who are in direct transit and transferring straightaway to a connecting flight do not need to seek entry to the UK and no immigration function is carried out. The duty would not therefore apply in those circumstances, although the staff will of course involve the police if there are reasonable grounds for believing a child in these circumstances to be at risk of harm.</p>

<a name="90304-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="09030489000151"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked about the extent of Section 11 of the Children Act. As I mentioned, that applies only in England, whereas this provision applies across the whole of the United Kingdom. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, asked about training of officials&#151;quite rightly so. Children&#146;s needs feature in the training that we give to entry clearance officers overseas, who also receive briefings from the International Organisation for Migration on trafficking awareness. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked how the UKBA code applies to juxtaposed controls. Section 1.13 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a><a name="09030489000200"></a>&#147;UK Border Agency staff overseas will also refer children to the authorities of other countries where local or international agreements permit or require&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030489000193"></a>This applies in particular to juxtaposed controls when agreement exists with the French authorities, as the noble Lord mentioned. I hope that, in the light of that clarification and those answers, noble Lords will be content not to press their amendments.</p>

<a name="09030489000152"></a><b><a name="90304-0014.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09030489000264"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> I thank all those who have spoken. I thank in particular the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, for reminding us that we do these things because they are right, particularly with regard to children. I still have some queries, because I had understood that Section 11 of the Children Act applies to any authority&#151;for example, the police&#151;which has to escort a child, even though it may be overseas. Perhaps the Minister will tell me whether I am wrong about that. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, has obviously heard a great deal that we have not. Perhaps I should be reassured by that, because he is usually very questioning, but sadly I am not entirely.</p>

<a name="90304-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="09030489000153"></a>There are still a couple of areas that I am concerned about. One is that the Minister did not mention the issue of private contractors. I am sure that they are covered by the provisions and await his assurance that they are. I raised the issue because some of the most extreme cases of which I have heard, although I have not observed them myself, have been of the dawn raids and removals of families, of course including children, for whom it is traumatic to be taken from their beds at four in the morning with their family and taken away in the dark in a van. I should think that that runs counter to this clause; I do not think that it will comply once the Bill has gone through.</p>

Here you have a situation that is unique, in that the children are in the custody of the UKBA. Certain powers have been granted to the UKBA by agreement of the French and Belgian authorities; they allow us to detain, to question, to search, and so on, those persons who come under the juxtaposed controls. That includes the children. If all those functions have been transferred from the state that has jurisdiction, why could they not transfer also the obligations to safeguard welfare of the children?</p>

I can write to the noble Lord on the detail of that, but that is the situation as it stands at the moment. As for private contractors, the answer is that, yes, these provisions include them at Clause 51(1)(b).</p>

Is the Minister saying that if, on the other side of a border, in another country, embassy staff are suspicious that there may be an ulterior motive in some of the trafficking that is going on involving children, they would alert people at this end? Will they be trained sufficiently to do just that, so that as, when or if any of those individuals and children come over, border staff will be sufficiently alert to deal with the situation? Are we satisfied that that is happening now? If not, what is in this Bill that will make it more effective?</p>

If they see something that they feel is wrong happening with a child, they will contact the authorities if the country that they are in is one where we are able to deal with the authorities and

In other words, the country would not be in the category of those where one would, perhaps, not want to mention it in case it ended up being worse for the family and child. They have to be countries that we have agreements with. Clearly, when it comes to something such as getting a visa, or anything that applies in this country, all these rules apply. There is a whole raft of different conditions&#151;such as other conditions in the Children Act&#151;that apply. We will come to them in later amendments. They cannot possibly all be applied on someone else&#146;s territory; we would feel rather annoyed if someone in this country started handling children on UK territory in the way that they felt was right under their law. We would be upset by that. All that we are saying is that we cannot do that.</p>

However, what if, for example, a child abroad has made an application through a consular post? In such a case, a refugee&#146;s children&#151;who are minors&#151;may make an application for family reunion. They would apply to join a parent who had been accepted as a refugee by the UK. In cases such as the one that we are being told about, it has taken several years of litigation before a challenge to the refusal to the child succeeded. During this time the children suffered severe psychological and physical ill health. That happened on the soil of another country, but the consular post is dealing with that application. That is not really interfering in the affairs of the country because it absolutely has to do with the child&#146;s application to this country. That is one reason why we want to look into this a little further before Report.</p>

Will there still be dawn raids? If so, will there be additional safeguards? Will they no longer exist because Clause 51 will preclude them? Could the Minister think about sending us some notes on what the new guidance will be when Clause 51 comes in?</p>

I think we will come to more of the details in other amendments. If, after that, the noble Baroness would still like a note, I have no difficulty in sending one with those details. Maybe I have not been clear about the situation in which this applies. Whether the duty applies is absolutely determined by whether the child concerned is in the UK or overseas. The location of the border staff exercising this duty is immaterial; it is a matter of where the child is. For example, a grandmother could apply for a visa to travel to the UK to care for a sick grandchild. Because the child is in the UK, the border force would have to consider the application, having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child. This would be the case despite consideration taking place outside the UK. It depends on where the child is.</p>

This is clearly a complex matter. I am a little concerned that, at this stage of the Bill, we may be making quite definite interpretations of what this clause means. This might be seen by others as setting a precedent and setting out quite clearly what needs to be done. Perhaps it is indeed better for us to come back to this. I think of this in particular with regard to whether the duty operates with a child on our soil or another country&#146;s soil. I can imagine a situation, for instance, of a school party going abroad and the teacher still being bound by Section 11 of the Children Act. If UKBA officials were dealing with the child in Calais they might still be bound by the safeguarding elements in the Bill. I am a little concerned that we should wait until the next stage of the Bill to look at this a little more closely.</p>

The first two amendments in this group can be seen as providing belt and braces support for Amendment 117B.

I thank other noble Lords and outside organisations, including the Immigration Law Practitioners&#146; Association and the Refugee Children's Consortium, for their work in this area and for their briefing.</p>

<a name="90304-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="09030489000170"></a>There is a very real and dangerous loophole that I want to explain to the Committee, but I want to make the point that while we applaud the Government for carrying forward Clause 51, which is largely thanks to my noble friends on the Opposition Benches, none of us can say that this Bill fully covers the welfare of children unless we look at the lacuna that has arisen in the present law. I know that the Government share absolutely the aim of protecting the youngest and most vulnerable members of society because they have told us that on innumerable occasions. It is my fervent hope, therefore, that the noble Lord will take on board what I and other Members of the Committee have to say and accept these amendments.</p>

<a name="90304-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="09030489000171"></a>If we return to the debate on the 2004 Bill, now the Act, when the provisions on the trafficking of children in what is now Section 4 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 were being debated, we can chart the course of this story. The Government accepted that their original drafting of that Bill was inadequate to deal with the trafficking of babies and young children and, potentially, other people with special vulnerabilities. The Government amended the Bill to address that. It was considered at the time by some in this House that the government amendment, which is now part of Section 4 of the Act as passed, was inadequate and hence an amendment was tabled to address that.</p>

<a name="90304-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="09030489000172"></a>At Report in your Lordships' House on the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 my noble friend Lady Anelay raised the risk of a lacuna and was supported by many other noble Lords. The concern then, as now, was that the trafficking provisions were suitable to help only those people who were in a position to know that they were being trafficked. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, offered an assurance that the Government did not think that the lacuna existed; and said that in any case the courts would be able to construe Parliament&#146;s intention. The noble and learned Baroness referred to the doctrine in Pepper v Hart 1993, AC593, which held that a reference can be made to ministerial statements in <I>Hansard</I> only if legislation is ambiguous. Under the Pepper v Hart doctrine, if it is not ambiguous, the courts cannot look at the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="09030489000173"></a>It seems that the existing legislation is not ambiguous: it covers only those people who are aware that they are being induced or coerced. A baby, or a very young or vulnerable person, cannot be in that position. They fall foul of a loophole in the law. The Crown Prosecution Service does not consider that the existing legislation allows it to prosecute in certain cases of child trafficking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="09030489000174"></a>The result of this can be seen in the Peace Sandberg case. Noble Lords may remember that on 16 May 2008, Peace Sandberg was jailed for 26 months at Isleworth Crown Court after being found guilty of facilitating illegal entry into the United Kingdom. The illegal entry in question was that of a baby, believed to

Importantly, Miss Sandberg was not prosecuted for trafficking, because it was concluded that Section 4 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 was inadequate to capture the trafficking of babies and very small children.</p>

<a name="90304-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="09030489000175"></a>That is the situation that our amendment is designed to prevent. It is no good to say that offenders will be caught and prosecuted for another offence, as in the Peace Sandberg case, because we cannot always know that that will be the case. There is a problem with the existing law: many organisations say so. Our amendments would fix that problem. They would ensure that babies and young children are covered by the Act. I feel sure that no one on any Bench in your Lordships&#146; House would argue against strengthening the Bill in its protection of the most vulnerable. We are dealing with a disgusting crime and I feel hopeful that the Minister will accept our proposals. I beg to move.</p>

Such is the purpose of the two amendments here, as well as an amendment seeking to apply the duty to all children.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="09030489000182"></a>On Amendment 112B, human trafficking, as the Committee agrees, is an appalling crime. Our overall aim is to make the United Kingdom a hostile environment for trafficking and to protect its victims. The United Kingdom therefore adopts a victim-centred approach to combating trafficking, including child trafficking. This is embodied in the <I>UK Action Plan on Tackling Human Trafficking</I>, updated in July 2008, which has a specific chapter on child trafficking and their care. The duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children applies to all children in the UK encountered by the UK Border Agency in the discharge of its functions, which includes the prevention of trafficking and enforcement activities.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="09030489000183"></a>On December 17 2008, we ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking. This sets out minimum standards of care for victims of trafficking. Within that, we are giving specific consideration to the needs of child victims. We are also compliant with other relevant international instruments, including the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, and the EU framework decision on trafficking which sets out EU legislation on this issue and also has a focus on child victims and their welfare.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="09030489000184"></a>While immigration considerations are important, trafficking is a much wider issue. Human trafficking is viewed primarily as a serious organised crime by international bodies such as the UN, by the UK Government and by law enforcement agencies such as the Serious Organised Crime Agency, for which combating organised immigration crime, including human trafficking, is their second-highest priority. It therefore includes, but is not limited to, immigration considerations.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="09030489000185"></a>An amendment to include combating trafficking in the list of immigration functions of the Secretary of State is therefore not appropriate. However, it is also not needed. We already take a victim-centred approach to combating trafficking. I trust that the noble Baroness will be content to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="09030489000186"></a>The second amendment seeks to say that all children in the United Kingdom will be included in the duty. The amendment is unnecessary because the current definition already applies without any qualification or reservation to all persons under the age of 18. I should like to reassure Members of the Committee that we have no intention of treating children in the immigration system any differently from other children in the UK. Quite the opposite; we have said on numerous occasions that every child matters as much if they are subject to immigration control as if they are British citizens. To that end we have deliberately adopted the definition of children in the Children Act 2004 to achieve parity with the duty in Section 11 of that Act. Perhaps I may remind your Lordships that Section 65(1) of the Children Act 2004 states that &#147;child&#148; means a person under the  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_827"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 827</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>age of 18, and we have used the same definition. The duty proposed in the Bill is therefore already a general duty that applies to all children. The amendment is not needed for it to be fully effective.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="09030494000001"></a>The third amendment covers a serious situation, but it is perhaps not the most appropriate means of preventing the wrong that is intended. Human trafficking is not limited to sexual exploitation, and the Government are committed to tackling it in all its forms. Section 4 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004 criminalises the trafficking of people, including children, for non-sexual exploitation. Concerns that young people might not be sufficiently protected were raised at that time, and the Act strengthened. Section 4(4)(d) of that Act makes it an offence to arrange or facilitate the entry into the UK of a young or vulnerable person with the intention of requesting or inducing actions of benefit to another person, that a person with the advantage of age would most likely refuse. This involves the Peace Sandberg case that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, was referring to, which fits directly into that.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="09030494000002"></a>This ensures we cover exploitation without curtailing legitimate activity. The amendment before us is unsatisfactory because it defines as exploited any child who is in a position of vulnerability. Therefore there is a risk, and it could easily be done this way within law, of criminalising legal activities, such as bringing children to the UK for altruistic purposes, to participate in competitions, cultural visits, choirs and so on.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="09030494000003"></a>The Government understand the concerns behind the amendment. We have some sympathy with that, and have previously committed to keeping the legislation on human trafficking under review. We intend to look into this matter further and address any situations where exploitation takes place in a trafficking context, but is not covered by the offence, as part of our considerations of the forthcoming Bill to simplify and consolidate immigration legislation. We aim to publish this in draft before the end of this parliamentary Session. There will be an opportunity for consultation on particular issues. On this basis I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

As he read out his brief he might have anticipated that I was going to be disappointed. I found the response bland and I found it completely unsympathetic to the points that were being raised. There seems to be an absolute lack of comprehension of the reason behind this amendment. It has been found that you cannot prosecute for the trafficking of babies&#151;which happens&#151;and the very young child who cannot be in the position to know they are being trafficked. They are being exploited, not necessarily for drugs, but they may very well be being exploited for sale, adoption or another reason.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="09030494000009"></a>This is so important that there is no question that I will not come back to it. We are being advised strongly by people who represent those who have to deal with this problem and who understand the legal situation that the law is not strong enough. The law cannot do what it says it is meant to do. Simply, for the Minister to think that I will walk away from this is probably to misunderstand me. We will not walk away from this; we will come back to it on Report. If, in the mean time, the Minister would like his officials to help us to get an amendment that will absolutely close this loophole, I will be very happy to discuss it with anyone. If we do not get that situation, we will divide the House, and I think that we will win. For today, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="09030494000012"></a>Various groups of children concern me under the category of immigration. First, there are the immigration detainees who are held in detention centres, many of whom are held for far too long. There is a further  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_829"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 829</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>amendment discussing the question of detention, so I shall not detain the Committee at this stage on that issue.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="09030494000013"></a>Secondly, a very large number of people&#151;certainly hundreds and said to be thousands&#151;have come into this country as children, underage, and have disappeared. No one knows where they are. This is a matter that I have raised before in the context of the Health and Social Care Act. Who is looking for them? Who is trying to find them? I welcome the fact that the Government have recognised the need for the Children Act to apply to this group of children. I am enormously grateful for the briefing that I and other Members received from the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium, the Immigration Law Practitioners&#146; Association and the Refugee Legal Centre, which mentioned the problems of dealing with the children whom we know about&#151;but who is looking for the children whom we do not know about?</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="09030494000014"></a>There are in existence local safeguarding children boards, which have been set up by statute. The Minister has already mentioned the fact that those boards have core membership that includes local authorities, health bodies, the police and others. I have called before for a census to be done by these local safeguarding bodies to discover how many of these children are in their areas of responsibility, where they are and what is happening to them. No one else is capable of doing so. If the UKBA now has an obligation under the Children Act, what is the relationship between the UKBA and the local safeguarding children boards regarding the children who appear, if we are not careful, to be falling between the cracks of the two?</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="09030494000015"></a>I shall go on to ask further questions of the Minister, because it seems to me that there is a great danger in allowing just the mention of looking after children under the responsibility of the UKBA to go without looking at all the other implications of this. Who is actually responsible for inspecting the conditions in which immigrant detainee and asylum-seeking children are held by social services all around the country? To ease the burden on the social services that are adjacent to the airports or ports of entry, children have been distributed all around the country to individual social services to be looked after. Their conditions are very different. Some are in bed and breakfast accommodation. Some are given education, others are not. Who is responsible for looking after this issue? The Council for Social Care Inspection was abolished recently and replaced by Ofsted. Is the UKBA talking to Ofsted about the inspection of the facilities in which these asylum-seeking and immigrant children are being looked after?</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="09030494000016"></a>We were going to just let the amendment go by default, but it seems to me to be a &#147;tip of the iceberg&#148; amendment. I really would like confirmation from the Minister that all these other implications of the looking-after of children under the terms and conditions of Section 11 of the Children Act 2004 really have been looked into and that all the other agencies with statutory responsibilities for helping and, particularly, for looking after these people who nobody knows anything about are being investigated.</p>

His name was on the amendment and he has much greater expertise than I do.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="09030494000018"></a>Whenever you hear, for example, discussions around a local government table about corporate parenthood and so on, I cannot recall an occasion when they have included the children we are talking about this evening. It has always involved children who were born and lived in the area and this issue is almost entirely overlooked. The noble Lord has raised some serious matters about how these systems intermesh, because in a lot of agencies they simply do not.</p>

The whole area is one where children and young people can fall between many stools and there are quite frequently gaps between one form of authority or service and another.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="09030494000020"></a>I will mention my own experience in dealing in the matter of disappeared children. About seven or eight years ago, the social services in Sussex had a safe house not too far from Gatwick and therefore suitably located for caring for such children. However, considerable numbers of children, several dozens at least, disappeared from that safe house. Subsequently, we were promised that there would be a kind of national safe house, probably in the London area, which would be operated by a voluntary organisation. I do not think that that ever came off.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="09030494000021"></a>All the same, children have gone on disappearing both from placements with foster parents and from children&#146;s homes run by local social services. The question that my noble friend raised about who is responsible for looking for those who have disappeared is very relevant and needs to be followed up.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="09030494000022"></a>There are fears that in some cases children who disappeared were somehow spirited away to west Africa or re-exported from this country. It is a very serious matter.</p>

I understand that the Home Office has just decided to withdraw funding from the Refugee Council Children&#146;s Panel. That panel has been very involved in the sort of work that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has been talking about. It helps to make decisions on the age of children in this country and generally keeps an eye on them. If the Minister does not know the answer tonight, I should be extremely grateful if he would write to let me know why this money has been withdrawn and what possible alternatives are being put forward to protect the children in the way that the children&#146;s panel has been doing. The panel has been absolutely central to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children in the United Kingdom, and it would enormously raise the stakes on Clause 51 if the proposed Home Office procedures were to stand without its expertise and support.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="09030494000025"></a>We are talking about quite a serious problem. In 2007, 3,500 separated children arrived in the UK from places such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia. Until now, the children&#146;s panel has been working to help these young people, who range in age from 10 to 17, to access services and to help them through the asylum system. The advisers on the children&#146;s panel help as many separated children as they can, although their services are concentrated in London and the south-east, through one-to-one casework, and they have drop-in services and surgeries. They work with those who are particularly vulnerable, including those who are trafficked.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="09030494000026"></a>My impression is that the children who have disappeared, especially those who have been placed in the custody of local authorities, are in fact trafficked and would not have disappeared from the system voluntarily. I feel that someone has a hold on them, enabling them to come from the custody of a foster parent or children&#146;s home or wherever they are located to be used for nefarious purposes within the United Kingdom. I do not think that it is very credible that they would be sent back to West Africa, as the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, suspected is sometimes the case.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="09030494000027"></a>Why are we cutting off money from the children&#146;s panel at the very moment when we are ostensibly safeguarding the welfare of the children? Does that not seem extremely incongruous, and can the Minister tell us whether there is any possibility that the Government will reconsider this niggardly and untimely stinginess?</p>

I am not sure but I believe that the future of the panel has been uncertain for some time. I think that there was a threat of the money being withdrawn, and now some money is being given for next year so that some of its work can continue.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="09030494000029"></a>However, I was comforted by the Minister&#146;s response at Second Reading, when he recognised the importance of people working on the front line and having front-line experience. We talked about the morale of the case managers. I also spoke to Jeremy Oppenheim about the changes that he has been bringing about. He has introduced the case management system so that individual case managers can follow a case from the beginning to the end and build a relationship with the asylum applicant. However we legislate, if we do not have people on the ground with experience and expertise to inform us of what is being done, we will not get what we ultimately need. During the passage of the Children Act 2004, the noble Lord, Lord Laming, said again and again that the Children Act 1989 was very good but that unfortunately it was being poorly implemented. We can legislate all through the night but if we do not have people on the ground with experience and expertise, we will not get the outcomes for children that we want.

These experts with long experience are just what we need if we are to protect children. It is a matter of concern and I hope that the Minister can reassure us.</p>

<a name="90304-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="09030494000030"></a>I also want to ask about the production of the guidance for Clause 51. May I have an assurance that there will be a close partnership with the Department for Children, Schools and Families and what it has done with Section 11?

I was very concerned by the anger of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, that greater attention was not being paid to trafficked children. There are far too many of them for a country which prides itself that such a thing could never happen here, but it has been happening. To hear that the money is being withdrawn from some of the organisations that are active in this field is not good news at all. I hope that the Minister can assure us that if there is a good reason for taking away money from this group&#151;nothing has given us any reason to believe that that is so&#151;similar sums of money will be made available to other people who will pursue those interests rather more vigorously.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90304-0016.htm"/>


<a name="90304-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="09030494000033"></a>Clause 51(3) requires a person exercising the immigration, asylum, nationality or customs functions in subsection (2) to have regard to any guidance given by the Secretary of State for this purpose. Subsection (5) requires the same of anyone exercising a function of the Director of Border Revenue. Amendments 113 and 115 would require the Secretary of State in turn, when issuing and reviewing such guidance, to have regard to guidance issued under Section 11 of the Children Act 2004 and Section 17 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.</p>

<a name="90304-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="09030494000034"></a>These amendments are unnecessary. It is already our intention that the guidance to support Clause 51 will be developed and issued jointly with the Department for Children, Schools and Families&#151;a point made by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel&#151;and will reflect closely the existing Section 11 guidance, about which I will say more shortly. Before I do, I should also make a technical point about the references to Scottish legislation. Section 17 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 is not analogous to our new duty, and thus not an appropriate model to follow for the following reasons.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_833"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 833</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90304-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="09030494000035"></a>Section 17 sets out the duty of a local authority to a child looked after by the local authority. This is a wholly different relationship from that between UKBA and the children it deals with in the UK immigration system. Section 17 section sets out that the local authority&#146;s duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children shall be a paramount concern, whereas our new duty is to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children when exercising specific functions. Section 17 is also a duty for the local authority to make services available to children and to take steps to promote relations and contact between the child and the person with parental responsibilities. Again, this is quite different from UKBA&#146;s role.</p>

<a name="90304-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="09030494000036"></a>Let me now return to the substance of the amendment and the relationship between our guidance and the existing Section 11 guidance. It might assist noble Lords if I describe the existing statutory guidance on making arrangements to safeguard and promote the welfare of children under Section 11. The guidance is divided into two parts. Part 1 sets out the general arrangements to safeguard and promote welfare, which all bodies subject to the duty must have in place. It includes strategic and organisational arrangements such as senior management commitment to children; a clear statement of the agency&#146;s responsibilities towards children that is available for all staff; staff training; effective inter-agency working; and so on. Part 1 also highlights some of the ways in which the duty affects direct work with children and families; for example, in the need to ensure that children are listened to and taken seriously; to be clear when to refer children in need to other agencies; to keep good records; and so on. Part 1 is drafted in such a way as to be relevant to all the different bodies that are subject to the duty and to enable them to apply it in ways appropriate to their own functions. We think that Part 1 as drafted is equally relevant to the UKBA and should apply in the same way.</p>

<a name="90304-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="09030494000037"></a>In Part 2 of the guidance, there are individual chapters devoted to each individual organisation to which the duty applies. This is because the duty applies differently to each and every body or organisation to which it relates because it always applies within the context of the specific organisation&#146;s exercise of its specific functions. We will produce something along similar lines for the UKBA. It will set out the UKBA&#146;s primary functions, including those of the director of border revenue, and the main areas where it has a contribution to make to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children in the exercise of those functions. Although the duty applies to all functions, it will be of greater relevance to some than others&#151;for example, in relation to identifying possible victims of trafficking. The guidance will also set out how we will give effect to some of the broad organisational and strategic arrangements in Part 1 in the specific context of the border force.</p>

<a name="90304-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="09030494000038"></a>As the amendment recognises, the Section 11 guidance applies to England only. Therefore, in addition to working closely with DCSF, we will also work with the devolved Administrations to ensure that our guidance takes proper account of the different arrangements in place elsewhere, and we will also consult other external  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_834"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column 834</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bodies, including NGOs, in the drafting process. The amendments make a specific point about taking account of the Section 11 guidance when the guidance on this clause is reviewed. In view of the very close relationship between the two that I have described, it will be obvious that neither could be reviewed without reference to the other and that this aspect of the amendments is also unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90304-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="09030494000039"></a>A couple of specific points were raised. One of the issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, was also touched on by other speakers. It is the withdrawal of funding from the Refugee Council&#146;s children&#146;s panel. We have agreed to fund it to carry out substantially the same services as in previous years; the only significant change is that we will no longer fund it to liaise with local authorities on age assessment. Instead, on that issue, we will go direct to trained social workers in local authority children's services departments, and we are providing additional funding for authorities with the largest number of such cases. Far from dropping money and taking it away, we are spending slightly more in a slightly different way.</p>

<a name="90304-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="09030494000040"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, asked about missing children. If children from overseas go missing, the police are immediately informed and normal police procedures are followed. The borders staff attend local safeguarding children boards where issues are raised involving children from overseas. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, also asked about the relationship between the border force and LSCBs. The Clause 51 duty will ensure that the border force fits within the inter-agency arrangements set out in Section 11 of the Children Act. That includes liaison with the local safeguarding children boards. He also asked whether we can confirm that the full implications of looking after children that are contained in Section 11 of the Children Act are being looked into. We are exploring with the Department for Children, Schools and Families how the Section 11 duty will apply in strategic arrangements and in the framework for co-ordinating with other agencies. That will be set out in detail in the guidance accompanying the new duty. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, asked about guidance on this liaison. I assure him that we have had a close partnership in formulating that guidance.

Perhaps we could have a note some time on the exact reasons behind this and what the children&#146;s panel will be left to do if it is not doing this. The Minister said that there would be extra money, but it seems to me that the local authorities will spend the money that the children&#146;s panel would have been spending on finding out what age a child was. We need a little more clarity on this, if we may have it.</p>

I understand that the children&#146;s panel has been particularly effective in the past year at recognising children who have been held in detention mistakenly as adults. Indeed, it has recognised more in the past year than in previous years, so it may have the expertise to do this difficult and complex job well and to protect children well who have been mistakenly placed in the adult system. I am sure that we will come back to this. It will be interesting to learn exactly how this will work in the best interests of children.</p>

There is nothing personal in this; the noble Lord, Lord West, and I have known each other for long enough to realise that that would not apply. When I was a member of the Independent Asylum Commission, we summed up the attitudes of the Home Office and the UKBA to all the points that were being put to them as a culture of disbelief. What worries me about the brief that the noble Lord read out was that it was the culture of disbelief writ large. I was amazed that it should be suggested that people reported to the police that people had gone missing. Who had reported them to the police? Which people knew that they had gone missing? I am incredulous.</p>

In view of the questions raised by noble Lords all around the Committee throughout our discussions today and on earlier parts of the Bill, I do not think that it would be responsible of us to let this part of the Bill go without further question. I hope, therefore, that to guide our discussions on Report, the Minister can share with us the guidance and the policy which they propose to put out so that we can subject it to the same sort of examination that we have put the Bill through, in the hope that we make it workable on behalf of the people whom we are trying to look after.

<p><a name="09030459000005"></a><b><a name="90304-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09030459000116"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> Last October we brought into force the legislation to set up the Care Quality Commission&#151;the new single regulator for health and adult social care. The noble Baroness, Lady Young, has given us a daily countdown to CQC kick-off. The draft regulations before us now are part of a package of secondary legislation which will enable the commission to take on its functions from 1 April this year.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000006"></a>Part 1 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 provides for a new registration system for the regulation of health and adult social care. These regulations are the first step in bringing the NHS into a system of registration for the first time, alongside the independent and voluntary sector and social care providers. At present NHS providers are required to comply with the code of practice for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections issued under the Health Act 2006. The regulations before us carry forward the essential requirements of the existing code and place them into the new legislative framework. Regulations 3 and 5 require NHS providers of healthcare to be registered with the commission and to meet a single registration requirement on the protection of persons against identifiable risks of healthcare-associated infections. The regulations cover the same providers that are obliged to comply with the existing code. In January we laid an order enabling the registration process to begin.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC306"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column GC306</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000007"></a>Alongside the regulations there is a revised code of practice which sets out the nine compliance criteria and guidance that the commission will use to judge whether registered NHS providers of healthcare are complying with the regulation on HCAI. It will be an offence to fail to comply with the regulation and registered providers may be prosecuted. On summary conviction, this could result in a fine of up to &#163;50,000 for each offence, as set out in these regulations. The Act also gave the commission a range of other enforcement powers to use where providers are not complying with requirements. These include: the power to suspend or cancel registration, the power to issue a warning notice or a fixed-penalty notice, and the power to attach conditions to a provider&#146;s registration. The greater range of enforcement powers enables the regulator to take a more flexible and proportionate approach to breaches of registration requirements. This will benefit patients by encouraging quicker progress in tackling infections. These regulations set out further details in relation to fixed-penalty notices and set the penalties at between &#163;1,250 and &#163;4,000 depending on the offence. A number of administrative matters are also set out, such as the timescale for payment.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000008"></a>Until 2010 the new Care Quality Commission will continue to regulate private and voluntary healthcare providers and adult social care providers under the Care Standards Act 2000. These providers will continue to have to comply with the regulations and national minimum standards under the 2000 Act, which include requirements on infection control. In 2010 the registration system under the 2008 Act will be widened from covering just NHS providers to cover private and voluntary health and adult social care, and with a wider set of safety and quality requirements.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000009"></a>If the registration system is to operate effectively and transparently it is important that the public and commissioners have access to information about services and service providers. These regulations make a number of provisions to ensure that information about the commission&#146;s regulatory action is available and they require the commission to keep a register of persons registered as service providers. The regulations also make a number of provisions requiring the commission to make public information relating to certain enforcement action it has taken. The commission is authorised to make certain other information available.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000010"></a>The Act requires the commission to notify PCTs, local authorities, strategic health authorities, Monitor and anyone else it considers appropriate when it issues certain notices, such as a notice proposing cancellation of registration. However, to ensure that these requirements are not overly burdensome, Regulation 9 sets out certain exemptions from this requirement, such as where notices relate to certain administrative matters such as the process of considering and granting initial applications for registration. Regulation 10 sets out further details about who must be notified.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000011"></a>In carrying out its functions the commission will need to look at documents and information as well as talk to providers and those using the services. The commission will need in the course of carrying out its functions to question people for explanations of any relevant matters. These regulations set out the people who must provide an explanation to the commission if  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC307"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column GC307</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>requested to do so. The Act makes it an offence for these persons to fail to comply with a requirement from the commission for an explanation of a matter. The regulations will give the commission a stronger role in relation to the provision of healthcare by NHS bodies and in tackling HCAIs. These are the first in a series of regulations that will be brought before the House to widen the registration system across providers of health and social care services. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09030459000012"></a><b><a name="90304-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09030459000117"></a>Earl Howe:</b> First, perhaps I may apologise to the Minister for being slightly late. I shall of course read the opening sentences of her speech, those that I missed, in <I>Hansard</I>. I thank her for introducing these regulations, but because of the helpful briefing session that she was kind enough to organise a couple of weeks ago, I have only a very few comments and questions.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000013"></a>The CQC&#146;s task of registering all providers of health and social care is a very considerable one, so it is not surprising that the Government have allowed it to be tackled in two stages. The regulations we are looking at provide only for the registration of NHS providers, and then only in relation to a single set of requirements, namely those covering healthcare-acquired infections. It is understood that further registration requirements will be introduced for these NHS bodies next year and that adult social care providers and the independent healthcare sector will also be brought within the scope of the new regime in 2010.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000014"></a>If we focus on this initial round of registrations, the first question that arises is whether there is a performance threshold below which the CQC will simply refuse to register a provider and, if so, what that threshold is. Those may sound like odd things to ask, but if these requirements are to mean anything, surely it is essential that every NHS body should have to demonstrate a minimum acceptable standard of cleanliness and hygiene and an acceptable recent track record in rates of healthcare-acquired infections if they are to qualify for a registration certificate. But what is that standard? The Healthcare Commission in general has done a good job in driving improvements in this area, but we know that a number of NHS trusts have been found seriously wanting in their recent performance on HCAIs. In those cases, what action has the CQC insisted be taken, or what improvements has it insisted on seeing before agreeing to issue a registration certificate? Rather like a game at a fairground where everyone is a winner, are we in practice looking at a 100 per cent success rate in the NHS bodies up for registration? Are any conditional registrations being agreed?</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000015"></a>It is important to understand how strict and how stern the CQC is being with providers with a poor track record. We know from the Government&#146;s own figures that MRSA affected around 6,000 people in 2006-07 and C. difficile about 56,000. The numbers may be falling, but they are still very high. Indeed, we would all say that they are unacceptable. It would be helpful to hear from the Minister whether the CQC is simply focusing on the existence of systems within provider trusts, or are they also looking at the quality of those systems in terms of the results actually being achieved?</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC308"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column GC308</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000016"></a>The second question relates to an issue that is strictly outside the scope of the regulations but which bears closely on them. As I mentioned a moment ago, the registration process for independent sector healthcare providers is being tackled more gradually and the aim is to accomplish that by 2010, at which point those bodies would cease to be subject to regulation under the Care Standards Act 2000. What enforcement powers will the CQC have during that transition period in relation to independent sector healthcare providers and, for that matter, providers of adult social care? Legally speaking, is the CQC fully able to monitor and regulate those bodies during the next 12 months as tightly as we would wish it to do, and does it have the resources to do so?</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000017"></a>The CQC has said that it will not hesitate to use the range of enforcement powers at its disposal if it needs to do so. Can the Minister assure the Committee that if in the last resort a provider of healthcare has its registration removed and thereby loses its right to be a provider, safeguards will be in place to protect the quality of patient care during the transition to a new provider? Although the power to issue fines as a penalty for poor service and poor infection control is undoubtedly a strong deterrent, there is in practice a downside to such fines. When NHS bodies are called on to pay fines, they will need to divert money from elsewhere in their budget to do so. In certain circumstances, one could imagine money being diverted from frontline patient care, which is the very opposite of what patients deserve in a situation where, if anything, they need enhanced protection. Will the Minister comment on that and will the CQC bear in mind that, in some situations, the imposition of a fine would run counter to the interests of the NHS organisation and of patients?</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000018"></a>Finally, how often will the proposed register of persons providing services be updated and verified? Does the Minister agree that regular and thorough vetting of the list will be important?</p>

<p><a name="09030459000019"></a><b><a name="90304-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09030459000118"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for introducing the regulations and for the very helpful briefing that she and the relevant officials provided to us a couple of weeks ago. There is a degree of interest in this because these are the first of the regulations that will enable us to see just how the Health and Social Care Act 2008 will be implemented and how the CQC will assume responsibility for an area of work that all noble Lords would agree has been carried out extremely effectively by the predecessor bodies. Both the Healthcare Commission and CSCI have in the course of their work and by their reports driven up standards in this area.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000020"></a>I have many of the same questions as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, but I want to ask a few more. Can the noble Baroness define for us what is an offence? Is an offence the same thing as an incidence? Are different incidences of healthcare-acquired infection different offences? If they are, the potential penalties become of a different order. Potentially, they will become a large imposition on what in future will be a much broader range of much smaller providers. Although we tend to think of acute hospitals when we think about healthcare-associated infections, we should not forget that the infections that have been mentioned are prevalent in a  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC309"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column GC309</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>lot of social care settings and, in particular, residential homes. If a small-scale provider of residential care ultimately becomes subject in 2010 to the same fine regime as a large acute hospital, that will have a disproportionate effect.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000021"></a>That is the first thing. The second is that I, too, have been thinking about the fact that in 2010 the independent sector will come under this regime. Has the department continued to think on in that vein about what happens if NHS patients exercise their right to seek treatment abroad if they have not been able to receive treatment in the United Kingdom? How do these orders relate to that? Looking to the future, what happens if individual budgets and direct payments bring in a whole tranche of small-scale healthcare providers? Who will regulate them?</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000022"></a>This is an interesting order, and I will be interested in the Minister&#146;s response. It is a fair reflection of the legislation that this House passed last year.</p>
<h5><a name="09030459000107"></a>4 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09030459000023"></a><b><a name="90304-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09030459000119"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I shall tackle the different points raised by the noble Earl and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. I thank both noble Lords, who have been helpful in the discussions we have had, which I, too, found very useful.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000024"></a>The noble Earl raised the issue of the threshold. The regulations are underpinned by the revised code of practice for the NHS, which I referred to in my speech, on the control of healthcare-associated infections and the related guidance, which was published alongside the draft regulations under the powers given to the Secretary of State by Section 21 of the 2008 Act. This new code sets out the criteria that the Care Quality Commission will use to check that the NHS organisations are complying with the requirements on the prevention and control of HCAIs. As the noble Earl will appreciate, we take that issue seriously. We are not complacent; we are pleased that the numbers of MRSA and C. difficile cases are down, but I agree that the situation will not be satisfactory until they have all gone.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000025"></a>The noble Earl raised the issue of how the CQC will act in assessing providers&#146; compliance and make decisions. It is doing so right now; it is making decisions on whether it will attach conditions to registration. I imagine that the noble Baroness, Lady Young, has her people hard at work on that right this minute.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000026"></a>On the issue of safeguarding, the enforcement powers will remain those under the Care Standards Act until providers are transferred to the new registration system under the 2008 Act. On the powers to close down healthcare facilities and wards, that is one of the range of interventional powers. The commission will need to consider the risk to patients and others using services of stopping a service against leaving a substandard service open, and it can do that only by liaising with the relevant PCTs and authorities. That is what we would expect it to do.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000027"></a>As I recall, the issue of what would happen to the fines was raised several times during the passage of the Bill. Where fines and penalties are incurred by NHS bodies as a result of a breach of safety requirements, we are working with HM Treasury to find a sensible way of returning the money collected to the local area where it can be reinvested into improving services.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC310"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column GC310</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000028"></a>The noble Earl asked how often the register will be updated. The Act allows for it to be live and to be done on an ongoing basis. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, asked about an offence being a breach of the registration requirements. Of course, issuing a penalty notice is only one of the CQC&#146;s enforcement powers, so it would be for the CQC to choose the most appropriate action in any given situation. As for the independent sector coming under this in 2010 and what will happen if people decide to seek treatment abroad, the CQC&#146;s remit applies only to care in England.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000029"></a>I hope that I have covered all the points raised by noble Lords, but I shall look at what they have said and write to them if I need to provide a more satisfactory or full answer. I thank noble Lords for their comments on these regulations.</p>

<p><a name="09030459000031"></a>That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the European Parliamentary Elections (Franchise of Relevant Citizens of the Union) (Amendment) Regulations 2009.</p>

<p><a name="09030459000032"></a><I>Relevant Document: </I><I>5th</I><I> Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments</I><I>.</I></p>

<p><a name="09030459000033"></a><b><a name="90304-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09030459000121"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> I shall refer to the regulations as the 2009 franchise regulations. They relate wholly to the European parliamentary elections to be held in the United Kingdom on the 4 June this year and form an important part of the Government&#146;s preparations for these elections. There was no requirement for us to consult with the Electoral Commission on this statutory instrument but we did so. It was content with the necessary changes and had no substantial comments to make.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000034"></a>These regulations amend the European Parliamentary Elections (Franchise of Relevant Citizens of the Union) Regulations 2001, which provide for the registration of relevant citizens of the EU who are resident in the United Kingdom as European parliamentary electors.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000035"></a>The 2001 franchise regulations gave effect to the requirements of a European Council directive concerning the arrangements in respect of the right to vote in elections to the European Parliament for citizens of the Union living in a member state of which they  are not nationals. These regulations amend the 2001 regulations to incorporate recent changes that have been made to the system of registration of  parliamentary and local government electors following the implementation of provisions inserted into the Representation of the People Act 1983 by the Electoral Administration Act 2006. The amendments ensure consistency between the registration systems for  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC311"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column GC311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>parliamentary and local government elections and European parliamentary elections, and ensure that relevant citizens of the Union are afforded the same protections as other voters.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000036"></a>In summary, the amendments will apply new provisions on late registration, new provisions on anonymous registration in England, Wales and Scotland, and changes to the procedure for determining applications for and objections to registrations.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000037"></a>First, as noble Lords will recall, late registration came into force on 1 January 2007 and allows eligible electors to register up to 11 days before a poll, whereas previously the period was between six and eight weeks. The Government want this power extended to include relevant citizens of the Union who vote at European parliamentary elections so that registration officers apply late registration rules consistently in respect of all elections, particularly as they are being combined on 4 June.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000038"></a>Secondly, anonymous registration came into force on 1 June 2007 and allows for eligible persons to register to vote without their names and addresses appearing on the electoral register. Its aim is to protect vulnerable people in society whose safety may be at risk if their details were to be made public. The amendment we are bringing forward in this statutory instrument will allow relevant citizens of the Union who apply to register in the European parliamentary elections to apply to register under an anonymous entry. Noble Lords may be pleased to hear that where relevant citizens of the Union already have an anonymous entry on the local government electoral register, the amendment will automatically grant that person an anonymous entry for the European parliamentary elections. In fact, the use of anonymous entries on the register has been very low indeed, involving some 500 out of about 40 million voters so far. There is, indeed, a hard test to get on to that list.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000039"></a>Thirdly, on determinations and objections, a number of changes have been made to the procedure for registration officers to determine applications and objections to applications. For example, objections to a person&#146;s registration can now be made both before and after that person&#146;s registration. The amendments to the 2001 franchise regulations will ensure consistency so that, as far as possible, the same procedures apply to determinations in relation to registration by relevant citizens of the Union as for registration for parliamentary and local elections.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000040"></a>There is a minor amendment to Regulation 8 of the 2001 regulations so that upon registering a relevant citizen of the Union in the European parliamentary electoral register, the registration officer himself or herself will no longer be required to send a copy of the application and declaration to the representative of the state in respect of which the applicant is a national. Instead, the registration officer will have to send only the information contained within the application and declaration. This complies with the EU directive and removes a potential burden for administrators.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000041"></a>I am sorry that I have gone through the details but, in their minor way, these are important regulations. The point behind them is to ensure the successful  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC312"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column GC312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>running and proper conduct of the European parliamentary elections. I commend this draft statutory instrument to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09030459000042"></a><b><a name="90304-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09030459000122"></a>Lord Henley:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing these regulations and for speaking to the other two orders. I offer him my commiserations for his voice, which sounds as though it is beginning to go. I do not know whether he needs a rest. Perhaps the whole Government need a rest. Looking at the picture of Daniel in Babylon, one can see the writing on the wall. Possibly that is not a very good joke, but there it is. I offer my commiserations to the noble Lord for his health and I hope that his voice will get better in due course.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000043"></a>As my noble friend Mrs Laing made clear in the Commons, we support these regulations in principle. We all want to do what we can to improve the electoral system and to ensure the absolute integrity of the ballot box. All three parties must admit that we have had problems at the ballot box over the past few years and, recalling the newspaper reports that we have read about that, all three parties have suffered from a number of colleagues who treated matters in a manner that they should not have done. We hope that the appropriate ones have all been caught and dealt with by the courts in due course. It is very important that we get this right.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000044"></a>While on the subject, perhaps I may refer to individual voter registration. Although this goes wide of the regulations, the issue was raised by the Government towards the end of the Political Parties and Elections Bill in the Commons last night. Obviously that Bill will come to us in a couple of weeks&#146; time&#151;I forget on which day Second Reading will take place&#151;and it would therefore be useful if the Minister could expand on what the Government said last night about what they are proposing to do about individual voter registration. I welcome the fact that they say they can bring it forward but&#151;this is where I suspect that both we and the Liberal Democrat Party will feel slightly suspicious&#151;they have implied that they cannot bring it through until something like 2015 or 2016. One suspects that the Government could bring it forward a bit quicker if they really wanted to. We wait to hear what the Minister can say about that. I hope he will give an assurance that they can bring it forward earlier. If they cannot, I have a sneaking suspicion that when the Political Parties and Elections Bill goes through this House, my party and one or two others might want to bring forward some amendments that might hasten the introduction of individual data registration. We will listen very carefully to what the Minister has to say.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000045"></a>My second point concerns data sharing. As the noble Lord will know, my honourable friend Mrs Laing raised the question of data sharing again when these regulations went through the other place. She is very concerned about that subject and has raised it on a number of occasions. Mr Wills, speaking for the Government, said in response to her:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030459000103"></a>&#147;On many occasions, I have heard the hon. Lady refer to the perils of data sharing&#151;she has done so again today&#151;but I have never heard her explain the advantages and benefits that it brings&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>Commons, Third Delegated Legislation Committee, 25/2/09; col. 12.]</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC313"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column GC313</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09030459000101"></a>Oh dear. If the Government cannot see what the potential problems of data sharing within government are, they have a great deal to learn. We have problems with data sharing in these orders&#151;they crop up again and again in a number of measures&#151;and if the Government cannot see what the problem is, they will have to pull their socks up and move in some way. I await the Minister&#146;s response, particularly on individual data registration.</p>
<h5><a name="09030459000109"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09030459000046"></a><b><a name="90304-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09030459000123"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> Before I speak to these regulations, I should indicate a non-pecuniary interest: I have sat on an informal advisory committee of Peers and MPs at the Electoral Commission. Although I do not purport to represent the views of the commission, I have been involved in some of the discussions on some of the issues with which the Committee is concerned this afternoon. I, too, look forward with considerable interest to what the Minister will be able to tell us about individual registration. The Electoral Commission has been very forthright about this issue&#151;it has not always been as forthright on others.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000047"></a>The Minister may recall that earlier in this Session I raised this issue on the Floor of the House. There is clearly a considerable loophole in the present law on registration in that we still have household registration which is, I fear, open to a great deal of sometimes inadvertent, but sometimes carefully planned, corruption. That is extremely unfortunate because it gives a bad impression of what is otherwise a very good system, of which we should be very proud.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000048"></a>There was, as the noble Lord said, some reference to this issue in the other place earlier this week. I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to spell out exactly what is intended. It would be very helpful, in preparation for the Political Parties and Elections Bill coming to this House, if we had a clear idea of what was intended. If, as I read, the timescale is as leisurely as the noble Lord has just indicated, that is extremely unfortunate. After all, this issue has been around a long time; there must have been plenty of time to think through the practical implications. There is a false dilemma between trying to make sure that the register is as comprehensive as possible and discouraging illegal registration. The integrity of the register must surely be far more important than its simple quantity. Simply because a register has a lot of people on it does not necessarily mean that it is very effective or legitimate. I hope that the Minister will say something about that.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000049"></a>On the regulations, I believe that the Government are absolutely right to try to achieve greater consistency while at the same time ensuring that that consistency is on as simple a basis as possible. The integrity of the register relies on relative simplicity. If it gets extraordinarily complicated, we have a problem. In that respect it is right that we should go for individual registration, but in so doing we should not try to build in too much complexity because that will undermine the effective registration of our fellow citizens and therefore the integrity of the register.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000050"></a>In that regard, will the Minister say a little more about the issue of anonymous listing? I notice that on 25 February in the Third Delegated Legislation Committee in the other place my honourable friend Mr Mark  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC314"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column GC314</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Oaten raised the issue of just how many people are currently applying for anonymous registration. The Minister has been kind enough to tell us that he thinks it is about 500.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000051"></a>I have a supplementary question. Five hundred is a small number, which implies to me that perhaps the process is too rigorous. I can think of a lot of people who legitimately should be asking for anonymous listing. Maybe it is a problem of publication or there is not sufficient publicity about the way that this could happen, but the regulations before us, and the existing regime for those who are already eligible for anonymous listing, is a tortuous process. It is quite discouraging to those who may have a legitimate request to be listed anonymously on the register. I hope that the Minister may be able to tell us whether he thinks that the present regime is over-rigorous and is therefore discouraging people who have a legitimate reason for wanting this protection of their personal circumstances.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000052"></a>Apart from those quick questions, I do not have any other concerns. My noble friends in this House feel, as do my honourable friends in the other place, that this is a useful bit of tidying up, and we thank the Minister for bringing it forward.</p>

<p><a name="09030459000053"></a><b><a name="90304-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09030459000124"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I thank both noble Lords for their support for the regulations. I will be moving the second and third orders in due course, and I have been advised that I have to speak to both of them. That will happen in a minute or two.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000054"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, asked about anonymous registration. We think that the system is working fairly well and that people are not being discouraged. It is important that there is quite a high hurdle to get over. The order itself means that it does not have to be a police chief constable but a police superintendent, so it could be done in the local police station if anonymity is necessary. The figures were 310 on 1 December 2007 and 551 on 1 December 2008. I am grateful for the noble Lord&#146;s support for this new development in the field of registration. He is right that we want to keep registration as simple as possible.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000055"></a>On the broader question of individual representation, I had a feeling that my right honourable friend&#146;s intervention in the final stages of the Political Parties and Elections Bill in another place on Monday night might attract some comment today; if I had not anticipated that, I should have done. If noble Lords will forgive me, I do not think we should indulge in a long session on that; we will have plenty of time to talk about it. I trust that both noble Lords, given their parties&#146; positions, welcome what was clearly an important Statement by the relevant Minister about this important matter.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000056"></a>At Report in another place my right honourable friend set out a clear timetable for moving towards individual electoral registration. That will initially involve a voluntary scheme running alongside the household scheme from 2010 to 2015. Before and during that period, major steps will be taken to continue to build on the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the electoral register to ensure that the public and the system are ready for the change. These measures will involve some amendments to the Bill in Committee in this House. I promise both noble Lords that we will share  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC315"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column GC315</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with them as quickly as we can the proposals we intend to put in the Bill regarding these matters, and I hope that we can discuss them before the Bill goes into Committee. The draft clauses may not be ready for a little while so I invite both noble Lords to be patient, but, as I say, we will certainly have a chance to talk about them before we go into Committee. I hope that the two noble Lords present today will be dealing with the Bill at the appropriate time.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000057"></a>I think that I expected a little more enthusiasm for the important move the Government have made this week. That is all I intend to say about individual registration, which has precisely nothing to do with the important statutory instrument we are debating today.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000058"></a>On data sharing, perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Henley, that once again it was a good try, but I do not think this is an issue that affects us today. We have introduced safeguards in the Political Parties and Elections Bill to ensure that the Information Commissioner is consulted before any orders are made to enable data matching to improve the electoral register. The proposals for data matching largely mirror the scheme already in place in Northern Ireland. The noble Lord&#146;s honourable friend in another place, Mrs Laing, brought up this issue around the Representation of the People (Amendment) Regulations 2009 which we will come to in a moment, but all I will say is that they make provision for the Statistics Board to receive the register and do not change substantively the provisions on data sharing. It is a consequential change following the transfer of the statistical functions of the Office for National Statistics to the Statistics Board.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000059"></a>We have had an enjoyable ride around the issues today.</p>

<p><a name="09030459000063"></a>This statutory instrument has been subject to consultation with the Electoral Commission. The commission has advised us that it supports all of these

What I have to say may be part of an answer to what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, in the previous debate.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000064"></a>These regulations amend the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001 and the Representation of the People (Scotland) Regulations 2001. In summary, they will make minor yet important changes in respect of applications for anonymous entries in the electoral register; make modifications to provisions relating to the registration of overseas Peers for European parliamentary elections, primarily to ensure consistency with other changes in electoral legislation; and thirdly, as I mentioned earlier, make provision for a free copy of the electoral register to be supplied to the Statistics Board, which now carries out the statistical functions of the Office for National Statistics.</p>
<h5><a name="09030459000111"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000065"></a>As mentioned earlier, the anonymous registration of electors came into force nearly two years ago. Applications for anonymous registration have to be accompanied by evidence in the form of, first, an attestation by a qualifying officer confirming that the safety of the applicant or another person in the applicant&#146;s household would be at risk if the register contained the applicant&#146;s name or address; or, secondly, that there is a relevant court order or injunction as listed in the regulations.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000066"></a>The amendments in these regulations make changes in respect of who constitutes a qualifying officer and the types of court orders and injunctions that may be used in evidence to support an application. First, in respect of qualifying officers, we are making changes to the level of police officer able to attest applications. At the moment, only a chief officer or chief constable can do so, which means that all applications presented at a police station have to be transmitted to headquarters for signing. This statutory instrument allows police officers of the rank of superintendent and above to attest applications. This means that applicants will, in most circumstances, be able to have the attestation undertaken at their local police station.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000067"></a>Secondly, the statutory instrument makes minor amendments to provide that an attestation signed by any director of adult social services or truant services in England or the equivalent in Wales can be submitted in support of an application in either England or Wales. The amendments also include any chief social work officer in Scotland within the meaning of qualifying officer. Therefore, in these respects, the amendments make the 2001 England and Wales regulations consistent with the current 2001 Scotland regulations.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000068"></a>This statutory instrument also amends the 2001 England and Wales and 2001 Scotland regulations to include within the meaning of qualifying officer any director of social services of a Northern Ireland health and social services board, and any executive director of social work of a Northern Ireland health and social services trust, as these office holders were previously not included.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000069"></a>Finally, the draft SI amends the list of court orders and injunctions that may be presented as evidence in support of an application for anonymous registration to include those made under relevant Northern Ireland legislation. This will ensure that no matter where a specified order or injunction is granted in the UK, it can be submitted in support of an application for anonymous registration.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000070"></a>Turning to other amendments within the Representation of the People regulations, the Representation of the People Act 1985 enables Peers who are resident overseas to vote at European parliamentary elections. The current regulations apply with modifications to certain legislative provisions for the purpose of registration of this category of elector. There are not many of them. As part of our preparation work for the European parliamentary elections this year, we identified the need to update these regulations, primarily to reflect recent changes to the system of registration for parliamentary and local government electors. In particular, the effect of an amendment to the Representation of the People Act 1985 made by the Electoral Administration Act 2006 is that an oversees Peer who has an anonymous entry in the register of local government elections will not be able to satisfy the conditions of entitlement to vote at European parliamentary elections. Consistent with this, the draft SI amends the current regulations to reflect that anonymous registration does not apply to overseas Peers for the purpose of European parliamentary elections.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000071"></a>Minor amendments are also made to ensure that the legislative framework for the registration of overseas Peers is workable and internally consistent. We understand that the number of Peers likely to be affected by these amendments is very small. The ONS registration figures for 2008 reveal that only four Peers were registered as European parliamentary overseas electors. I do not know whether any of those have applied to be anonymous on the register but they could only have been so since 1 June 2007. Their entitlement to vote was conditional on their having been on a register in the United Kingdom in the course of the past 15 years, so I think that four probably comes down to a much smaller number.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000072"></a>Finally, as regards the Office for National Statistics, we are making a minor amendment to the 2001 England and Wales regulations and the 2001 Scotland regulations to provide for a free copy of the electoral register to be supplied to the Statistics Board. The regulations currently provide for a free copy of the register to be supplied to the Office for National Statistics. However, as the office&#146;s statistical functions are now carried out by the Statistics Board, it is appropriate that the board should receive the register instead.</p>

<p><a name="09030459000073"></a>I thank noble Lords for allowing me the time to go into perhaps a little too much detail on this statutory instrument, but it is important that these matters are on the record. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Henley, for the very kind remarks he made about my voice in the earlier debate. However, I warn him not to be too overconfident or to think that my voice, odd though it may sound at the moment, presages anything other than triumph whenever the general election comes.</p>

That is why I made my remarks about data sharing, which are possibly more appropriate to these regulations than to the preceding ones. I have nothing further to add other than that I am interested in his estimates of the number of Peers who might be affected by this measure. I think he said originally that four Peers might be affected, and then suggested that the figure was coming down to a much smaller one. I remember that a Secretary of State in the Department for Education for whom I worked said that she thought three exam boards were too many and that one was too few. However, she was not prepared to speculate on what she considered was the right figure. I wonder whether the noble Lord will speculate on what the appropriate figure&#151;if it is much smaller than four&#151;is likely to be. He probably cannot answer that question and I do not particularly expect one. However, if he can, I will listen to it with interest.</p>

<p><a name="09030459000075"></a><b><a name="90304-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09030459000128"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> I will speak briefly as I hope to preserve the Minister&#146;s voice for the final order, which I regard as rather more important. I do not think this House could ever be accused of not looking after the interests of minorities. If we are seeking to preserve the interests of four Peers who are resident in the European Union for this electoral purpose, we really are looking at the minority of minorities. Unless, of course, the Minister anticipates a large flow of Peers disappearing from this House and this country for economic or legislative reasons. If we are seeking to preserve the rights of one Peer, who presumably may have triggered this whole exercise by seeking to preserve the anonymity of his or her registration, that seems to me a great accolade that we should celebrate in this Parliament; namely, that we are prepared to look after the interests of one Peer. If that is the case, perhaps the Minister may like to comment on it. Having made that point, this is obviously just a simple tidying-up operation and I hope that we will not have to ask the Minister to use his voice at great length to explain the origin of this change.</p>

I really do not want to go into the details. I am afraid that we are not preserving the right of any Peer; to make the law consistent we are saying that a Peer who found himself in the extremely unlikely position of having been on the anonymous list for local elections from 1 June 2007 would not have the right to vote in European parliamentary elections. The noble Lord tempts me to give a figure of less than four. I will: nought.</p>

<p><a name="09030459000079"></a><b><a name="90304-gc0002.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09030459000131"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> The purpose of this draft  order is to implement without modification the recommendations of the Boundary Commission for England to make alterations to the boundaries between the parliamentary constituencies of Daventry and South Northamptonshire in Northamptonshire; and Somerton and Frome, and Wells in Somerset. I hope that the Committee will consider that this is an uncontroversial draft order, but I have a feeling that my hope may not be realised completely.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000080"></a>The Boundary Commission for England has observed its customary rigorous and non-partisan procedures in producing its report, including wide consultation. Although there has been some opposition to the proposals in Somerset, everyone concerned has had an opportunity to put their arguments, which have, I understand, been carefully considered by the commission.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000081"></a>I appreciate that there may be some interest from those affected&#151;the electors concerned as well as Members of this Committee and of the other place who represent these areas. However, I hope we can all agree that the commission has, as usual, done its work very thoroughly and that we can approve this draft order.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000082"></a>I shall provide some background to the commission&#146;s report and the order. Thanks are due to the Boundary Commission for England and its secretariat for its assiduous work in carrying out this review. As always, it has carried out its duties thoroughly and conscientiously. I take this opportunity to thank the deputy chair of the commission at the time, the honourable Mr Justice Sullivan, for overseeing this work. He is no longer the deputy chair, having been elevated to the Court of Appeal, so he is now Lord Justice Sullivan. I am grateful, as I am sure are all Members, for his work with the commission over many years.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000083"></a>The Boundary Commission is a body appointed by statute to review parliamentary constituency boundaries in England. As well as carrying out regular reviews on all parliamentary constituencies approximately every 10 years or so, if it thinks it necessary between those reviews, the commission can carry out interim reviews of boundaries in a particular area. These might be necessary as a result of other changes, for instance to local authority boundaries or perhaps if there are major population changes in an area. The report and the draft order are the result of local authority boundary changes.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000084"></a>The previous regular periodical review in England was completed by the commission in October 2006. Its report was implemented without modification in the Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 2007, which sets out the parliamentary constituencies into which England is divided. The parliamentary constituencies are described by reference to local government areas as they existed on 12 April 2005 and, of course, the new parliamentary constituencies will come into effect at the next general election.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000085"></a>After the commission&#146;s report was submitted, the Electoral Commission made orders in 2006 and 2007 which altered the local government ward boundaries in the district of South Northamptonshire and in the district of Mendip in Somerset. Because those orders came into effect some months after the commission  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC320"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column GC320</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>had submitted its previous periodical report to the Secretary of State, the boundary changes were not reflected in the 2007 order. As a result, the boundaries between the parliamentary constituencies of Daventry and South Northamptonshire, and those between Somerton and Frome, and Wells do not follow the new local authority ward boundaries.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90304-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="90304-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000086"></a>The Boundary Commission for England, therefore, considered whether it should carry out another interim review of the relevant areas and other areas in a similar situation. It concluded that it should carry out a review, but decided to postpone its reviews of the other areas because of local government reorganisations. No doubt the commission will return to those areas in due course.</p>
<h5><a name="09030459000113"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90304-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000087"></a>The commission began the process in the usual way, announcing the commencement of the review in June 2007, collecting data and considering the evidence. It produced provisional recommendations in July 2007, published them widely and invited representations from interested parties. It made the recommendations available for inspection locally and on its website. The provisional recommendations propose that only the minimum changes necessary should be made to bring the boundaries between the parliamentary constituencies of Daventry and South Northamptonshire and those of Somerton and Frome, and Wells back into alignment with the new local authority ward boundaries. That will involve a relatively small change on the map and relatively few electors.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000088"></a>Sixteen written representations were received in respect of proposals for the Northamptonshire constituencies, of which 13 were objections; and five in respect of the Somerset constituencies, of which four were objections. The commission therefore decided to hold local public inquiries in both areas to allow those making representations, and others, an opportunity to make their case in person.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000089"></a>As a result of those public inquiries, the commission made revised proposals in both areas. Further written representations were received in respect of both areas, but after considering those and all the other evidence, I understand that the commission decided to make no further changes to its proposals. It made its report to the Secretary of State on 25 July 2008. The Secretary of State is required by statute to lay the commission's report before Parliament, along with the draft order implementing the recommendations,</p>
<ul><a name="09030459000104"></a>&#147;as soon as may be&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09030459000102"></a>after receiving the report. After arranging for publication of the report and preparing to seek legal approval  of the instrument implementing the report's recommendations, the report and the draft order were laid in January this year.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000090"></a>The draft order is uncomplicated and, as I said, includes without modification the recommendations contained in the Boundary Commission&#146;s report by amending the 2007 order to realign the parliamentary constituency boundaries with the altered ward boundaries. That means that the parliamentary constituencies will reflect the new local authority ward boundaries introduced in the Electoral Commission orders made in 2006  and 2007.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000091"></a>If the House should see fit to approve the draft order and those in the other place do the same, it will be submitted in the normal way to the Privy Council for approval before it comes into force. I remind the Committee that should the draft order be approved, it will have no practical effect until the next general parliamentary election. Any parliamentary by-elections that may occur in the areas affected before then will of course take place on the existing boundaries.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000092"></a>I trust that that explains in sufficient depth what the order is about and why the draft order should be approved.</p>

<p><a name="09030459000093"></a><b><a name="90304-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09030459000132"></a>Lord Henley:</b> I was not going to speak to the orders, but I think I should, purely to declare a very obscure interest. I do not know whether it is declarable or not. With regard to the first two constituencies concerned, Daventry and South Northamptonshire, the peerage under which I sit in this House is different from the one under which I call myself. I sit under a United Kingdom peerage, which is Lord Henley of Watford in the county of Northamptonshire. I think that the Watford in the county of Northamptonshire is in one of the wards mentioned in the district of Daventry. Therefore, I ought to declare my interest there. Other than that, I have nothing to say.</p>

<p><a name="09030459000094"></a><b><a name="90304-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09030459000133"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> I certainly do not have such a distinguished interest as the noble Lord, Lord Henley, but I have an interest in knowing quite a bit about a part of the country to which the order refers: Somerset, which contains both the Somerton and Frome and the Wells constituencies. Having, I confess, been fully briefed only today, I am alarmed to the extent that I believe that the Boundary Commission for England may have misdirected itself with regard to the changes to those two constituency boundaries. I must substantiate that by trying to explain why I have expressed that very serious concern.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000095"></a>As I understand it, a substantial review with considerable and comprehensive consultation was undertaken in the constituencies concerned. But, as has been implied by the Minister, before it was completed and the process brought to fruition, changes were made to the district council ward boundaries. It was at that point that the commission decided that it should review the proposals that it had already consulted upon. I understand that no complaint had been made in either constituency by either of the Members, who are representatives of the two opposition parties, about the earlier process of consultation. The concern arose about the then change in the recommendations that resulted from the changes made to the Mendip district wards. I emphasise that it was simply the district wards that were changed, not the county wards, and I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Henley, who knows a lot about county politics, will agree that county wards are a great deal more significant when it comes to the identification of communities and the rural areas that have a relationship with local towns. It is true that although the changes are not that dramatic, as a result of the recommended redistribution, some very interesting divisions have arisen in the rural areas that form part of the catchment areas, if you like, of some of the small towns of Somerset.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC322"></a><b>4 Mar 2009 : Column GC322</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90304-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000096"></a>I think that we are owed a better explanation of why the Boundary Commission exercise decided to review proposals that had already attracted quite a lot of public support. The Minister has said that only five representations were made, but four of those were in opposition to the changes. It is clearly the case, as I know from contacts in Somerset, that many people thought that the original proposals would go through and were not aware of the second phase of consultation. Even more substantially in this building, I also understand that neither of the constituency Members of Parliament&#151;Conservative and Liberal Democrat&#151;feels that the consultation for the second stage of this exercise was anything like as adequate as for the first.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000097"></a>The Minister may now be able to explain why this particular order has come to this House first. That is curious since it deals with parliamentary constituencies, which are of very considerable interest to Members of the other place. Indeed, I do not think that hitherto there has been a formal occasion for Members of the other place to express anxieties on this score.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000098"></a>Having appeared before the Boundary Commission in the past, I have to say that its inquiries are usually meticulous. Up to this point, I have not heard of another example where it has gone back and, as it were, started the exercise again, having been triggered by a simple change to second-tier ward boundaries. That seems to be unusual as well. I find the whole process very extraordinary and I hope that the Minister will take note that I and my noble friends, when the report is made to the House, will seek the withdrawal of this order and a review. We do not believe that it meets the normal criteria that the Boundary Commission follows for England. Although it has a very good reputation, I fear that on this occasion, it has not met the expectations we all have of it.</p>

<p><a name="09030459000099"></a><b><a name="90304-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09030459000134"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I thank both noble Lords for their contributions. I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Henley, need worry too much about a conflict of interest; indeed, I can reassure him on that.</p>

<a name="90304-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030459000100"></a>I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, for setting out so clearly his objections to part of the order. However, the Government&#146;s view is that this is very much a matter for the Boundary Commission itself. Having considered it and having also held a public inquiry, when I understand a minor change was made, the commission came to a view, and it is that view which makes up this draft order. As the noble Lord generously conceded, the commission went through its normal procedures and the inquiries were conducted properly. The recommendations following the commission&#146;s inquiries were accepted and we do not see it as our role in government to second-guess on matters of this kind. If we were to do so, it would represent a fairly dangerous precedent in terms of government power. The noble Lord will understand why I say that. I regret that he will take this matter further, but he is of course entitled to do so.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09030468000004"></a>I am pleased to announce that the Ministry of Defence has signed a five-year contract with BAE Systems, worth around &#163;450 million, for the provision of an availability support service to the Typhoon fleet of aircraft.</p>

<a name="09030468000017"></a><b><a name="90304-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="09030468000045"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (Lord Young of Norwood Green):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills (John Denham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09030468000018"></a>In 1997 there was no capital budget for further education (FE) colleges and the National Audit Office (NAO) described FE college buildings as &#147;ageing and their quality and fitness for purpose was often unsatisfactory, affecting the reputation of the sector&#148;.</p>

<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09030468000019"></a>Between 1997-98 and 2006-07, more than &#163;2 billion has been invested in modernising FE facilities. My department will spend another &#163;2.3 billion in the current spending review period. We have brought forward &#163;220 million of this funding, &#163;110 million from 2009-10 to 2008-09 and a further &#163;110 million from 2010-11 to 2009-10, as part of our response to boost the economy. Nearly 700 projects in 330 colleges throughout England have been agreed, and 253 schemes are under way or fully approved. Only 42 colleges have yet to receive any investment. Last summer the NAO reported the programme as making good progress with the renewal and modernisation of the FE estate, with the great majority of projects coming in on budget and delivering great improvement for learners.</p>

<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09030468000020"></a>I previously informed the House that the demand for funding by colleges has risen. The size of projects and the scale of government funding required have increased. In December, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), which administers the programme, decided to defer further approvals of projects in principle and in detail while assessing the programme overall. As I said in the House on 3 February, this decision did not affect projects that have already received agreement in detail and are in progress and we anticipate spending the full &#163;2.3 billion allocated in this spending review period.</p>

<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09030468000021"></a>Today the council met to discuss the results of its assessment of the programme. It has decided to give detailed approval to eight schemes at colleges in Stoke-on-Trent, Coulsdon (Surrey), West Kent, Liverpool, Solihull, Northampton and two in Bolton.</p>

<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09030468000022"></a>These colleges had all been recommended for approval by the national capital committee of the council and decisions to approve their applications in detail had been deferred from the December meeting.</p>

<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09030468000023"></a>The total cost of these schemes is nearly &#163;400 million. The council will provide more than &#163;300 million in government funding over the next five years. Following the council&#146;s decision today, the LSC will be working with the colleges involved on the phasing and funding requirements of these projects and how they are now taken forward. Their benefits will be felt by students and their local communities for years to come.</p>

<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09030468000024"></a>However, the LSC has now completed its assessment of other colleges seeking approval in principle or detail. I am informed that the council has already given 79 colleges the first stage of approval in principle. Government funding of nearly &#163;2.7 billion would be

A further 65 colleges have submitted bids to the national LSC for approval in principle with an assumed funding contribution from government of a further &#163;3 billion.</p>

<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09030468000025"></a>As a consequence, there are many more schemes currently in preparation than can be funded in this spending round. For that reason, I agreed with the council that it would appoint an independent reviewer, Sir Andrew Foster, to find out how this situation arose and what lessons must be learnt for the future. It is clear that even at current record levels of funding not all schemes can be implemented on the timescales originally envisaged. I have therefore asked the council to consult with the Association of Colleges and the FE sector to advise me on ways of prioritising schemes in the future programme.  </p>

<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="09030468000026"></a>I have asked the council to keep interested members informed on the progress and status of schemes in their area.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09030468000028"></a>The Supreme Allied Commander Europe has decided that the specific capability, currently provided by the UK to the NATO force in Kosovo, is no longer required.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09030468000029"></a>Our drawdown reflects the changed circumstances in Kosovo, in particular the improved security situation. The key milestones in Kosovo&#146;s independence have passed without major incident and the security situation in Kosovo is generally calm. The EU rule of law mission has recently rolled out across Kosovo. Against this backdrop, and with over 14,000 personnel still in theatre, NATO remains well placed to deal with any potential security incidents.</p>

<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09030468000034"></a>I have placed in the Library of the House today a copy of the Service Complaints Commissioner&#146;s first annual report on the fairness, effectiveness and efficiency of the service complaints system. </p>

<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09030468000035"></a>The Government committed to the establishment of a Service Complaints Commissioner in their response to the Deepcut review, which was published in June 2006. Provisions had already been proposed in the Armed Forces Bill then under consideration for an independent external reviewer who would examine the fairness and effectiveness of the service complaints system and report annually to Ministers. However, in light of the Deepcut review, the reviewer was given a wider role in relation to allegations of bullying, harassment and other improper behaviour. Recommendations made by the HCDC in its duty of care report 2004-05 also helped to shape the role of the commissioner and the complaints process.</p>

<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09030468000036"></a>The role of the commissioner is to provide scrutiny and assurance that the complaints process is working effectively and that lessons learnt are being implemented. The commissioner offers an independent ear for the concerns of service personnel and their families and can pursue their proper consideration by the chain of command. The commissioner&#146;s work will help us to maintain a complaints system that is fair and effective and where necessary improve it. I am confident that the commissioner provides the optimum arrangement for both service personnel and the chain of command responsible for their welfare and discipline.</p>

<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09030468000037"></a>I and the service chiefs are committed to the role of the commissioner and welcome this first annual report. We are committed to continuously improving the service complaints process and take the commissioner&#146;s recommendations very seriously. I am pleased that the report states that the new complaints system is well designed and is working; it also makes a number of criticisms of current procedures, which we will need to consider carefully. I will provide a formal response to the commissioner once we have had time to look at the report in detail.</p>

<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09030468000039"></a>Sunday 8 March marks International Women's Day. This year the theme chosen for this event is women and the global economic downturn. To mark it, the Government are publishing today:</p>
a booklet specially produced for women&#151;<I>Real </I><I>Help Now </I><I>for </I><I>W</I><I>omen</I><I>&#151;</I>which sets out the wide range of practical support available to women, including childcare, help with family finances, developing skills and finding a job; anda short fact-sheet summarising the key findings of a report on quantitative and qualitative opinion polling work that my department carried out last month on women&#146;s attitude to the economic downturn. The results show clearly that women have more, and wider-ranging, concerns than men about nearly every issue raised.
<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="09030468000040"></a>I am placing copies of both these publications in the Vote Office. I have also placed copies of them; together with the main opinion polling report, in the Libraries of both Houses. Copies will also be available on the Government Equalities Office website&#151;<a href="http://www.equalities.gov.uk">www.equalities.gov.uk</a>. They are intended to inform a number of events this week to mark International Women&#146;s Day, during which we will discuss the concerns that women have about the effect of the downturn on them and their families and the action that we are taking to provide real help now as well as real hope for the future. In particular:</p>
later today, we will be meeting with leading businesswomen and third sector organisations; and tomorrow, there will be a full day&#146;s debate in this House on the theme of supporting women and families through the downturn and building a strong and fair economy for the future; a similar debate will also be held in the House of Lords on Thursday 12 March.
<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09030468000041"></a>We are discussing with our international partners how we can best work together this week and next in New York as part of the Commission on the Status of Women. In Europe, the UK is co-chairing a working group of the European Commission Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men, and will draft an opinion on gender perspectives on the response to the economic and financial crisis.</p>

<a name="90304-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09030468000042"></a>These events and debates take place in the context of the national and international efforts to address the global financial crisis. The road to the London summit points to the importance of &#147;ensuring that the UK workforce has the skills it will need to take advantage of the opportunities of an increasingly globalised world, through the education system and lifelong learning including support for part-time and flexible work for men and women&#148;.</p>

The grant letter also specified an overall apprenticeship completion success rate target for 2008-09 of 65 per cent, subject to factoring in the effects of the current economic downturn. In 2007-08 113,000 people completed an apprenticeship in England and completion rates reached an all time high of 64 per cent. The 2007-08 completion rate for apprentices with learning difficulties and/or disabilities was 60 per cent. We will continue to work to improve access to and successful completion of apprenticeships and, going forward, will expect apprenticeship completion rates for people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities to be no lower than for non-disabled learners.</p>

Around 900,000 households rely on heating oil as their main fuel for central heating and just under a quarter of these were fuel poor in 2006.</p>

<a name="90304w0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_245"></a><a name="09030488000277"></a>Warm Front is the Government's flagship scheme for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England for vulnerable householders. The scheme currently provides grants for specified insulation and heating measures up to the value of &#163;2,700. or &#163;4,000 for oil central heating (including properties with no access to the gas network).</p>

<a name="90304w0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_246"></a><a name="09030488000278"></a>The Government recognise the specific challenge of assisting properties in rural communities. The Warm Front Scheme Management Board considers on a regular basis whether to approve appropriate alternative technologies on to the scheme, where they might prove cost-effective. One example is through Warm Front and National Energy Action where we are currently carrying out a pilot using solar thermal technology together with electric heating.</p>

<a name="90304w0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_247"></a><a name="09030488000279"></a>In addition, Warm Front has a networking team which operates in rural areas to help bring assistance to vulnerable households in rural communities. Proactively engaging with local organisations and area-based schemes, the team helps to increase the take-up of grants and energy efficiency advice in rural areas.</p>

<a name="90304w0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_248"></a><a name="09030488000280"></a>The carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) is the Government's principal policy for driving up household energy efficiency by 2011. Under CERT the major energy suppliers have an obligation to direct at least 40 per cent of carbon savings at priority group households. This includes important measures for hard-to-treat homes such as solid wall insulation and central heating. Suppliers installed around 80,000 heating measures through fuel switching in the previous three-year obligation period to March 2008 (the second energy efficiency commitment, EEC2). The Government recognise there is a high up-front cost for these measures and therefore under CERT we have introduced specific incentives to help improve the financial viability of fuel switching, with a particular focus on homes which are off the gas grid.</p>

<a name="90304w0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_249"></a><a name="09030488000281"></a>The principal barrier to providing new gas connections to communities and households beyond the mains gas network is the cost to the customer. Ofgem recognises the benefits that access to gas offers low-income households, and has incentivised the large gas networks to connect deprived communities under the 2008-13 gas distribution price control. This packages a range of existing funding sources and uses independent gas transporters with an aim of ensuring the maximum number of vulnerable and fuel poor households should be connected to the gas network at least cost. Those households who will be assisted under the scheme qualify because they either reside within the 20 per cent most deprived areas according to the index of multiple deprivation, qualify for assistance under Warm Front (or similar schemes in the devolved nations) or fall within the priority group under CERT.</p>

The intersessional IWC meeting which will take place in Rome from 9 to 11 March has no power to make such decisions.</p>
