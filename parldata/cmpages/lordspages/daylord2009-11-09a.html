<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="09110912000003"></a>Lords, there have been delays in the visa operation in Pakistan, particularly in issuing visas resulting from successful appeal decisions. Some applicants have been inconvenienced as a result. The United Kingdom has a close and important relationship with Pakistan. During the Home Secretary&#146;s recent visit to Pakistan, he assured the Government there that the visa operation is a priority and committed to reducing processing times to meet the published service standards by November.</p>

How many people are waiting for visa endorsements in Islamabad after winning their appeals in British courts in the past six months? Will Her Majesty's Government refund fees of all those victims of our failure who have missed their deadlines for medical check-ups, university courses, family weddings and professional jobs, either due to the backlog or the delay in FedEx? And finally&#151;</p>

I do not have at my fingertips the exact numbers of those who have missed courses; I shall get back to him in writing. We have about 10,000 students currently studying in the United Kingdom. In the first nine months of this year, just under 8,000 student visas were issued. On the appeals, the team working in Abu Dhabi, which is fully set up now, cleared more than 4,000 cases in five weeks in September and October and we will continue at that pace. We are rapidly getting up to speed.</p>

If security is the consideration, why was the visa centre moved to Abu Dhabi rather than to a safer location, such as Karachi? If security is the motivation, why have only 29 face-to-face interviews been conducted out of 66,000 applications in the nine-month period to June 2009?</p>

As interviews, we have discovered, interestingly, that interviews are not a reliable indicator necessarily; people make them out to be more effective than they are. The independent monitor and others have pointed out that research into job selection methods shows the interview as the weakest link. We go into great detail with the electronic checks and paper-based decision-making. As for the move to Abu Dhabi, there is no doubt that there have been problems caused by IT failures and linkages, so it has not worked straightaway as well as we would have liked. However, we have resolved most of those problems and things are working much better. On refusal rates, we refuse automatically any bid that includes false documentation or information. In Pakistan, there is a very high volume of false documentation. As soon as we spot it, the whole bid is refused. That is one of the problems.</p>

That is something that we on these Benches have called for. Can the Minister confirm whether the IT system is now fully operational? He referred to what I hope are just teething problems. How many staff are now employed there and of what type? Are they locally engaged or home-based? How many will there be when the office is up and running, if it is not fully operational now?</p>

<a name="09110912000010"></a><b><a name="91109-0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09110912000581"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> My Lords, we have not returned the issuing of visas to Pakistan; that is done in Abu Dhabi. It is part of the hub and spoke process that we have around the world. I apologise because I did not fully answer the last question. Yes, there is an issue of safety; there is no doubt about that. This happened post the Marriott hotel attack in Pakistan, where we were concerned about the large number of people we had there. We assessed Karachi as a dangerous place as well in that sense and Abu Dhabi was seen as a much better place for this. Abu Dhabi also acts as a spoke for Bahrain and will shortly do the same for Iran. The other reason is to get a certain standard for this type of work around the world, and that is working quite well.</p>

<a name="91109-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09110912000011"></a>As to the number of people, we currently have 15 UK-based staff in Islamabad, 15 Ralon staff and 120 locally engaged staff, who do the detailed nitty-gritty stuff. In Abu Dhabi, we have 146 staff, of whom 88 are support staff and the others are primarily British. I visited that unit because we were having problems there. It had difficulties initially, but it is rapidly getting up to speed and we are clearing the backlog.</p>

The quality of service to our would-be students from overseas is of fundamental importance to the economic interest of this country and now that the new points-based system is coming into effect, everything must be done to make sure that students get their visas as expeditiously as is needed for them to take up their courses.</p>

I declare an interest as chancellor of a university. Foreign students are important, not only in economic terms&#151;if they come from outside the EU they are a valuable economic tool&#151;but because we are able to add huge value to their training in terms of what they can do when they go back to their nations, and they add huge value to our students in terms of the interchange of ideas. This is an important matter.</p>

<a name="91109-0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09110912000014"></a>We are aware that there has been a delay. As I already said, we are working extremely hard to get this right and we are getting there. We have cleared a big backlog; we are getting better and quicker and we will resolve this problem. Working with Pakistan is extremely important to us. The safeguards that we have put in place are crucial. We had to tighten up our borders and over the past two years or so we have done an immense amount in this area.</p>

Since 2006, we have pursued an education and enforcement campaign aimed at foreign-registered vehicles in the UK. This arose from public concern over the perceived increase in foreign-registered vehicles that were not subject to UK road-tax rules. Vehicles may be used by visitors for up to six months in 12 without having to meet UK requirements. The campaign continues and we believe that public concern has lessened.</p>

When a foreign car is first spotted by either the police or the general public it is arranged for a warning notice to be placed on that vehicle saying that the driver is required to register it if they are here for six months within a year. Only after the six months have elapsed, or the vehicle is spotted again, is enforcement action taken.</p>

Is it not true that the case which received publicity recently did not involve the DVLA in any way? The police in good faith, but wrongly, clamped a motor vehicle, and they put it right as soon as they could, without payment. Will he also confirm that, largely as a result of the publicity campaign to which he refers, concern over the number of foreign vehicles not paying our road tax has largely been allayed?</p>

Obviously there will be the odd case when somebody is hard done by, and he has referred to one case which has received publicity. It was indeed based in Northamptonshire, the home county of the noble Baroness, where the police have been particularly active with their own Operation Andover campaign. The number of vehicles that have enforcement action taken against them has reduced and the situation appears now to be under control.</p>

There is a lot of evidence of people being totally ignorant of signs that say no left turn or no right turn, or that give bridge heights, although these are supposed to be international signs. Will the Minister also comment on the level of fines being imposed by VOSA on foreign vehicles which are improperly maintained and driven by drivers who have exceeded the driver&#146;s hours?

Once a foreign vehicle with either a recognisable or unrecognisable number plate is spotted, the warning notice is placed on it and the owner or driver knows what he or she is required to do in terms of getting the car taxed and registered in the UK. The problem of unreadable number plates is not however confined to foreign plates. There are a number of plates called cherished plates, which British drivers have, which also fall foul of the law.

It is interesting to note that in the last 12 months in which the scheme has been in operation, 18,419 vehicles registered overseas have been sighted, 691 have been clamped, 387 have been impounded, and 132 vehicles registered overseas&#151;which I think are the vehicles he is asking about&#151;have been authorised for disposal, mainly by what I am advised is called shredding.</p>

It is clear that we will not be serving our communities, nor will we be remaining competitive with other countries, if we do not guarantee that next generation broadband is more universally available than it is at present. Certainly, there is provision of broadband at present from, for instance, Virgin, while BT is also interested in spreading its reach in these terms. However, the Government are concerned about that reach and I am grateful to the noble Lord for emphasising how important it is.</p>

Over 2,100 political prisoners remain behind bars, and the country&#146;s ethnic nationalities suffer oppression and discrimination. Aung San Suu Kyi&#146;s meetings with our ambassador on 9 October, and with the United States Assistant Secretary of State last week, are a small but welcome development. We will continue to press for real progress and genuine dialogue between the Government, the Opposition and ethnic nationalities in Burma.</p>

Their shoot-to-kill policy has driven tens of thousands more civilians into hiding in the jungle where they have to live in harrowing conditions of danger and deprivation. Might Her Majesty&#146;s Government consider increasing some cross-border aid to help these people to survive in those conditions, especially with the imminent onset of the rainy season?</p>

DfID is increasing its support for groups channelling cross-border humanitarian aid into Burma. This year about &#163;360,000 of DfID funding is being used by NGOs for cross-border aid delivered to eastern Burma from Thailand, so it is happening. About &#163;500,000 is being provided for healthcare in Shan and Kachin states across the border from China. Proposals are under consideration to increase funding on both borders in 2010. We will continue to review the level of support and the targeting of these programmes and I am sure we will rely on the noble Baroness to keep us on our toes.</p>

The Prime Minister&#151;we should commend him for this&#151;wrote in August to the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and his fellow UN Security Council members, calling for that exact global arms embargo against Burma. We believe that no one should be selling arms to a Burmese military regime which continues to have such an appalling human rights record.

Our shared objectives remain the release of political prisoners and dialogue between the Government, opposition and ethnic groups. We need to see a genuine transition to democracy and if the NLD, the opposition party which Aung San Suu Kyi leads, is calling for dialogue&#151;which it is&#151;we would welcome that, but on its terms, not those of the military junta that is in control.</p>

<a name="09110912000062"></a><b><a name="91109-0002.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="09110912000637"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> My Lords, these amendments address a fundamental omission in the foundation trust regulatory regime. The omission recently came to light following the events at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. The amendments were introduced to the Bill on Report in another place. Given this late introduction I am pleased that the debate on these amendments will take place under Committee rules, allowing your Lordships&#146; House the chance to debate them.</p>

<a name="91109-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09110912000063"></a>NHS foundation trusts are a key part of the Government&#146;s health reform programme and are proving to be a success. The autonomy afforded to a foundation trust offers the best model for improving the provision of healthcare, allowing greater freedoms and autonomy to those who can demonstrate high performance. However, the events at Mid-Staffordshire Foundation Trust demonstrated clear failings to its patients, the public and the NHS. The Government are committed to learning the lessons of these events to ensure such events cannot happen again.</p>

<a name="91109-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09110912000064"></a>My honourable friend the Minister of State for Health, on introducing these amendments in another place, said that they acted on two of the many lessons we have to learn. First, Monitor, the independent regulator of foundation trusts, should have the power to remove foundation trust status where a foundation trust fails to live up to the high standards. Secondly, transparent democratic accountability is vital when a foundation trusts fails.</p>

<a name="91109-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09110912000065"></a>The amendments need to be viewed in the context of the existing powers of intervention. The National Health Service Act 2006 provides the independent regulator, Monitor, with a range of powers of intervention in foundation trusts. These can be used in the event of a significant breach of the terms of authorisation or requirements in legislation. Monitor&#146;s powers include the removal of any or all of the directors of the board or requiring the board of a foundation trust to do, or not do, specific things.</p>

<a name="91109-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09110912000066"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, the Bill also contains clauses relating to trust special administrators, which would enable Monitor to trigger deauthorisation of a foundation trust that is no longer sustainable in its current form. This is as a preliminary to the deauthorised trust coming under the control of a trust special administrator as part of a prescribed six-month process.</p>

<a name="91109-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09110912000067"></a>The proposal presented for consideration today is the final missing option between those extremes. It would enable Monitor to trigger deauthorisation for a sustainable foundation trust. Foundation trusts are authorised on the basis of being high-performing organisations. It is logical that, should they fail to live up to the required standards and lose public confidence, powers should exist to remove their foundation trust  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_588"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 588</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>status. A power to deauthorise provides a clear message that foundation trusts must maintain the high standards that are expected of them, and provides the public with the confidence that organisations must continue to earn the right to continue as foundation trusts.</p>

<a name="91109-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09110912000068"></a>The new Section 52B provides that triggering deauthorisation will be a decision for Monitor. Under the proposals, when a foundation trust has breached any term of its authorisation, or requirements in legislation, and the breach is so serious that it justifies deauthorisation, Monitor may trigger deauthorisation. Triggering deauthorisation will be a complex decision. The new Section 52C establishes a framework requiring that Monitor considers four factors: the health and safety of patients; the quality of services that are provided; the financial position of the trust; and the way it is being run.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/91109-0003.htm"/>


<a name="91109-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09110912000069"></a>To ensure transparency, new Section 52C also requires Monitor to consult on and publish guidance setting out the detail of the factors that it will take into account. Before triggering deauthorisation, Monitor must consult with key stakeholders to get their views. Accordingly, Monitor will be required to consult, as a minimum, the Secretary of State, the trust itself, the appropriate strategic health authority and relevant commissioners of the trust&#146;s services. This mirrors the clauses relating to trust special administrators.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09110912000070"></a>Having done this, if Monitor gives a deauthorisation notice, the Secretary of State must make an order deauthorising the foundation trust, which will take effect within five working days of the order being made. The new Section 52D provides that the deauthorised foundation trust would then become an NHS trust under Secretary of State powers of direction. In common with the clauses relating to trust special administrators, Schedule 2 to the Bill means transitional arrangements will be put in place to allow the continuation of commercial arrangements entered into using foundation trust freedoms and to ensure continuity of services for local people.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09110912000071"></a>Along with this new process, the amendments will also strengthen democratic accountability. While Monitor is responsible for the regulation of foundation trusts, the Secretary of State is ultimately accountable to Parliament for the overall provision of NHS services.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09110912000072"></a>Monitor&#146;s operational independence is a vital part of the regulatory framework, and one that we should seek to maintain. Only Monitor can trigger the deauthorisation of a foundation trust, reinforcing Monitor&#146;s independence, and ensuring that its authority is not undermined, but when considering the most serious risks to patients, the Secretary of State should be able to formally express his view.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09110912000073"></a>To enable this, the amendments propose that the Secretary of State should be able to formally request that Monitor consider deauthorising a foundation trust. In any such situation, it will be vital that the Secretary of State and Monitor are able to act quickly and transparently. We therefore propose that if Monitor believes that a differing course of action is preferable, it will be required to publicly explain its decision, either within a default of 14 days, or within such further time as the Secretary of State deems appropriate to the particulars of the case.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09110912000074"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment 6. It corrects a minor drafting error in Clause 18(8)(b), which lists orders that are not subject to any statutory procedure. The other orders made in connection with trust special administrators are not subject to any statutory procedure and an order made under new Clause 65L(5) should also have been included in this list. This makes the drafting consistent with the Government&#146;s original intention, which was approved by the House of Lords Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09110912000075"></a>The Government believe in strong, independent regulation of foundation trusts, and that foundation trust status should continue to be earned. I hope that noble Lords will agree that these proposals give Monitor a useful further regulatory power, while formalising a method for the Secretary of State to have a transparent dialogue with Monitor concerning the most serious of foundation trust failures.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09110912000076"></a>I am glad that we will now have the opportunity for a full debate on this issue, and I beg to move.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09110912000078"></a>It is perhaps understandable that the Government should have seized the opportunity afforded by the Bill to slot into it a raft of provisions by which they clearly set a lot of store, but it is nevertheless unfortunate that we should be considering these important matters for the first time only at the very last stage of the Bill's passage through the House. Nevertheless, we are where we are, and it is, I hope, helpful that we can debate the amendment under the rules of Committee, because it certainly begs a number of fundamental questions.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09110912000079"></a>The first question is: why is the amendment thought to be necessary? We are here dealing with the situation in which a foundation hospital such as Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust is found to be delivering patient care to a seriously inferior standard&#151;an unacceptable standard. We can no doubt conjure up all sorts of imaginary examples of how that might come about. Interestingly, we are not here talking about a foundation trust whose viability is under threat only because of financial failure. We already have provisions in the Bill to deal with that situation.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09110912000080"></a>The amendment deals with management failure and what should be done when patients are exposed, for example, to serious clinical risk or serious health and safety shortcomings sufficient to constitute a breach of trust authorisation. Ministers are saying that in such a situation, Monitor should have the option of deciding that the trust should be deauthorised&#151;in other words, that it should lose its foundation status and move back into the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09110912000081"></a>What might be the point of that? The only point that would resonate with me is the likely benefit to patients, but where is the evidence that bringing a  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_590"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 590</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>hospital back under the aegis of a strategic health authority would be more likely to solve its management difficulties than if it were kept under the regulatory eye of Monitor? All the evidence points in the other direction. Take the example of Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells. The fact that Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells was in the direct line of sight of the Secretary of State made no difference to the catastrophe that occurred there. The very serious management problems that emerged in Mid-Staffordshire Hospital were ones that began long before it achieved foundation status. They were there when it was still an NHS trust under the direct scrutiny of the strategic health authority and, by extension, the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09110912000082"></a>By contrast, it is a matter of common agreement that Monitor has an extraordinarily successful record as a regulator. It has extensive powers of intervention, as the Minister mentioned. It has used those powers on a number of occasions to great effect. Where trusts have breached the standards set out in their terms of authorisation, Monitor has, in every case, taken action that has brought them back into compliance. Sometimes, this kind of action need only be informal, but if we look at the provisions contained in Section 52 of the 2006 Act, we are rapidly reminded that there is no shortage of weapons at Monitor&#146;s disposal, should it chose to deploy them. I find it difficult to imagine a situation where to resolve a failure of management, it would be thought better to move a trust out of Monitor&#146;s jurisdiction and into that of Ministers. Therefore, my first question to the Minister is about the evidence that has led the Government to believe that there really is a regulatory gap here. The gap identified by Dr David Colin-Thom&#233; was much more about better co-ordination and communication between the various regulators than it was about deficiencies in legislation.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09110912000083"></a>My next question relates to some of the wording in the amendment. New Section 52B covers the conditions governing the serving of a notice by the regulator. To paraphrase this section, it says that the regulator may give the Secretary of State a notice if it is satisfied that a foundation trust is contravening any term of its authorisation or any of its legal obligations and that the breach, whatever it is, is serious enough to justify deauthorisation. If we compare the wording of this section with new Section 65D(1), which deals with the process leading up to the appointment of a trust special administrator, we find a clear difference. New Section 65D states&#151;again, I paraphrase&#151;that the regulator may give the Secretary of State a notice if it is satisfied that a trust has already failed to comply with a notice served under Section 52 and that further exercise of Monitor&#146;s powers under Section 52 is not likely to rectify the problem. In other words, a notice under new Section 65D is there very much as a final resort when all else has failed. There is no flavour of that idea in new Section 52B. There is nothing there that suggests that a notice to deauthorise is appropriate only after Monitor has exhausted its intervention powers. Why is that?</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09110912000084"></a>For example, it is quite possible to imagine Monitor being satisfied that a trust was committing a serious contravention of its terms of authorisation, while at same time believing that the contravention was capable of being remedied without deauthorisation being  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_591"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 591</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>necessary. The absence of any provision making clear that Monitor may and, indeed, should treat its powers in new Section 52B as a measure of last resort is slightly worrying. Can the Minister confirm that it does not lay Monitor open to the possibility of judicial review?</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09110912000085"></a>Let us imagine that at a certain foundation hospital, there was a serious failure of care and the course of action taken by Monitor to remedy it stopped short of going down the deauthorisation route. Let us further imagine that someone thought that that decision was quite wrong and that deauthorisation was the only appropriate course to take. Could Monitor be open to legal challenge? In other words, does new Section 52B send a signal that deauthorisation should be treated as just an alternative to the normal remedial measures that Monitor has at its disposal? I very much hope that the Minister will say that this is not so, but it is not obvious from a straight reading of the text.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09110912000086"></a>I turn now to the subject of my amendment. To add greater clarity&#151;as I noticed that the Marshalled List does not print line numbers, whereas the amendment does refer to line numbers&#151; the amendment seeks to leave out proposed new Section 52E in the government amendment. As the Minister has explained, we see at the end of the government amendment proposed new Section 52E, which would give the Secretary of State a statutory power to request Monitor to consider exercising its power to commence the deauthorisation of a foundation trust. I heard what the Minister had to say about this provision. She said that it amounts to a request and no more than that. Monitor is at liberty to decide not to commence the deauthorisation process and all it has to do is publish its reasons for not doing so. All this sounds innocuous, but is it? I think we should consider very carefully whether this is a step we wish to take.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09110912000087"></a>When we debated what became the 2003 Act&#151;the Act which established foundation trusts&#151;the one cardinal feature of the new regime, as the Government were keen to emphasise, was that Ministers should not be involved in operational decisions about the delivery of healthcare by foundation trusts. That principle was the very reason why Monitor was created as an independent regulator&#151;accountable directly to Parliament, not to Ministers&#151;and why foundation trusts were made accountable to their governors and members, as well as to Monitor. It was explicitly recognised that, however tempted Ministers might be to weigh in if something ever went wrong in a foundation trust, it would not serve anyone&#146;s interests if they actually did so. Other mechanisms would instead kick in. The independence of foundation trusts, and their freedom from political manipulation, were the key features that would underpin their ability to raise standards and to be responsive to the needs of their patients.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09110912000088"></a>I maintain that the power contained in proposed new Section 52E, innocuous as it may look, oversteps the line of political interference to which I have just referred. It is one thing for a Minister to make an informal request to Monitor: nobody can have an objection to that and legislation is not required for it.   


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_592"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 592</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Here, however, we have not only a statutory power given to Ministers, but also a bit of sleight of hand. If we read the wording carefully, we see that what is termed a &#147;request&#148; is in fact akin to an instruction. Upon receipt of a request from the Secretary of State, the regulator has no choice but to take certain action. It has to go through the process of deciding whether it is satisfied that there is a serious contravention or failure in the trust concerned, and it has to give formal consideration to the matters listed in proposed new Section 52C. It must, then, either serve a notice to deauthorise, or publish its reasons for not doing so. In other words, Monitor cannot just say &#147;no&#148;: it cannot just decline to take any action at all. What we see here, therefore&#151;albeit in a disguised form&#151;is a power of direction over Monitor. That, for me, is one step too far.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09110912000089"></a>If one thinks of the kind of situation which might give rise to a request from the Secretary of State to Monitor, it is highly likely to be characterised externally by intense media interest and intense pressure on the Government to do something about a reported problem in the hospital concerned. Ministers will find it difficult to protest, in the midst of a media feeding frenzy, that they are not accountable for what may or may not be going on. So their safety valve, politically speaking, is to put public pressure on Monitor.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09110912000090"></a>Looked at in the cool light of day, the statutory power contained in proposed new Section 52E is simply a means of allowing Ministers to grandstand on an operational issue for which, as a matter of law, they are not responsible. The proper course is not for Ministers to be given a statutory power to order Monitor about, but rather for us to remind ourselves what we agreed in 2003, which is to let Monitor do its job in the way it was set up to do and which it has proved it can do, free of political second-guessing. I should like to hear the Minister&#146;s reply to this. It will not be lost on her that I think that this entire government amendment has been rushed into the Bill with undue haste and that new Section 52E has been inserted as a result of misplaced ministerial backsliding on a key point of principle. For myself, I do not think that that is the direction of travel we should be taking. I therefore beg to move.</p>

I should say straightaway that I have sort of jettisoned my speech after counting lines 99 to 153 of the government amendment again and thinking further about the noble Earl&#146;s amendment. For the benefit of one or two noble Lords, I ought to remind the House about Monitor and what it does. I should also declare an interest as a member of the board. As such, I should say straightaway that I have been party to the negotiations held outside this Chamber with the Government about the amendment, and after many weeks the board declared itself to be content because we felt that we had pushed it as far as we could. But, as the code of conduct reminds us, none of us sits in this House as the representative of an organisation, and I am wholly won over by the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09110912000092"></a>A Member of this House who is in the Chamber today asked me who on earth Monitor is as if its members were a small group of aliens parachuted in from outer space. We were created by the Government in 2003 to regulate independently foundation trust hospitals and the mental health services that come under that grouping. The organisation is accountable to Parliament and does not float in administrative space. We produce an annual report on which questions can be raised. Its membership is appointed by the Appointments Commission in exactly the same way as are the boards of NHS trusts, so we are not a peculiar bunch of independent-minded folk who do not think carefully about the impact of our decisions on public sector organisations; we are of the public sector.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09110912000093"></a>I can think of several good reasons why a trust may be returned to the Secretary of State. We already have provisions in the Bill for those which fail financially, and I can see that there could be times when quality issues require powers of intervention beyond those held by Monitor. It has draconian powers in terms of appointments to and removals from boards, for example, and together with the Care Quality Commission, can intervene and prevent services from running if they are failing dramatically. But what strategic health authorities as links in the Department of Health&#146;s chain of command, and through them the primary care trusts, can do is occasionally recontract a service or change a sector economy to ensure that a service is acting effectively in concert with other services. They can do some of the restructuring that might enable a service to reinvigorate the quality of its care. These are very rare occurrences, but I can see that it could happen. It has not happened yet, I might say, but I can see that it might.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09110912000094"></a>As we go into a time when money is going to be very tight and the temptations at the centre will be to implement mechanisms of restraint&#151;which it has been tempted to implement before and they have usually been disastrous in the NHS&#151;it will be very tempting for the department and for Ministers, under certain circumstances, to try to intervene more than would probably be in the best interests of local services.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09110912000095"></a>It is also important to remember that there is a group of people at the back of these foundation trusts called governors and members&#151;a million of them&#151;who have a part to play and local powers to intervene. We do not wish to do anything which cuts across those powers of influence. That is why the governors and members were created and why this Government were so keen that there should be some local accountability which would enable powers to be given to local people to intervene under these circumstances. I can see that there could be occasions when it would be necessary for Monitor to request the Secretary of State to rethink the system of accountability and that it should go back to NHS trusts. This is not because we believe that the Department of Health has any greater history of improving services than Monitor; as we have said, the history is worse.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09110912000096"></a>I think that, on balance, the powers in the Commons amendment go too far. They enable the Secretary of State to push when under pressure from the media and

I am entirely won over by the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, which still leaves the basic requirements for the deauthorisation of trusts in place but allows for a more sensible provision.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09110912000097"></a>There is one point which remains unsatisfactory in the Commons amendment and that relates to the period of time which Monitor is given to respond to the Secretary of State&#146;s request to deauthorise a foundation trust. The proposals require a response from Monitor within 14 days, with flexibility for the Secretary of State to set longer deadlines if appropriate. I seek reassurance from the Minister that, if Amendment 1 is adopted, an appropriate timetable for consideration of any request will be agreed with Monitor on a case-by-case basis. It is clear from our dealings with hospitals that it is likely to require more than 14 days, and a timetable should be set accordingly. I seek reassurance on that. Overall, I am very attracted to the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and will give it my support.</p>

The noble Earl, Lord Howe, has reminded us of some of our exchanges. It is certainly true that I swore undying support for the independence of the regulator on the basis that Ministers would resist the temptation to interfere in the workings of foundation trusts when things did not go quite as everyone would want them to go.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09110912000099"></a>In the case of mid-Staffordshire, neither the Healthcare Commission nor Monitor covered themselves in communications glory over the way that some aspects were handled. There are some issues on which I have some sympathy with Ministers for intervening. However, proposed new Section 52E crosses the line with regard to the assurances that government Ministers, including myself, gave in good faith about the independence of Monitor.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09110912000100"></a>I have not heard the arguments for why we need the proposed new Section 52E. Indeed, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, made some good arguments for why we do not and it is incumbent on Ministers to explain why the amendment is now necessary. What circumstances have changed since the 2003 Act to make that kind of amendment necessary?</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09110912000101"></a>To add to that, the way that Monitor has behaved for five to six years is, for the most part, overwhelmingly a triumph of successful early interventions when things were going wrong in particular foundation trusts. Admittedly, many of those issues were financial but, even then, Monitor intervened with trusts whose financial circumstances were going off the rails much more rapidly than strategic health authorities, either in their current or previous form, have ever done.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09110912000102"></a>In answer to a Question that I put down a couple of months ago, the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, replied that there are still 40-odd existing trusts, not foundation trusts, that have historical deficits. That situation simply would not have happened with Monitor; those sorts of issues would have been tackled earlier. This comes back to the question raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe: if we return a failing trust to an SHA, what guarantee do we have that the responses in putting

I have some sympathy with the points that the noble Earl has raised.</p>

<a name="09110912000103"></a><b><a name="91109-0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09110912000642"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> My Lords, I shall follow on from the last point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, about timescales. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, was right to remind us that these decisions are often made in the glare of publicity when something has gone seriously wrong. We are not talking simply about financial mismanagement; as the Minister said in her introductory remarks, we are talking about the deauthorisation of a trust on grounds that include health and safety and quality of service as well as finance and other managerial matters. Those are complex and difficult matters to question and establish.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09110912000104"></a>Why are the periods of time mentioned in proposed new Section 52D, which is about the process of deauthorisation as it would be taken under proposed new Section 52B, so short? An order must take effect within five working days of when it is issued. Proposed new Section 52D(8) specifies a period of seven days after the Secretary of State makes an order for the regulator to publish its report. That is a very short time to report on potentially deep and complex matters. I would welcome some clarification from the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="09110912000105"></a><b><a name="91109-0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09110912000643"></a>Baroness Pitkeathley:</b> My Lords, I speak in favour of the Commons amendments; I believe that they will provide more reassurance to patients and the public. However, I ask for some clarification from my noble friend on a couple of points about regulation. I declare an interest as chair of the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence. It is important that patients know who they can expect to be regulating services when trusts are deauthorised or identified as unsustainable and come under the Secretary of State&#146;s powers of direction. Is it going to be Monitor or the Care Quality Commission? Are they going to fight over it? We need to be very clear about that. If the purpose of regulation is to guarantee patient safety, it is important that patients are informed and have clear directions about where to take their concerns. I would welcome clarification about that.</p>

<a name="91109-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09110912000106"></a>I also have some concerns about the potential impact on revalidation, especially for doctors, of the trusts which enter these proposed arrangements. Medical revalidation at the local level relies on the responsible officers&#151;who are likely to be medical directors&#151; to maintain the process of revalidation. We need to be assured that the function of responsible officer could still be discharged in such circumstances. If not, what other measures could be put in place to avoid what might be unintended consequences for the revalidation of doctors?.</p>

We have heard several noble lords and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, a member of the board of Monitor, say specific things about the powers that Monitor has in regard to financial controls. The issue with mid-Staffordshire was not as much about financial  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_596"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 596</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>control as about patients&#146; health and safety. If we can be reassured that Monitor has the powers currently to act on issues related to patient health and safety, to bring the trust into order and maybe even deauthorise it, then I would be content that these amendments are not necessary. I am persuaded by much of the argument made by the noble Earl, Lord Howe&#151;it is difficult not to agree with his arguments as they are often so well studied&#151;but one issue that concerns me is whether Monitor has the provisions currently to act solely on patient health and safety issues and not only financial issues.</p>

<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="09110912000108"></a><b><a name="91109-0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09110912000645"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> My Lords, I support the comments of the noble Earl, Lord Howe. I have been involved in the National Health Service off and on over the past 30 years and Monitor has been the first body to really transform trusts as I have been aware of them. Inefficiencies in the NHS, I am afraid, are a commonplace; they have been there over the years. In their preparations to become foundation trusts, the trusts have to work extremely hard to sort out their governance, to sort out their boards, to appoint new people and to improve their professionalism. Certainly our board&#151;it is quite typical&#151;is now completely different because we had to be different in order to justify our existence as a foundation trust. Therefore I find it difficult to think that somehow it would be a step forward for a trust to be moved from regulation by Monitor to some sort of regulation by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09110912000109"></a>I agree with the comments that have been made by my noble friend about the fact that Monitor has been required to focus on finance until very recently. My understanding now is that Monitor will have a very good look at the quality accounts of every foundation trust in order to judge us on our quality of service as well as our financial probity. On that basis, the government amendment will be unhelpful and I add my support to the words of the noble Earl, Lord Howe.</p>

<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="09110912000110"></a><b><a name="91109-0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09110912000646"></a>Lord Crisp:</b> My Lords, I also speak with sympathy for the position that the noble Earl, Lord Howe is advocating. I was chief executive of the NHS when Monitor was created and therefore I have some background in it. There are two points to make. First, there are times when it would be sensible to deauthorise a foundation trust, and that is when the problem is not resident within the trust but within the wider local health economy. That may be solved by sorting out issues on a slightly wider scale than only within the individual organisation.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09110912000111"></a>I agree with the point about the separation of government and DH from Monitor. The point of Monitor was that it would be independent, objective and ultimately accountable to Parliament. However, this amendment seems to suggest that when government, for whatever reason, decides that it wants Monitor to answer to it, it is expected to do so on a fortnightly basis. That seems a very short period of time and takes away the basic point. We wanted to see these sorts of decisions taken in an objective fashion and as far away as possible from any political considerations. It is on that basis that I have a great deal of sympathy with the noble Earl&#146;s position.</p>

<a name="09110912000112"></a><b><a name="91109-0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09110912000647"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> My Lords, there is no doubt that the noble Earl is right and that this is not the most satisfactory way in which to proceed with legislation. However, as he also said, we are where we are.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09110912000113"></a>The amendments strengthen the foundation trusts regulatory regime and reaffirm the Government&#146;s commitment to the foundation trust ideal and the independence of Monitor. They fill a gap identified in the wake of the events of mid-Staffordshire by showing that foundation trust status must continue to be earned and by providing further democratic transparency to foundation trust regulation.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09110912000114"></a>The noble Earl&#146;s amendment would remove new Section 54E from Commons Amendment 1, which allows the Secretary of State to formally request that Monitor consider deauthorising a foundation trust. I think that the noble Earl would agree that the independence of Monitor is vital and that maintaining this independence is an extremely important part of the foundation trust model. The Government&#146;s proposals are based on that very principle. They will preserve Monitor&#146;s independence, as the decision to deauthorise rests solely with Monitor.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09110912000115"></a>Section 54E does not limit Monitor&#146;s independence when making decisions. However, it reflects that the Secretary of State is ultimately accountable to Parliament for the overall provision of NHS services. In extreme cases, Parliament and the public might legitimately expect that there should be an enhanced level of transparency. Indeed, in another place, Conservative Members representing constituencies served by the mid-Staffordshire trust pushed us to go further, insisting that the Secretary of State should be able to force deauthorisation. The amendments make it clear that Secretary of State could only make requests, not force any action. This is because, while we recognise the concerns raised by honourable Members in another place, we believe in and are committed to the benefits of independent regulation.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09110912000116"></a>The circumstances in which such requests may be made are also constrained by the proposals. They do not appear from the ether, as the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, suggested, to be dealt with in two weeks. Section 54E provides that a request could be made only when it appeared to the Secretary of State that there were grounds for Monitor to consider deauthorisation; that is, it must be satisfied that there has been a breach that is sufficiently serious to justify deauthorisation. As we have heard, it will be for Monitor to set out the detailed matters to be considered, using the framework in the amendment. I am sure that we can all agree that transparent decision-making in difficult times is vital. This is a valuable lesson following the events of mid-Staffordshire.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09110912000117"></a>I turn to some of the points made by noble Lords in this debate. The noble Earl and the noble Lord, Lord Patel, referred to the evidence of a regulatory gap. We think that mid-Staffordshire is a wake-up call that shows the necessity for the option to deauthorise, because it became an issue of public confidence. That should not be underrated here.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09110912000118"></a>On patient safety and public confidence, it is important to send a message that foundation trust status is not a one-way ticket. Ministers need to have a way in which  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_598"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 598</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to make their views known on such an issue of public confidence. However, this is not about correcting the past; it is about driving behaviour in the future. It is only one of a number of things that we have done in relation to mid-Staffordshire and this issue. Monitor does an excellent job and this power will strengthen its hand, as well as the Government&#146;s.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09110912000119"></a>The noble Earl and others asked how this measure will benefit patients. The power to deauthorise makes it clear that foundation trusts must maintain the high standards that are expected of them and that foundation status is not something that can be taken for granted. We believe that it will act as a further incentive to foundation trusts to maintain the highest standards of care for patients. We believe that this, linked to the regulatory regime that my noble friend referred to and to which I will return in a moment, is the best way forward.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09110912000120"></a>The noble Earl also asked why the Secretary of State would have any better skills than Monitor to deal with issues such as those in Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells. The new performance framework relating to NHS trusts, which has been rolling out across the NHS since April this year, will improve the transparency and consistency of the process of identifying and addressing underperformance in NHS trusts. The performance framework clearly emphasises the roles and responsibilities of PCTs as commissioners and strategic health authorities as system and performance managers in driving up improvements, alongside the transparent role for the Department of Health. We believe that world-class commissioning and the strategic health authority assurance programme will complement the framework by holding PCT commissioners and SHAs to account for the roles that they play in tackling underperformance and failure. Consistently poor performers will either be supported to recover or their exit will be managed through a time-limited process.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09110912000121"></a>The noble Earl asked why there was no requirement in new Sections 52B and 65D to exhaust other intervention powers. He asked whether that lays Monitor open to judicial review. Of course, Monitor is always potentially at risk of judicial review when exercising its powers and has to exercise its powers in accordance with the principles of public law. In deciding whether to deauthorise, Monitor will need to consider whether it is dealing with this in an orderly fashion by steps that cannot be used against it. That will be a relevant factor in considering whether it should exercise its powers in this manner. If Monitor can show that its decision whether to deauthorise or not is reasonable in the circumstances, that decision will be lawful.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09110912000122"></a>I was not completely clear whether the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, was speaking in favour of Monitor or not, but I was surprised by her intervention. Monitor has declared itself content with these proposals. Indeed, the amendments give Monitor an important new power. The Government are fundamentally committed, as I have said on many occasions, to the independence of Monitor. Surely we can all agree that, when patients&#146; lives are at risk, action needs to be taken. Both the Secretary of State and Monitor should be able to defend their actions publicly. Given the amount of consultation with Monitor that led to this amendment  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_599"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 599</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>being tabled, I was surprised at the noble Baroness&#146;s intervention, although I accept that the noble Earl is very persuasive in these matters. In addition, Monitor&#146;s guidance will deal with the matters that it considers when deciding whether to deauthorise. That will include consideration of whether lesser steps of intervention would be appropriate.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09110912000123"></a>Again on the issue of Monitor&#146;s consultation process, I quote from the consultation document, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="09110912000258"></a>&#147;In such circumstances, we ... accept that it would appropriate for the Secretary of State to request that Monitor consider proposing de-authorisation and that Monitor&#146;s response should be published&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110912000222"></a>That is what Monitor had to say on this matter.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09110912000124"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, raised the issue of 14 days and the timescale. The proposal is for 14 days or longer. In extreme circumstances, speed is of the essence, but so is due process. If the Secretary of State sets an unreasonably short timescale, he will be subject to judicial review. The Secretary of State will have to work closely with Monitor to ensure that the appropriate timescales are met.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09110912000125"></a>My noble friend Lady Pitkeathley and the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, raised the issue of the CQC and Monitor. As noble Lords may remember from earlier discussion of the Bill, Monitor and the CQC are bound by law to work together. In September 2009 they signed a Memorandum of Understanding. This takes account of the relationship and details the way in which they will work together and alongside each other in delivering their respective statutory functions. The CQC is an independent corporate body established under the 2008 Act. It is responsible for the regulation of the quality of health and social care services. Monitor is an independent corporate body established under the 2006 Act. It is responsible for authorising, monitoring and regulating NHS foundation trusts. They have to collaborate and co-operate together to ensure the effective discharge of their statutory functions and efficient and effective regulatory frameworks for NHS foundation trusts.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09110912000126"></a>My noble friend Lady Pitkeathley asked about the responsible officer for medical revalidation. The amendment will have no impact on this. I am sure that we can agree that transparent decision-making is vital in these difficult times. I hope that the noble Earl will feel reassured that the proposals ensure that decision-making remains, rightly, with Monitor. I hope that he will also support the Government&#146;s view that transparency is vital in these difficult circumstances and feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I can clarify that I was indeed speaking on my own behalf, as I believe everybody in the House should. We are all members of organisations; we do not always speak on their behalf. I was expressing a personal view. Much of the amendment is good and Monitor has been supportive of those parts of it.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09110912000128"></a>As a point of clarification, I would like to ensure that the Minister and other Members of the House are aware that the quality standards by which Monitor  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_600"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 600</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>assesses, and has formerly assessed, foundation trusts are exactly the same as those used by ordinary National Health Service trusts. Information from the Healthcare Commission until last week, information that is gathered by local organisations and from the governors and members, and information from achievement-against-performance targets form the basis on which foundation trusts are monitored, so they are just the same.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09110912000129"></a>Monitor is now involved with the Care Quality Commission and the Department of Health. The chairman sits on the National Quality Board and is working closely with other organisations to see how we can all monitor quality better in a prospective fashion, to complement the way in which the CQC monitors it retrospectively so that our systems dovetail and work together. I hope that that is clear. When talking about mid-Staffs, it is important to understand that it was being monitored in exactly the same way as every other NHS trust.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09110912000130"></a>Finally, I raise the issue of new Section 52E. All it does is enable the Secretary of State to make a request. Why is it necessary for the Secretary of State to have such a power in a Bill? There is no reason not to exclude that section, which sounds pretty heavy and interventionist and requires a response within 10 days. Nothing in normal day-to-day non-departmental government body business would preclude the Secretary of State from making a request. Most months now, expressions of anxiety are passed between various organisations in the health field. I cannot imagine a situation where this measure would be necessary. On that basis, I do not understand why it needed to be included in the first place. The rest of the amendment is very helpful to the process of regulation without it.</p>

In that circumstance, who would patients approach? Would it be the Secretary of State, the Minister, their Member of Parliament, Monitor or the Care Quality Commission? Who would they approach?</p>

<a name="09110912000132"></a><b><a name="91109-0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09110912000650"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> The only reason why I expressed surprise at the intervention of the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, is that she opened her remarks by saying that she had been involved in the lengthy discussions between Monitor and the Government, and Monitor has said that it was very satisfied with this process. Obviously the Secretary of State can request information and can request Monitor to consider matters at any point, and does so, but the measure that we are proposing would mean that Monitor was bound to explain its answer. That is the key point. That is why new Section 52E is framed as it is. Of course, we know that Monitor applies the same standards to foundation trusts as are set out in the legislation for all CQC registration. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Patel, that, were a trust to be deauthorised, it would then go back into the NHS system and the same framework for the patient voice to be heard would kick in.</p>

<a name="09110912000133"></a><b><a name="91109-0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09110912000651"></a>Lord Mackay of Clashfern:</b> My Lords, is new Section 52E premised on the idea that the Secretary of State may have information coming to him that will have escaped Monitor? If that is not the case, I do not understand why he should take it on himself to tell Monitor about something that it is already investigating. I should have thought that one&#146;s basic confidence in a foundation trust was based on the independence, skill and competence of Monitor. If you have a system that allows the Secretary of State to say to Monitor, &#147;You are not doing this very well&#148;, that will tend to reduce confidence in Monitor and reduce public confidence in the system, as it would suggest that public confidence could be bolstered only by the fact that the Secretary of State had power to intervene.</p>

<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="09110912000134"></a><b><a name="91109-0004.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09110912000652"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> The Secretary of State will not intervene; he will ask Monitor to consider deauthorisation. The key point is that Monitor then has to explain its decision. It can say no, as it is an independent regulator. It has every power to say no but, if it chooses to say no, it has to do so publicly. This is about transparency and having to say no on the public record. The measure also gives Monitor a new power to deauthorise, which it did not have previously and which it has said that it wishes to have.</p>

<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="09110912000135"></a><b><a name="91109-0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09110912000653"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in this debate, not least those who have supported the position that I have taken. I am particularly grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy. Having listened to her, I accept that there could be rare circumstances in which the power that the Government are seeking might be warranted and might be appropriately used.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09110912000136"></a>However, the main issue that I raised relates to new Section 52E. Essentially, the Government have looked at mid-Staffordshire, acknowledged that there has been a failure of management and decided that the way to solve that management problem is by legislating. That is a classic piece of wrong-headedness, although, for the reasons that I gave earlier, it could be even worse.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09110912000137"></a>New Section 52E is all about putting Monitor under political pressure and, as my noble and learned friend said, could serve to do the very opposite from what the Government are intending; namely, it could undermine confidence in the system. If people do not think that Monitor is doing its job properly, that is an even worse situation. Not only does Monitor have to act when instructed or requested to act, but it may have only 14 days in which to do so because, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, pointed out, the Secretary of State could insist on 14 days. If it then delivers what seems to the Secretary of State to be the wrong answer, there seems to be nothing to prevent the Secretary of State from repeating the request straightaway, thereby redoubling the political pressure. To me, none of that is a very appealing prospect.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09110912000138"></a>We then come back to whether deauthorisation is a measure of last resort. From the Minister&#146;s answer, I was not entirely clear about that. The fact remains that Monitor could be trapped by the wording of the amendment. Having taken a detailed look at the facts of the particular case, it might well find that the trust was in breach of its authorisation terms. It might well  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_602"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 602</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>find that that breach was serious enough to justify the Secretary of State making an order to deauthorise a trust yet, despite that, conclude that it was inappropriate to go down the deauthorisation route. How easy will it be for Monitor to hold fast to that conclusion in the face of intense political pressure? Without wording in the new section to make it clear that deauthorisation should be considered only when other measures have failed, that will not be easy at all.</p>

<a name="91109-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09110912000139"></a>The way to secure improvements in the performance of foundation trusts is much more straightforward than any of this, and noble Lords have referred to it. It is to make sure that there is close liaison between the Department of Health, Monitor and the Care Quality Commission. We do not need legislation to do that. I am sufficiently encouraged by the support that I have received from other noble Lords that I should like to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09110912000142"></a>Amendment 11 was one of a series tabled by my right honourable friend the Member for Makerfield, Ian McCartney, and the honourable Member for Colchester, Bob Russell, in the other place. Their amendments sought to remove the power to impose restrictions on sales of tobacco from vending machines,   


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_605"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 605</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>so that the national authorities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland would only be able to make regulations to ban tobacco sales from vending machines completely.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09110912000143"></a>As I have previously made clear, the Government recognise that there is a serious problem with young people accessing tobacco from vending machines and that action needs to be taken. Vending machines are currently the usual source of cigarettes for 10 per cent of 11 to 15 year-olds who say they smoke. In 2008, the Local Authorities Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services reported that 40 per cent of test purchases carried out by trading standards across England resulted in underage sales from vending machines.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09110912000144"></a>I do not intend to rehearse the many arguments we have had about nicotine being highly addictive, or that some 200,000 children aged between 11 and 15 are regular smokers. It is clear why the Government are so concerned.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09110912000145"></a>As we debated in your Lordships&#146; House, the issue of tobacco-vending machines continues to raise strong views across all parties. On Report in the other place, all parties were offered a free vote and Amendment 11 was accepted. As it was the result of a free vote, the Secretary of State for Health made clear in his Third Reading speech in the other place that the will of that House would be respected and the Government would not seek to overturn the amendment.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09110912000146"></a>This amendment requires that we do what 16 other European states have done&#151;ban the sale of tobacco from vending machines. The UK leads the world on many tobacco-control policies and yet in this aspect we are behind. The tobacco-vending machine industry has had at least 10 years to get the operating companies to adhere to their voluntary code to stop underage sales from vending machines and this has not been successful.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09110912000147"></a>The consequential government Amendments 11A to 11G give Amendment 11, agreed in the other place, its full effect. These consequential amendments remove all remaining references to restrictions from the vending-machine clauses and omit wording in the Bill which is not required in the context of a ban. They replicate the other amendments that were tabled by the right honourable Member for Makerfield on Commons Report but which were not reached. They ensure that Clause 22 would be workable and also align Clause 23 on Northern Ireland with England and Wales. We can confirm that Ministers in both Wales and Northern Ireland are also committed to prohibiting the sale of tobacco from vending machines in accordance with these amendments.</p>

<a name="09110912000149"></a><b><a name="91109-0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09110912000659"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, in considering the amendments before us, we find ourselves in another somewhat unusual situation. Noble Lords will remember that when the Bill underwent scrutiny in this House during the early part of this year there was an outbreak of harmony between these Benches and those of the Government when we debated the provisions for cigarette-vending machines.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09110912000150"></a>I do not want to misrepresent the views of anyone in this Chamber but no noble Lord felt it was defensible that children and young people under the age of 18 should continue to have access to cigarette-vending machines.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09110912000151"></a>I am absolutely clear that Ministers were right to seek powers in the Bill to restrict access to such machines with that thought in mind. The exercise of the power would force vending-machine operators to come up with credible and workable systems that would have the effect of denying underage would-be smokers the means of buying cigarettes in that way. Furthermore, there was a wide measure of agreement that if, after a period of time, those measures were shown not to be effective&#151;in other words, that children were still habitually gaining access to cigarettes from vending machines&#151;Ministers should consider exercising the additional power set out in the Bill to ban the machines altogether.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09110912000152"></a>That two-step approach was, I believe, proportionate and sensible. I say that for two main reasons. The first is that vending-machine operators have not been slow off the mark in responding to the challenge that they have been set. A number of technologies exist which are designed to prevent underage persons from gaining access to vending machines. Not all of them give one confidence that they will deliver in the way that they are supposed to, but at least one technology that I have personally seen demonstrated, the radio frequency control system, not only convinced me that it would work efficiently and well but is successfully in use in a number of locations. The Department of Health recommended the use of that system in its recent consultation document. I am personally as sure as I can be that the Government were right to believe that there exists a workable means of delivering the policy objective that they have set themselves.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09110912000153"></a>The second reason why I support the Government's first approach is that to proceed immediately to an outright ban on vending machines would bring about disproportionate harm and damage. The damage would be felt by pubs, which stand to lose trade from people who, from time to time, wish to access their vending machines but, more seriously, it would have an instant and devastating effect on those who depend for a living on supplying and operating such machines. There are roughly 650 people in this country whose livelihoods are earned in that way, and several hundred more in the supply chain. I do not believe that any sort of case has been made for bankrupting those individuals and putting them on to the dole queue without giving the regulatory route a chance to work.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09110912000154"></a>Parliament should contemplate taking that drastic step only when all else has failed. It is not a step that should be taken lightly. The problem is that, unless we are very careful, that step will indeed be taken lightly. The Government have allowed themselves to get into  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_607"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 607</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the position of acquiescing in the result of a debate in another place that was arrived at not after a free vote, nor even after a whipped vote, but after no vote at all. The amendment in the name of the right honourable Member Mr Ian McCartney was agreed to by default after the Government Whips failed to produce tellers. That fact puts this House into a rather different situation from the one we normally face at Lords&#146; consideration stage. In moving that the House do disagree with a Commons amendment, we are usually saying we believe that the judgment taken by another place was wrong. In this case, however, the other place did not have a chance to exercise its judgment at all. We simply do not know what the collective will of the House of Commons would have been.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09110912000155"></a>For that reason alone, it is surely right that we ask the other place at least to go through the Lobby before we put 650 people out of work. Of course, we know one thing. We know that the Government have not changed their minds on the merits of the Bill as it originally stood. How do we know that? When the Division was called in another place on the McCartney amendment, Ministers were queuing up to vote against it. The Government had not given way at that stage. Indeed, I am sure that the Minister still believes in her Government&#146;s policy. She has simply allowed herself to be persuaded that, constitutionally, it would be improper for her to carry that policy through. In moving this amendment, I am suggesting to her in the strongest terms that that view is misconceived and, indeed, that she owes it to the other place to send this matter back for further consideration. She certainly owes it to those whose jobs depend on the way that this matter is finally determined.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09110912000156"></a>I have no wish to be impertinent to the Minister or to overegg the case I am making, but if she does not give way on this, and if she were to carry a vote in her own Lobby, she and her colleagues will bear personal responsibility for the consequences that will ensue. There is still time for this matter to be sorted out before Parliament prorogues. If the other place is given another chance to determine the issue properly, and if it decides on a free vote that the McCartney amendment should stand, I will be in no position to argue. As it is, I argue very strongly indeed that the parliamentary process is in danger of being grossly subverted, which is why I beg to move.</p>

There is no doubt whatever, as every Member of this House must accept, that tobacco is a potentially lethal product. It is also highly addictive, and there is clear epidemiological evidence that once children begin to smoke, they have great difficulty in giving up the habit, although many succeed. When this issue was debated fully and extensively in Committee in your Lordships' House, many of us, including me, strongly supported an amendment to abolish the sale of cigarettes from vending machines,. However, the Government did not accept that amendment and claimed that, as an interim measure and pending further consideration, they wished to impose stricter age-verification restrictions and supervision as regards vending machines.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_608"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 608</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09110912000158"></a>They did that despite the fact that I presented evidence that in the north-east of England, from where I come, a series of trading standards officers embarked upon an exercise in which they recruited significant numbers of volunteer young people below the age of 16 and took them round a series of establishments in which vending machines were installed to see whether they would succeed in buying cigarettes. In the majority of cases&#151;60 per cent and sometimes 70 per cent&#151;the children had not the slightest difficulty in purchasing cigarettes from vending machines, contrary to the existing law. In one establishment, the landlord gave the child change to put in the machine to purchase cigarettes.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09110912000159"></a>The British Heart Foundation has recently conducted a number of surveys. It found that test purchases consistently show that young people regularly purchase cigarettes from vending machines. In 2008, 12 per cent of children and young people who were regular smokers usually bought their cigarettes from vending machines. The British Heart Foundation estimates that 23,000 11 to 15 year-old regular smokers access their cigarettes in this way. It has also conducted a more detailed survey of landlords in establishments where vending machines are available. It found that the age-verification restrictions that the Government initially proposed were viewed as unworkable and as a burden by a large number of landlords. The survey showed that nearly two-thirds&#151;63 per cent&#151;of landlords said that, during busy times, it would be impossible to check IDs and operate a machine within their line of sight. More than two-thirds&#151;68 per cent&#151;of pub landlords said that current proposals would be a significant extra burden on their business. Eighty-two per cent of landlords describe the revenue they receive from vending machines as &#147;unimportant&#148;. Three-quarters of landlords would rather remove the machine than risk prosecution for underage sales. Despite the potential deficiencies in another place to which the noble Earl referred, I think Ian McCartney did us a very good service by proposing the amendment that was accepted in your Lordships&#146; House. I trust that your Lordships will accept that amendment as tabled now by the Government and reject the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe.</p>

I was present in Committee when the noble Lord, Lord Walton, was speaking to these matters and produced the very substantial evidence for the case he has just made again today. Since then, however, something has happened. In the Bishops&#146; Bar today, I was approached by my noble friend Lady Golding, who showed me a document describing a showing in the House last week of a particular piece of equipment, which I am not as yet satisfied that MPs were aware of when they took their decision.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09110912000161"></a>I dissent from the view of the noble Earl that, where a vote has not taken place, it is not necessarily an advised opinion of the House of Commons. The fact is that, where a vote was not taken, it was because the House did not object to the measure being put before the House. It could be argued that it has considered it, and there was shown a position of unanimity, even though it was the view of the noble Earl that there were some Ministers who wanted to vote against the McCartney amendment.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_609"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 609</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09110912000162"></a>The document shown to me by my noble friend Lady Golding should be brought to the attention of this House, because the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has alluded to it. It shows that there is available in the United Kingdom, in 600 public houses in the country, a piece of equipment that is managed and operated by a person standing behind the bar. I want to go through the sequence of events, because I believe that it actually deals with all the concerns that my noble friend has alluded to, and which Ian McCartney must have had in mind when he was moving his amendment.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="09110912000267"></a>&#147;Step 1: customer requests for the machine to be enabled&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09110912000223"></a>in other words, to be made operational.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="09110912000268"></a>&#147;Eye contact is made by the member of staff&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09110912000224"></a>that is, the person behind the bar, to the customer who wishes to buy the cigarettes&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09110912000269"></a>&#147;and if necessary identification is requested&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09110912000225"></a>in other words, if the person looks underage, then obviously the bartender would not respond in the way the customer would wish.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="09110912000270"></a>&#147;Step 2: Once age verification has taken place, and the staff are certain that the person is over 18 years of age, the machine is enabled&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110912000226"></a>In other words, it is made operational.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="09110912000271"></a>&#147;Step 3: The member of staff observes the sale, to make sure it is the person whose age they have verified making the purchase.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="09110912000272"></a>Step 4: The machine is then ready for use to vend one packet to the customer.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="09110912000273"></a>Step 5: After vending one packet of cigarettes, the machine reverts to standby&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110912000227"></a>In other words, it switches off automatically. Therefore, throughout the whole process of the cigarette packet being purchased from that machine, the person behind the bar is responsible for what has happened by having control over the button which enables the machine. I presume, therefore, in those conditions, that a person under 18 would not be able to purchase cigarettes.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09110912000163"></a>I am not against what Mr Ian McCartney has suggested, but what I want to know is whether the Commons knew about this equipment when the decision was taken. They should have been aware of a system that the Government would have tested in the event that the legislation in its proposed form prior to the Ian McCartney amendment would have been passed. Were Members of Parliament aware of this equipment, of which I suspect most noble Lords were completely unaware until the noble Earl, Lord Howe, referred to it in his contribution and I outlined it in greater detail in mine?</p>

As I have said many times during the course of this Health Bill and indeed during the passage of previous health legislation, it is the hypocrisy of Her Majesty&#146;s Government that many of us find difficult to understand. I have called twice for a complete ban on the sale of all tobacco products, the logic being that if we are not meant to smoke, we should not be able to buy them. One of the most awful things about trying to ban these vending machines is that it will serve only to increase the illicit sale of tobacco in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09110912000165"></a>I should like to remind the noble Baroness that at the moment it is estimated that the Treasury loses &#163;8.5 million a day as a result of the illicit tobacco trade. To save the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, having to go to the Box, that works out at &#163;3.1 billion a year. It is for these reasons that I wholeheartedly support the noble Earl.</p>

As colleagues know, I have had the privilege of serving as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Ways and Means and I have checked on what happened that evening. To be frank, the House was in a fair degree of turmoil. It was not a considered decision made on evidence. Indeed, some of the evidence was wrong because Ian McCartney said that no product considered dangerous other than cigarettes may be vended, but alcohol can still be vended today. That was an inaccuracy in his speech.</p>

<a name="91109-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09110912000167"></a>However, that is not the point, rather it is the one made by my noble friend Lord Howe, which is that the House did not give a view one way or the other. Further to that, my friend the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours&#151;I call him that because for many years we served on the Public Accounts Committee together&#151;is right, and indeed I have been aware of the report for a while. It is based on completely new technology, and what I find confusing is that this has been done in consultation with the Department of Health. The department has been consulted and encouraged the tobacco industry, following our Committee stage, to go for this sort of development. Trading standards, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Walton, has been consulted and is in favour of this. To my knowledge, there are no trading standards officials who are not saying that this is a major development that will restrict almost entirely the underage procurement of cigarettes from vending machines. The technology is based on radio frequencies, and I am willing to lend my copy of the report to colleagues who wish to read it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09110912000168"></a>If the Department of Health, following our Committee stage and encouraged by the Minister, is co-operating on this work, and if the vending machine companies which now have not far off 1,000 of these units out in the trade, and the trade is not 80 per cent against it&#151;they are almost 100 per cent in favour, based on a much bigger sample than the 200 involved in the British Heart Foundation research before this was even mentioned&#151;then this is a changed situation.</p>

<ul><a name="09110912000275"></a>&#147;tighten up their operations to prevent underage sales of tobacco to children and young people. That is the context in which the decision was taken in another place&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 2/11/09; col. 3.]</ul>

They have joined in producing some amendments and new technical developments which are very encouraging. I hope the Minister will answer this because it seems to me that there is a terrible danger of the Department of Health having totally misled this industry, if it is not going to pay any attention to a major technical improvement of the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09110912000171"></a>It is not just a few people that we are talking about. We are in the middle of a recession and we are putting at risk 200 companies. Yes, they are small companies, SMEs, but nevertheless directly employing 650 people and indirectly, nobody knows exactly how many, but there will be a couple of thousand. What is the point of slavishly saying, the Commons voted, they did not know what they were voting about and we will put at risk all these people? The Minister has a responsibility, frankly, not to play with people&#146;s lives, at least to weigh up what her own department&#151;and she, I had thought&#151;was encouraging. You cannot, in this day and age, kill off people&#146;s livelihoods because an amendment is inadvertently voted on in another place. I plead with the Minister to recognise this situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09110912000172"></a>My noble friend Lord Howe has put forward what I think is a very reasonable suggestion and one that I think the industry would understand.

We were aware of the dangers of tobacco. It is not only children; those who are trying to stop smoking find it much more difficult when they are tempted by having vending machines there. It is part of an overall tobacco control strategy. On vending machines, I find it difficult to think that there is not another solution and that these machine manufacturers will go out of business, but I do not dispute what has been said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09110912000174"></a>As for new technology being in place, I find it difficult to believe that it has emerged since we had the debate here and that it was not in existence previously and could not have been known to the other place. Many of us in this House were very keen to see this go in and many of us were very glad to see the importance recognised of the impact on people&#146;s lives in terms of life expectancy, morbidity and the chronic disease states that we see in smokers. Anything that decreases that enormous burden on the individual, undermining their quality of life, as well as the burden to the state of the cost of their care, would have been welcomed when this amendment came from the Commons.</p>

I would not want to protract it greatly, but one has not been addressed. The argument of the noble Lord, Lord Walton, on the harm that can be caused by tobacco commends itself to most people in this House, whatever view they take about this amendment.

However, as to the proposed exception, which has been supported by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, which might be made because of a technology which has been found to make it more possible to restrict the sale of tobacco to young people, it appears to me that there is some unnecessary impracticality in that. No doubt it is technically possible, and they have explained how, but the problem appears to be that it requires the full co-operation of the vendor to be effective, and it is highly probable that the vendor will make his or her own assessment of whether the sale is likely to be uncovered. That raises a policing point. The elaboration of the enforcement of that law and the unnecessary creation of a new offence would also weigh against our rejecting the McCartney amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09110912000176"></a>My third point is that it is not for this House, although we can observe and comment on the procedures of another place, to act as a policeman. For that constitutional reason, we should be silent on this point.</p>

<p><a name="09110912000228"></a>those are the critical, operative words&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09110912000276"></a>&#147;we are committed to using the power in this Bill to prohibit cigarette vending machines altogether. We intend to introduce requirements on vending machines from October 2011 and to measure their efficacy over a period of two years. Should underage sales from vending machines remain a problem after that period we will move to ban them&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/5/09; col. 600.]</ul>
<p><a name="09110912000229"></a>That is a fair, balanced and responsible approach.</p>

<a name="91109-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09110912000178"></a>The second reason is that a blanket ban, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, pointed out, would cause much dislocation and hardship, with a number of long-established businesses going bankrupt and many hundreds of people losing their jobs at a time when unemployment is forecast to get progressively worse. I have to tell my noble friend Lady Finlay that unfortunately these machines cannot be converted to selling anything else.</p>

<a name="91109-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09110912000179"></a>The third reason is perhaps the most important, whether we happen to be on the libertarian or the restrictive side of the general smoking debate. Although we all, whichever side we are on, want to discourage under-18s from taking up smoking, the Commons amendment could be counterproductive and result in more underage people smoking than would have been the case if the clause had been left alone. The new machines referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours&#151;incidentally, they stock only legal, duty-paid

If they are banned, the cigarettes that pubs and similar places have to stock will have to be kept under the counter, loose. At busy times, hard-pressed bar staff will find it difficult to keep tabs on them. This will almost certainly be taken advantage of by wily teenagers.</p>

<a name="91109-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09110912000180"></a>Let us revert to the sensible compromise put forward by the Government six months ago and retained until quite recently, to give the new machines a trial, see if they actually work and cut down teenage smoking, and then&#151;but only then&#151;move to ban them altogether if necessary.</p>

We have plenty of evidence that cigarette vending machines are the main source of cigarettes for children. Evidence from the British Heart Foundation puts the figure at 23,000 children in England and Wales. Earlier this year, a test purchase exercise in south-west England found that 73 per cent of attempts by 15 year-olds to buy cigarettes resulted in a sale. Three-quarters of a million children under 16 take up smoking. Any attempt to reduce that is beneficial. Arguments are made about the technology that can be used; methods involving radio frequency, for example, are being promoted by the National Association of Cigarette Machine Operators. However, all technologies fail; all technologies can be got round in an attempt to get cigarettes from vending machines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09110912000186"></a>The other argument used is about the jobs that will be lost and the damage that this will do to the economy. They are the same arguments that we have heard in other debates. We were told that thousands of jobs would be lost and that all Patels would close down their corner shops because tobacco would not be displayed at the point of sale. I do not think that that has happened, so I do not buy the argument that loss of jobs will ensue. The only argument that I buy is that vending machines promote the taking-up of cigarette smoking among children. I find it very persuasive.</p>

The issue then is whether the use of vending machines can be supervised, which seems to be one purely of practicality. The survey to which the noble Lord, Lord Walton, referred stated that a majority of pub landlords said that they believed that it was an unworkable solution during busy hours within the pub.</p>

Nevertheless, there is some evidence of pub landlords believing it to be impractical. Moreover, it feels very impractical on a common-sense level, as other noble Lords have said. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, described something like five steps. It did not seem to me that the steps that he was describing were any shorter than those that it would have taken for somebody to sell somebody a packet of cigarettes without having to operate machinery across the room. On the basis of the impracticality of that solution for what is a significant problem for children, we should support the Government&#146;s amendment.</p>

We have heard this afternoon that tobacco is an addictive and dangerous drug, not only to children but to everybody else. Of course, many people accept that; I accept it myself. But the Home Secretary does not. When Professor Nutt suggested that tobacco was more dangerous than cannabis, the Home Secretary sacked him. So it is quite obvious that the Home Secretary takes a different point of view from that taken by the right honourable Mr McCartney and the Secretary of State for Health.</p>

<a name="91109-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09110912000191"></a>So where are we on tobacco? Is it so dangerous that, as Professor Nutt says, it should be made a class B or class A drug? Or is it not as dangerous as those drugs and therefore should it remain a completely unregulated substance? It is about time that we had clarity on this, although obviously we are not going to get clarity on it this afternoon. I was regularly in Grand Committee when we discussed this matter, where one decision was made virtually by unanimity, with no change in the situation made at Report. Now, however, the Government have decided to accept an amendment to their own Bill. Let us also not forget that this is a House of Lords Bill; it is not a House of Commons Bill. The House of Lords is quite entitled to insist that the Bill should be as it was when it left here. Indeed, the Government should be insisting that the Bill should be as it was then.</p>

<a name="91109-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09110912000192"></a>If we were discussing something that involved losing 650 jobs, the closure of 200 factories, making some people bankrupt and making it difficult for 70,000 public houses at a time of rising unemployment, we would all be outraged. Yet we are proposing to do this with impunity. Of course we are being told, &#147;That&#146;s rubbish&#148;. In every debate that we have had about tobacco&#151;and by God I have taken part in some of those debates during my period in this House and, indeed, in the other House&#151;we have been told, &#147;It won&#146;t  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_615"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 615</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>really affect businesses in the way you say it will&#148;. For example, when we were debating the ban on smoking in public places, we warned, because we had information from the industry, that many public houses throughout the country would close. Again, we were told that we were talking nonsense. Yet thousands upon thousands of pubs have closed up and down the country. If the prevention of smoking in public places did not have the whole effect, it certainly had a partial effect on an industry that was going through a difficult time.</p>

<a name="91109-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09110912000193"></a>We have heard about an alternative this afternoon&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, first raised it&#151;which could possibly solve the problem for everyone. Indeed, he quite rightly said that perhaps the House of Commons was not aware of this new system that has been produced at some cost to the vending machine industry. Why would we not do this?</p>

<a name="91109-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09110912000194"></a>I go back to the ban on smoking in public places. We spent a lot of time on it in Grand Committee, with a lot of expertise from various people. We could have prevented a complete ban by providing instead for the separation of smokers from non-smokers. The Government would not listen. They would not even consult the people who could provide the air-conditioning equipment that would have allowed the separation of smokers from non-smokers and helped the pubs industry through a difficult time.</p>

<a name="91109-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09110912000195"></a>I go back to where I started. For heaven&#146;s sake let the Government make up their mind about where they are going on smoking. I fear that the reason why they do not want to have a complete ban on smoking&#151;that is really what they are advocating; that is what they are after, to make it completely illegal for anybody to smoke&#151;is that they are afraid of the electoral consequences and do not want to lose the &#163;10 billion of revenue that they get from people still daring to smoke. Please let us have some honesty about this matter and not have the Government say on the one hand that smoking is bad for you but on the other hand that it is not as bad for you as cocaine or cannabis.</p>

At times I have found both to be somewhat overstated. I have therefore spent all the time we have deliberated on this Bill coming at every issue and briefing with considerable care and an open mind. I have been helped in that by the fact that now, as all the way through this Bill, our Benches have free votes on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09110912000197"></a>With some considerable relief I heard the noble Earl, Lord Howe, clarify precisely what the issue is today. The one of most concern is what happened in the Commons and the matter of Commons procedure. I do not wish to be flip at all, but if this House set itself the task of addressing every piece of legislation that had a defective passage through another place we would never go into recess. But I take the point that there was not a vote, because it is important. That is why I made it my business to talk to colleagues in another place to see whether Members there had been frustrated over it. My understanding is that they were

My honourable friends in another place are usually pretty quick to tell me about something like that. The fact that there was no vote may, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, said, suggest a frustration of the will that House, but that is the most important point on that.</p>

<a name="91109-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09110912000198"></a>I have listened with great care this afternoon to arguments on vending machines, some of which have been new and many of which have been rehearsed before. Throughout this debate we have missed one important point. Vending machines predate a whole load of other changes in society; they were there in &#147;Brief Encounter&#148;, on station platforms, when everything else for miles around was closed. These days it is extremely hard to live anywhere where there is not a shop open 24 hours a day within a manageable distance, although I accept that in some country areas that may be an overstatement. Vending machines are an anachronism&#151;a point that has been missed&#151;so why have they continued to exist? They continue to exist for the convenience of people who smoke and because the vendors of tobacco find them an effective way in which to find the new markets that they need among young people.</p>

<a name="91109-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09110912000199"></a>I did not agree with the display ban that was agreed in the Health Bill. I share the deep concerns of noble Lords that such a ban will lead to an increase in smuggling. I did not agree with some of the other measures that your Lordships&#146; House agreed to. But banning vending machines, given all the arguments put before us, is the right thing to do. It is in the interests of young people and it should happen as quickly as possible. That would be my view; whether my colleagues choose to support me is a matter for them.</p>

I speak as a self-confessed one-time tobacco addict. I hope that after 10 years of abstention, I have now kicked the habit, but I am not guaranteeing it. I accept that tobacco an addictive. I accept, in some respects, Professor Nutt, who says that it is more dangerous than cannabis or cocaine. The dilemma is, however, what we should do about it. I regret to say that some of the arguments in this House this afternoon have been, &#147;We know tobacco&#146;s bad. We know we can't stop it, but we have to be seen to do something&#148;. The instant reaction nowadays is ban it or stop it. &#147;Whether it works or not, who cares? Our conscience is clear. We have made our position quite clear that we want to stop it&#148;.</p>

<a name="91109-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09110912000201"></a>If tobacco is so serious, why do the Government not have the courage of their own convictions and ban it entirely? I would accept that. I cannot accept the argument that we should not take a course of action because of the loss of jobs. Nobody says that we should allow heroin to be continually sold on our streets or for cocaine constantly to be trafficked. There would be a loss of jobs. They may be illegal jobs, but they are still jobs. To lay all that aside, in the absence of a total ban, it is not necessary simply to do a little here or there and say that it will work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09110912000206"></a>One thing that we have not emphasised in this debate is that although this tobacco legislation is aimed at discouraging children from smoking, the people who will benefit most from children not smoking are the adults that they will become. It takes a generation or so for the pathological effects of smoking to appear. When a child starts early, he or she will not suffer very much at the time, but the addictive effects of smoking will last. As my noble friend Lord Walton said, 80 per cent of adult smokers start before the age of 19. That is the real point of this legislation. I confess an interest in that I voted for the full banning of vending machines in Committee. I feel that my right honourable friend Ian McCartney is absolutely right. The feeling of the House of Commons was very much on his side even though there was no vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09110912000208"></a>First, the Government&#146;s position on tobacco vending machines has indeed changed in light of the debate at Report stage of the Health Bill in another place. We admit that we have changed our minds, notwithstanding the quotes raised by the noble Lord, Lord Monson, when we considered the Bill earlier this year. It was an impassioned debate in another place, and it resulted in a key amendment being accepted. The intention of the amendment made in the other place was to remove the power to impose requirements on tobacco vending machines, thus allowing the Government only to prohibit cigarette sales from such machines or not. As the Secretary of State for Health said in another place, the will of the House will be respected when the Government consider how best to put it into effect. That is why the Government do not seek to overturn the amendment now.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, checked with her colleagues in another place; this was indeed helpful and exactly accords with my view. The noble Lords, Lord Monson and Lord Naseby, raised this issue. As noble Lords well know, the other place determines its own rules. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, for his comments on this. The Speaker presides over the Chamber to ensure that those rules are followed. It is not normally the Government&#146;s job to put tellers in on a free vote. The Speaker ruled on that day and <I>Hansard</I> records that decision. Yes, a Division was called off and the amendment was accepted on a shout. I can recall times when this House has had such procedures. Under similar circumstances, noble Lords have accepted that decision; it is considered a proper and valid decision of this House. I suspect that honourable Members in another place may take exception to their procedure being questioned in the way that it has been by noble Lords&#151;as, indeed, we would.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09110912000210"></a>We were asked: why not allow the vending machine companies to implement restrictions on a voluntary basis before banning them? As long ago as 1998, the <I>Smoking Kills </I>White Paper referred to the voluntary code of practice issued by the National Association of Cigarette Machine Operators to its members. This code has been revised so that the primary consideration when siting a machine is the need to prevent sales to children. Despite the NACMO code of practice, vending machines remain a significant source of tobacco for children and young people. That is why we included vending machines in the Health Bill in the first place, and why Ministers have made it clear that action will be taken.</p>

<a name="91109-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09110912000211"></a>The tobacco vending machine industry has had ample opportunity voluntarily to solve the problem of youngsters getting tobacco from its machines; it has been unsuccessful. Young people are still getting tobacco from vending machines. I met representatives of NACMO this morning because I wanted fully to understand the issues. I listened carefully to what they had to say. We are committed to making the regulations on the tobacco provisions of the Health Bill as soon as possible. There is nothing to be gained from undue delay. As I pointed out to the gentlemen I met this morning, the date would still be October 2011, which is nearly two years away. It would not be immediate. There is scaremongering among the people who run these companies that this is an immediate ban. This is not the case. The Government are taking the powers&#151;</p>

The Minister knows as well as I do that the Department of Health&#146;s recently published consultation on the proposed tobacco control regulations in England recommends the use of the RF system. Does the department accept that this is a good system and that it must move forward, or are Ministers totally blind to what their own department is finding?</p>

Of course we discussed that matter with it when we were drafting the regulations that were to be considered before the other place took its decision. We are sympathetic to small businesses that will be affected by the legislation to prohibit tobacco vending machines, but we are also concerned about how easily young people can get tobacco from vending machines. When another place considered the proposals for vending machines the competing interests were debated.</p>

The noble Lords, Lord Palmer and Lord Monson, suggested that removing vending machines would mean that more illicit tobacco would be sold in pubs and clubs. That is speculative. There is no evidence that removing vending machines will result in more illicit tobacco being sold in pubs and other venues where vending machines are commonly located. Indeed, laws are already in place to prevent premises being used for the sale of illicit tobacco and significant punishment can be imposed should that happen.</p>

My noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours referred to the technology and the equipment. The use of equipment to prevent vending machines selling cigarettes to children was an option included in the Department of Health&#146;s 2008 consultation. This is not new technology. I know that the tobacco vending industry has been active in making both your Lordships and Members of another place aware of the different options that we have. Unless Members of another place were not reading their e-mails or their post, I suspect that they would have known what options were available when they had their debate.

It is very simple: if it was, then we should vote for the McCartney amendment; if it was not, it seems to me that the Commons were unaware of this technology, which seems to me to deal with all the issues about which my noble friend is concerned.</p>

I do not have the relevant <I>Hansard</I> in front of me but I have looked through it and I know that there was a passionate debate on both sides of the issue. I would be extremely surprised if honourable Members were not aware of the technology and equipment available to solve this problem. However, as far as I can tell from the debate, they were not convinced that this would solve the problem of tobacco being available to young people from vending machines.</p>

I certainly was aware that this technology had been discussed with trading standards officers, but it does not actually change the point. We are committed to making regulations relating to tobacco under the new powers provided by this Bill. Of course, careful consideration will be given to the responses to the consultation and to complying with our EU obligations to notify draft regulations. Amendment 11 was accepted in the other place and all parties were offered a free vote. This amendment represents the will of that House. Therefore, I beg that Amendment 11 and the consequential amendments be agreed to and I ask the noble Earl, Lord Howe, to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09110923000006"></a>It is necessary to re-emphasise only two points. There is a proportionate and workable course of action open to Parliament in pursuing its wish to bear down on underage access to vending machines. That is to allow the Government to lay regulations designed to  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_621"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 621</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ensure that such access does not occur, while at the same time allowing legitimate adult smokers to purchase cigarettes from vending machines as they wish. I do not show the pessimism of the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, about this. We know that there is technology available and in use that would enable that to happen. The Government believe that, too. The Minister in another place, Gillian Merron, said during the debate on the McCartney amendment:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="09110923000096"></a>&#147;The Government believe that we can place requirements on vending machines that will be effective, proportionate and deliverable in preventing under-age sales and balance the views of all concerned&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 12/10/09; col. 109.]</p>

<p><a name="09110923000007"></a>Those of us who share that belief argue that, if government policy is to be overturned, the very least that is needed is a vote in the House of Commons. Indeed, I would argue that a vote there should be seen as necessary, irrespective of one&#146;s view on the banning of vending machines. My clear understanding is that, as the noble Lord, Lord Howie, has outlined, the other place was denied the opportunity to go through the Lobbies. I refer the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, to col. 123 of Commons<I> Hansard</I> on 12 October, which makes the position abundantly clear. I am sorry if the sensibilities of Members of another place may be troubled by our rejecting the McCartney amendment, but in my view the matter is too important for that.</p>

<a name="91109-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09110923000008"></a>It is certainly true that the competing interests were debated in the other place, but from reading the debate one can see that they were barely alluded to. The main thrust of the debate focused on tobacco displays, which are not the subject of our debate. To approve the Commons amendment today, in the absence of a Commons vote, would be to betray the 650 or so people whose livelihoods depend on being able to operate vending machines. They are men and women with families and mortgages who, in many cases, stand to lose everything if cigarette vending machines are summarily banned. If that were to happen on the back of what was, essentially, a mess-up in the House of Commons, it would&#151;</p>

That will give the people involved in the industry time to deal with matters accordingly. As the noble Baroness has said, the ban would certainly not come into effect for about two years.</p>

I am arguing that the two-stage approach, which the Government originally favoured, was the proportionate one. If we are left with the McCartney amendment and nothing else, it will be a summary ban because it is an all-or-nothing position. That is my point. I maintain that, unless we ask the other place to think again, we will have on our hands a travesty of the parliamentary process. Without apology, I therefore beg to move.</p>

<a name="91109-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09110923000012"></a>We had a full debate in the course of the Bill&#146;s passage about the private patient cap and its impacts on the National Health Service and I thank all noble Lords for their valuable and informed contributions to our discussion. I am pleased to say that Commons Amendment 12 responds to these debates and enables a designated mental health foundation trust to earn up to 1.5 per cent of its total income from income that it derives from private charges. The new clause also contains the definition of mental health foundation trusts for this purpose.</p>

<a name="91109-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09110923000013"></a>NHS foundation trusts are a growing part of the NHS. The Government are committed to ensuring that the foundation trust model becomes a dominant form of healthcare provision. We want these trusts to use their freedoms, local accountability and financial independence to innovate and improve NHS services. As noble Lords know, the intention behind the cap was to manage a potential risk that the freedoms given to foundation trusts might allow them to change their fundamental nature as NHS organisations. As the foundation trust model has evolved, it has become clear that we need to examine new ways of ensuring that the foundation trust best serves the interests of NHS patients; we absolutely accept this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09110923000014"></a>At Third Reading, I announced that the Government would embark on a policy review following the outcome of the judicial review of the current legislation. However, we have brought forward that commitment and last week commenced our review by launching a call for evidence to stakeholders both inside and outside the NHS. This is due to close by the end of the year. The Government would like to see NHS patients deriving even greater benefits from NHS foundation trusts. That is the basis of our review. This is a complex and controversial issue and only by having a fundamental and inclusive review can we ensure that consensus is reached on the solution for the long term. It will also ensure that any future solution for the long term is pragmatic, workable and achieves our fundamental purpose.</p>

<a name="91109-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09110923000016"></a>This is the first stage of a broader process to review the cap. The evidence that we receive will help to shape the direction that our policy review takes next year, which we expect to complete in the spring. We intend to follow this with a public consultation on proposals for reform, which would mean that legislation could be possible early in the new Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09110923000017"></a>Pending the outcome of the review, a compelling case has been made for one narrowly defined interim measure to address the genuine anomaly of mental health foundation trusts, all of which have caps set at zero. Mental health foundation trusts were not envisaged in 2003. This amendment addresses an unintended consequence of the legislation and one of the most commonly reported complaints about the cap. Many noble Lords and honourable Members in another place have raised this issue as a particular concern. The Government have received representations from mental health foundation trusts that say that they are unable to move forward with ideas for service development. One, for example, has said that it cannot develop novel services such as those for children with autistic spectrum disorders and acquired brain injury. This type of service provision, it says, could have national application.</p>

<a name="91109-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09110923000018"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, observed in Grand Committee, these trusts have told their representative body that they are also prevented from supporting the Government&#146;s well-being agenda. Some have written to us saying that they cannot enter into government-sponsored return-to-work activities with external contractors or provide specialist help for employees at risk of mental ill health, unlike non-foundation mental health trusts. Given the current climate, it has never been a more important time to invest in mental health. Mental health foundation trusts themselves have said that, for their service users, the ability to promote and deliver the well-being agenda would be very beneficial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09110923000019"></a>We have listened and we are acting. By enabling the application of a cap of 1.5 per cent, Amendment 12 will give our highest-performing providers of NHS mental health provision more room to innovate and support the development of further high-quality services for the NHS. The calculation of 1.5 per cent does not purport to be an exact science; it is an acknowledgement that mental health foundation trusts need some freedom. The figure is based on the average cap for acute foundation trusts in 2008-09. I stress that this is an interim solution, which will not prejudice the review&#146;s aim of a lasting solution for all foundation trusts. We believe that we should only do something now that is clearly defined and around which

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09110923000020"></a>The Government&#146;s amendment offers a pragmatic solution to the immediate anomaly of mental health foundation trusts.

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09110923000021"></a><b>Baroness Meacher:</b> I shall speak also to Amendment 14A, which seeks to build upon Amendment 14, moved in the other place by the Government. Amendment 14A will provide for a 1.5 per cent private patient cap for all foundation trusts with a cap below that level. As the Minister eloquently explained, the Government have accepted the need for a 1.5 per cent cap for mental health trusts. It is very difficult to see any logic in not extending that cap to all other foundation trusts.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09110923000022"></a>I should draw your Lordships&#146; attention to misprints in the amendment on the Marshalled List. A correction slip has been issued to clarify these points and we shall debate the amendment as on the amendment slip.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09110923000023"></a>As the Minister explained, the Government accepted the principle implied by our amendment, moved during the passage of the Bill, that there should be more rationality in the system of private patient caps and that it should be possible for foundation trusts to raise at least a little more revenue for the pressing needs of NHS patients. The significance of these matters is increasingly apparent as the results of the credit crunch and the pressure on resources in the public sector, particularly the NHS, become apparent.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09110923000024"></a>I applaud the Government&#146;s decision to institute a review of the private patient cap structure, and I particularly like the principles that the Minister set out to guide that review. The aim of the review, which is taking place immediately, is to inform a policy review that will start in the new year. The only problem with this, which the Government accept, is that they will be unable to do anything about the results of the review or introduce legislation before a general election. Therefore, foundation trusts will have to stagger on with this rather ludicrous structure of private patient caps&#151;some with 0.3 per cent, one with 30 per cent and others with 5 per cent&#151;for the indefinite future. It is difficult to argue that that makes any sense.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09110923000025"></a>I welcome, of course, the Government&#146;s amendment agreed in the other place to give mental health trusts a private patient cap of 1.5 per cent. That amendment means that mental health foundation trusts will be able to deliver additional services and, as the Minister said, employment support to benefit NHS patients. It is a good example that the cap enables positive things to be done by trusts, not only the straightforward provision of beds for private patients one might imagine. It is not like that; this issue covers all sorts of eventualities.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_627"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 627</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91109-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09110923000026"></a>However, I should emphasise that my purpose in moving amendments on the private patient cap has never been motivated by the needs of mental health trusts, particularly, and certainly not by the needs of the East London NHS Foundation Trust, which I chair. I put on record that that trust has no plans at present to undertake private patient work, although that would now be possible.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09110923000027"></a>The Foundation Trust Network has asked foundation trusts to indicate what a 1.5 per cent patient cap would mean in terms of additional revenue. It is interesting that an additional &#163;132 million would be brought into the 55 trusts which responded for the benefit of NHS patients. It is useful to think about that funding in terms of saving jobs in the NHS. If we assume a cost of &#163;40,000 per job, a 1.5 per cent cap for all foundation trusts could save about 7,000 jobs. It may be that a few mental health trusts will not take up the cap&#151;in which case 7,000 would be a slight overestimate&#151;but that would not make a huge difference. I raise the employment point because it relates to UNISON&#146;s concerns about any change to the private patient cap, and it may be particularly interested in the idea of saving 7,000 jobs per year in the NHS in the coming period.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09110923000028"></a>The other benefit of the amendment is that, for the first time, there would be a level playing field for some 75 per cent of foundation trusts. The remaining 25 per cent would have a cap above that level going back to 2002-03. That will have to be settled after the general election, when and if a new Government get round to dealing with these issues.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09110923000029"></a>During the passage of the Bill, we discussed a number of the disadvantages of the uneven and very restrictive private patient cap. I do not wish to repeat those debates except to briefly summarise a few of these problems. The Government&#146;s top-up policy is unworkable in foundation trusts without reform. The private patient cap makes it hard for some leading NHS providers to become foundation trusts. A mental health foundation wanted to buy out a private-sector competitor that was going out of business and whose services were, presumably, needed and could have been taken into the NHS. However, because there was no cap&#151;although 1.5 per cent would not have covered it&#151;that sort of initiative was simply not viable.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09110923000030"></a>Private patient income was the means by which one foundation trust bought leading-edge technology and equipment for the benefit of NHS as well as private patients. More trusts need that option, and that is going to be more and more pressing. The private patient income cap is threatening the development of cancer services to both NHS and other patients. Investment in laser dermatology for the benefit of NHS and private patients is being prevented by the current private patient cap.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09110923000031"></a>In the tight financial climate of the coming years, these restrictions on NHS services for NHS patients will only worsen. I hope the Minister will agree that this modest amendment would assist trusts to some extent while the nation waits for the results of the review and new legislation. I hope she will agree that it deserves the Government&#146;s support. I beg to move.</p>

When the Lords amendment was passed at Third Reading, the Government were not prepared to countenance a variation of the current rules on the private patient income cap because a judicial review about the operation of the cap was underway in the courts. Not only have the Government now changed their mind on that point and decided that there is no issue of principle at stake here, they have also felt able, of their own volition, to make a concession in respect of mental health trusts, as we now see in the Commons amendment before us&#151;a concession I naturally welcome.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09110923000033"></a>It is instructive to read the remarks of the Minister in another place, Mr Mike O&#146;Brien, who said on Report on 12 October:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="09110923000102"></a>&#147;We take the view that the way the system operates now is not the way we want to see it operate. It is not fair. We concede that argument immediately&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 12/10/09; col. 70.]</p>

<p><a name="09110923000034"></a>Referring to the honourable Member for Eddisbury, he said:</p>
<ul><a name="09110923000110"></a>&#147;He asks whether we have changed our mind: yes, we have. Have we considered the matter again? Yes. Have we taken the view that we can go ahead with the change now? Yes, we have&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 12/10/09; col. 77.]</ul>
<p><a name="09110923000035"></a>We are now in a strange situation. There is no issue of principle at stake any more. The Government agree that the system is not fair and needs revision; they admit they have changed their minds and accept that the system can be changed now. If all that is true, there is absolutely no argument for resisting the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09110923000036"></a>The amendment does its level best to defer to the Government by not asking for too much. In all honesty, the figure of 1.5 per cent which the Government have alighted upon as a concession to mental health trusts is completely arbitrary. One could argue that it simply perpetuates the arbitrary nature of the entire private patient income cap regime. There is absolutely no logic to the figure of 1.5 per cent, but it is the percentage that the Government now feel comfortable with. As an interim measure, this is certainly better than nothing. The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher is to be commended for advancing a proposal which is both moderate and reasonable. I find it difficult to imagine what rational argument the Minister can put up against it.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09110923000037"></a>At Third Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Warner, focused on one aspect of this issue which we would all do well to bear in mind:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="09110923000103"></a>&#147;We are moving into a financial climate where the NHS ...will need every penny that it can get to meet public expectations&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/5/09; col. 936.]</p>

<p><a name="09110923000038"></a>The noble Lord was absolutely right. The problem with doing things as the Minister suggests is that if we let this Bill go without inserting this amendment into it, it is likely to be a long time before another legislative opportunity comes before us. As the noble Baroness said, it is likely to be 2011 at the earliest before Parliament is able to revisit this matter. That is not acceptable. More to the point, the Government should not regard it as acceptable given that they now agree that the current rules cannot remain in place.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_629"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 629</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09110923000039"></a>The Government have announced a rapid review of the private patient income cap and have issued a paper calling for evidence about it from the NHS. This review is unlikely to bring much to the table because the Government already know the system needs to change pretty radically. A key point is the need to provide foundation trusts with a breathing space, which is just what this amendment would do. Some 75 per cent of existing foundation trusts have a private patient income cap of less than 1.5 per cent. A lot of trusts are not being permitted to meet the needs of their NHS patients as fully as they would like to do by investing in new services, trusts whose NHS budgets are stretched to breaking point because they are barred from generating any additional private patient income whatever.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09110923000040"></a>The perversity of the situation is well exemplified by Great Ormond Street children&#146;s hospital, which cannot apply for foundation status because if it did so it would be instantly in breach of its cap. It carries on as it is, with no restriction whatever on the amount of private patient income it can generate. Is that really what we all want?</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09110923000041"></a>Even at this late stage, it is not too late for the Government to change their mind yet again. I hope they will do so by accepting the amendment of the noble Baroness. I shall not hesitate to follow her should she choose to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="09110923000042"></a><b><a name="91109-0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09110923000612"></a>Lord Warner:</b> My Lords, I rise to support the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, to the Commons amendment. I do so as the Minister who took through this House the 2003 legislation setting up foundation trusts and imposing what I can only describe as the arbitrary private patient cap. Later I was also the Minister responsible for policy on foundation trusts but have no current public or private interest to declare in speaking to this amendment.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09110923000043"></a>I recognised at an earlier stage of this Bill that we had got the 2003 Act wrong on the private patient cap. I am pleased that my colleague, Mike O&#146;Brien, in the other place appears to have had a Pauline conversion since our discussions at Third Reading here. We also know that lurking in the background is the attitude toward private patient income and the private patient cap of UNISON and other public sector unions. They have rather forgotten that the patron saint of the NHS, St Nye of Ebbw Vale, himself wrote into the NHS founding legislation provision for trusts to obtain private patient income and indeed for NHS patients to secure more privacy by buying a space in amenity beds. There is a long tradition of using private patient income in the NHS for the benefit of NHS patients and the development of services.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09110923000044"></a>We now have a situation where some FTs have a cap of 30 per cent, some of five per cent and some zero per cent. I welcome the fact that in the other place the Government have improved the situation in relation to mental health trusts. However, this still leaves some 75 per cent of foundation trusts below that cap, according to the excellent piece of work circulated to Members of this House by the Foundation Trust Network. I find it extremely disappointing that, for reasons of  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_630"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 630</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their own, the Government are unwilling to apply the 1.5 per cent ceiling consistently across foundation trusts.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09110923000045"></a>The Foundation Trust Network&#146;s excellent briefing sets out some of the missed opportunities presented by these new, equally arbitrary, arrangements from the Government, both for foundation trusts and for NHS patients. As that briefing paper illustrates, the Government&#146;s position is a bit of an own goal in that it thwarts its own policies on well-being and top-up of NHS services.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09110923000046"></a>The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, is a moderate attempt to introduce greater coherence into the capping of FT private patient income while also protecting the interests of NHS patients. It also gives foundation trusts a good slug of additional income. I would suggest, on the Foundation Trust Network&#146;s calculations, something of the order of &#163;200 million a year in extra income, which buys quite a lot of extra services for people. As the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, mentioned, it creates extra jobs at a time of difficulty in and around public finances.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09110923000047"></a>I would be a bit more convinced about the Government's review if the Department of Health had supported Monitor rather more vigorously over the judicial review sought by UNISON. I was concerned to find that recently, the Department of Health, acting as an &#147;interested&#148; party in that judicial review, is giving evidence to the High Court supporting an even more restricted position than Monitor is in now. I do not think that that bodes terribly well for an objective review of our private patient income cap. I am sorry to be sceptical but I operate on the basis of the evidence in front of me, and I do not find that terribly convincing.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09110923000048"></a>If they had wanted to, the Government could have dealt with this legal challenge differently by acknowledging that there were problems and by setting out their plans to deal with the arbitrary and inconsistent nature of the 2003 cap. This rather last-minute call for evidence does not totally convince me. It could have been done a long time ago and the case could have been made in plenty of time for an amendment to this Bill or earlier legislation. The amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, is a practical way to improve matters while the Government make up their mind about what they want to do. I am not at all clear from the call for evidence what they want to do in this area, apart from setting out some principles with which most people would find it difficult to disagree. The amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, does good for NHS patients and FTs alike and, in a modest way, helps implementation of government policy. If she wishes to press her amendment to a Division, I shall certainly join her in the Lobby, and I encourage my noble friends to do likewise.</p>

I could not resist intervening when I heard the noble Lord, Lord Warner, say that there is a long history of the NHS taking private patients and deriving from them income that has supported the National Health Service. When I  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_631"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 631</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>became a consultant in neurology in 1958, that was perfectly true. For a time, I did part-time private practice and was able to admit private patients to the ward in my hospital. The income derived from them was substantial. Subsequently, however, I became a whole-time academic and could no longer have private patients in my ward.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09110923000050"></a>I think that the memory of the noble Lord, Lord Warner, is rather short. He may not remember that when Mrs Castle, as she was before she became Baroness Castle, was Secretary of State for Health, under pressure from the unions, a major campaign was undertaken to remove, as far as possible, all private beds from NHS hospitals. It reached a stage when there were three major hospitals in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and only one private bed was available in each hospital. I, as an academic, used to receive patients referred to me from countries across the globe&#151;even from the United States and Australia&#151;but I had to refuse to take them because there was not a private bed to which they could be admitted. That policy of the then Labour Government, under pressure from the trade unions, gave the biggest impetus to the development of private hospitals outside the NHS of any policy adopted by any Government.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09110923000051"></a>I strongly favour the public-private mix. I strongly favour the proposal that private patient income should be used to the benefit of the National Health Service. I believe that the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lady Meacher goes a long way in that direction. Personally, I would have loved to see the cap greatly increased, but I know full well that Unison would not accept it at the moment. However, I hope that the consultation on which the Minister is now engaged, and in which the Government seek to take advice, will lead to a substantial modification of the cap in the long-term.</p>

<a name="91109-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09110923000052"></a>In the mean time, as my noble friend Lady Meacher has made clear, the income derived from private patients is at the moment of benefit to foundation trusts. For that reason, her amendment, modest although it is, is a crucial development. Whatever the consultation shows, no legislation further to amend the cap is likely to come about for several years to come. I strongly support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09110923000056"></a>I have to say delicately that in tabling her amendment, the noble Baroness astonished me. I well recall her comments at Third Reading. Perhaps I may read them  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_632"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 632</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out to refresh her memory. She had been pressing for further consideration to be given to these matters. She spoke at length&#151;as did we all&#151;and gave a memorable speech, which we all recall with great interest. In response to that speech, my noble friend said:</p>
<ul><a name="09110923000111"></a>&#147;it is our intention to begin a review to address precisely how to strike the right balance between protecting NHS services for NHS patients and allowing NHS foundation trusts the flexibility they need to operate effectively in the best interests of patients. This would mean a review of the cap and appropriate action to follow ... I repeat our commitment to take forward a review following the outcome of the current judicial review. This is the most sensible way of making sure that any new approach reflects the views of those affected and enables us to test those practical solutions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09110923000093"></a>So the Government were conceding to the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher. In response to that generous offer from the Government, she said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a><a name="09110923000104"></a>&#147;When the Government are able to institute a review, we would all hope to be involved in it, contribute to it and support it. Then, if possible, a consensus can be found through a good consultation process in which all the issues can be resolved, and a set of principles wider than we are able to deal with today can be put into a future Bill&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/5/09; col. 939-40.]</p>

<p><a name="09110923000094"></a>In other words, she fully supported the review that my noble friend was offering at Third Reading. It is no longer a question of the review being in the future, it is now in the past. The decision has been taken and the review is in place.</p>

On all sides of the House, we recognise that this is an interim measure. We still have 25 per cent of foundation trusts with variegated private patient caps. Clearly, that is not sensible or useful. Ultimately, 1.5 per cent may not be the right figure, but I think that there is a general understanding across the country that the present completely illogical and inconsistent private patient cap is unhelpful for all concerned. This modest amendment is an attempt to improve matters in the interim, pending the result of the review and, no doubt, ultimate legislation in a few years&#146; time.</p>

I argue that the interim measure is the concession on mental health trusts. My noble friend is breaching the wider principle of extending the amendment to the cap right across all National Health Service foundation trusts in the United Kingdom. I choose my words delicately, but she is making a mockery of her acceptance of the very generous offer that my noble friend made at Third Reading. I have argued repeatedly in the past that this is a sensitive matter for the Commons. In the event that these matters are to be dealt with, they should be dealt with in primary legislation in the House of Commons in a Bill that goes through all its stages in the House of Commons, not be dropped in at the last moment at the fag end of a Bill, which effectively gives the House of Commons only one opportunity to debate it. The House of Commons is being denied the right comprehensively to consider this very sensitive issue. I reject this amendment, and I hope the House does too.</p>

We now have Monitor, terms of authorisation, the mandatory services schedule, contract variations with PCTs, boards of governors on significant decisions, asset disposal locks and consultation. There is now a framework to ensure that the NHS acts appropriately. I can understand the feelings of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, but, with a very strong socialist philosophy, one wants to be careful to retain the fairness, the equity and all the things that the NHS stands for. I want to persuade him that in the six years that have elapsed since foundation trusts were established, we have enabled the NHS to do that through the measures I mentioned.</p>

<a name="91109-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09110923000060"></a>I find the logic of this very hard to grasp. Perhaps I am being cynical, but I remember from when I was on the Front Bench that when you are in a hole, you instigate a review. If you have a general election coming up, it is an even better thing to do if you have a policy that is unpopular with your colleagues, your Back Benchers and the trade unions. What is being proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, is sensible, logical and fair. It is interim in that 1.5 per cent is arbitrary, but at least we are getting to a greater degree of parity, which the NHS needs. I am working with the NHS a lot at the moment, and there is real concern about the financial situation it is facing. If this brings more money into the National Health Service, we should welcome it.</p>

<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="09110923000061"></a><b><a name="91109-0009.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09110923000620"></a>Baroness Barker:</b><b></b>One thing that has not changed in the past six years is that the best children's hospital in Europe, if not the world, is not a foundation trust. That is not insignificant because part of the problem with this debate is that it is wholly out of context. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, tried to allude to the complex discussions around the establishment of foundation trusts. What he did not say, although it is right, is that at that time the ability to do private patient work was one of many inducements to make trusts become foundation trusts. In totality, people began to baulk at the extent to which the Government&#146;s policy of foundation trusts was being introduced.</p>

<a name="91109-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09110923000062"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, is to be commended for taking something that is arbitrary and inconsistent and replacing it with something that is arbitrary but consistent. That provides the answer as to why this can be only a temporary measure. It is not principled&#151;I do not think the noble Baroness makes any claim that it is principled&#151;nor is it worked out on the basis of any kind of sustainability. It is just an interim fix to enable some foundation trusts to generate more income. Are we prepared to put up with that in the context? With some reluctance, I think I am.</p>

<a name="91109-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09110923000063"></a>I am not persuaded by some of the arguments that have been made about foundation trusts and their need to generate income. I would be more compelled by them if that argument applied to all NHS trusts. The key part of this amendment is subsection (2A) which states that any powers to raise money from private patient income,</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_634"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 634</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="09110923000112"></a>&#147;must be exercised subject to the principle that the provision of goods and services in return for private charges must in all circumstances be in the interests of the National Health Service&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09110923000095"></a>That is what is important. Whether this amendment will achieve what in practice has been difficult to achieve, and sometimes impossible to achieve, since 1948, I am not sure. That is why there is a case for having a thoroughgoing review of this matter. I have no doubt that an incoming Government of whatever hue will not leave this one alone. I am not given to betting, but if I were, I would suggest that in three years&#146; time, there will be a completely different proposal before your Lordships' House. However, as a very interim measure, I am prepared to accept, albeit with some reluctance, the argument put by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher.</p>

<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="09110923000064"></a><b><a name="91109-0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09110923000621"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> My Lords, the debate today has shown that this area remains complex. There are a multitude of valuable views and principles that must be balanced. Amendment 14A, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, seeks to raise the level of cap for all foundation trusts to at least 1.5 per cent and introduces a safeguard that private patient activity must in all circumstances be in the interests of the health service. The noble Baroness and I agree that there is a clear case for reform, and I admire the fervour with which she has put her case throughout several debates on this issue. We differ on the means of achieving that aim.</p>

<a name="91109-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09110923000065"></a>The government amendment seeks to provide an interim flexibility for a tightly defined class of foundation trusts that find themselves in a unique position. They as a class are unable to undertake any innovative work or private work or provide any additional private drugs and are prevented from supporting the Government&#146;s well-being agenda. This temporary measure will provide flexibility for these trusts while a full review of the cap is undertaken for all foundation trusts. We have already begun this process with a call for evidence to the NHS and other stakeholders, and we expect to complete the review process by spring. The noble Baroness illustrated the need for a thoroughgoing review. The reason we have not gone further in our amendment is that the risk of unintended consequences is significant and the advantages of developing a solution using the expertise within the NHS are compelling. We do not want to end up once again in our current position with a judicial review on the interpretation of rules ongoing at the same time as the rules are in need of reform.</p>

<a name="91109-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09110923000066"></a>I also regret to say that this amendment presents serious technical difficulties that we would not want to see in law. The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment attempts to introduce a safeguard that, on the face of it, we could all agree with. However, the safeguard also serves to show how difficult this area is. It requires that the private patient activity must in all circumstances be in the interests of the National Health Service. Wording of this type currently exists in legislation and could be a useful guiding principle when considering reform of the cap. However, in this instance, it is legally problematic for three reasons.</p>

<a name="91109-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09110923000067"></a>First, a foundation trust is already required by its authorisation to abide by its principal purpose of providing goods and services for the purpose of the  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_635"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 635</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>health service in England. This is a different test from that proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, and it is not clear what Monitor would be expected to do to give effect to the principle as expressed in the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment in addition to the existing requirement.</p>

<a name="91109-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09110923000068"></a>Secondly, the phrase &#147;in the interests of the health service&#148; is currently used only where legislation needs to be deliberately vague. The issue we are debating here is not one of those cases, and the lack of clarity means that the amendment fails to achieve the protection that the noble Baroness desires. The &#147;interests of the National Health Service&#148; is open to several interpretations. Noble Lords can conceive of an argument that it is in the interests of the National Health Service to prioritise private patients to attract talent for a wider benefit, whereas another interpretation might be that prioritising private patients to the detriment of NHS patients is not ever in the interests of the National Health Service.</p>

<a name="91109-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09110923000069"></a>Thirdly, the use of the phrase &#147;National Health Service,&#148; rather than the established legal term &#147;health service&#148;, introduces uncertainty as to whether the amendment is aimed at the interests of the health service in England and Wales, just England, or those of the National Health Service in Scotland or health services in Northern Ireland. The amendment would create legal uncertainty in an area that has already attracted litigation. It is precisely what the Government&#146;s review process aims to avoid. By conducting a thorough review, the Government hope to avoid such complications and present to Parliament a solution that could secure a sensible future for our foundation trusts once and for all&#151;a future that gives them freedom to innovate for the benefit of NHS patients within clearly defined rules that ensure that their fundamental public service nature remains unchanged.</p>

<a name="91109-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09110923000070"></a>Perhaps I may turn to some of the questions asked by noble Lords. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, said that the 5.1 per cent is arbitrary. That number is based on the average cap&#151;</p>

There is a difference between giving mental health foundation trusts some flexibility where they have none, and changing the basis of the cap for all foundation trusts. There would need to be a proper review before making any wholesale change. This needs to be worked out with the NHS.</p>

<a name="91109-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09110923000073"></a>The noble Earl said there was no issue of principle at stake any more. The principle of this is that wide-ranging change should take place with full consultation and consideration of the complex details, particularly given the divergence of strong views on this matter.</p>

<a name="91109-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09110923000074"></a>My noble friend Lord Warner said that the concession did not deal with the arbitrary caps for acute foundation trusts. When MPs and Peers voted through the proposals in 2003, they knew that the cap would vary in an arbitrary way among acute foundation trusts. Mental Health foundation trusts were not conceived of in

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09110923000075"></a>My noble friend also raised the Government&#146;s position on judicial review. The Government&#146;s position has to be founded on the formulation of the current law. We cannot advocate a flexible interpretation if it is not consistent with the legislation that exists at the moment. The issue under discussion today is how best to fix this for the future.</p>

<a name="91109-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09110923000076"></a>In conducting our review of the cap, we are already seeking evidence widely from the NHS and others. We are committed to involving stakeholders at every step of our policy development, and the development of this concession was no different. It was developed through consultation with the parties concerned, including the trade unions.</p>

<a name="91109-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09110923000077"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, raised the issue of new developments such as Monitor and things being different now from the way they were in 2003. The same legislation that established foundation trusts also established Monitor, governors, terms of authorisation and all the other developments that the noble Baroness cites and supports so well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09110923000080"></a>The Government have already begun their review of this policy and are committed to reform. The amendment seeks to address a genuine anomaly while recognising that the risk of unintended consequences is such that further change must be made only on the most informed of bases and be developed with the NHS. It is important to repeat that this is a technically flawed amendment. The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, and I share the same goal, and indeed it is shared by many noble Lords. I hope that the House will agree that the Government&#146;s way forward presents the best opportunity to secure a viable, long-term solution for foundation trusts. On that basis, I respectfully ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

The proposed amendments seek to correct a mistake that has recently come to light and which was made in the Health Act 2006 and which has been consolidated into the National Health Service Act 2006. Commons Amendments 13 and 25 repeal Section 180(2)(c) of the National Health Service Act 2006 while Commons Amendment 15 provides for the new clause set out in Amendment 13 to come into force at the end of a period of two months beginning on the day that this Bill receives Royal Assent and becomes an Act.</p>

<a name="91109-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09110923000088"></a>Since the introduction of the optical voucher scheme in 1986, government policy relating to the vouchers has been consistent across Administrations. The policy has been that eligibility for NHS optical vouchers should be targeted at children and those in receipt of qualifying income related benefits or who need a complex appliance. People aged 60 or over are currently included among those who may be eligible for help on low income grounds or who may need a complex appliance. However, the change introduced by the National Health Service Act 2006 extended eligibility for optical vouchers by mistake to all people aged 60 or over regardless of income. The records show that it was not referred to in the Explanatory Notes, was not discussed during the passage of the Bill through Parliament, and was not the subject of impact assessment or consultation. It was quite simply a mistake made during the process of preparing the draft Bill. Ministers have apologised to the Commons for this mistake and I apologise to noble Lords also. The proposed amendments seek to correct the mistake and reinstate the legislation to reflect what has been a longstanding policy of the Government and what was our intention at the time; namely, that the entitlement should remain unchanged.</p>

<a name="91109-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09110923000089"></a>We remain of the view that help with the cost of optical appliances through the NHS voucher scheme should be targeted on those most in need, as this represents the best use of NHS funds. We recognise that people aged 60 or over have an increased risk of eye disease, and because of this, those aged 60 or over are eligible for NHS-funded sight tests. This entitlement continues and is unaffected by the proposed amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09110949000002"></a>&#147;In the summer, we published the low-carbon transition plan, which explained how we would meet our commitments to carbon reduction for 2020 and beyond. New infrastructure is being provided for the coming years, with 20 gigawatts under construction or  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_641"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 641</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consented&#151;more than that which will close by 2018. However, to meet our low-carbon energy challenge, and due to the intermittency of wind, we will need significantly more generating capacity in the longer term. Over the next 15 years to 2025, one-third of that larger future generating capacity must be consented and built. Given this challenge, the imperative of reform in the planning system is clear.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09110949000003"></a>The current system is characterised by duplication, with several bodies responsible for different aspects of consent, overlapping responsibilities of politicians and independent decision-makers, and delay. Today, to guide the decision-making of the new Infrastructure Planning Commission, we are setting out for consultation six draft policy statements on energy, most importantly those for the trinity of fuels of our low-carbon future: renewables, nuclear and clean fossil fuels. We need them all in the long term because the challenge of the low-carbon transition is so significant.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09110949000004"></a>We need renewables: they are a home-grown and plentiful source of supply, already powering 2 million homes in the UK. Nuclear is a proven, reliable source of low-carbon energy and an important base load in the system. Fossil fuels, with carbon capture and storage, will enable flexible peak load response. Last year we saw offshore wind generation increase by two-thirds and onshore wind generation by one-quarter, but we need to significantly increase the rate of progress to meet our objective of 30 per cent of our electricity coming from renewables by 2020.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09110949000005"></a>The national policy statement on renewables covers onshore renewables over 50 megawatts and offshore wind over 100 megawatts. Other onshore decisions remain with local authorities. The policy statement seeks to strike the right balance between achieving national objectives and avoiding adverse impacts on the local environment and biodiversity. While the Government set out the framework in the national policy statements, each application will be decided on by the independent IPC. The IPC will have to take account of regional and local plans, drawn up by local authorities, and developers will have to ensure that they have consulted locally before any application is made, with local authorities submitting local impact reports. The Infrastructure Planning Commission will make its decisions on the basis of a clear timetable of a year from the acceptance of an application to a decision. This system is right for energy security&#151;by meeting our commitments on renewables, we can limit the need for gas imports, holding them at 2010 levels for the rest of the decade. It is also the right thing to do for our environment, because there is no bigger threat to our countryside than climate change.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09110949000006"></a>Even on our ambitious targets for renewables, however, there will be a need, on the estimates that we are publishing today, for additional non-renewable power&#151;we need to use all available low-carbon sources. That is why we were right last year to end the moratorium on new nuclear in this country. In response, energy companies have announced intentions to build 16 gigawatts of new nuclear power.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09110949000007"></a>In the spring, we invited comments on the 11 sites that had been nominated for new nuclear power stations, all on or near existing nuclear sites. I can tell the  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_642"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 642</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>House that 10 of the 11 sites have been judged as potentially suitable and included in the draft policy statement. The next step will be consultation in the 10 selected sites as well as nationally. The consultation proposes that the 11th site, Dungeness, should not be included in this national policy statement. This is because the Government do not believe, following advice from Natural England and others, that a new nuclear power station can be built there without causing an adverse effect on the integrity of the internationally unique ecosystem.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09110949000008"></a>Under the habitats directive, we are obliged to consider alternative nuclear sites. An independent study has suggested that three&#151;Kingsnorth, Druridge Bay and Owston Ferry&#151;are &#145;worthy of further consideration&#146;. We have concluded, however, that all of them have serious impediments and none is credible for deployment by the end of 2025, the period of the policy statement; nor do we believe that they are necessary for our plans for new nuclear. Therefore, we have excluded all of them from being potential sites in the draft policy statement.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09110949000009"></a>On waste management, the Government are satisfied that, on the basis of the science and international experience, effective arrangements to manage and dispose of the waste from new nuclear power stations can be put in place. In addition, today we are opening consultation on the proposed regulatory justification for two different reactor designs. New nuclear is right for energy security and climate change and will be good for jobs, too, creating up to 9,000 jobs to build and operate power stations at each site and helping leading companies to access the international market.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09110949000010"></a>As well as renewables and nuclear, the third part of our low-carbon future is clean fossil fuels. There is no solution to the problem of climate change either at home or abroad without a solution to the problem of coal&#151;cheap and reliable, but the most polluting fuel. Already from the European budget, &#8364;180 million has provisionally been offered to assist Hatfield power station to fit CCS. I can confirm that we have received bids from E.ON and Scottish Power for the next stage of the current CCS competition for a post-combustion power station.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09110949000011"></a>Early next year, we will allocate the up to &#163;90 million set aside for the next bid or bids that will go forward to the detailed design and engineering stage. Our aim is for carbon capture and storage to be ready to be deployed 100 per cent on all new coal-fired power stations by 2020. We are determined to ensure that, with the right combination of regulation and incentives, we make this happen. So I can confirm that, under our new framework published today, there will be no new coal-fired power stations without CCS.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09110949000012"></a>With immediate effect, to gain development consent all new coal plant will have to show that it will demonstrate CCS from the outset on around 400 megawatts of total output. Our plans are based on up to four projects between now and 2020, including up to two post-combustion projects and up to two pre-combustion projects. The pre-combustion demonstration projects are expected to have 100 per cent CCS on their coal capacity from day one. The post-combustion projects will be expected to retrofit CCS to 100 per cent of  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_643"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 643</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their capacity within five years of 2020, enforced by the Environment Agency, with a review to confirm this by 2018. If we conclude at that time that CCS will not be proven, we believe that further regulatory measures will be required to restrict emissions from these plants, such as an emissions performance standard.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09110949000013"></a>Even with the right regulation, though, if we leave the funding of CCS simply to private companies, it will not happen in time. To make CCS financially viable, our proposed energy Bill contains powers to introduce the levy announced in the Budget by the Chancellor to support demonstration. Responding to points made in the consultation, the levy will also be available to support the move to 100 per cent retrofit of CCS. Taken together, these policies are the most environmentally ambitious set of coal conditions of any country in the world and they provide the opportunity for Britain to create thousands of jobs in carbon capture and storage throughout our country.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09110949000014"></a>On coal, nuclear and renewables, the aim of the NPS is clear: consistent with the advice of the Committee on Climate Change, we need to be on course for the long-term goal of near-zero carbon emissions from power. Alongside the overall policy statement and those for nuclear, renewables, fossil fuels and gas storage, we are also publishing the policy statement for electricity networks.

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09110949000015"></a>In every area&#151;onshore and offshore wind and other renewables, nuclear and clean fossil fuels&#151;there will be people who wish to oppose specific planning applications. Their voice must be heard in the process. The planning process must ensure that we consent the right projects in the right sites. But while, of course, we need a process that can turn down specific applications, saying no everywhere would not be in the national interest. As a country, we need nuclear, renewables and clean coal for our energy future. They are necessary for security of supply, tackling climate change and the future of our economy. That is why we are reforming the planning system and publishing our statements today. I urge all sides of the House to unite behind these proposals and I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.</p>

The question that the Minister should answer is: why did this Labour Government leave it so late to act?</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09110949000017"></a>The Statement is made necessary by the Government&#146;s admission in July that they expect power cuts in 2017. The cause of this national emergency is obvious: for over 12 years, 15 successive Energy Ministers&#151;a new one every nine months&#151; behaved like the ostrich and stuck their head in the sand rather than face up to the action that was needed to address our energy black hole. Did the Government know that most of our nuclear power stations would reach the end of their planned life before 2017? Was anyone in this Administration informed that North Sea oil and gas production would peak and fall away? Did anyone tell

Every one of the measures contained in this Statement should have been brought forward 10 years ago when the Government had their chance to secure the investments that are so desperately needed to keep the lights on, keep prices down and cut carbon emissions. Why leave it so late?</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09110949000018"></a>On the planning statements themselves, we support the Government. We agree that it is right to create a fast-track planning process for large infrastructure projects, with a dedicated secretariat and time-limited decisions. Does the Minister agree, however, that the final decision should be taken not by an unelected, unaccountable official but by a Minister accountable to Parliament?</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09110949000019"></a>Nuclear must be part of a diverse energy mix, provided that it is commercially viable, but does the Minister accept that it is now too late for new nuclear to come on stream fast enough to replace our current capacity before it shuts down and that this will increase our dependence on gas imports until at least 2020?</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09110949000020"></a>On coal, will the Minister confirm that the large combustion plant directive will close a third of our coal capacity but, since it was agreed by the Government in 2001, not a single carbon capture and storage plant has been authorised to replace it? Is 2014 still the date by which any entry in the Government&#146;s CCS competition must be up and running, or will the Minister confirm what the industry tells us&#151;that it has had to be put back yet again?</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09110949000021"></a>On renewables, Britain has the lowest proportion of energy from renewable sources of any EU country apart from Malta and Luxembourg. As the Secretary of State intends again to entertain his colleagues in another place by blaming the gaping hole in our energy supply on rural district councils rather than on the void in energy policy, why the Government have not proposed reforms in their Statement to allow communities to benefit from wind farms is beyond me.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09110949000022"></a>Britain&#146;s consumers and businesses will pay through the nose for the last-minute scramble that the Secretary of State has announced today to cope with the blackouts that he predicted in July. Maybe the Minister will explain, clearly and simply, why the Government have allowed us to get into this state. Perhaps he will accompany his response with an apology to the British people for 12 years of negligence, for which we are now paying the price.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09110949000024"></a>One of the things that slowed me down on my way was the large number of great tomes that have come out, which I find rather bizarre. The statement seems to have two purposes: the first is to print a large number of documents that we have to read in great haste, and the second, of course, is to give the go-ahead to the nuclear sites. Much of the statement is about nuclear new-build, and the Government are keen to give the go-ahead to the 10 new sites. These documents  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_645"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 645</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>had to be published to meet the legal requirement before the sites can be approved but, from the tone of the statement, you would not put your money on being an opponent of any of those sites being built. It gives the impression that any opposition will be completely pointless.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09110949000025"></a>I am not a BANANA&#151;that is a great expression that I heard recently, Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anyone&#151;but we will need to look at a mixed bag. Of course we on these Benches do not believe that nuclear is the option.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09110949000026"></a>I have two questions, which I have raised on numerous occasions. I am speaking on the Front Bench because my noble friend Lord Teverson could not be here today, but in my former capacity I usually made this point, and now I have the opportunity to make it again: nowhere does the document mention where geological storage of the waste has been considered, and that problem does not seem to have been addressed. The second important issue is that, although the sites have been approved, we still have no indication of what type of reactor we are looking at. It would be interesting if a planning decision were being taken without the type of reactor that was to be approved having been settled on.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09110949000027"></a>Other aspects of the policy statements are to be welcomed. There are obvious implications for climate change from the use of coal, but we have long argued that the implementation of carbon capture and storage is vital and so we welcome the statements. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, pointed out, carbon capture and storage is still on the drawing board. I noted with interest use of the expression &#147;carbon capture ready&#148; rather than &#147;it will be in place before build&#148;. When a new energy Bill comes forward, will the Government look at the rather unfortunate implication of the Crown Estate having a legal obligation to make as much money as possible out of the sea bed? It will add considerably to the cost of any carbon capture and storage, and it seems rather strange that the Government should be giving with one hand and taking with the other.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09110949000028"></a>Much energy is being spent on nuclear, but the thin document on networks infrastructure is not as comprehensive as it could be. Infrastructure needs to be addressed far more closely, because it seems to fall outside the remit of many of the White Papers that have gone forward. There is a real issue here: most infrastructure is more than 30 years old and will need to be replaced. Do the Government have a figure for the replacement of the high-level line infrastructure?</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09110949000029"></a>The document on renewable energy, although I was speed-reading it, looks extremely good and will be helpful, although it seems that the size that a wind farm needs to be to fall within the remit is great, especially for onshore wind. That would be particularly unfortunate. I am a great advocate of wind turbines. Some are soon to be built very close to me and I am rather looking forward to it, which makes me unusual, it seems&#151;in this House, anyway. The level at which the policy kicks in is extremely high.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09110949000030"></a>Among the other renewables in the document, there seems to be a glaring omission. Although the burning of biomass and incineration are mentioned, anaerobic

I must declare a pecuniary interest: I am the chairman of the Anaerobic Digestion and Biogas Association, a worthy body&#151;under the new rules, one is allowed to speak about one&#146;s interest if it has a wider context, which this does. Anaerobic digestion is, we believe, capable of producing 20 per cent of our domestic gas. If 1,000 plants are built, which most of the experts believe is possible, it would account for a build of &#163;5 billion, most of it coming from the private sector, and deal with energy security. It is unfortunate that it has been left out of the document. Why are the Government not focusing a great deal more on this important subject?</p>

I do not accept the noble Baroness&#146;s analysis of the Government&#146;s approach to energy policy, nor her rather alarmist statement about potential blackouts later in this decade. The Government have taken a strong strategic role. The fact that we are here today with the draft national policy statements is an indicator of that. The fact that we have led the way in terms of grid reform, that we have given the green light to new nuclear and clean coal, and that we have challenging targets for renewables is clear evidence of a Government who have got energy policy right and will drive it forward with determination over the years ahead.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09110949000036"></a>On whether we have enough electricity generation, as the Statement said, great progress is being made. Two gigawatts of capacity has been constructed this year; another eight gigawatts is under construction; another 10.5 gigawatts has been consented to. Of course, we cannot be complacent, but a lot of good work is being undertaken.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09110949000037"></a>The noble Baroness welcomed the overall thrust of the changes being made to the planning system, but she was concerned that Ministers would not take the final decisions in relation to individual applications. That is quite deliberate; we have seen it appropriate to have a separation whereby Ministers make decisions in relation to the national policy statements after scrutiny by Parliament&#151;it is right for Ministers to make the policy&#151;but where individual planning decisions are made by an independent body. That separation is likely to lead to greater public confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09110949000038"></a>On coal, we are still in a position to be a world leader. We still hope that the 2014 demonstration deadline will be achievable; two bids are in the process for the first competition; I have taken part in a number of international discussions about CCS; and there is a determination to see a considerable number of scaled-up projects developed. There is no possibility of meeting the emission reduction targets which we have set and

I agree that it is important that we should be a leader.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09110949000039"></a>On renewables, it is true that we started from a low base, but we have made great progress in recent years. Electricity generation through renewables reached more than 5 per cent in 2008; we want to build on that. However, clear concern has been expressed about the record of local authorities, particularly those represented by the noble Baroness&#146;s own party, in refusing many applications. The NPSs are obviously concerned with nationally significant infrastructure projects, but they set the parameters within which local planning decisions will be made. It is very important to bear that in mind.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09110949000040"></a>I welcome the general comments of the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale. I readily admit that there are a considerable number of documents which will need to be considered very carefully. He focused particularly on the nuclear NPS and implied that, because we decided that we should do a lot of the assessment work around individual sites to present in the NPS, it means that decisions are a fait accompli. I must resist that interpretation. It is laid down that each application has to go through due process. I am confident that the IPC will go through all the processes that need to be gone through. We believe that the inquisitorial, as opposed to the adversarial, approach will allow local people rather better involvement in decisions than under the old system. I was reminded of the public inquiry that occurred in relation to Sizewell B, which I understand took more than 300 days of public hearings, only 30 or so of which were concerned with local issues. I reassure the noble Lord that the process will be vigorous. We can expect stakeholders and interested parties to look carefully at the way in which the whole process is undertaken. It is important to reflect that if local people have objections they will be allowed to express them much more coherently, transparently and easily than in the past.</p>

<a name="91109-0010.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09110949000041"></a>On CCS, the noble Lord made an interesting comment about the Crown Estate. It is probably beyond my remit to discuss the terms under which the Crown Estate must produce income. However, I always welcome debate and transparency about the doings of the Crown Estate and I would not discourage him from allowing us to debate those matters in due course. Of course, he will be aware of the Crown Estate&#146;s very important role at the moment in terms of the licensing regime for wave and tidal power, which is very important indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09110949000042"></a>On waste management, the noble Lord probably missed the point from the Statement that we are satisfied that on the basis of the science and international experience, effective arrangements to manage and dispose of the waste from new nuclear power stations can be put in place. On the issue of reactor designs, we have today opened consultation on the proposed regulatory justification for two different reactor designs and clearly we will invite comments on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09110949000044"></a>As far as the electricity infrastructure is concerned, the NPS does refer to the Electricity Network Strategy Group report, <I>Our Electricity Transmission Network: A Vision for 2020</I><I>,</I> regarding increases in generation and changes in direction.

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09110949000045"></a>As far as anaerobic digestion is concerned, the noble Lord knows that I, too, have a considerable interest in that. It does have great potential. Whether we can go as far as his estimate is another matter. I am grateful that he gave me a little notice of this, because I am advised that anaerobic digestion is covered in section 2.57, which refers to biomass and waste combustion. It refers specifically to biogas, sewage, sludge and animal manure. These are all technologies associated with anaerobic digestion. I hope the noble Lord is reassured.</p>

As far as consultation is concerned, in a sense we have a consultation on the national policy statement, but also there will be a site-specific consultation that will take place during this consultation period.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="09110949000136"></a>&#147;That is why we were right last year to end the moratorium on new nuclear in this country&#148;.</p>

The phrase used then was &#147;keeping the nuclear option open&#148;. That they can now seek to take credit for deciding to move forward with nuclear actually passes understanding, and I would have thought that there might have been some greater sense of shame that so much time on this has been wasted.</p>

<p><a name="09110949000133"></a>I had been given to understand that in fact there was going to be a justification statement made today, alongside the six documents which the Government have published. As I understand the matter, the justification is required under the 1996 Euratom BSS Directive 96/29, and is implemented in regulations made in this country, the <I>Justification of Practices Involving Ionising Radiation Regulations 2004</I><I>.</I> Is this document that the Government have referred to in their Statement that justification, or is it yet another preparatory stage before there can be justification?</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09110949000052"></a>I am asking this question&#151;and I am sure Ministers have been warned of this by their officials&#151;because the legal challenge that they are likely to face from some of the diehard anti-nuclear brigade is going to centre on this justification document.

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09110949000055"></a>Why do they put &#147;House of Commons&#148; in these documents? In fact, the Planning Act contains in Section 9 a provision indicating that this House will have as much say in the discussion of the applications and the advice to the IPC as the other place. What is the purpose of being deliberately provocative towards Members of this House by putting the words &#147;House of Commons&#148; in these documents? They are pandering to those in the other place who have always disliked this House. I find it very shaming that Ministers should yield to that sort of temptation.</p>

I do not agree with his analysis or the implication that the Government have delayed making key decisions on energy. However, he knows that I share his view of the importance of nuclear energy. We now have a great opportunity to go forward with a great deal of confidence and look forward to a hugely positive impact in jobs, skills and investment in the nuclear sector.</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09110949000057"></a>The justification is in the consultation that we have issued. The noble Lord is right that regulatory justification is a process required under the Justification of Practices Involving Ionising Radiation Regulations 2004. I understand his frustration; he thinks that, because it is a consultation, it will delay the statement of justification. However, we are doing this for the very reason that he mentioned&#151;the potential for this to be looked at very carefully by all sorts of stakeholder interests. We must ensure that we get it right, which is why we think it better to have a consultation first before we make the formal statement.</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09110949000058"></a>On what is contained in these documents, where it says that it is presented to the &#147;House of Commons&#148;, the noble Lord has me bang to rights. He is quite right; the Planning Act is clear that it is a statement that should be made to Parliament. A mistake has been made and, as Minister, I accept responsibility. I apologise to the House. My understanding is that we are printing new sheets to be pasted in to the documents to make sure that that is clear. I assure him that it was a mistake and not a deliberate effort to undermine the role of this House in these matters. I fully expect that there will be an opportunity for us to debate, perhaps at some length, the national policy statements as part of parliamentary scrutiny. I have no hesitation in apologising to the House.</p>

I see no detail&#151;obviously I have not had the chance to spend very long on it&#151;about how that consultation of the citizen is to be carried out. I am provoked by the misprint only to ask the Minister whether he does not believe that the NPS justifies long and detailed scrutiny and not simply a debate. More importantly, what is the process for consulting people outside this building? Planning policies in the past have regularly set out in detail the process of consultation. Although it is referred to in debate, there seems to be no indication of how the consultation is to be taken forward and how people are to respond to it. What we have heard is a Statement from the Dispatch Box this afternoon that the Government will drive forward their policy with determination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09110949000061"></a>There will be parliamentary scrutiny. I mentioned the word &#147;debate&#148;;. it is entirely a matter for the House to decide how it wishes to scrutinise the national policy statements. In the Commons it is likely to be through a Select Committee, which one would expect to produce a report to which the Government would have regard, and the committee can recommend a debate in the House. In this House, it is very much a matter for the House to decide.</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09110949000062"></a>We are holding five events in different parts of the country to encourage the public and communities to respond to the consultation; we have commissioned an organisation called Planning Aid to publish leaflets setting out background information; and we are making it easy for people to respond on the website. I assure the noble Baroness that we want the consultation to be successful and that the Government will consider very carefully the responses made. However, we should not underestimate that a very important part of this process is parliamentary scrutiny, which is very much in the hands of Parliament.</p>

In my capacity as chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association, I was getting rather impatient because of the delays. However, I well understand the need for the delays. This is an area in which we might well see vexatious litigation emerging as a major barrier to progress.</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09110949000064"></a>The comprehensive character of the Statement and its balanced nature, including not only nuclear but renewables and the potential&#151;albeit somewhat long-term&#151;for coal, is to be welcomed. It is flexible and pragmatic on nuclear sites, but our friend in the other House, Malcolm Wicks, the former Energy Minister, has indicated that we would have not only replacement nuclear generation capability but also an increase to something of the order of 40 per cent of the generating capability of this country accounted for by nuclear. This Statement gives reassurance to those looking for a degree of confidence that they can invest in the future, and to do so in the knowledge that it will not be subject to delay and long interruption.</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09110949000065"></a>I make one final point: this will be a very expensive programme of capital investment. We would like to think that disadvantages sections of the community are not exposed to higher energy prices than necessary.. Uncertainty, as we have seen with gas supplies and gas prices, means that the cost to individual domestic consumers, particularly those in poorly insulated houses, becomes unacceptable. So we must have the lights on, but on at a cost that the public and industry together can afford.</p>

He is right: we have to make sure that they are correct. It is better producing them now than in the summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09110949000067"></a>On the question of how much nuclear generation there should be, the noble Lord will know that the Government do not believe that they should set a target. However, in setting out the energy need, the national policy statement has some helpful indicators.  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_652"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 652</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is made clear that the nuclear sector should be free to contribute as much as possible of the 25 gigawatts of non-renewable energy required by 2025. That is not a target; it is simply stating that, on the best estimates we have at the moment, in 2025 we will require about 25 gigawatts of non-renewable energy. It is then up to the nuclear developers to see how much they will go for. It is noticeable that, as of today, the energy companies intend to produce 16 gigawatts of nuclear energy, but there is no reason why their current intentions should be a limit on what might occur in the future.</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09110949000068"></a>My noble friend is surely right about high energy prices. There will be a cost, but we must ensure that through energy efficiency we can reduce some of that cost. We also have to make sure that it is not at the expense of those who suffer from fuel poverty.</p>

Like the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, I was caught metaphorically speaking with my trousers down elsewhere.</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09110949000070"></a>I welcome the Statement. It is a good thing that at last at last we have one; .at last we have some movement. Having said that, we need to keep a rational perspective about nuclear energy, which I entirely agree we need and will have to put in place. The noble Lord, Lord Flowers, who we sadly no longer see in his place nowadays, remarked to me well over 10 years ago that, in the final analysis, mankind had only one source of energy and that was nuclear. We had a choice between having a power station here or 98 million miles away, and he knew which one he preferred. He was prescient.</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09110949000071"></a>I wish that the Government were paying more attention even now to 2050. We need to remember that most of the massive plant that is likely to be constructed as a result of this Statement today is likely to still be living and working in 2050. We are gambling with the 2050 target, particularly in relation to coal-fired generation. We are gambling that carbon capture and storage will work and that it will capture 100 per cent of the carbon. I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that it will do that because, if it does not, it will put an even greater question over the whole subject. We are also gambling that it will be economically competitive. There is a real possibility that that will not be the case. I could go on for another two or three minutes but I see that our time is up. I will give the Minister a chance to reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09110949000073"></a>The noble Lord makes an interesting point about nuclear power. We have reflected in the Statement what my right honourable friend the Secretary of State refers to as the trinity of nuclear, renewables and clean fossil fuels. Clearly, to ensure energy security, we need to have a diversity of both supply and generation, and we need to have it in a drive towards a low carbon future. The mix that we are proposing will enable us to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09110949000074"></a>On coal, I said earlier that if we are not able to develop CCS, there is absolutely no way that this country and many countries of the world, including China and India, can meet the kind of targets that have been set for 2050. That reinforces the importance of CCS and why we should adopt a leadership role in this country. Of course, there is a safeguard in the Statement. If as a result of the independent evaluation it transpires that CCS has not worked in the way that we wished it to work, we will have to return to the issue of what to do about existing coal-powered stations and their emissions. That will clearly be a subject for review towards the end of this century. I, for one, remain optimistic about CCS and its potential for this country.</p>

It was introduced in the other place by the honourable Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central to, as he put it,</p>
<ul><a name="09110949000151"></a>&#147;correct a significant inequality. It would also correct an anomaly that undermines freemen, where they remain, when exercising functions on behalf of their communities, and that undermines a significant part of our constitutional heritage&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 13/10/09; col. 222.]</ul>
<a name="91109-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09110949000079"></a>The amendment will mean that the daughter of a freeman can claim to be admitted as a freeman on the same terms as the son of a freeman. It also provides that the son or daughter of a freeman can request that they are admitted to a guild whether or not their parent had been admitted as a freeman at the time of their birth and whether or not they were born in the town or city in which the guild exists. Traditional activities need to reflect the modern world. In this day and age it is right that there should be equality of treatment between men and women. This amendment ensures that this occurs in relation to freedoms granted for an area.</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09110949000080"></a>When accepting that Clause 27 should be inserted in the Bill, my noble friend Lady Andrews stated that traditions needed to work in a non-discriminatory way and we attach great importance to seeking equality between men and women. As I have said, it is not acceptable in this day and age to treat women differently. There is also a need to make the guilds more relevant to today and ensure that they do not die out. Women must be allowed to become freewomen if they wish; that can only be to the advantage of guilds.</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09110949000081"></a>I understand that my noble friend Lord Graham may feel that the Commons amendment was unnecessary, given the provisions he introduced in Committee in  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_654"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 654</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this House, which were entirely permissive and so allowed guilds to decide among other things whether or not they wished to allow women to claim the freedom. However, in the other place it has been argued that providing equality should be a requirement rather than a choice and the Government have accepted that argument. We agree with the central argument that women should be afforded the same rights as men, particularly in relation to freedoms granted for an area.</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09110949000082"></a>I know that my noble friend Lord Graham has worked tirelessly on this issue and the freemen of our towns and cities have much to thank him for. Without his efforts many guilds would be facing real difficulties in bringing their admission rights up to date and in some cases even surviving. For our part, we believe that the amendment laid by my noble friend strengthens the Bill by allowing admission rights to be changed more easily and flexibility for the guilds to amend their rules to meet any challenges that may arise in the future. Importantly, it provides a considered framework to make changes consequential to allow daughters to become freemen and amend other admission rights.</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09110949000083"></a>The daughters of freemen can become freemen on the same terms as sons of freemen as a result of the Commons amendment&#151;the rights and benefits equally apply&#151;but admission to a guild can also grant benefits and rights to the spouses and widows of freemen and Clause 27 will allow the guilds to consider and amend such rights&#151;those consequential on permitting women freemen. In some cases I understand that the widows of freemen have certain benefits, such as charitable payments or the right to certain accommodation in retirement. The freemen guilds, using Clause 27 and the new schedule to the Local Government Act 1972, introduced by my noble friend, will be able to amend their admission rights more easily so that these benefits can also be granted to widowers or, indeed, civil partners of freemen and freewomen.</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09110949000084"></a>Clause 27 will also allow guilds to consider widening their admission rights to individuals other than simply a son or daughter of a freeman. This might, for example, include permitting sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, nephews and nieces of freemen or freewomen to be eligible to seek admission. Of course, Clause 27 will also allow, as a result of the admission of daughters, that they might be called freewomen if the guild so resolves.</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09110949000085"></a>Clause 27 will also enable guilds to amend other admission rights, such as amending, perhaps, the terms of servitude as an apprentice to a freeman, or widening the rights of apprentices serving in the town generally. In addition, the framework introduced by Clause 27 will allow changes to be made more easily to other admission rights contained in the royal charter. It will enable guilds to change admission rights operated by custom by a simple resolution and provides an easier route for changes to rights contained in Acts of Parliament.</p>

<a name="91109-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09110949000086"></a>In summary, these two clauses work together. My noble friend&#146;s hard work has not been in vain&#151;indeed, far from it. I am aware that concerns have been expressed about difficulties that guilds may have in adopting these new admission requirements. However, as I have  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_655"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 655</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>said, the new schedule to the Local Government Act 1972 will ensure that consequential changes can be made to the rights and privileges of the freedom as a result of daughters gaining admission and the other changes made by the new clause introduced in the Commons. It will enable freemen to consider the implications of admitting daughters and change any of their rights accordingly if there is a need or desire to do so.</p>

<a name="91109-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09110949000087"></a>Moreover, I understand that several guilds have, over the years, made the same changes to their admission rights as those provided by the Commons amendment, and have been able to deal with any difficulties that arose. I am sure that all other guilds are capable of doing the same, especially now that there is a clear framework in place to make such amendments. There is time to prepare for the change, given that the relevant clauses are not commenced until two months after Royal Assent. Together with Clause 27, this amendment updates and helps to preserve one of our most ancient traditions, while providing equality of opportunity for men and women, a principle to which I know this House attaches great importance. I commend it to the House. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09110949000089"></a>This could have been a joyous moment in my parliamentary life. Having spent almost six years seeking to assist the Guilds of Freemen in bringing their procedures into the 21st century; having successfully piloted three times through this House a Private Member&#146;s Bill with all-party support to do so; having seen it fall in the other place due to one voice shouting &#147;Object!&#148;; and then having the Minister and officials at the Department for Communities and Local Government draft a comprehensive Bill, only to have it handed out to a Member in another place&#151;Derek Conway&#151;who was unable to proceed with it, I was then able to present that department-drafted Bill as an amendment to this Bill. It had unanimous support from every Bench in this House. I took care to consult not only the freemen of England and Wales, but more widely. When the Bill left this place with good will all round, I considered that I had achieved a modest advance, especially for women in their desire to inherit rights enjoyed by their fathers within the guilds movement. It was not to be.</p>

<a name="91109-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09110949000090"></a>Sadly, a rift within the freemen has revealed that the Newcastle upon Tyne guild holds a different view from almost every other guild, to such an extent that when the Freemen of England and Wales embraced the comprehensive new clauses that I introduced, Newcastle asked its four MPs to table the amendment now before us. As I intend to show, what is put forward as a simple amendment, designed to bring equality for women, is seen by many freemen as running counter to a prime argument for my clauses, which was stressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, who took the Bill through the Lords. That is, my clauses were permissive and it was an enabling Bill&#151;not compulsory, taking fully into account the fact that guilds throughout the land are not uniform; they are

My new clause gave that degree of flexibility which the freemen wanted and which the amendment before us denies. It is mandatory and not permissive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09110949000091"></a>I have no argument with either Newcastle or my parliamentary friends in another place, but I ask the House to try to understand the following. When this amendment was before the Committee in another place, Dan Rogerson, a Member of the Committee, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="09110949000142"></a>&#147;The new clause was tabled by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Jim Cousins), who is not a Member of the Committee. I was contacted this morning by Newcastle City Council and told that councillors wished to raise a crucial question by way of this new clause&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 18/6/09; col. 273.]</p>

<p><a name="09110949000092"></a>The Minister of State then said:</p>

<p><a name="09110949000094"></a>Even later in the same debate, the Minister said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a><a name="09110949000145"></a>&#147;Perhaps a discussion between the hon. Member for North Cornwall and my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central would be helpful, because I am advised that clause 27 meets many of the new clause&#146;s aims and&#151;crucially&#151;in a more sustainable way&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 18/6/09; col. 274.]</p>

<a name="91109-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09110949000095"></a>I have learnt from bitter experience that this is a complicated matter and the implications of accepting the Newcastle upon Tyne amendments may well not have been fully understood. Nor was the fact that Newcastle was isolated within the Guild of Freemen. Last week I received a copy of a letter addressed to my noble friend Lady Golding, herself a freeman of Newcastle under Lyme guild, from Derek Miller, clerk to the trustees. It read:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a><a name="09110949000146"></a>&#147;However at the very end of the passage of the Bill through the Commons an amendment was tabled which, if I understand it correctly, would make it mandatory for the daughter of a Freeman to be admitted to the Freedom where her brother would have the right to be admitted&#148;.</p>

<a name="91109-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09110949000096"></a>I ask the Minister a direct question. Can he confirm that this understanding is correct? The letter goes on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a><a name="09110949000147"></a>&#147;If my understanding of the position is correct on this particular point affecting admission procedures this completely undermines the concept of ENABLING as opposed to REQUIRING as set out in the amendment proposed by Lord Graham. The Trustees feel that such an amendment is not in the best interests of the Newcastle under Lyme Trustees insofar as it requires admission no matter what the circumstances of any Body of Freemen might be: do they see it right in principle.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a><a name="09110949000148"></a>Some Bodies, including Newcastle under Lyme, may have land or other assets or investments involved, and a compulsory admission of women in these circumstances is effectively an expropriation of existing historic rights ... It is not that the Trustees feel that the admission of women is wrong in itself, but they believe it is appropriate for each body of Freemen to consider carefully the implications of such a move without it being imposed upon them in this way.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a><a name="09110949000149"></a>The amendment proposed by Lord Graham had the backing of the Freemen of England and Wales and I suspect virtually every other Body of Freemen apart from those in Newcastle on Tyne&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09110949000097"></a>I received another letter from Alan Fallows, a past president of the Freemen of England and Wales, writing on behalf of the Guild of Freemen of Shrewsbury. He wrote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a><a name="09110949000150"></a>&#147;All concerned are well-versed in the history of the failure of the previous &#145;Family Succession Bill&#146; after being deemed &#145;unfit for purpose&#146; so we are dismayed to see that Clause 4 effectively mirrors the terms of that failed Bill and is equally prescriptive. Our first point is that we see absolutely no reason or necessity in the new clause. The original clause perfectly conveyed the essence of the fact that the Freedom is differently constructed and operated in each place and is restricted there by differing customs and legal constraints by either charter or statute. The situation requires that an &#145;enabling Bill&#146; is utilised to facilitate different amendments to admission criteria in each place without the imposition of a limited national ruling. Your clause covers not only the admission of women but also the problem of location of birth, date of birth, stepchildren and children-in-law. These facts were recognised and supported by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary and the Minister of State when they argued against the necessity for inclusion of the new clause in Committee&#148;.</p>

<a name="91109-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09110949000098"></a>Where do we go from there? If what I am being told by guilds of freemen is along the lines of the above, I sense that there is a storm brewing which bodes ill for good relations with the Government. I despair when I think of the enormous amount of time spent on this by people within the department and by Ministers. I pay full tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, who tirelessly sought to draft an amendment that would achieve not what Parliament wanted but what the freemen themselves wanted. I am dismayed at the turn of events.</p>

<a name="91109-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09110949000099"></a>By virtue of the parliamentary timetable, with this Session concluding in three days&#146; time, I cannot see that my seeking recourse to normal means of objecting would be practical or successful. However, it must still be within the Minister&#146;s power to withdraw this clause so that meaningful discussions can take place within the totality of the freemen of England and Wales to try to produce a change that will satisfy all parties. Clause 27 can still be used in the interim. Will the Minister consider my suggestion? If he does not wish to do that, I forecast that the department will hear from many puzzled and angry guilds and that all the good work done by officials will be set at naught.</p>

I correct him in that I am an honorary freeman of England and Wales. In fact, I was proposed by the freemen of York, not by the freemen of Newcastle-under-Lyme, who are called burgesses, not freemen, which complicates things even further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09110949000101"></a>The clerk to the trustees of the burgesses of Newcastle-under-Lyme wrote to me and I have passed the letter to my noble friend Lord Graham. I received a further letter from them, explaining where they have difficulty with the Bill, although they have no difficulty with the principle of the Bill or with the enabling Bill of my noble friend Lord Graham. The clerk to the trustees wrote that he had,</p>
<ul><a name="09110949000152"></a>&#147;difficulty with the wording of what is proposed. In Newcastle-under-Lyme the status of freedom is conferred on birth. On coming of age, a young man presents himself to the Mayor of the  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_658"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 658</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Borough for confirmation of that status. As such, he does not &#145;claim to be admitted&#146; in that the Mayor does not &#145;admit&#146; a man to Freedom but simply acknowledges that he has held status which he has claims from birth. Accordingly, if the Bill is enacted in its present form, I should be left with a very difficult problem of construction. Sub-clause (2)(1)(A) clearly addresses the case where a man claims &#145;to be admitted as a Freeman&#146; i.e. it speaks to a future state of affairs which lies in the gift of a third party. Those words are not, as I say, apt to cover the situation in Newcastle-under-Lyme and on balance I would feel compelled to advise the Trustees that the amendment now proposed if, enacted, would have no application within this borough&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09110949000134"></a>That adds a further complication to what my noble friend Lord Graham has said. It is obvious that rules for many of these guilds of freemen vary from area to area. This matter has to be tackled constructively through discussion with the freemen, who know their own rules, and it has to be agreed. The freemen are not in principle against women being adopted as freemen but they believe that the clause is so flawed that it will not apply to some of them but may apply to others. Therefore, I ask that these fresh clauses be reconsidered, we have a general discussion on them and that, if necessary, we include the measure proposed by my noble friend Lord Graham. I believe that his proposal, which allowed each guild of freemen to deal with the matter as they saw fit, would be the best way to proceed.</p>

I thank the Minister and his team for setting out its purpose so clearly and I register the apologies of my noble friend Lady Warsi, who is unable to take part in this important debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09110949000103"></a>This measure draws to everybody&#146;s attention the difficulties that arise when we open up these ancient bodies to scrutiny in the modern day. We find that some strange things are happening that would not occur if these bodies were set up today. None the less, these bodies are important. Like the noble Lord, Lord Graham, I am from the north-east of England&#151;from Tyneside. When we talk about the freemen of the City of Newcastle, a reverence is displayed that is not displayed when we talk about any other body, because these people are the custodians of that most hallowed turf of St James&#146; Park and comprise the landowners and guardians of huge tranches of central Newcastle.</p>

<a name="91109-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09110949000104"></a>I seek clarification on the following point. I defer to the knowledge and extensive interest displayed by the noble Lord, Lord Graham, and the noble Baroness, Lady Golding. It seems to me that the guild in Newcastle has the opportunity to appoint females and males to the position of honorary freeman. When I looked on the City of Newcastle&#146;s website, I found that Councillor Margaret Collins is an honorary freeman, as are Harriet Dunlop, Daisy Clark, Joan Silcox, Rachel Somerville and a number of others, so clearly there is an ability at present for males and females to be appointed to this position. Therefore, it cannot be argued that this is a male fraternity, because clearly it is not, although the stewards appear to be exclusively male.</p>

They also have some significant modern-day powers in their custodianship of assets, property and land in many of our urban areas. We want to see that land and those green spaces preserved.</p>

<a name="91109-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09110949000106"></a>I very much agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Golding: using general legislation to tackle particular problems in particular guilds constitutes a slightly heavy hammer. Our policy is one of localism. We approve of the idea of local people determining the terms of their area and we would very much like to see maximum flexibility given to local guilds&#151;and, indeed, to the freemen of the City of Newcastle&#151;to determine the composition and the order of succession of hereditary freemen in a way that they would see fit.</p>

I am not sure whether I can say much more than that, although I will confess to being a little puzzled. Although I listened to what the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, was arguing, I am not clear whether it was for this new clause not to be included. As I read it, his original Clause 27 stays in the Bill; it is not as if we are knocking out what we did at the previous stage. I am also a bit confused by the terminology, because the term &#147;admitted&#148;, to which the noble Baroness referred, is in the clause that is in the Bill. I accept that it is not &#147;claim to be admitted&#148;, and that it may be the claim that is relevant rather than the admission. Having displayed such a wealth of ignorance, however, I shall go back to my point of principle: the greater the equality for women, the better.</p>

Perhaps I might start by addressing the concerns raised by my noble friends Lord Graham and Lady Golding. On the question that they posed to me, I do not propose to withdraw this clause. I have no authority to do that and I do not believe that it would be appropriate. My noble friend was possibly anticipating this as a joyous moment after six years of effort. I know that he has made a lot of effort, but he should not feel let down. His achievements in respect of that six years&#146; work are embodied in the Bill; they remain there and contribute to supporting the guilds going forward.</p>

<a name="91109-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09110949000109"></a>Yes, it is a permissive regime that is encompassed within the amendment that your Lordships previously accepted, but that sits together with those particular areas that have been carved out where there is a mandatory requirement. My noble friend asked whether it was correct that it would be mandatory for daughters to be admitted if sons could be admitted. It would not be mandatory, but the amendment says that, if the daughter should seek admission, it is mandatory to allow her to become a freeman. That is absolutely what this amendment enshrines.</p>

<a name="91109-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09110949000110"></a>My noble friend also referred to the expropriation of rights. If the concern is that of having a dilution of assets if a greater number of members joined the guild, I am sure that there would be ways to address  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_660"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 660</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that. However, I am also sure that one way not to address that would be by a gender cut-off, which seems to me to be quite the wrong principle to adopt here. My noble friend is quite right that the new clause goes further than the permissive regime that he introduced through his amendments, but that regime still remains in place and it is an important part of the Bill. When I moved the amendment, I outlined some of the circumstances where it will be brought to bear. I think that my noble friend Lady Golding&#151;and, indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Bates&#151;referred to honorary freemen. We should be clear that we are not talking about honorary freemen here; they are a separate issue. We are dealing with hereditary freeman. It is those guilds and individuals to whom this clause and my noble friend&#146;s amendment are addressed.</p>

<a name="91109-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09110949000111"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bates, said that it is always difficult when you are opening up parts of ancient history. Part of what we are trying to do in this Bill is to help the guilds to ensure that they have a future as well as a past and to facilitate their moving forward with addressing their rights and responsibilities The noble Lord, Lord Bates, outlined some of those. To be clear, again, I think that the noble Lord referred to Newcastle freemen as being honorary freemen. However, they are hereditary freeman. There are different arrangements for honorary freeman. Those will, in fact, be covered by Clause 28, not the provisions that we are addressing tonight.</p>

<a name="91109-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09110949000112"></a>My noble friend Lady Golding referred to seeing how the amendment that we are discussing fits with the requirements in some of the guilds&#146; rules at the moment. This, again, goes back to the amendments brought forward by my noble friend Lord Graham in the schedule that was introduced in your Lordships&#146; House. I stress that that is what gives the wherewithal to make the consequential changes, so that the mandatory provisions of this amendment can be encompassed and made whole within the context of the guilds&#146; rules. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said that she welcomed equality; there is an extra component of that in these circumstances. I readily accept that it could be achieved under a permissive regime, but this amendment makes it mandatory and puts daughters in the same position as sons. Surely in the 21st century we should welcome that. I hope that that has addressed the concerns of noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09110949000117"></a>In July, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government published the consultation paper <I>Strengthening Local Democracy</I>. This sought views on the scope of local authority powers, in particular around their powers to undertake mutual insurance arrangements. The consultation attracted 96 responses to the specific question on mutual insurance, with 82 per cent agreeing with the proposed power.</p>

<a name="91109-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09110949000118"></a>The amendment adds a new clause to provide permissive powers for named authorities to enter into mutual insurance arrangements should they wish to do so. These authorities, which are described as &#147;qualifying authorities&#148;, are local authorities&#151;other than parish and community councils&#151;fire and rescue authorities, police authorities and other best-value authorities in England and Wales. Authorities exercising the power will need to ensure that any proposed arrangement meets the duty of best-value as laid down in legislation. While it seems unlikely that all qualifying authorities will wish to establish or participate in an insurance mutual, clear and specific legal powers will be available for those for whom it makes good business sense to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09110949000119"></a>The amendment provides that best-value authorities may establish and become members of a corporate body whose objectives are to provide insurance to those authorities who are members of the mutual. Other qualifying authorities may be members of the mutual and the mutual may also provide insurance to other bodies, which will be prescribed by regulation and which I will call affiliates. Affiliates will be those which have some association with qualifying authorities; for example, in the case of local authorities, arm&#146;s length management organisations (ALMOs), academy schools or wholly-owned subsidiaries. Broadly, the intention is for a qualifying authority to be able to sponsor an affiliate to bring it within the mutual&#146;s insurance cover as we understand that many local authorities already arrange insurance cover for ALMOs and some schools. However, affiliates will not be able to become members of the mutual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09110949000121"></a>The Secretary of State in relation to England and Welsh Ministers in relation to Wales, may, by regulation subject to the affirmative procedure, amend the list of authorities that are qualifying authorities. They may also impose restrictions or conditions on the use of the power by regulations subject to the negative resolution procedure. We intend to consult on the content of such regulations. However, we are of the view that the following may be required. First, the mutual insurance body should be registered with the FSA so that it will be a body authorised to carry out the activity of providing insurance, which is regulated by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Secondly, a mutual insurance company will not be able to reinsure risk with another qualifying authority mutual, although it will, if course, be able to reinsure in the market. This is to avoid a potential spiral of risk were a number of different qualifying authority mutuals to reinsure each other, with the danger of the risk effectively ending up where it began. Thirdly, qualifying authority mutual insurance bodies are unlikely to be allowed to have offshore captive insurance subsidiaries. Our view is that providing powers to local authorities which could facilitate avoidance of UK tax, or would enable the avoidance of appropriate levels of regulation which are needed to protect public money, is not something appropriate for local authority mutual insurance companies.</p>

Commons Amendment 10 is a consequential amendment to add a reference to insurance in the Long Title of the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="09110949000125"></a><b><a name="91109-0013.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09110949000187"></a>Lord Bates:</b> My Lords, I have a couple of brief points, although we are basically on the same page and we support this enabling measure.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09110949000126"></a>The Government are fond of consulting extensively, and we approve of that. However, the Minister said that there were 96 responses to the consultation. What consideration has been given to them? We were offered a headline figure of 82 per cent which agreed with the proposed power. I have seen only one of the responses&#151;by Zurich Municipal&#151;which was forwarded to us and other Members who participated in the earlier debate. There did not seem to be just a binary question&#151;are you in favour or not? Zurich&#146;s response amounted to some 11 pages. Its perspective from being a municipal insurer in the UK since 1903 was that there were significant pros and potential disadvantages to allowing local authorities to set up mutual insurance companies&#151;not least relating to the residue of underwriting risk and how that might impact on local authorities&#146; primary responsibility to deliver local services in the event of claims.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09110949000127"></a>Can the Minister comment a little further on the substance of the responses? What consideration has been given to the thoughtful and reasoned responses of companies such as Zurich, which display a level of expertise way beyond that which I can offer in this area? How was that distilled in such a short period? The consultation closed on 2 October and the results were presented on 13 October. That does not seem to be much time in which to absorb the comments.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09110949000128"></a>My second point relates to the role of the RDAs. The RDA leaders&#146; boards will have a role in overseeing or offering some assessment of the appropriateness of municipal insurance schemes. That may be appropriate at this time, but I am hesitant because the regional development agencies are in the vanguard of trying to claw our way out of recession. They have huge responsibilities. One of our criticisms of the RDAs throughout has been that although their primary duty is to promote business and enterprise in a region, they are often drawn into intensely bureaucratic areas that are non-core to their activities. They become involved in producing regional spatial strategies, regional economic strategies, regional waste strategies, regional cultural strategies and regional transport strategies. The RDAs have to bring all of these together. Can the Minister provide an assessment of the RDAs&#146; involvement in fulfilling their role as regards municipal insurance schemes. For example, if they are the bodies that will license or assess whether a municipal insurance company should be established, will they carry a residue liability if that insurance arrangement were to go wrong?</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09110949000129"></a>I should like some reassurance on that. My primary point is not the pedantic one regarding where residual liability may reside, but a more substantive one. These bodies are supposed to be there to help in the midst of a recession and to focus on enterprise and business regeneration in their areas. Are they being given another responsibility which they do not need and which will distract them from their core responsibility?</p>

<a name="09110951000001"></a><b><a name="91109-0013.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09110951000048"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> My Lords, my comments go back a stage earlier than the points that the noble Lord has just raised. These amendments, which were added to the Bill in response to the London Authorities Mutual Ltd case, seem to address a symptom, not the underlying disease. The analogy that occurred to me this morning was that the Government have just managed to fling one parcel on to a train as it is leaving a station headed for the destination of Royal Assent, but they have left what matters on the platform.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09110951000002"></a>I had a go at amendments in lieu of these amendments. I understand that the Public Bill Office said, &#147;Good try, but not within the scope&#148;, as these amendments are limited to mutual insurance. The Minister will not be surprised that I had tried to give the Government a legislative base on which to build either a power of general competence, although I knew what response that would get, or&#151;this is particularly important&#151;a base for any other discrete power that may turn out to be needed because the power of well-being does not cover it. Legislative opportunities for this sort of thing are not that frequent. It is a matter of chance that this Bill was available at the time when we had the judgment in that case.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09110951000003"></a>I cannot say that insurance would have been my first choice of activity, but that is not the point. Local authorities should be free to undertake activities that they judge to be appropriate. Like others, I thought that the well-being powers were sufficient and felt a considerable sense of dismay at the judgment in this case.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09110951000004"></a>Looking for the judgment was a case of, &#147;Be careful what you wish for&#148;. I asked the Library to find it for me and it turned out to be 91 pages. We find that we have not escaped the fine analysis of local authority powers or the line of cases arising, starting with the interest rate swaps and so on. Also, what is &#147;incidental to the incidental&#148;?</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09110951000005"></a>The leading judgment in the case&#151;to pick out a couple of short comments&#151;said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74"></a><a name="09110951000037"></a>&#147;Promotion of well-being is not an expression one would normally associate with a somewhat complex arrangement to save money, such as the LAML arrangement, rather than with action directly to promote or improve a healthy or prosperous condition&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110951000033"></a>The judge said later that,</p>
<ul><a name="09110951000038"></a>&#147;taking steps to improve the authority&#146;s general financial position is not to be treated as something that will of itself promote or improve the wellbeing of its area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09110951000006"></a>There needs to be a direct connection for the powers of well-being in the earlier legislation to be sufficient. We are left with local authorities not being clear about the boundaries of their autonomy and with a rich seam to be mined by particular third-party interests that oppose a proposed activity by the local authority.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09110951000007"></a>The Government talk a lot about local autonomy and every so often one finds passages that make clear the philosophy that underlies what they say. I will refer to two. The first is in their response to the Communities and Local Government Select Committee report,<I> The Balance </I><I>o</I><I>f Power: Central </I><I>a</I><I>nd Local Governmen</I><I>t</I>. The  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_665"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 665</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government, at paragraph 27, talk about holding constructive dialogues on the need for extra powers. They say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75"></a><a name="09110951000039"></a>&#147;Where specific evidence is provided to us, we will consider this on its merits&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110951000008"></a>I emphasise the words &#147;on its merits&#148;.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09110951000009"></a>Secondly, in the recent paper <I>Strengthening Local Democracy</I>, question 8 asks:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a><a name="09110951000040"></a>&#147;How best should any reduction in numbers of LAA targets ensure that services are responsive to&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09110951000034"></a>and again I stress the following words&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09110951000041"></a>&#147;the most important local needs as well as national entitlements&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09110951000035"></a>All that begs the question: who is doing that assessment. I could go on, but those two extracts display a philosophy that we on these Benches do not share.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09110951000010"></a>As I said, I have not been able to table the amendments that I would have liked concerning not just the power of general competence but giving the Government the opportunity to respond to a problem such as the local authorities&#146; mutual problem. Of course, we do not oppose the amendments, but we would have liked to be able to move from the particular to the general and turn the Bill into something much more worth having.</p>

<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="09110951000011"></a><b><a name="91109-0013.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09110951000049"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Bates, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, for their contributions to our short debate. I start with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Bates, about the consultation. We will of course be publishing its results. On his mention of Zurich, I imagine that that is in the &#147;against&#148; box concerning the data, but we will be publishing that in due course.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09110951000012"></a>The provision is not mandatory. These are opportunities for local authorities to enter into mutual insurance arrangements if it is in their interests to do so.</p>

<p><a name="st_188"></a>
<a name="09110951000013"></a><b><a name="91109-0013.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09110951000050"></a>Lord Bates:</b> I thank the Minister for his courtesy in, as always, giving way. The more general point is that it was not an opinion poll as to whether authorities were in favour or against; the Government went out to consultation when detailed responses were given about Zurich. Can he explain how that information given by very busy people in organisations who have put a lot of time and thought into it has influenced the amendments before us now?</p>

<p><a name="st_189"></a>
<a name="09110951000014"></a><b><a name="91109-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09110951000051"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Let me say generally on consultation that it is the Government&#146;s policy, as the noble Lord will be aware, to distil the results and publish them. We do not typically publish all the responses verbatim, but seek faithfully to represent the spread of views. Clearly the time between the conclusion of the consultation and the need to make progress on the amendments has been relatively short. I acknowledge that, but I hang on to my point, which is that nothing here requires local authorities to enter into mutual insurance arrangements. This is an enabling, permissive provision that provides the framework within which they can do it. It is important that that framework is provided, in part for the reasons touched on by the noble Baroness. The judgment in the LAML case was that local authorities, notwithstanding the well-being power, did not have the vires to enter into the arrangements  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_666"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 666</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that they did. We know that mutual insurance arrangements, properly conducted, can be very beneficial to local authorities. If they have a chance of getting better value from their insurance arrangements&#151;often, mutual insurance arrangements also drive good risk management behaviour&#151;that seems to me to be all to the good.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09110951000015"></a>As for the role of the RDAs, I do not fully understand the noble Lord&#146;s point. RDAs will not be qualifying authorities able to enter into mutual insurance arrangements. The point that I made when moving the amendment was that we would envisage that mutual insurance arrangements would be regulated by the FSA, as are all other insurance companies. That is the quality and regulatory issue about which we should be concerned.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09110951000016"></a>The noble Baroness referred to the judgment in the LAML case, which had to be addressed. Of course there are wider, serious issues around competence, although it could be labelled in another way. We have been clear in our support for councils that want to undertake innovative activity to drive efficiency and to act in their interests and the interests of local communities. The aim is something that we share. We have taken seriously the LAML judgment that suggests the existence of a general power, but it would not have altered the findings. This is why in this case to ensure that local authorities are able to undertake mutual instance, a specific enabling power is needed, and we have used the opportunity of the Bill to drive that forward.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09110951000017"></a>In our recent consultation, we asked councils to identify where there are similar complex arrangements, other than mutual insurance, which are potentially out of the scope of the existing powers, and we are committed to following up on any issues raised. We will consider if there are cases in which a general power may provide reassurance for local government. I am sure that the debate about the general power of competence will not go away, but it is better that this debate is on wider issues rather than specifically mutual insurance.</p>

<a name="09110951000018"></a><b><a name="91109-0013.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09110951000052"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> Does the Minister accept that the local government world probably will not know whether to be worried about something until somebody takes it to court?</p>

<p><a name="st_191"></a>
<a name="09110951000019"></a><b><a name="91109-0013.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09110951000053"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> There is always a risk, particularly for local authorities that are trying to do innovative things. That is why we need to use the opportunity of the consultation fully to understand the types of arrangements and situations that local authorities are facing to make sure that they have the vires to undertake them. The noble Baroness makes a reasonable point. Everyone will have assumed that the powers that local authorities have would have been sufficient to undertake those mutual insurance arrangements but, at the very least in the timeframe available to us in the Bill, we can rectify that issue.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09110951000020"></a>The noble Baroness asked where this leaves the well-being power. In the Local Government Act 2000 the power of well-being was introduced which allows councils to do anything with the exception of raising money or things expressly prohibited by legislation that would have an impact on the social, economic  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_667"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 667</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and environmental well-being of their area. The breadth of this power is such that it can be regarded as a power of first resort when seeking to improve such outcomes for communities, but we recognise that many local authorities will be concerned about the implications of the LAML case. However, every court case on the well-being power has upheld the breadth of that power, and this one is no different. The court case ruled mutual insurance services out of scope of the well-being power and changing the well-being power or introducing another form of general power would not be certain to ensure that local authorities could engage in mutual insurance arrangements. I know that that debate will go on, but before us tonight are these amendments relating to mutual insurance. I am grateful to have the support of both noble Lords.</p>

Amendment 4 addresses the Secretary of State&#146;s power to disapply the operation of Part 2 of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 from types of construction contract. While the Bill has been going through Parliament, we have been approached by a number of stakeholders from within the industry and also its customers who are concerned about the nature of the Secretary of State&#146;s power to exclude contracts from the provisions of the 1996 Act.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09110951000022"></a>Currently the 1996 Act contains an &#147;all or nothing&#148; power so that the Secretary of State can disapply all the provisions of Part 2 of the 1996 Act from types of contract. We would like to substitute a new power enabling the Secretary of State to disapply any, not necessarily all, of the provisions of Part 2 of the 1996 Act. The current power in the 1996 Act is a blunt one. Amendment 4 will allow the Secretary of State to exercise the disapplication power in a proportionate manner.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09110951000023"></a>This approach will give us the flexibility to deal with specific issues of direct concern with particular types of contract. Importantly, it will allow us to ensure that as many of the valuable features of the 1996 Act as amended by this Bill continue to apply&#151;for instance, the right to stage payments, the right to adjudication and the right to suspend performance in cases of non-payment as appropriate. The legislation will also be able to respond proportionately to future contractual innovations. The current order-making power is subject to the affirmative procedure, and that will be the case with the new power.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09110951000024"></a>The next amendments in this group are Commons Amendments 5 and 6, which are minor amendments to Clause 137, concerning pre-dispute agreements regarding adjudication costs. The 1996 Act was silent on the costs of adjudication and this has led to a practice in the industry whereby the party with the most bargaining power can insert a clause into the construction contract requiring that if the weaker  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_668"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column 668</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>party wants to go to adjudication to determine a dispute, they would have to pay all the superior party&#146;s legal and other costs, and all the fees and expenses of the adjudicator. Clearly, such practices are unacceptable and are directly intended to work against the intent of the 1996 Act.</p>

<a name="91109-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09110951000025"></a>Clause 137 therefore inserts new Section 108A into the 1996 Act, and this prevents parties to construction contracts from entering into agreements before a dispute has arisen as to who should pick up the costs of an adjudication. A consequence of this broad and simple prohibition is that pre-dispute agreements between the parties to the effect that an adjudicator can allocate his fees and expenses as part of his decision are also caught. Allowing the parties to agree in their construction contract that the adjudicator has this power is current good practice, which we would like to preserve. This amendment achieves this by carving out such agreements from the general prohibition. This is wholly in line with the amendment suggested by my noble friend Lord Brett during report on 22 April. I beg to move.</p>

They are essential protection, particularly for the sub-contractors, who are often the people we read about in our newspapers day after day, going out of business as a result of funds not being passed on to them at an appropriate speed by main contractors.

He said that this area was so complex and detailed that perhaps it merited a stand-alone construction Bill in order to deal with all that. I think, however&#151;trying to be charitable&#151;that we are quickly running out of time in this Session, so there is not likely to be such a Bill soon. But a specific Bill focused on construction, to draw in all of the areas in which they operate, particularly in relation to requirements on credit insurance, would be widely welcomed. Even in their present form, the new provisions are a significant step forward, and will provide welcome relief when implemented to many essential small and medium-sized businesses up and down the country.</p>

The regulations are made under Parts 6 and 8 of the Act. The provisions update, strengthen and modernise legislation that dates from 1845.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000005"></a>Currently, seven banks are authorised to issue banknotes in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the Government acknowledge the cultural importance of this. The fundamental objective of the legislation is simply to ensure that holders of Scottish and Northern Ireland banknotes have similar protection to holders of Bank of England banknotes and, in the event of an issuing bank failing, can obtain full face value for their notes. This is important for consumer protection and financial stability.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000006"></a>Part 6 of the Banking Act 2009 contains the overarching principles of the new regulatory regime, the details of which are contained in these regulations. The Treasury and the Bank of England have been working closely together, and with the issuing banks, to develop the regulations and ensure that the underlying policy objectives are met. We have also been working closely on the operational details of the new regime  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC110"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column GC110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that are to be contained in the banknote rules, which are made under the regulations by the Bank of England and must be approved by the Treasury.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000007"></a>At the core of the regulations are the provisions relating to the holding of ring-fenced backing assets to ensure the protection of noteholders. In the event of a note-issuing bank becoming insolvent, the Bank of England is required to make arrangements to ensure that the insolvent bank&#146;s ring-fenced backing assets are applied for the purpose of satisfying noteholders&#146; claims, and that noteholders may obtain full value for their notes by exchanging them for an equal value of banknotes, coins or funds of another bank.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000008"></a>Clearly, for the regime to operate effectively the Bank of England needs to be able to require banks to provide such information as it may reasonably require for the purpose of exercising its functions, or for verifying or monitoring a bank&#146;s compliance with the new regime. The regulations therefore enable the Bank of England to make the relevant rules. Similarly, enforcement provisions ensure compliance with the new regime. The Bank of England may impose a financial penalty on an authorised bank that has failed to comply with any provision of the banknote regulations or rules, subject to a maximum annual cap as set out in the regulations.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000009"></a>I would like to bring to the attention of the Committee one point in regard to the operation of the enforcement provisions that came up via the consultation that the Treasury conducted on the draft regulations.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000010"></a>Respondents to the consultation asked that an independent appeals or arbitration panel be established, in the event that an authorised bank wanted to dispute a penalty imposed by the Bank of England. The Bank of England has confirmed that the penalty policy will set out an appeals process to which authorised banks may have recourse if they are dissatisfied with the Bank&#146;s decision on such a penalty.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000011"></a>As I have said, the fundamental principle underpinning these regulations is to offer holders of Scottish and Northern Ireland banknotes a similar level of protection to holders of Bank of England banknotes.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000012"></a>The powers conferred by these regulations on the Bank of England equip it to carry out its role as regulator effectively, and ensure that the objectives of these provisions are being met.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000013"></a>These regulations will therefore enable the current long-standing tradition of commercial banknote issuance in Scotland and Northern Ireland to continue, and I commend them to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="0911099000014"></a><b><a name="91109-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0911099000120"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the regulations, which are largely uncontroversial, although I would like to raise just a couple of areas, one of which is penalties, which he has partly touched on, and the other is costs.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000015"></a>Under paragraph 4 of Schedule 3, penalties can amount to 10 per cent of the relevant bank&#146;s notes in circulation annually. There are nearly &#163;5 billion-worth of notes in circulation, so in the admittedly unlikely event of all the banks failing to fulfil their obligations and incurring a penalty, in theory the Bank could raise half a billion pounds a year. Even in today&#146;s climate of  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC111"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column GC111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a billion here and a billion there, that seems to be a large sum of money potentially accruing to the Bank of England.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000016"></a>How did the Government arrive at the figure of 10 per cent? What conversations did the Treasury have with the Bank about how penalties would be calibrated? If I can put it another way, what is the Government&#146;s view of what would trigger the maximum penalty; 10 per cent of the notes in circulation?</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000017"></a>When we debated penalties during the passage of the Banking Act 2009, the Minister noted that they would be dealt with in more detail in a statement of policy on penalties, which is required under these regulations in Schedule 3. We had very little time in the final stages of the Banking Act earlier this year, which I am sure the Minister recalls, so I cannot claim that we pursued this with the vigour that we might otherwise have done. The requirement for the Bank to issue a policy is clearly a move in the right direction, but it is a very modest one. Statements of policy, unlike the rules which are required under these regulations, do not require the Bank to consult on the policy, do not require Treasury consent and involve no parliamentary oversight whatever.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000018"></a>Can the Minister tell the Committee more about what the policy statement that is required under paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 will contain? Does a draft of the statement of policy exist, and is it available for public scrutiny? Is any consultation in practice being undertaken in respect of it, notwithstanding no formal requirement for there to be consultation?</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000019"></a>Given the high level of potential penalty, it is no surprise that the consultation on the regulations revealed a desire for an independent appeals process or an arbitration panel, which the Minister has referred to. There is nothing in the regulations that sets out or requires an appeals process. The Minister has already repeated what the Government said in response to the consultation process, namely that an appeals process will be set out in the statement of policy on penalties, which is required by paragraph 5 of Schedule 3. I want to query that with the Minister. Paragraph 5 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0911099000098"></a>&#147;The Bank of England must publish a statement of policy ... in respect of ... the process it will follow when it imposes a penalty&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0911099000095"></a>It says nothing about the statement containing processes that might be available to an aggrieved note-issuing bank if that bank is handed a penalty. Is the Minister content that the Government&#146;s drafting of paragraph 5 covers policies for the remedies available to others? It seems to me to be drafted only in terms of actions by the Bank.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000020"></a>I find it difficult to see how a process, which the Bank must follow, can cover the administration of an appeals process that is independent of the Bank. I think that I heard the Minister say in his introductory remarks that there would be some form of independent appeals process. That being the case, it is difficult to see how an independent appeals process could fit within the wording of a statement of policy that the Bank will follow. I should be interested to hear how the Minister sees that operating in practice.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC112"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column GC112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000021"></a>As I said, the statement of policy is of an even lower level than the rules that have to be issued under these regulations. Perhaps the Minister will explain why a matter as important as appeals has been left by the Government to a statement of policy by the Bank, and not even to rules issued under regulations to which the Treasury would have some say as it would have to give consent. Will the Minister say whether the interests of natural justice are served by this approach, which appears to leave the matter of appeals solely to the whim of the Bank?</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000022"></a>My honourable friend Mr Greg Hands raised the issue of costs with the Minister when these draft regulations were considered in another place last week. I do not think that all of the answers given at that stage fully dealt with the matters, so I am returning in part to those issues. The impact assessment shows costs falling on the issuing banks of &#163;100,000 in terms of start-up costs and ongoing annual costs. That does not seem a large sum spread over the number of banks, and the consultation did not unearth a major issue. By far the biggest cost will be borne by the Bank of England, which is a factor of five times the cost of the private sector. It is estimated that the Bank will incur &#163;500,000 of start-up costs and then a similar amount each year. What was unexplained in the Delegated Legislation Committee in another place was why such a disproportionate amount of the total cost is being borne by the Bank of England.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000023"></a>It is unusual to find that the total cost of regulation is split so unevenly between the regulator and the regulatees. It is normal that the cost of regulation falls predominantly on those who are the object of regulation and not the regulators. Are the Government satisfied that the Bank of England is planning to carry out cost-effectively the functions that are required of it by the Banking Act 2001? At the end of the day, the Bank&#146;s costs affect the taxpayer if only by way of the dividend arrangements between the Bank of England and the Treasury, so the amount of costs incurred by the Bank is a matter for the Government. I hope that the Minister can shed more light than what was offered in another place on what the Bank will do and why.</p>

<p><a name="0911099000024"></a><b><a name="91109-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0911099000121"></a>Lord Newby:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the detail of the regulations. As he and the noble Baroness said, they are completely non-contentious. However, given that these regulations are bringing procedures up to date, I was slightly surprised that in the unlikely even of a penalty notice being issued, it will be sent by post. A letter sent by post to the registered office of the authorised bank,</p>
<ul><a name="0911099000100"></a>&#147;shall be deemed to have been received by the bank on the second business day after posting&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0911099000096"></a>In current circumstances, that seems not only a hazardous basis on which to communicate important information, but a rather outdated method. I wonder whether using electronic forms of communication in addition to the post might be a policy usefully adopted by the Bank of England.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000025"></a>My final point relates to a short discussion that we had some time ago about who signs the banknotes. It was pointed out that at one stage Sir Fred Goodwin signed the banknotes of the Royal Bank of Scotland.

<h5><a name="0911099000104"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="0911099000026"></a><b><a name="91109-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0911099000122"></a>Lord Foulkes of Cumnock:</b> My Lords, normally in the Chamber or in Committee I am seen by Members opposite as one of a band of loyal supporters of Her Majesty&#146;s Government, here to defend at all costs, in all circumstances and in every way possible what the Government are doing. However, today I have one or two questions. I hope they are not too awkward for my noble friend, because I do not want to cause him undue problems on this special day that I look forward to celebrating with him later. I do not want to sour the occasion, but I have two or three questions that I hope he will answer.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000027"></a>The issue is not theoretical, as we in Scotland know. The Explanatory Memorandum includes the line,</p>
<ul><a name="0911099000101"></a>&#147;in the event of the insolvency of a note issuing bank&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0911099000097"></a>We were within 24 hours of that happening in the case of the Royal Bank of Scotland, so it is not a theoretical issue. Now we are being told that banks will be disaggregated in line with competition legislation and because of representations from, and the requirements of, the European Union. What happens to the note-issuing responsibilities if a bank is disaggregated? The Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group and the Clydesdale Bank have responsibility for issuing RBS notes, Bank of Scotland notes and Clydesdale Bank notes. If the Lloyds Group is disaggregated, as some people have suggested will happen, and an independent Bank of Scotland is set up, does the responsibility for issuing banknotes automatically transfer to the Bank of Scotland and its new owners? Heaven forbid that someone like Sir Fred Goodwin or Sir George Mathewson would be part of that new ownership. Would that worry my noble friend? I hope that he would be concerned if those who were involved in the near-collapse of a bank were then to take over responsibility for running a bank that had responsibility for issuing banknotes.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000028"></a>My second question relates to the excellent speech by the Prime Minister&#151;here I am reverting to type&#151;at St Andrews at the weekend. He suggested a number of alternative ways in which funds might be raised to finance banks that get into difficulties. He suggested the so-called Tobin tax on transactions, and also insurance arrangements under which either the banks might put money into a fund to provide insurance or have an external insurer provide it. How does this relate to the proposal today? It seems to conflict with what is being suggested. The noble Baroness opposite referred to costs and other aspects of it. It would be interesting to know whether any suggestions made by the Prime Minister in St Andrews will be adopted.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000029"></a>Finally, as a former Member representing a Scottish constituency in the other place and now a Peer with a Scottish title&#151;not all Peers from Scotland have Scottish titles, but I am one of them, although the title is not as distinguished as that of one Member opposite&#151;I welcome the fact that the banks in Scotland will be allowed to continued to issue notes, subject to these provisions, and I hope that that will continue for many  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC114"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column GC114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>years to come. However, I hope that the Minister will be able to give me and others some assurance by answering my questions, as well as those raised by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord opposite.</p>

<p><a name="0911099000030"></a><b><a name="91109-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="0911099000123"></a>The Duke of Montrose:</b> My Lords, perhaps I may come in quickly, having experienced this amazing note of humility from an Ayrshire man. In backing up my noble friend&#146;s concern about costs, I want to make a very simple point, which may have an explanation. The Explanatory Memorandum says that if a bank goes bust, its notes will be redeemed by the Bank of England at no cost. However, if a worthless piece of paper is replaced by a note issued by the Bank of England, how can that be said to be at no cost? It seems to me that the Bank of England will have to pick up the tab for reimbursing people who hold those other notes.</p>

<p><a name="0911099000031"></a><b><a name="91109-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0911099000124"></a>Lord Kilclooney:</b> My Lords, this is a timely matter in the present circumstances of banks in both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland because those in business and those who handle notes have increasing concerns about banking in both territories.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000032"></a>The regulations mention that we have four issuing banks&#146; notes in Northern Ireland: those of the Bank of Ireland, the Ulster Bank, the Northern Bank and the First Trust Bank. The Northern Bank and Ulster Bank are not matters of great concern in Northern Ireland because the Ulster Bank is, after all, a British bank owned in Scotland and the Northern Bank is owned by a Danish bank. Our problems in Northern Ireland relate increasingly to notes issued by the Bank of Ireland and the First Trust Bank, which is not really a separate bank as it is 100 per cent owned by the Allied Irish Bank.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000033"></a>Banking in the Republic of Ireland is pretty serious. Sometimes the press in Ireland refer to it as the next Iceland, and it is scary when you see language such as that. The Anglo Irish Bank in the Republic of Ireland has already collapsed, and the other two, the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank, which is the First Trust Bank, are often referred to in the press as being insolvent. Of course, the Republic of Ireland may have to seek support from the eurozone, but some economic journalists are saying that Germany may not come to its rescue and that it may have to go to the IMF in the first six months of 2010.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000034"></a>That is why I say that these regulations are timely. They are a means of further guaranteeing to people in Northern Ireland that the pound notes issued by the four banks, and in particular the two in the Republic of Ireland, will be guaranteed by the Bank of England. However, I want to comment on that.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000035"></a>First, I agree that the cost of this is amazing&#151;&#163;600,000 a year, and for what? For nothing. It would be much better to have a standard bank note in the whole United Kingdom, and here I disagree with the noble Lord from Scotland. Today, I have just three notes with me: from the Northern Bank, the First Trust Bank, which I stress is the Allied Irish Bank in the Republic, and the Bank of Ireland, which once again is a Republic of Ireland note. Those notes are an embarrassment because when you go to Scotland, England, Wales, the eurozone or indeed the whole of  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC115"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column GC115</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the European Union, people do not recognise them. They are not even recognised in England, the reason being that they are not exchangeable with other currencies, be it the euro or any other foreign currency. Therefore, they are an embarrassment and cause difficulty.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000036"></a>One thing that would be much better would be to have the word &#147;sterling&#148; on the notes in larger print. It is the smallest word on each of the notes. When you try to explain to English people that the note has the same value as the Bank of England note, they look at you in horror. You look for the word &#147;sterling&#148; and find it. After some debate they might accept it, but you can be refused on many occasions. These notes are a hindrance and an embarrassment. They have one advantage; England still does not have &#163;100 notes. We, however, need lots of money in Northern Ireland for our farmers, who deal in &#163;100 notes. That is one advantage of having notes of our own in Northern Ireland, but the only one; there are disadvantages in the design.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000037"></a>Many banks in Northern Ireland, such as HSBC, Santander, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Abbey, do not issue notes but work mainly with Bank of England notes. In this case, however, some consideration should be given in the future to the withdrawal of the right to issue local notes, which, as I say, are an embarrassment wherever you travel.</p>

<p><a name="0911099000038"></a><b><a name="91109-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0911099000125"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have participated in this short but interesting debate on what we all recognise is an important issue. One or two important questions were asked, as were some relatively complex ones. I am relieved that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked me one or two questions which I ought to be able to answer with one- or two-syllable words rather than in a long discussion of the issues.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000039"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, began the discussion by making important points about this work in two areas, to which I shall refer first. Penalty notices are a small part of authorised banks&#146; overall operations, but ensuring that banks comply with the regulatory framework is of the greatest importance for consumer confidence and for ensuring that commercial banknotes continue to play an effective role in the economy. It is therefore important for a financial penalty to carry enough weight to act as a deterrent against non-compliance while balanced against the need for a proportionate and reasonable response to breaches.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000040"></a>The maximum penalty of 10 per cent of a bank&#146;s notes in circulation is cumulative over the course of the year. However, I am sure the Committee does not have the slightest doubt about the importance of the strength of the penalty for a breach in this area, given the whole issue of confidence, as the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, indicated when he went on to discuss Irish banks at present.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000041"></a>The noble Baroness asked why we had arrived at 10 per cent and whether to incur any penalty could do more harm than good, such as tipping a bank into insolvency. The Bank must be able to impose a penalty that fits the nature of the breach and acts as an effective deterrent to prevent further such breaches.  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC116"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column GC116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The penalty will be in line with the Bank of England&#146;s published penalty policy. The maximum value of 10 per cent of an authorised bank&#146;s notes in circulation is, as I have indicated, a small part of its overall operation. It is therefore considered an appropriate cumulative annual cap on the penalties that the Bank of England may impose.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000042"></a>What will the statement on the Bank of England&#146;s policy on penalties look like? This is the Bank of England&#146;s responsibility. The Bank is currently consulting the issuing banks on the banknote rules and the penalty policy. I am not in a position to describe those in greater detail at present, but the Committee will draw solace from the fact that the Bank is consulting on these issues, which are part of the rules for which it is responsible.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000043"></a>The impact assessment contains full details of the costs. None of the consultation responses queried the assumptions for costs, or the difference between the Bank of England&#146;s and the issuing banks&#146; estimated costs. The noble Baroness referred to a disparity between the two.</p>

Those who looked at the consultation, and at the impact assessment, would have been concerned about their own costs. These are quite modest for the banks concerned. I would not have expected anybody else reading the impact assessment to comment on the Bank&#146;s costs unless they had an impact on their own costs. I understand that there is no charge from the Bank of England to the banks that may issue notes, so it signifies nothing that there were no comments on the Bank&#146;s costs.</p>

They do not occupy the same kind of role as the noble Baroness, but consultation among informed participants tends to throw up areas where there might be questions and difficulties. I am reflecting the fact that we have not met those issues in the way that the noble Baroness suggests.</p>

I will reply to the noble Lord in a moment on the crucial question of security that has been identified with regard to banks. On the question of whether it was a good idea, it was reasonable for Her Majesty&#146;s Government to make the presumption that in both Northern Ireland and Scotland&#151;I am sure that my noble friend Lord Foulkes will be on his feet in a moment if I make the wrong

I do not think that there was consultation on that matter. The consultation was more about the details of the regulations that we are discussing.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000048"></a>The consultation involved putting the issues on a website, and a copy was sent to all previous respondents on the issue, so the level best job was done to try to involve those who might be defined as being interested. I say to the noble Baroness that consultation is still going on&#151;that is the responsibility of the Bank of England as regards the penalty policy. It is consulting the authorised banks on the matter. There is no formal requirement for the Bank to consult: it is empowered to draw up policy on its own. That is what the Act says. However, it is wise that it should consult the general public, although perhaps not in the way suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney. It should consult those who will be directly involved. Therefore I hope that it will be appreciated that the Bank is going about its business in a purposeful way, and seeking to get the best insights possible by the way in which it works to resolve issues of penalty policy.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000049"></a>I am not in a position to single out any specific behaviour that might trigger the maximum penalty. The noble Baroness asked me to envisage the worst case. That is always a hazardous thing when one is involved with banking behaviour, because when it comes to confidence the wish can be father to the thought if one is not careful. The Bank of England would have to consider all the relevant circumstances at the time with regard to the crucial issue of confidence. The noble Baroness cannot expect me to go into much detail on the issue, although I am always tempted by the questions that she asks and attempt to answer them as fully as I am able.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000050"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked me two questions. On one I can reassure him: my noble friend Lord Myners has many responsibilities but he is not going to be signing the banknotes. His second question concerned the post. I emphasise that communication will take place through all modern media&#151;not just the post but electronic media as well. The noble Lord knows only too well that in very serious circumstances such as this you have to have proof of notification, and one form of communication will be by post. If the bank can prove that after two days it did not receive the requisite document by post, then of course there will be an extension of time; otherwise, it will be assumed that the postal services will deliver, as they are accustomed to do. As has always been the case, the policy with regard to these issues will be that, if you are not able to substantiate that the document did not arrive by post, it will be your responsibility to respond on the assumption that you received it two days after it was posted. We will not be departing from that. I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, was really asking me to fashion a policy communication based on what we all regard as temporary difficulties with the Post Office, which we hope will return to normal fairly shortly.</p>

<p><a name="0911099000051"></a>My noble friend Lord Foulkes kindly said that he did not want to ruin my day. However, he started to do that the moment he stood up, as he was all too well aware. He could have made a much better job of looking after my interests by not asking me those questions. Nevertheless, I emphasise to him that they are important questions. He asked what would happen if a bank were broken up. The issuing rights are vested in the corporate entity that was authorised to issue notes by virtue of the 1845 legislation, and a change in the share ownership of that entity would not deprive the bank of its issuing rights. However, the right to issue notes cannot be transferred to another bank by contract; it stays with the original bank, as defined under the legislation. If his anxiety was that these rights could be readily transferred and be the responsibility of others, I can reassure him that that would not be the case. I give way to my noble friend, who I see is seeking to enhance my day again.</p>

<p><a name="0911099000052"></a><b><a name="91109-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0911099000130"></a>Lord Foulkes of Cumnock:</b> I am very grateful to my noble friend. I presume that within the Lloyds group there is currently an identifiable unit&#151;the Bank of Scotland, as part of Lloyds. However, if it is disaggregated, as is being suggested by the European Union and domestically, is it guaranteed that there will be a new organisation or entity also called the Bank of Scotland? I do not know whether that will be the case but would it not create some problems? Therefore, arising from these obligations at the time of disaggregation should there not be an agreement that one of the units will be the Bank of Scotland, presumably with its headquarters in Edinburgh? If that were the case, I would be encouraged because it would mean that we would have some kind of guarantee during the aggregation that the Bank of Scotland would rise like a phoenix from the ashes.</p>

<p><a name="0911099000053"></a><b><a name="91109-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0911099000131"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> That is a colourful perspective but I am not sure that I can follow my noble friend down that path. I reassure him that the rights conferred on the corporate entity cannot be transferred to anyone else&#151;they cannot be sold to another bank by contract. Whether the existing bank will continue will depend on the circumstances of the restructuring and the security identified in terms of that restructuring. I am not in a position to give assurances on that now because none of us knows the structure that will emerge. I can only give my noble friend a negative assurance: the rights cannot be transferred to another corporate entity. Whether the corporate entity continues and enjoys the confidence to carry on its functions will depend on the Bank of England&#146;s judgment on the arrangements of the corporate entity, but my noble friend will recognise how important that is to the bank. Therefore, it is inconceivable that this will not be part of the priorities of the restructuring position. I do not think that I can comment any more fully on that.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000054"></a>I appreciated the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, about the timeliness of the measure. It is important that we establish confidence all round in the circumstances he identified where there are some anxieties, which I would not want to exaggerate. However, he is suggesting that the cost is somewhat high, but we do not think that it is. The  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC119"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column GC119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>confidence of the public in the banknotes that are issued is crucial. The noble Lord has identified a dimension of the problem of others accepting the banknotes at face value because of the way in which they are inscribed and so on. I am not in a position to comment on that, but that point will be taken on board. The general issue is that confidence in the notes is critical, which is why we regard this whole process as being one in which necessary costs may be incurred, but they are part of the crucial role of the Bank of England in relation to guaranteeing the essential security behind the banknotes, which, as the noble Lord emphasised, is so important.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000055"></a>The noble Lord, the Earl of Montrose, also asked me about this question.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000058"></a>I am all too well aware that aspects of this submission are difficult for the Committee, not least because we are talking about regulations which relate to rules that the Bank of England is to draft. The rules have to be supervised, vetted and authorised by the Treasury, but they are not part of these regulations. That is because these rules go down to such elements of detail as to make them not suitable for detailed parliamentary scrutiny. We are concerned with the regulations which govern the whole process.</p>

I want to take him back to my point about appeals, which he did not really deal with.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000061"></a>Let me track back. During the passage of the Banking Act earlier this Session, we created different regimes for Part 5, which dealt with inter-bank payment systems and Part 6, which is about banknotes and which we are currently debating. Part 5 had a very clear appeals mechanism linked to the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act. No such provisions were made in the Bill for banknotes. The issue of appeals comes up again in the consultation, and the Government replied that it would be done in a statement of policy. I am trying to tease out whether the Government have properly allowed for an appeals mechanism in the way in which they have approached both the legislation, including the regulations and subsequent rules, and the statement of policy. There is  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC120"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column GC120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>no requirement in the regulations for an appeals process. The Minister&#146;s position is that the possibility of issuing a statement of policy on penalties allows but does not require the bank to make provision for an appeals process. The point that I put to the Minister was that paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 to the regulations says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0911099000099"></a>&#147;The Bank of England must publish a statement of policy, with which it must comply, in respect of ... the process it will follow when it imposes a penalty under these Regulations&#148;.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000062"></a>I put the point in my earlier remarks, possibly not sufficiently clearly, that what the Government have provided for in paragraph 5 does not seem to encompass anything that could be regarded as an appeals process, because an appeals process involves organisations or appeals tribunals&#151;it involves something other than the Bank of England. The Government have drafted paragraph 5 only in terms of things that the Bank of England must do in its policy and they have not even drafted it sufficiently comprehensively to encompass what one would need to see in terms of an appeals mechanism.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000063"></a>This may sound rather pernickety, and on reflection I am not clear why we did not insist on having an appeals mechanism in the Bill. It was probably because of lack of time rather late in the day in the proceedings at the end of the Bill, when we were operating an expedited process. To some extent, one takes the blame for that; but it is important now. Consultation has revealed the need for an appeals process, which I can fully see given the scale of the penalties that are potentially capable of being imposed by the Bank of England. I put to the Minister that the regulations do not adequately allow for that appeals process to be created within the legal framework of the Act and the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="0911099000064"></a><b><a name="91109-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0911099000136"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness has made explicit her concerns, and earlier I attempted to identify how these concerns were being addressed, not perhaps in quite the way that she wished. She is absolutely right that the regulations do not make a formal requirement to consult on the penalty policy on the issue of appeal.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000065"></a>As I indicated earlier, the Bank of England has circulated to the issuing banks the appeals procedure that it envisages alongside the latest draft of the rules. The Treasury can only approve the rules. It does not have the power to approve the penalty policy. The Bank of England is working against the background that, on consultation, the issue with regard to the penalty policy and the right of appeal, which the noble Baroness has stressed, is important. The Bank of England is working closely with the Treasury while drafting both the rules and the penalty policy. The Bank of England remains answerable. If the policy is manifestly unreasonable, if what was created was a structure in which the right of appeal was not a significant right for anyone undergoing the penalty, the Bank could be subject to judicial review. As a public body, it is all too well aware of its responsibilities in those terms.</p>

<p><a name="0911099000066"></a>I am sorry that I am not able to take the issue much further than that. The noble Baroness has identified that these are the limits of the regulations regarding the appeal policy. I am stating that that is so, but

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000067"></a>The regulations are of the greatest importance. They ensure that holders of Scottish and Northern Ireland banknotes will be afforded the same level of protection as that afforded to the holders of Bank of England banknotes. The regulations are the first step in implementing Part 6 of the Banking Act 2009, which established the framework of the new regime after very considerable consultation. It will be recognised by the Committee that throughout the process the Treasury has worked closely with the Bank of England and with the issuing banks on the evolution of this policy, against a background where we all recognise why we needed a new banking Act and why the wider public needs every confidence to be restored with regard to a matter of such importance as banks that issue banknotes.</p>

<p><a name="0911099000069"></a>The Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987, as amended by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, contains powers for the Secretary of State for Defence to make regulations on disciplinary matters, including the conduct of members of the Ministry of Defence Police. There are currently some 3,500 Ministry of Defence Police officers throughout the United Kingdom.

MoD police officers possess the full range of constabulary powers and the skills to interact with personnel and the general public: with a view to protecting life and property, maintaining the peace, detecting and preventing crime, and prosecuting offenders. They can work both inside and outside defence establishments.</p>

<p><a name="0911099000071"></a>Today, in an effort to improve further the arrangements for dealing with the misconduct of MDP officers, we are seeking to introduce two statutory instruments that will bring the MoD Police into line with their colleagues in Home Department police forces in issues of conduct and appeals. The Home Office regulations have been in place for almost a year and continue to enjoy the full support of all major stakeholders, including the Police Advisory Board for England and Wales and the Independent Police Complaints Commission.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000072"></a>In response to the recommendations of the Taylor review, the two statutory instruments establish a new set of procedures that govern police disciplinary matters. The Ministry of Defence Police (Conduct) Regulations 2009 establish procedures for taking action against the misconduct of police officers. The Ministry of Defence Police Appeals Tribunals Regulations 2009 provide for appeals to a police appeals tribunal against the findings and specific outcomes of the MDP conduct regulations.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000073"></a>The Ministry of Defence Police is a national police force. It is therefore our policy that all members of the force&#151;whether in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland&#151;operate under the same conduct regulations, policies and procedures wherever they serve in the United Kingdom. We have therefore kept in close contact with the devolved authorities, the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland and the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, and informed them all of our legislative proposals on the new MDP conduct procedures and of our intention to enter into agreements with the respective ombudsmen to extend their jurisdiction over MDP officers in Scotland and Northern Ireland, as outlined in the new regulations.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000074"></a>It may be helpful if I set out the background to the regulations. The Taylor Review of Police Disciplinary Arrangements was a review conducted by William Taylor, CBE, OBE, QPM, a former Commissioner of the City of London Police, a former HM Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland and also a former police adviser to the MoD Police Committee. The programme board that guided and informed the Taylor review consisted of the main police stakeholders and other invited organisations&#151;the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Police Federation of England and Wales, the Police Superintendents&#146; Association of England and Wales, the Chief Police Officers Association, the National Black Police Association, representatives of the Special Constabulary, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, UNISON, Liberty and the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. The MoD was also involved in the consultative process.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000075"></a>The Taylor report made 19 recommendations, some of which I shall highlight. They include: police officers disciplinary arrangements are most appropriately determined by Parliament after extensive consultation; a new single code should be produced to be a touchstone  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC123"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column GC123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for individual behaviours and a clear indication of organisation and peer expectations; although regulated by Parliament, the new procedures should be based on the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service&#146;s code of practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures; conduct issues should be separated into two distinct groups&#151;misconduct and gross misconduct&#151;to promote proportional handling, clarify the available outcomes and provide a better understanding of the policing environment; and the police service must manage the disciplinary arrangements dynamically to drive through the changes to the internal culture of the organisation and promote the acceptance of responsibility at all levels. The recommendations were accepted by the programme board and the Home Office Minister. That led to the Police Advisory Board for England and Wales being asked to take forward the process for implementation.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000076"></a>I have a few points to emphasise about the Ministry of Defence Police (Conduct) Regulations 2009. First, the Taylor review found that the current system of dealing with police misconduct can be slow and disproportionate. It gives little or no encouragement to managers to deal swiftly and proportionately with low-level misconduct matters. Discipline hearings were seen as being more akin to criminal court hearings and even low-level misconduct matters were decided by a three-person panel of senior officers.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000077"></a>The new system will ensure that police managers are given the responsibility and ability to deal with misconduct fairly and proportionately at local level. Timescales are also built into the process to ensure time limits on all misconduct and gross misconduct cases. An independent member appointed by the MoD Police Committee will also sit on misconduct hearing panels to bring a public perspective to holding MDP officers to account. The Taylor report recommended a new single code, which should be the touchstone for individual behaviour, and a clear indication of organisational and peer expectation. The Home Office together with other stakeholders produced the new standard of professional behaviour for Home Department police officers that form part of their conduct regulations. These standards set out clear expectations of the behaviour that the public and colleagues expect of all police officers. The same standards will therefore form part of the Ministry of Defence Police (Conduct) Regulations and replace the existing MDP code of conduct.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000078"></a>The Taylor review also proposed that the new misconduct procedures should be based on the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service principles which will modernise the system and make it easier for individual officers and the police service generally to learn lessons and improve their service to the public. One of the key points to emerge was the need to shift the emphasis and culture in police misconduct from blame and punishment towards a focus on development and improvement. The review also stressed the importance of carrying out a full assessment of the alleged misconduct at an early stage with a view to implementing a proportionate response. The new procedures have incorporated the requirement for this objective assessment to take place at an early stage.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000079"></a>A further recommendation by William Taylor was that the procedures for dealing with the unsatisfactory performance of a police officer should be reviewed. While new regulations on performance were therefore introduced for Home Department police forces on 1 December 2008, there are no equivalent regulations for the MDP. Instead, MoD Police officers will continue to fall under existing MoD restoring efficiency procedures in any case in which a police officer&#146;s performance or attendance falls short of the required standard.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000080"></a>The Ministry of Defence Appeals Tribunals Regulations 2009 provide for appeals against findings or certain outcomes relating to cases considered under the new conduct regulations. Appeals should be dealt with in a timely and proportionate manner, so timescales are built into the new regulations to ensure that this is the case. The police appeals tribunal chair will have the power to dismiss appeals at an early stage where there is no real prospect of success and no other compelling reason for the appeal to proceed.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000081"></a>The tribunal will have the power to overturn the findings of the original panel that considered the conduct case and to amend the sanction imposed. The composition of police appeals tribunals differs according to whether the officer is senior or non-senior and whether the officer serves in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The police appeals tribunal is a three-person panel for senior officers and a four-person panel for non-senior officers. For senior and non-senior officers serving in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, the chair is selected through the Judicial Appointments Commission and must have five years&#146; legal standing. For officers serving in Scotland, the chair is selected from a list that is nominated by the Lord President of the Court of Session. The chair has the casting vote and there is no appeal against the decision of the tribunal or of the chair; the only challenge is through a judicial review.</p>

<p><a name="0911099000082"></a>Our proposals for the Ministry of Defence Police enable the force to follow in the footsteps of its Home Department police force colleagues in implementing the new conduct and appeals regulations. The new procedures provide a fair, open and proportionate method for dealing with alleged misconduct, and will hold MoD Police officers to account appropriately and in the same manner as their colleagues from other police forces throughout England and Wales. This will create a conduct environment for police officers that more closely reflects civilian employment practice. The regulations are intended to encourage a culture of personal responsibility among police officers and of learning and development for both individuals and the organisation.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000083"></a>It remains the case that, where circumstances require, there must be appropriate sanctions for misconduct. However, we must also ensure that improvement is an integral part of any outcome. Even when the individual is dismissed, there are learning opportunities for the force. I beg to move.</p>

We on these Benches share his tribute to members of the Armed Forces who have been killed and to their families, and his view that the main tribute should be paid on the Floor of the House.</p>

<p><a name="0911099000085"></a>These new regulations are uncontroversial, and I have just three short questions for the Minister. First, what distinct conclusions and recommendations resulted from the MoD&#146;s consultation with the Defence Police Federation and the Chief Police Officers&#146; Staff Association? The Minister may have covered the second question in his opening speech, but I will ask it anyway in case he wants to add to his original point. What strategy have the Government devised to ensure that the new regulations are understood and are being fairly and consistently applied? Finally, how much do the Government envisage spending on retraining their officers in the light of these new regulations?</p>
<h5><a name="0911099000109"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="0911099000086"></a><b><a name="91109-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0911099000140"></a>Lord Lee of Trafford:</b> My Lords, first, I enjoin these Benches and my party in the earlier tribute to our Armed Forces. Twenty-five years ago, I had ministerial responsibility for the Ministry of Defence Police and came to form a very high regard for it. I have particular sympathy with the conditions in which the officers have to work at many MoD facilities, bases and sites. I remember working very hard to try to get adequate winter clothing for the MoD police who were guarding the cruise missile site at Greenham. Despite the size of the MoD budget at that stage, I had the greatest difficulty in managing to get resources for adequate clothing, and I hope that they have it today.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000087"></a>In more recent years, on a golfing trip to Loch Lomond, I met one of the former officials of the MoD Police, who seemed very pleased to see me. He is in charge of the locker room at Loch Lomond and he gave my golf shoes an extra clean. I do not know whether I need to refer that to the Register of Members&#146; Interests, but I happily declare it to the Committee.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000088"></a>In a rather more serious vein, we, too, have no fundamental queries with regard to the use of the regulations, but I should like to ask the Minister three specific questions. First, given that the related Home Office orders&#151;the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2008, the Police (Performance) Regulations 2008 and the Police Appeals Tribunals Rules 2008&#151;all came into force on 1 December 2008, why has it taken the MoD effectively a whole year to bring these orders into force, in November 2009?</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000089"></a>Secondly, the Explanatory Memorandum talks of the orders being monitored and reviewed and says that the Ministry of Defence Police Committee will provide a quarterly external review and offer advice and guidance where necessary. That is welcome, but can the Minister confirm under what mechanism reviews and guidance will be made available to parliamentarians? Will copies be placed in the House of Lords Library or will they be restricted to being online on the MoD website? Linked to that, can the Minister give me an indication of the make-up or composition of the Ministry of Defence Police Committee? Thirdly, what discussions have there been between the MoD and the Home Office in devising these regulations? Specifically, has the MoD monitored and incorporated issues that have arisen out of the Home Office orders in the past 10 months, or are these regulations simply a like-for-like duplication of the Home Office orders?</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC126"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column GC126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

I turn, first, to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Astor. Consultation took place with the Defence Police Federation and the Chief Police Officers&#146; Staff Association. No specific issues of concern were raised and they were broadly supportive of the new procedures and the new standards of professional behaviour.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000091"></a>I turn to the strategy for bringing the procedures into effect. I can specifically respond on the matter of training, and I think and hope that this will be a full enough answer. As part of the implementation programme, a comprehensive package of training has been developed and delivered, based on Home Office police training. All ranks of chief inspector and above have received or will receive a mandatory two-day hearing or meetings course delivered by an external approved training provider. The cost is in the region of &#163;50,000, although clearly the full cost will be greater when the time of the staff attending the courses is taken into account. Improvements from the procedures will pay back very rapidly in terms of efficiency. Constables, sergeants and inspectors will receive mandatory awareness training via the MoD Police e-learning package, which is based on the Home Office police model developed by the National Policing Improvement Agency. In addition, the force has implemented a comprehensive awareness package of posters, leaflets, articles in magazines, presentations and monthly bulletins.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000092"></a>The MoD Police regulations needed to be drafted separately. They are under separate primary legislation and require a further additional consultation process with the Defence Police Federation and the Chief Police Officers&#146; Staff Association. The devolved authorities and others in Scotland had to be consulted. Copies of the guidance and, I believe, the outcome of any review&#151;I will write to the noble Lord if that is not accurate&#151;will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000093"></a>I was asked: who is on the MoD Police Committee? This committee was established under the Ministry of Defence Police Act. It is appointed to deal with the governance of the Ministry of Defence Police. It consists of one independent chair, three independent members, two police advisers and two senior MoD officials. Its role is to provide assurance to the Secretary of State for Defence on the Ministry of Defence Police and the use of constabulary powers, and confirm that they meet the standards required for a police force. The police committee formally meets quarterly.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0911099000094"></a>There were continued discussions with the Home Office. The MoD has maintained a dialogue with Home Office officials in preparation of the regulations and procedures, and since the police conduct and appeals regulations were implemented. We understand that the Police Advisory Board sub-committee, which is responsible for overseeing the reforms, is pleased with the progress and there is every indication of their success. We are informed that there is still a requirement for cultural changes, as would be anticipated at this stage. There are also indications of signification savings being accrued. Like the Home

The substances concerned are GBL and 1,4-BD; 1-benzylpiperazine&#151;BZP&#151;and a group of other substituted piperazines; synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists, which I shall refer to as synthetic cannabinoids for short&#151;that shows what a complex issue this is&#151;15 anabolic steroids, two non-steroidal growth-promoting agents and oripavine.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000002"></a>As is required by the Act, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs has been consulted and agrees with the proposals. On 25 August, following the completion of a 12-week public consultation, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced that the Government had decided to control a range of &#147;legal high&#148; drugs to protect the health of the public, especially young people. These &#147;legal highs&#148; carry varied but significant health risks. Young people in particular may often equate &#147;legal&#148; with &#147;safe&#148; and do not always understand that the drugs carry risks. By banning the drugs we will send a clear public health message to users and sellers.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000003"></a>New legislation is only part of the work that we are doing to tackle the emerging threat. We have also launched an information campaign to educate young people on the dangers of these substances, particularly when they are mixed with alcohol. As with all FRANK campaigns, ours is targeted to ensure that the message reaches the people most at risk of using the substances, and we have worked with leading experts in the field to develop the campaign. We are also targeting people looking to purchase the drugs online with key risk messages that will appear while they are searching  the internet.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000004"></a>We must be prepared to adapt our drug legislation to tackle emerging threats to health. We propose to introduce generic definitions for a number of these drugs to capture closely associated chemical compounds that otherwise might be misused instead. This is not a new approach&#151;we have used it for other synthetic drugs&#151;and again we are taking the opportunity to future-proof our drug legislation, responding to current and foreseeable trends to ensure that we keep one step ahead of the unscrupulous manufacturers of illicit substances.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000005"></a>Gamma-butyrolactone&#151;GBL&#151;is perhaps the best known of the drugs that we propose to control with noble Lords&#146; approval. Noble Lords may recollect that much concern has been expressed about the dangers of misusing GBL following the tragic death of Hester Stewart, a young woman with a bright future ahead of her. It is important that we impose suitable controls on the drug&#146;s availability to help to ensure that other families do not suffer a similar loss.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000006"></a>When ingested, GBL and a similar chemical, 1,4-BD, are rapidly converted to GHB, which is already controlled as a class C drug. The effects and risks associated with the misuse of GBL and 1,4-BD are unconsciousness, a dependence syndrome if used regularly and a risk of death by intoxication. However, unlike GHB, GBL and 1,4-BD have a wide range of legitimate industrial uses. For example, they are used in the manufacture of cleaning agents, paints and nail polish. Our recent public consultation focused on ensuring that a  control option for GBL and 1,4-BD was chosen that provides the best protection to the public from the harms that these drugs can cause while taking fully into account the uses of these chemicals for legitimate business purposes.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000007"></a>We intend to amend the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 so that the prohibitions relating to GBL and 1,4-BD as class C drugs, and the consequential offences, will apply only when the substances are intended for human ingestion. The amending regulations to allow the legitimate use of GBL and 1,4-BD are subject to the negative resolution procedure. They will be laid shortly, to come into force on 23 December at the same time as the Order in Council if it is approved.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000008"></a>The Government accepted the advisory council&#146;s advice on the class C classification of GBL. Current evidence, especially in relation to societal harm, suggests that GBL, like the related GHB which has been a class C drug since July 2003, is less harmful than current class B drugs. The health risks, including the risk of death, are increased when the drug is combined with alcohol or other depressant or stimulant substances,

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000009"></a>The control of BZP is the Government&#146;s response to the European Council&#146;s decision to require all EU members to subject BZP to &#147;control measures and criminal provisions&#148;. The decision states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09110919000066"></a>&#147;due to its stimulant properties, risk to health, the lack of medical benefits and following the precautionary principle, there is a need to control BZP&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09110919000061"></a>through measures,</p>
<ul><a name="09110919000067"></a>&#147;appropriate to the relatively low risks of the substance&#148;.</ul>
<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000010"></a>The advisory council advised a class C classification for the drug, but also recommended that controls be levied on the related group of substituted piperazines, not just BZP, using a generic definition, as BZP is only one of several substituted piperazines that have been found in the United Kingdom and are, or are capable of, being misused, with the same or very similar harms. For the very reasons I gave at the start of my remarks on the need for durable legislation, the Government support this recommendation.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000011"></a>For similar reasons, we have proposed generic definitions to deal with synthetic cannabinoids&#151;the man-made chemicals that mimic the psychoactive effects of the active ingredient in cannabis and can be sprayed on herbal smoking products such as Spice. After consideration of the available evidence, the advisory council concluded that the harms of synthetic cannabinoids are broadly commensurate with those of cannabis and that they should be classified accordingly under the 1971 Act. Cannabis was reclassified as a class B drug, with effect from 26 January 2009, and it is logical that synthetic cannabinoids should also be controlled as class B drugs.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000012"></a>Controlling the potential range of synthetic cannabinoid substances that are or could be used in these herbal smoking products presents a challenge. As with piperazines, the council calls for the wider legislative control obtained by using generic definitions. By using the scientifically elegant definitions provided by the advisory council, our controls will capture a range of synthetic cannabinoids and therefore address current and foreseeable trends.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000013"></a>Bringing 15 anabolic steroids and two non-steroidal substances, which are growth promoters, under the control of the 1971 Act brings UK legislation into line with the World Anti-Doping Agency&#146;s prohibited list. As class C drugs, they will join more than 50 anabolic steroids. The original group of steroids that came under the control of the 1971 Act as class C drugs in 1996 was identified by reference to the International Olympic Committee&#146;s prohibited list. It is therefore appropriate for the Government to update the control of such drugs by reference to its successor, the World Anti-Doping Agency&#146;s prohibited list.

<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC130"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column GC130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961. Oripavine is an alkaloid that is found in the poppy straw of the opium poppy. It can be converted into thebaine, which is controlled under the 1971 Act as a class A drug and is used in the production of semi-synthetic opiates such as hydrocodone and oxycodone. I apologise for all these different names. They are quite mind boggling, I know, but there is no way of getting around them,  I am afraid. There is currently no evidence of oripavine&#146;s misuse in the UK, nor of its illicit conversion in the UK to thebaine and other opioids. For these reasons, the advisory council concluded that its potential harm is more commensurate with class C drugs such as the opioid, buprenorphine. The Government have accepted this recommendation.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000015"></a>If the order is approved, the Government will publicise the law changes through a Home Office circular and through the Talk to FRANK and drugs.gov.uk websites. Reference to the law change and health risks relating to the drugs will be included in future government materials for young people. The order will ensure that we have up-to-date and durable legislation for these dangerous or otherwise harmful drugs to enable us to respond to current and foreseeable trends. I commend the controls proposed in the order. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09110919000016"></a><b><a name="91109-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09110919000083"></a>Baroness Neville-Jones:</b> My Lords, as the Minister said, this draft order will classify various substances as controlled drugs under the framework set up by the Misuse of Drugs Act. On these Benches we support the Motion for approval but we have a couple of concerns about the approach to the classification of, in particular, GBL and 1,4-BD.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000017"></a>I have two points to make. The first concerns the length of time that it has taken to classify GBL. It was recognised as a pro-drug of GHB, meaning that when ingested it has similar effects and risks. The class C classification was given to GHB in 2003. In 2007, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommended that GBL should be classified as a controlled drug. However, it has taken a further two years for the Government to get round to that classification and, although I take the Minister&#146;s point about the need to ensure that legitimate use is not impeded, that seems a very long time. I should be grateful to know the circumstances that caused this delay and whether in the future action can be speedier.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000018"></a>There is no doubt that during the time this drug has been under consideration but not classified there has been a significant increase in the use of the substance, including, in particular, in date rape cases. It now appears to have a faster onset of action than its related drug, GHB. Therefore, I should be very grateful to know the Minister&#146;s analysis of the speed at which these classifications take place and whether they can be somewhat speeded up.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000019"></a>My second point concerns the Government&#146;s decision to treat GBL as a class C drug. There have been cases of sudden death when this substance has been consumed with alcohol and, as I have already said, it has been linked to date rape cases, which is pretty serious from a public protection standpoint. On these Benches we do not consider that treating this substance as a class C drug will provide the required emphasis on either the potential harm or the need for robust enforcement.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000020"></a>One consequence of the chaos over cannabis reclassification is the damaging impression that class C drugs are not particularly harmful. The Minister himself mentioned, and I entirely agree, that because it is legal it does not necessarily harm less. I think that there is a mistaken impression that these drugs, if only class C, are not particularly harmful.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000021"></a>The situation is not helped by the problems that there have been with the Government&#146;s drugs helpline, FRANK, which, in one case, as the Government admitted, gave out the wrong advice earlier this year about the strength and health effects of cannabis. In the context of this order, it would be very helpful if the Minister could say what steps the Government have taken to ensure that that kind of slip-up does not occur in future, because its consequences can obviously be serious.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000022"></a>Does the Minister accept that we are still learning about the potential effects of GBL and that its serious effects are becoming clearer over time? It would be helpful if he could say on what basis the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and the Government made the decision to classify GBL at the lowest level. Did they, for example, consider the potential harm caused by GBL if it is consumed with alcohol? When the Government announced their decision to reclassify cannabis last year, they said that with,</p>
<ul><a name="09110919000068"></a>&#147;doubts about the potential harm that will be caused, we must err on the side of caution and protect the public&#148;&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 7/5/08; col. 705.]</ul>
<p><a name="09110919000062"></a>I absolutely agree. Therefore, my view is that we should err on the side of caution when it comes to GBL and that we should take a more precautionary approach than I believe a C classification gives us.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000023"></a>The Misuse of Drugs Act is supposed to put in place a flexible framework where, if evidence of greater or lesser harm of a drug emerges, the classification can be changed accordingly. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us on what kind of basis a review would take place. Will there be continuous review or a time-to-time review? What would be the possible consequences of review? We think that GBL should be classified as a class B drug and not a class C drug. I should be grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments.</p>

<p><a name="09110919000024"></a><b><a name="91109-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09110919000084"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> My Lords,  I am grateful to the Minister for sharing the  Government&#146;s thinking on this order, which we  support, and for his manfully struggling, if I might respectfully say, with the names, which are incredibly difficult. I was also very grateful for the particularly clear Explanatory Memorandum, which was very good in setting out the options and why the Government had taken them.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000025"></a>The Minister mentioned that the generic approach has been taken before, so obviously the Government have experience of the legal term &#147;structurally derived&#148;. I highlight this because, with the ever-increasing amount of scientific knowledge available about what stimulates the brain and how, there is a worry that it will be quite easy for chemists to move from one chemical make-up to another with the same effect. It is the effect that we   


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC132"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column GC132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are worrying about, as opposed to which chemicals are causing it, although the Minister may tell me more about that.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000026"></a>I worry because, as fast as the Government can move and classify, people interested in selling drugs can move equally fast to another chemical make-up. Given the discussion around GBL and the fact that it has other uses, children and young people might revert to something commonly used in other countries where the marketing is probably less slick. It might not be marketed as GBL and there might be far more sniffing of glue, paint-stripper, nail varnish remover, aerosols and all sorts of things. It is not that by classifying these things the problem will disappear. The biggest effort should still be the educational campaign. What is the current spend on the educational campaign that the Government call FRANK and what is the budget for next year? It is only by adequate education that the health of young people can be safeguarded.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000027"></a>There has been much controversy on the classification and advice from the advisory council, and we are sad that the Government chose to disregard its view. You could consider any substance: for example, alcohol is legal but in A&amp;E departments there are many cases of much harm and sudden death from drinking too much. Again, ultimately, that is a question of education, unless we go down the line of prohibition of alcohol.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000028"></a>The Minister did very well when he was talking about the objective as regards synthetic cannabinoids. The Explanatory Notes state:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09110919000065"></a>&#147;The ACMD advise that the potential harms of synthetic cannabinoids are broadly commensurate with those of cannabis&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09110919000063"></a>which I think should be followed with a full stop because the ACMD agrees that synthetic cannabinoids are fully commensurate with the harms caused by cannabis. If there was a full stop, it would continue with, &#147;which&#148; the Government chose to reclassify,</p>
<ul><a name="09110919000069"></a>&#147;as a Class B drug under the 1971 Act&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09110919000064"></a>That would be against the scientific advice, which the Explanatory Notes do not say. I do not believe that classification is the key; education is the key, and that can begin with children as young as is reasonably possible so that they are not a sitting target for marketing.</p>
<h5><a name="09110919000072"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000029"></a>There was no population or household survey data collection on BZP so there was a pretty limited insight into usage. Although we know when tragedies happen and someone takes something and dies, do the Government have any idea of how widespread the use of most or all of these products is? It is difficult to apply for a budget for education if we do not know how widespread the problem is. It is also a problem in health terms. We do not know how many people are likely to have health issues. Ultimately, that prevents a proper debate taking place.</p>

There is no doubt that we all agree that drug misuse wastes lives, destroys families and damages communities. We have to face the problem head on. We know that we can succeed in tackling drugs and reducing the harm they bring. In the past 10 years we have seen some progress and  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC133"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column GC133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>notable successes. Drug use is down but we have to be prepared to respond to the nature and force of the problem as the environment changes, and as part of that response we must look to our drug laws.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000031"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, referred to things such as spice and so on, which are a way for unscrupulous people with shops to get round the drug laws and sell things to people who feel they need them. The noble Baroness mentioned the issue of date rape, which is important, and particularly unpleasant. The ACPO forensic science service and sexual assault referral centres conducted a 12-month study into DFSA, which is drug-facilitated sexual assault&#151;yet more acronyms&#151;in a number of police areas in England. It found that GHB, which is a like drug to GBL, was detected in only two out of 344 cases. It is quite a small number but that does not mean that it is not important. We have to be aware that some of the assessments may not be correct, but it is not as great an issue as we thought it might be.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000032"></a>The noble Baroness touched on how long it has taken to do this, and she was a little hard on us. The ACMD recommended control of GBL in August 2008, not 2007. As the noble Baroness alluded to, it was not straightforward because of the number of legitimate uses. We remain committed to protecting people. The consultations had three options, with a view to ensuring a better understanding before moving down that route. We are working with the ACMD to expedite our response when we have better evidence of harm. For example, advice on the synthetic cannabinoids was received in August 2009. We laid the order in Parliament in October and we are debating it now. We may have been a little faster than was said, but I would not be complacent because it is important to act quickly. The people who do these things are willing to move quickly to try to get round all our attempts to protect people.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000033"></a>On classification, the ACMD clearly advised us that harms for GBL are equivalent to class C. We accepted that advice in full and the current evidence in relation to societal harms suggests that it is less harmful than some other drugs, but there are still a number of risks. That is why we agreed with its view. We could debate and talk about the issue, but we have made a reasonable assessment. My honourable friend Alan Campbell, the Minister responsible for drug policy, made a commitment in the other House to keep classification of GBL under review, and we will take steps to do so. If we have got it wrong, we will review it.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000034"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked what other steps we could take to prevent misuse. There is no simple solution to the misuse of drugs&#151;that is why we need a drugs strategy that encompasses enforcement, education and treatment. Often the education and treatment achieve more, but you must have enforcement as well, not least because of the unpleasant people who push the drugs. When we face the complications of responding to the misuse of a chemical, and the clever changing of chemicals that I can hardly pronounce, it adds to the complexity. However, as the noble Baroness said, we must look at this across the board.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000035"></a>I do not know the precise budget of FRANK, but I will write to the noble Baroness. There was concern about the FRANK helpline giving out wrong information.  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC134"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column GC134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I was aware that this had happened. When these incidents have come to light, we have taken immediate action and will continue to keep an eye on the situation. We cannot take more draconian measures. We continually monitor the helpline and the operators have a clear view of what they should be saying. However, human beings are what they are and sometimes things go wrong.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000036"></a>One question touched on paying attention to the ACMD. Since the advisory council was formed, on three occasions the Government in power&#151;whether the Conservatives or ourselves&#151;have not agreed with one of its statements. That is a tiny number when one considers all the recommendations that it has made. Other factors are in play. The council members are scientists who provide brilliant advice. Generally we listen to it, but on occasion there are policy issues that they are not best placed to judge&#151;it is up to Ministers to make the decision. That is correct, and when one looks at the hundreds of recommendations that the council has made and realises that only three times has the advice not been taken, one can see that the balance is about right.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000037"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, touched on concern that chemists change the chemical nature of substances outside the law. That is absolutely right. Pronouncing the names of the substances is difficult enough, and they keep changing them. That is why we are applying generic definitions to control these drugs. Again, we cannot be complacent. This is a dangerous area. However, it is super that we will be able to get hold of the people who run shops for potheads and stop this happening. That is important.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000038"></a>I hope that I have answered most of the questions. If there is anything that I have not touched on, I would be happy to come back in writing&#151;but I cannot see that I have missed anything. Approval of this order will help us to ensure that necessary controls are in place to protect the public. We all have the same aim. In particular, what is important is to protect the health of our young people from the harm done by these drugs.</p>

Already there are 5,600 compliant rail  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC135"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column GC135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>vehicles in service&#151;more than one-third of the national fleet. However, we knew that there was more to do and have further strengthened the regime by taking powers to apply accessibility standards to older rail vehicles&#151;those in service before 1 January 1999&#151;when they are refurbished. We have set an end date of 1 January 2020, by which time all rail vehicles must be compliant. The House took a keen role in scrutinising the provisions and noble Lords suggested a number of significant improvements.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000040"></a>However, in expanding RVAR to capture older rail vehicles used on public transport services, older heritage and tourist vehicles have been brought within the scope of the requirements. Applying modern accessibility requirements to heritage and tourist railways would clearly damage the experience of a train or tram journey from the past which they wish to recreate and in which this country has such a wonderful tradition. We have no desire to destroy this heritage or to restrict the important contribution that this sector makes to increasing tourism and, given the location of many of these networks, to bolstering regional economies. The draft order therefore provides an exemption for these vehicles to ensure their preservation. It may be helpful to the Grand Committee if I briefly summarise its provisions.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000041"></a>The draft order will provide an exemption for all heritage and tourist rail vehicles that were introduced into service before 1 January 1999 and that are operated on any of the many heritage and tourist networks named in the schedule. It will also exempt all heritage and tourist rail vehicles that were introduced into service before 1 January 1999 and that are operated solely within the confines of a depot, whether on an exempt or non-exempt network, and all rail vehicles, regardless of their date of entry into service, that are operated on miscellaneous networks. These networks include those that are used for industrial purposes, engineering or building works in the grounds of a private house, fairground ride and so on that would otherwise be within the scope of RVAR.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000042"></a>Vehicles covered by the exemption will be able to operate on any of the networks listed in the schedule without impediment. However, we also know that some operators occasionally run their vehicles for special events or excursions on networks, such as the Blackpool tramway, that have no exemption as they primarily provide a public transport service. We do not want accessibility legislation to stop this practice, so provision is made to allow individual vehicles to operate on non-exempt networks for a maximum of 20 traffic days each in any calendar year. A traffic day runs from 3 am to 3 am in recognition of the service patterns that some operators adopt. This provision came out of the consultation process.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000043"></a>In preparing the draft order, we considered carefully the interests of disabled people and sought a balance between these and the legitimate interests of railway enthusiasts who wish to preserve our rich railway heritage. I suppose at this point I ought to declare an interest as one of those enthusiasts. We believe that this approach is sensible and pragmatic. It has received

<p><a name="09110919000044"></a><b><a name="91109-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09110919000088"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> My Lords, this is a largely uncontroversial order, and I make it clear from the outset that I am not minded to oppose it. We all subscribe to the fact that disabled people should be able to access all public service and leisure vehicles and be in a position to enjoy, as able bodied people do, the full range of leisure activities, but one has to accept that there may be rare occasions when this is simply not feasible. Heritage rail vehicles surely fall into this latter category. Many are run on small gauges and cannot be adapted, as the order says, in a way that complies with the Disability Discrimination Act or the rail vehicle accessibility regulations, and a valuable and enjoyable attraction would become unavailable to all those who want to take advantage of it if either were enforced.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000045"></a>I have a couple of questions. I see that the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee was consulted on the resolution procedure suggested in the order, but there is nothing to indicate its response to the general consultation on this matter. Given that there was a consultation and that the responses were taken into account, can we take it that this organisation was content on this occasion to accept limited access to this leisure activity for those whom it represents? Will the Minister clarify what its response was to the main consultation? He may also know whether the owners of these pre-1 January 1999 heritage vehicles can give some access to people with disabilities, particularly those who are in wheelchairs, so that they can participate where possible, or is this largely too difficult? Does the Minister know what limited access is provided on at least some of the areas listed in the schedule? Can he also confirm that all vehicles of this type constructed since 1 January 1999 will comply with the Disability Discrimination Act and will therefore not need to be exempted at a later stage?</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000046"></a>With regard to the 20 days, we also note that these rail vehicles can have access to the main non-exempt rail networks, and that they will be exempt from these provisions when they do and when they are in their depots&#151;not necessarily for repair and maintenance but for the purpose of &#147;depot days&#148; for visitors. We think that that is a very sensible provision.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000047"></a>We are satisfied that the order provides a flexible and sensible exemption to an otherwise firm commitment which all Governments have made to try to ensure that those with disabilities are not disadvantaged in doing what they wish to do due to access being limited.</p>

That would be totally artificial because people go on the national railway for the purpose of getting on to the heritage railway. In fact, I think that some heritage railways would do rather badly if that did not happen.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000049"></a>My other point is that, in his introduction, the Minister recited the fact that the Rail Vehicle Accessibility (Networks) Exemption Order provides for all railway vehicles to be compliant with the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act by, I think, 2021. This is probably a leading and contentious question, but how does the Department for Transport propose to meet that deadline, with proper accessibility provision in all vehicles, bearing in mind that there is an absence of orders for new vehicles and you cannot go through a period of famine and suddenly catch up with yourself after a few years have elapsed? I foresee that the Government will be obliged to come back and ask for further exemptions because the vehicles will not be available. I refer in particular to the cancellation by the Government of the order for 200 diesel vehicles. Although that rests on the premise that much of the railway will be electrified, I somehow think that the process of electrification will take rather longer than the Government think and that we will see some pretty old and inaccessible vehicles continuing in use at the expiry of the exemption period.</p>

They have reflected the interest in the House in the provision of an accessible public transport system, and at the same time they have been very supportive of our heritage railways.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000051"></a>In our commitment to increasing accessibility on public transport services, we do not want to spoil the things that are part of the historical charm of heritage and tourist railways, that make them so popular with the public and that contribute so significantly to the nation&#146;s tourism industry. The Heritage Railway Association has advised that heritage railways and tramways employ 17,000 people directly and benefit from the services of 16,000 part-time volunteers. The public seem to appreciate the services that they provide, as they make 13 million passenger journeys a year on these railways and tramways.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000052"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said, the vehicles that heritage railways use were never designed with accessibility in mind, and we have to be sensitive to some of the physical and technological difficulties that prevent heritage operators from complying with accessibility standards. Let me give one example. One of the most basic requirements of RVAR is that audio and visual passenger information about route and destination is provided. While it is obviously essential on a public transport service when people are travelling from one point to another, passengers on heritage or tourist networks are usually there to enjoy the journey itself and usually end up at the point at which they started from. If information is needed, increased levels of staffing on these networks will provide that increased information. The idea of putting in wiring that has

<p><a name="09110919000053"></a><b><a name="91109-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09110919000091"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> My Lords, I was making the point that adopting accessibility standards that apply to new vehicles in the heritage sector would cause a great deal of damage to the viability of heritage railways, which is why the exemption order has been brought forward. I am very pleased that it has the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000054"></a>They both raised questions that I shall try to answer. I was asked particularly about consultation. The order was subject to public consultation in the summer of this year and was sent to all the networks listed in the schedule, as well as representative industry groups, including the Heritage Railway Association. Crucially it was sent to the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, the Government&#146;s statutory advisers on the transport needs of disabled people. Forty-nine responses were received, and a summary of these are available on the Department for Transport&#146;s websites. The provisions in the order were widely supported by all respondents as being a proportionate and effective way of dealing with the issue. The two bodies to which I referred were entirely content with the line that we have taken.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000055"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the efforts that the heritage network makes in attempting to deal with the needs of disabled people. It is important that it does so as its clientele tends to be elderly and sometimes disabled. It is an important part of a holiday or tourism experience that they should be able to use heritage railways. I am pleased to say that the great majority of heritage railways and tramways have made a special effort. I mention, in particular, the Kent &amp; East Sussex Railway, the Bluebell Railway and the Severn Valley Railway, which are three very large heritage railways. The National Tramway Museum has also made special provision for disabled people. Sometimes it is a question of adapting vehicles to make them accessible to wheelchairs, which I have seen on a number of railways. With tiny railways, it is obviously difficult to accommodate them, but even on some of the narrow gauge lines in Wales similar provisions are made.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000056"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, asked about the 20-day exemption. I think that he is perhaps confusing two different things. The exemption applies to networks such as the Brighton tramway, which provides a public transport service. The national railway is subject to the European accessibility regime, which would cover, for example, the North Yorkshire Moors Railway extending down to Whitby on the national railway. Those vehicles will be subject to the end date of 1 January 2020 when the European accessibility regime comes in, but we would hope that there would be consultations and discussions well before then to see how these could best be accommodated. They are not subject to the 20-day rule. If they want to operate on many more days, it will not be a problem.</p>

<a name="91109-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09110919000057"></a>The noble Lord also referred to whether we can meet the 2020 standards. We are working with the operators to see what needs to be made accessible by 2020 on the older vehicles, and here, too, we are engaging early. We have started the process of discussion and are embarking on something called targeted compliance.</p>

<a name="09110910000003"></a><b><a name="91109-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09110910000090"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and Ministry of Defence (Lord Drayson):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State Defence (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09110910000004"></a>UK forces in Afghanistan form part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and contribute to the efforts of the international community to assist the Government of Afghanistan to expand security and build the rule of law.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09110910000005"></a>The Taliban insurgents are ruthless and indiscriminate in their attempts to kill and maim our troops and the Afghan people.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09110910000006"></a>In his Statement on 26 February 2009 (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 394) on the detention and transfer of persons captured by UK forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, my right honourable friend the then Secretary of State for Defence set out the value of detention operations to our campaign in Afghanistan. Detention operations by UK forces are conducted in accordance with, and the holding of detainees in UK facilities meets the standards required by, the relevant provisions of international law.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09110910000007"></a>In the light of the evolving threat to our forces, we have continued to keep our approach to these operations under review. Under NATO guidelines individuals detained by ISAF are either transferred to the Afghan authorities within 96 hours for further action through the Afghan judicial process or released. And in the majority of cases, the UK forces will operate in this manner. However, in exceptional circumstances, detaining individuals beyond 96 hours can yield vital intelligence that would help protect our forces and the local population&#151;potentially saving lives, particularly when detainees are suspected of holding information on the placement of improvised explosive devices.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09110910000008"></a>Given the ongoing threat faced by our forces and the local Afghan population, this information is critical, and in some cases 96 hours will not be long enough to gain that information from the detainee. Indeed, many insurgents are aware of the 96 hours policy and simply say nothing for that entire period. In these circumstances, the Government have concluded that Ministers should be able to authorise detention beyond 96 hours, in British detention facilities to which the ICRC has access. Each case will be thoroughly scrutinised against the relevant legal and policy considerations; we will do this only where it is legal to do so and when it is necessary to support the operation and protect our troops.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09110910000009"></a>Following a Ministerial decision to authorise extended detention, each case will be thoroughly and regularly monitored by in-theatre military commanders and civilian advisers. Individuals will not remain in UK detention if there is no further intelligence to be  


<notus-date day="9" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS32"></a><b>9 Nov 2009 : Column WS32</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>gained. We will then either release the detainee or transfer the detainee to the Afghan authorities. We have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Government of Afghanistan, requiring that individuals detained by UK forces and transferred to the Afghan authorities are treated properly. Following transfer, we continue to work with the Afghans in support of their judicial processes, maintaining close links and monitoring the application of the MoU, including through regular visits by Royal Military Police and British embassy staff to transferred detainees. The ICRC also has access to the Afghan system.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09110910000010"></a>We ask our Armed Forces to operate in highly dangerous environments. In Afghanistan the capacity of the local agencies to enforce security and the rule of law is growing by the day, but it is vital that our forces have the authority and the capability to deal effectively with the serious threat to troops and those they are there to protect. I recognise the sensitivity of detention operations, but they are fundamental to the success of our military operations in Afghanistan, as has been proven in other operational areas.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09110910000011"></a>UK forces in Afghanistan operate, and will continue to operate, in accordance with international law and with the highest standards of conduct that we rightly expect of them.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09110910000015"></a>On 27 April the Home Office published a consultation, <I>Protecting the Public in a Changing Communications Environmen</I><I>t</I>, which set out the importance of communications data in helping to protect and safeguard the public; how the rapidly changing communications environment means the existing capability of the police, the security and intelligence agencies and other public authorities is declining and why change is necessary. Today I am publishing the summary of responses submitted as part of this consultation exercise.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09110910000017"></a>Used in the right way, and subject to important safeguards to protect individuals&#146; right to privacy, communications data can play a critical role in keeping all of us safe. They enabless investigators to identify suspects and their associates; provide vital clues in solving life-threatening situations such as kidnaps, and evidence supporting alibis and prosecutions; support lawful interception of communications; and assist the emergency services to help or locate vulnerable people. They are also critical to safeguarding our national security, and in particular to countering the terrorist threat.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09110910000018"></a>The consultation paper sought views on options for maintaining our vital communications data capabilities to protect the public against a background of rapid technological change. It rejected options for both a single database holding all communications data and a &#147;do nothing&#148; option. Instead it proposed a &#147;middle way&#148; approach involving two main elements for which new legislation would be required. These elements were:</p>
 provisions to impose obligations on CSPs relating to the collection and retention of specified communications data which cross their networks (including third party and other data which are not currently retained for business purposes or under existing legislation); and provisions to impose obligations on CSPs to organise the communications data they retain in a specified way enabling specific lawful requests for data by public authorities to be processed efficiently and effectively.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09110910000019"></a>The Home Office received 221 responses to the consultation exercise. As explained in the summary of responses, the Government&#146;s rejection of a central database for all communications data was welcomed. There was also recognition of the importance of communications data and agreement that the capability of communications data to protect the public should be maintained.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09110910000020"></a>As we develop the approach proposed in the consultation in the light of the responses received, we will continue to work closely with communications service providers in order to minimise as far as possible any impact on them. We will also ensure that any new proposals will include strong safeguards to minimise the potential for abuse and to ensure the security and integrity of the data.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="09110910000048"></a>Member states reached agreement on the council conclusions concerning the EU position for the forthcoming Copenhagen climate conference. Dinner discussions on 20 October saw early positioning of member states for the following day&#146;s debate and the UK was among those arguing for ambitious conclusions to send a clear signal of intent prior to the international negotiations in December. The council agreed on a text containing three compromises relating to the long-term EU emissions-reduction target, bunker fuels and assigned amount units (AAUs). At lunch, the discussion centred on the need to engage with business and expertise as well as co-ordinating EU messaging and maintaining contact in the run-up to Copenhagen.</p>

In addition to Lord Browne, the review will have six other members chosen for the breadth and depth of their experience and expertise. These are Michael Barber, Diane Coyle, David Eastwood, Julia King, Rajay Naik and Peter Sands. I have discussed these appointments and the terms of reference for the review, set out below, with the honourable Member for Havant. We are both committed to ensuring the independent nature of this important piece of work. The review fulfils the commitment made by the Government during the Commons stages of the Higher Education Act 2004 to review the operation of variable tuition fees after these had been in force for three years.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="09110910000054"></a>Variable tuition fees have provided institutions with a secure income stream worth &#163;1.3 billion per year, which has helped to sustain the long-term financial health and viability of this crucially important sector. Over this time, the number of students attending university has continued to rise, as has the number coming from lower-income backgrounds.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="09110910000056"></a>The independent review will consider the balance of contributions from all those who benefit from the higher education system. It will consult all those with an interest in higher education in this country, including current and potential students. The review will also convene an advisory forum to draw on the views and expertise of a range of representatives with interests in higher education.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="09110910000066"></a>This national policy statement forms a key element of the Government's programme to deliver the reforms to the planning system included in last year's Planning Act.

<a name="91109-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="09110910000067"></a>The aim of the reforms to the planning system set out in the Planning Act is to make the planning system more responsive to challenges such as climate change, more streamlined, efficient and predictable, and more transparent and accountable with full and fair opportunities for public consultation and community engagement.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="09110910000068"></a>The draft national policy statement for ports sets out the broad need for ports capacity looking ahead to 2030 and beyond, taking account in particular of our forecasts of port freight demand and the regional and local economic benefits of port activity. It also restates the Government's long-standing policy that this need can be best be met by an efficient and competitive ports industry operating in a free-market environment. It further sets out, in the context of the Government&#146;s overall objectives for sustainable development, including mitigating and adapting to climate change and the achievement of good design, how the various potential adverse impacts of port development should be addressed by applicants with a view to avoiding, mitigating and where necessary compensating for such impacts. It notes how ports can support the development of low carbon energy sources and a low carbon economy. And it provides guidance about how the Infrastructure Planning Commission must weight any residual impacts in considering applications for nationally significant port developments, including in setting requirements and agreeing obligations for consented developments.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="09110910000069"></a>The department is also publishing, in parallel, its appraisal of sustainability of the draft national policy statement, incorporating a strategic environmental assessment, as well as an impact assessment and an assessment of the NPS under the habitats and wild birds directives and regulations.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="09110910000070"></a>The public consultation being launched today invites views on the extent to which this national policy statement provides a suitable framework for the Infrastructure Planning Commission in making decisions about consents for new port developments. Its decisions will be based primarily on national policy statements, so it is all the more important that people have a full opportunity to comment on the detailed drafting. The consultation closes on 15 February but I encourage people to respond earlier where possible in order to allow their comments to be taken into account in parliamentary scrutiny of the policy statement. Consultees are also invited to participate in consultation events to be organised by my department in London, Leeds and Cardiff.

The advice I have commissioned from High Speed 2 on high speed rail services is likely to be a significant factor in determining future policy, I have now concluded that it would be appropriate to publish this NPS early next year, having considered the HS2 report. In addition, I still expect to publish a draft NPS for airports by 2011.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="09110910000077"></a>I am today announcing the Government&#146;s intention to introduce in the next Finance Bill a further change to the rules on how groups of companies are taxed when they buy back their issued debt at a discount to the amount borrowed. The further change is in addition to the changes I previously announced in my Statement on 14 October.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="09110910000078"></a>In my Statement on 14 October, I announced that the Government proposed to deal with the circumstances in which companies could buy back their debt at a discount to the amount borrowed without being taxed. I announced changes that would tighten the rules dealing with debt buybacks to ensure that only those debt buybacks that are undertaken as part of genuine corporate rescues will benefit from discount not being subject to tax.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="09110910000079"></a>The Statement made clear that even if a company benefited from the discount not being taxed under the new proposals any subsequent cancellation of the debt by the new creditor will result in the debtor being taxed on the previously untaxed discount.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="09110910000080"></a>HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) published more detail on these proposals on 22 October, available at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/drafts/debt-buyback.htm">www.hmrc.gov.uk/drafts/debt-buyback.htm</a>, which clarified the circumstances in which the discount on the debt buyback would not be taxed and the mechanism by which a subsequent release of such a debt would result in the debtor being taxed on the discount.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="09110910000081"></a>It has since come to light that groups of companies may be able to avoid the discount that was not taxed at the time of the buyback being taxed on the subsequent release of the debt. Groups may be able to achieve this by means of the new creditor accepting ordinary shares in the debtor in order to release the debtor from its liability.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="09110910000082"></a>The Government are therefore proposing to introduce additional legislation to prevent this. The new legislation will ensure that where the discount on a buyback is not taxed, any subsequent release of the debt where the consideration for the release is ordinary shares in the debtor or the entitlement to any such shares then the debtor will be taxed on the previously untaxed discount arising on the debt buyback.</p>

<a name="91109-wms0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a><a name="09110910000083"></a>The further legislation announced today will have effect in relation to releases of debt that occur on or after today in relation to any debt that was subject of a debt buyback occurring on or after 14 October and to which the proposed legislation announced on 14 October will apply.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="09110910000084"></a>Draft legislation will today be published on HMRC&#146;s website covering both the 14 October announcement and today&#146;s announcement.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="09110910000086"></a>The debt cap forms part of the important reforms to the taxation of the foreign profits of UK companies, which the Government introduced in Finance Bill 2009.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a><a name="09110910000087"></a>The amendments announced today will ensure that the debt cap functions as intended providing Exchequer revenue protection while at the same time keeping the compliance burden as small as possible. Specifically, there will be the following amendments made:</p>
 legislation will be introduced to remove accountancy mismatches in the application of the gateway test to ensure that a consistent way of measuring liabilities is used in arriving both at the worldwide group&#146;s gross debt and the net debt of UK companies; legislation will be introduced to put beyond doubt that preference shares are excluded from the relevant liabilities both of the worldwide group and of UK companies when applying the gateway test; legislation will be introduced to extend the definition of financial instrument to include all derivatives, such as options, swaps, futures, forwards and contracts for differences. This is because the current definition, which relies on the FSA handbook, may exclude certain derivatives which are routinely traded by many banks and other financial institutions. The change will ensure that groups are not disqualified from the qualifying financial services groups exemption because they undertake such dealings;legislation will be introduced allowing companies to elect that no debt cap disallowance is allocated to them. This will benefit companies, such as those involved in whole business securitisations, that need certainty of tax treatment in order to protect their credit ratings. This legislation will also mandatorily restrict the allocation of disallowances to dual resident investment companies; legislation will be introduced to extend the definition of financing income, so that guarantee fees are included as financing income. This provides consistency of treatment where guarantee fees are paid within a group, or are deemed to be paid under transfer pricing legislation, since a guarantee fee is already treated as a financing expense of the payer; legislation will be introduced to refine the definition of a group treasury company for the purposes of the debt cap rules so as to exclude trading companies performing a peripheral group treasury company function;

This will ensure that the available amount reflects the economic cost to the group of borrowing by partnerships in which it has an interest, and is computed in a way consistent with the UK tax treatment of partnership debts;legislation will be introduced to ensure that certain partnerships, formed under the laws of an overseas territory, qualify for the collective investment scheme exclusion for the purposes of identifying an ultimate parent company under the debt cap rules. Where an overseas corporate fund vehicle has a majority stake in a number of commercially unrelated groups of companies, this will minimise the possibility of all of its controlled holdings being treated as a single group for debt cap purposes; legislation will be introduced to ensure that securitisation companies, which come within the special tax regimes we introduced in 2005, are excluded from the debt cap rules. This will ensure that the tax-neutral status of these companies is not jeopardised and will avoid any adverse effect on their credit ratings; anda new power will be introduced to allow the definitions of the available amount and the tested expense amount to be changed or added to through secondary legislation. Regulations made under this power will be capable of having effect from 1 January of the calendar year in which they are made. This will ensure that difficulties arising where the accounting treatment for external borrowing in the consolidated accounts differs from that in a UK company&#146;s individual accounts can be addressed through regulations.

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government further to the remarks by Baroness Thornton on 1 May 2008 (<I>WA 410</I>) during the Committee of the Whole House on the Alcohol Labelling Bill stating that if a voluntary scheme was not adopted by industry the Government would introduce a mandatory scheme, when they intend to introduce mandatory labelling of containers of alcoholic beverages. [HL6136]</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="09110920000003"></a><b><a name="91109w0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09110920000563"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> In May 2007, the department reached a United Kingdom-wide voluntary agreement with the alcohol industry to include specified unit and health information on alcohol labels. The Government made clear their expectation that the majority of labels should be covered by the end of 2008.</p>

<a name="91109w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="09110920000004"></a>We expect to be able to publish shortly the results of independent monitoring from samples taken in April 2009. We will be looking at whether a majority of labels are covered by the expected information and whether the content is consistent with the 2007 voluntary agreement.</p>

<a name="91109w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="09110920000005"></a>If we find that most labels are still not complying with the voluntary agreement, we will consider what action we can take to improve compliance, including using existing powers under the Food Safety Act to make this a mandatory requirement.</p>

<a name="91109w0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="09110920000006"></a>We believe that consumers have a right to consistent, agreed information on at least the large majority of alcohol labels, to enable them to assess their intake of alcohol and to relate this to the Government's guidelines.</p>

The normal criteria which the Government would apply for the recognition of a state remain those that are set out in the Written Answer dated 16 November 1989 (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 494 ) by the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. They are that &#147;it should have, and seem likely to continue to have, a clearly defined territory with a population, a Government who are themselves able to exercise effective control of that territory, and independence in their external relations. Other factors, including some United Nations resolutions, may also be relevant&#148;.</p>

This electrification programme radically affects the requirements for rolling stock over the next decade.</p>

<a name="91109w0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_478"></a><a name="09110920000516"></a>There will be far less need for diesel trains and a greater requirement for electric trains. In particular, the previously planned procurement by the Government of new diesel trains has now been superseded. Shorter term solutions will include the redeployment of existing rolling stock within and between train operators. Accordingly, we will publish a new rolling stock plan in the autumn, taking account of the changed circumstances and setting out a revised strategy.</p>
