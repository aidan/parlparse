I am not convinced that that was the whole story. I find it impossible to believe that any of this happened with no fraudulent behaviour whatever. The Americans are certainly exploring the fraud and criminal activities that took place. Why have Her Majesty's Government not gone down that road and set up a full-scale inquiry into fraudulent behaviour in this area?</p>

I believe that the primary fault here must lie with those who were instrumental in creating and rating complex derivative-based products, but there is also a serious element of caveat emptor on the part of the purchasers of those products, which in many cases were other banks, insurance companies or pension funds. If there was criminal behaviour, that must clearly be pursued, and the primary responsibility for that will lie either with the Financial Services Authority or the Serious Fraud Office. To the extent that there is any evidence of fraudulent or criminal activity, I know that the Government will endorse a vigorous pursuit of those inquiries and a successful conclusion of matters in the courts.</p>

Many people bought shares in these banks on the basis of the published accounts that had been certified as accurate by the auditors.

In practice, the auditing profession has been rather good at placing responsibility for accounts on directors: the audit certificate is deemed fair and reasonable on the basis of assurances given to auditors by directors. One cannot distinguish and separate out entirely responsibilities here, but the auditing and accounting profession clearly has questions to answer. I am very pleased that the communiqu&#233; from the OECD Finance Ministers meeting last weekend identified the need to get to grips with accounting issues, particularly around off-balance sheet items and derivative exposures, which are at the core of many of these accounting problems.</p>

The primary function of the vessel is not sea rescue, although it has performed that responsibility when in the vicinity. The ship has never been in the area for 12 months of the year, but we appreciate the importance of having a presence there. The Navy command has made a plan, the details of which we do not want to give at this point, but there will be a vessel in the area during the winter.</p>

The vessel is due for two sessions of repair and serious maintenance between May and October this year and between May and October next year. It is hoped that those two costs, which are already in the budget, will go a long way towards meeting the cost of the repair to the damage. On whether we operate too few ships, we think that we can provide an alternative ship for the area not at the expense of other deployments. A balance has to be struck between ships with extra capability or more ships; that always has to be taken into account.</p>

If the Government were ever to decide&#151;presumably they will have to at some point&#151;to withdraw &#147;Endurance&#148;, does she agree that it would be important for explanations to be given, through diplomatic channels, to the Argentine Government that we are, as I assume we are, ready to continue to defend the islands?</p>

As that time approaches, we will have to consider what we should do about a replacement. The Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence have discussed who should take prime responsibility for funding this kind of exercise, given, as I said, that the ship&#146;s primary purpose is the sovereign presence in the area. We think that this is an important area. Important discussions are coming up on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Antarctic Treaty and submissions to the United Nations will be made by May of this year on possible future expansion. We are very well aware of the importance of having a presence in this region.</p>

The difficulty arose during routine cleaning of freshwater filters. I am told that a seawater valve was changed and that the crew could not close it properly, which led to water coming into the engine room and elsewhere on the boat. Therefore, it was decided to isolate the engine room to prevent further water from coming on board. As a result, the ship lost propulsion. It was a routine exercise and, until we have the full inquiry into what went on, which we cannot carry out until the ship is back home, it would not be wise for us to comment at this stage.</p>

The changes in the ways that water companies charge for the drainage of surface water and highways would cost churchgoers and the Church of England some &#163;15 million a year, and the total effect for community groups would be very much higher. It seems to be one of those situations where everyone is agreed on what should happen, but no one can do anything. Will the Minister undertake to end the buck-passing by revising and reissuing the guidance to Ofwat and the water companies to make it absolutely clear that community halls and church buildings should not be charged for surface water drainage on the same basis as businesses?</p>

The basis has changed since 2000, after consultation, and has met broad approval. What has gone wrong is the way in which individual companies have implemented the guidance; in particular, nearly all complaints revolve around United Utilities whose charges have increased by several hundred per cent in a number of cases. The Government have made it clear that this is unacceptable; Ofwat has made that clear to the company involved; and the company has apologised for its actions and is taking remedial steps.</p>

I had a garage which was considered separate from my house and the water rates charged on it were attached to an old rateable value totally out of touch with the present metering and new ways of providing water. Eventually, when it was agreed that it would become part of my house, it all came in under my meter. It did seem to me that anyone who had property in the category that the right reverend Prelate has spoken about, is at a disadvantage. Are they still using a rateable value as the basis of assessment? All these other changes in water charges have been to the benefit of the customer.</p>

The movement has been from the old rateable value to the new surface water drainage charges. That is what has caused the consternation. The principle is unexceptionable; namely, that properties should pay for the clearance of surface water on the simple grounds that the community has to pay if the property owner does not pay, because we need to have this water removed. The question is about fairness and the treatment of particular categories. What is clear, as the right reverend Prelate was indicating, is that the churches deserve special consideration, as do some other organisations like charities and sports clubs. Those issues are being looked into to make a separate arrangement for them. The issue about the general principle I think is not contestable.</p>

Where they do not there is a fair amount of public furore. That is why I have identified the particular company which has caused the greatest problems. Other companies have implemented the new charges without this degree of controversy and concern. How do we prevent the issue arising in the future? I think it is hugely unlikely that any other water company would follow the course which United Utilities has been obliged to do, which is to revise its position with regard to charges to take account of public criticism and to apologise for the actions it has recently taken.</p>

However, the position is clear as regards other properties; they are charged on the surface water that accumulates. If they do not pay, if we create exemptions, the ordinary householder has to make up the deficit. As a consequence, it will be clear that we have to look at reductions and exemptions very carefully. I am merely indicating that the furore has broken out&#151;and I can give numbers on this&#151; because certain charges for which United Utilities has been responsible are 16 or 17 times larger than those for comparable buildings in other water authorities.</p>

I think that most of us would agree that the first duty of a democratic Parliament is to hold the Executive to account; that is the very core of what it is there for. The House will be aware that we now have allegations&#151;I repeat, allegations&#151;of British complicity in extraordinary rendition and torture from Morocco, Egypt, the Gambia, Guantanamo Bay, Iraq and some other places. Even more embarrassingly, we have a United Nations report on the matter which holds Britain responsible for illegal and concealing acts. In the light of such rumours, would it not be better for a country with our reputation and standing in the world to appoint an independent inquiry to go into these matters, which go far beyond the case of Binyam Mohamed, so that the air can be cleared and we can once again assume our position in the world as supporters of civil liberties and freedom?</p>

We have the Intelligence and Security Committee which provides oversight of the intelligence agencies. It is important that the Government should keep that body well informed. As the House will know, the matter of possible criminal wrongdoing has been referred to the Attorney-General, who was here to answer questions and, I hope, to convince the House of the seriousness with which she will investigate this matter.</p>

I have always been struck by the dedication of those who work on it. It must be one of the most hard-working committees that Members of either House serve on, and it has the disadvantage, from a parliamentary point of view, that none of that work is ever given recognition because, by its nature, it has to be done behind closed doors. It is incumbent on government Ministers to be open, honest and straightforward with that committee, as with the agencies. That is where we should look for further inquiries on this matter, and I am happy that my noble friend has taken this opportunity to point that out to the House.</p>

If the evidence shows that the Government collaborated with foreign intelligence agencies by supplying the ingredients for the questions to be put to torture victims, would that be referred to the police for criminal investigation, or would it be treated as a breach of our obligations under the convention against torture, and would that evidence be made available to the special rapporteur as well?</p>

This Bill will create a national savings gateway scheme, giving 8 million people the chance to open accounts in which each pound that they save will be matched by 50p of government money. I am pleased to have the chance to set out the purpose of the Bill and I look forward to the contributions of noble Lords both today and at future stages. I know that the Bill will benefit from the careful and expert scrutiny that it will be given in this House.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09031759000055"></a>I start by explaining the aims of the saving gateway scheme, which the Bill will introduce from 2010, and how we have reached this point, because this is a measure that has been carefully developed over a number of years. We have two objectives for the saving gateway scheme: to encourage a savings habit among working-age people on lower incomes and to promote financial inclusion.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09031759000056"></a>I am sure that noble Lords on all sides of this House will agree on the importance of saving. Savings can provide people with independence during their lives, security if things go wrong and comfort in later years. They make it easier to deal with unexpected events, to plan ahead and to prepare for the future. A lack of savings, by contrast, makes it more difficult to invest in education or training. Unexpected expenses, such as an unplanned domestic expenditure or an illness, are much harder to deal with, as there is less of a buffer to fall back on.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09031759000057"></a>Government incentives to save are already in place, including tax relief on pension contributions and tax-free savings accounts, or ISAs, which are now held by   


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_119"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>18 million adults. However, both these incentives rely on tax relief to provide the incentive to save, but that offers little benefit to people on lower incomes, who pay little or no income tax. We know that people on lower incomes also have lower levels of savings than the rest of the population. According to the most recent Family Resources Survey, 43 per cent of households with a total weekly income of less than &#163;100 have no savings at all, a percentage that falls as incomes rise.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09031759000058"></a>We therefore conclude that there is a strong case for an additional incentive for people on lower incomes to save, which is what the saving gateway scheme aims to provide by offering 50p from the Government for each pound saved. We believe that this can promote a saving habit, which will continue even after the saving gateway comes to an end. The saving gateway also aims to further financial inclusion by bringing people into contact with mainstream financial services, some of them for the first time.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09031759000059"></a>We are, I am sure, all aware of the costs that financial exclusion can bring, often to the most vulnerable members of our society, whether through something as simple as paying commission to cash a cheque or through being forced to turn to doorstep lenders or even illegal loan sharks because affordable credit is not available. We are working hard to tackle financial exclusion, supported by the Financial Inclusion Fund. The saving gateway will form part of that work by encouraging people to engage with the banks, building societies and credit unions that will offer saving gateway accounts.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09031759000060"></a>Again, there is a case for a particular focus on people on lower incomes. According to research by the Financial Inclusion Taskforce, whose chairman, Mr Brian Pomeroy, gave evidence to the committee on this Bill in the other place, low-income households are more than twice as likely to be unbanked as other households. Many may also be saving through unregulated products, the dangers of which were shown by the collapse of Farepak in 2006. Our objectives for the saving gateway have been welcomed by organisations that help to tackle financial exclusion, by representatives of people on lower incomes, by organisations focused on saving and by the financial services industry.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09031759000061"></a>Over recent years, we have looked closely at how the saving gateway can best achieve these commendable objectives. Since we first consulted on this idea in 2001, we have conducted two pilots of the saving gateway. Between the two, more than 22,000 people took part and over &#163;15 million was saved. Those who participated were overwhelmingly positive about the effect of the saving gateway.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09031759000062"></a>We are currently conducting further evaluation of the second pilot. The initial results show that 91 per cent of participants would be very likely to open a saving gateway account again if they had the chance and that 93 per cent would recommend it to a friend. This evaluation also shows that, before the pilot started, around 40 per cent of participants were putting money into a savings account at least once a month. During the pilot, the proportion rose to around 80 per cent of participants. Unsurprisingly, that number fell slightly once the pilot ended and the incentive of a government  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_120"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>contribution was removed, but even 18 months later around 60 per cent were still saving once a month and around a further 20 per cent had saved in the previous three months.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09031759000063"></a>We have also learnt a number of important lessons from the pilots, which have informed the design of the national saving gateway scheme. As I said, we believe that there is a strong case for an additional incentive for people on lower incomes to save. They have fewer savings than the rest of the population, they benefit less from incentives that rely on tax relief and they are also more likely to experience financial exclusion. We believe that the saving gateway should be focused on people of working age, rather than pensioners. There are significant incentives for people to save for their retirement before they reach it, including tax reliefs to incentivise pension savings, which were worth around &#163;30 billion in 2007-08. We will also be introducing personal accounts to promote low-cost, tax-enhanced savings for retirement.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09031759000064"></a>On average, pensioners have higher levels of savings than the rest of the population. Only 17 per cent of households with more than one adult over pension age have no savings, compared to 24 per cent for all households and, as I mentioned, 43 per cent of households with incomes of up to &#163;100 a week. The Government already provide significant support to pensioners in other ways, such as winter fuel payments, free prescriptions, free eye tests and free off-peak nationwide local bus travel for the over-60s, free TV licences for the over-75s, free central heating for pension credit recipients and free loft and cavity insulation for those aged over 70.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09031759000065"></a>We are also increasing the full basic state pension to &#163;95.25 a week from April 2009 and raising the standard minimum income guarantee in pension credit by more than indexation in April, which means that no single pensioner need live on less than &#163;130 a week in 2009-10 and no pensioner couple on less than &#163;198.45. These measures mean that pensioners have money to fall back on, even if they have low levels of savings. I know that my noble friend Lady Hollis has views on this subject and I very much look forward to hearing them. I doubt that I have assuaged her concerns, but hope that I may be able to do so in the course of our consideration of this Bill.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09031759000066"></a>Our target group is working-age people on lower incomes. We believe that the simplest and most efficient way of reaching them is through passporting eligibility for the saving gateway from qualifying benefits and tax credits, which is what the Bill sets out. This means that people will not be required to complete a means test to prove that they are eligible for the saving gateway and they will not need to contact the Government. Instead, they can automatically be sent a notice of eligibility by HMRC, which will be operating the scheme. The qualifying benefits and tax credits are listed in Clause 3 of the Bill and have been carefully selected to target working-age people on lower incomes.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09031759000067"></a>Noble Lords may be aware that there was some discussion in the other place about the fact that carer&#146;s allowance does not feature in that list. We have listened carefully to the views expressed. As the Economic Secretary said in the other place, we are minded to extend eligibility for the saving gateway to recipients  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_121"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of carer&#146;s allowance, in order to target claimants of working age. We hope to do this in Committee. We believe that this amendment will make an additional 300,000 carers eligible for the saving gateway.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09031759000068"></a>I turn to how the accounts will work, once they have been opened with an account provider. These accounts will last for two years. Each month, savers will be able to deposit up to &#163;25. The monthly limit will promote regular saving. For each pound saved, the Government will contribute 50p at the end of the two years. In total, this means that account holders will be able to save up to &#163;600 in their accounts and receive up to &#163;300 from the Government, all of which will be tax-free. How the government contribution will work is set out in Clause 8 of the Bill, which provides that the maturity payment, as it is called in the Bill, will be calculated on the basis of the highest balance that has been reached during the account. At the end of the account&#146;s life, the saver will have the choice of what happens to the money that they have saved and the maturity payment that they have earned. There will always be a default savings account for the money to roll into if the saver does not make an active decision. The account holder will also have the choice of different saving products, or of spending some or all of the money.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09031759000069"></a>As I said, the results of the pilots suggest that many people will continue to save, having established the saving habit that the saving gateway is aimed to promote. I am sure that there will be widespread support in the House for that aim and for the aim of promoting financial inclusion and I hope that there will be widespread support for the Bill. It will introduce a national saving gateway scheme that will offer 8 million people a real incentive to save, targeted on working people on lower incomes who need it most. That will help to initiate a saving habit. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09031759000071"></a>For my part, I welcome the explanation that the Minister has given of the Bill and its objectives. We must recognise that it is something of a mouse of a Bill compared to the scale of the challenges that we face, but it is welcome nevertheless as a small but significant recognition of the importance of developing a culture and habit of saving and thrift in the UK. That is clearly important for two reasons. First, because it is good for the economy; and secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it is good for the individuals. I shall touch on those points briefly.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09031759000072"></a>First, it is good for the economy because a high savings economy is more productive and wealth-creating. It is important that we are clear about that because there have been moments when the messages from the Government have appeared to be somewhat ambiguous or contradictory. We should be very clear that, at the end of the day, the output of the UK economy in the long run is determined by the size of the labour force and its productivity; it is not determined by any particular level of consumer spending or government spending. The more savings we have, the more productive the

A low savings economy, whether brought about because of government borrowing or consumer borrowing beyond prudent levels in the end leads to a trade deficit and a build-up of debt that has to be paid for by future generations. So we should unequivocally be in favour of a high savings economy. The question, of course, is how to manage the transition from where we are to that point, but that is the direction in which we should all seek to travel.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09031759000073"></a>Secondly, savings and thrift is important for individuals in encouraging independence and self-reliance. I accept, as has the Minister, that there are many people on low incomes, especially those targeted by the Bill, for whom paying their way week by week is a struggle. They have little if any cash put by to protect them against occasional emergencies. However, we should not imagine that just because people have low incomes, they cannot save. In part, it is an attitude of mind and an attitude of responsibility&#151;of people living within means and taking some responsibility for their future welfare. Indeed, the pilots have demonstrated that many people on low incomes&#151;not all, but many&#151;can, if given incentives, find the opportunity to put some money aside to provide security for their own well-being.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09031759000074"></a>I was reminded of that a few years ago when an uncle of mine died at the age of 95. Among his papers, we found a life assurance policy that had been taken out by his mother when he was born in 1901 at a rate of a penny a week to a Hampshire mutual society. His mother was the wife of a rural labourer who became a war widow during the First World War, but for 40 years a penny a week was paid to that life assurance company to ensure that when her son died there was money to pay for his funeral.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09031759000075"></a>That type of attitude was not unique to her. It was part of the thinking and culture of her generation and class. I fear that in many sections of society, we have lost that sense of responsibility and thrift in the headlong rush to live on borrowing and credit&#151;the mortgages of the future. Like the Minister, I am very much in favour of something which tries to recreate some of that culture and habit.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09031759000076"></a>The question is: if this Bill can help&#151;and some pilot results suggest that it can&#151;what can we do to make it even more effective? Let me pick on two problems that often occur to people targeted by this Bill. One is the fear that if they save and build up reserves and then, as often happens, fall into default on some of their loans or credit-card bills and are put under a court order, their savings are immediately taken as part of the settlement. That creates a view, &#147;Why bother saving up money which will simply be taken away every so often when I hit that problem? If I had spent it, it would not have been there to be lost?&#148;. The problem is that if they do not save, it is more likely that they will not have the cushion to protect them when the unexpected comes along and they cannot keep up their payments.</p>

<a name="90317-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09031759000077"></a>Another serious issue is that when they fall into that situation, get behind on rent and become homeless, getting back into housing requires a deposit. Many cannot, even with the amount of money envisaged in this scheme, save up enough to be able to take out the deposit to get back into housing.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_123"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90317-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09031759000078"></a>Will the Government consider a couple of modifications to this Bill? The first is to provide that savings in these gateway schemes are excluded from normal debtor claims and court settlements. In other words, will they ring-fence them, so that money put aside in these savings schemes will still be there at the end of a court settlement? It will not then be lost, but will be there to continue to provide a cushion.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90317-0003.htm"/>


<a name="90317-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09031759000079"></a>The second possibility is to create a link to the Social Fund, so that those who have built up some savings, and demonstrated that they have a savings habit, would have preferential access to a top-up loan or grant, which would enable them to afford a deposit to get back into housing. For many, that is the real source of continual poverty. Once they are evicted and lose their housing, they can never get the money together to get back into rented accommodation.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09031759000080"></a>Those two changes would significantly enhance the perceived attractiveness of putting savings aside in these schemes. They would address real issues on people&#146;s minds and would increase the incentive to participate. I will leave it to the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, to raise the issue of pensioners. However, in passing, I add it as a third area which the Government might amend. It is odd to suggest that people cease needing this just because they pass over the pension age. While many pensioners may have capital, many do not. They would benefit from the incentive to build up enough of a cushion to deal with the odd, unexpected bill. However, even with those additions, we have to accept that this Bill will remain a mouse&#151;maybe a slightly stronger one. If we are to address the lack of savings in this country, we need to go further. I suspect that is beyond the scope of this Bill.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09031759000081"></a>There are a couple of things that I have spoken about in the House before, which I would like briefly to mention at this stage. One major step forward would be to remove taxation from all income derived from savings. It seems anomalous that, having encouraged people to save out of taxed income, we tax them again on the income that they produce from those savings. It is no incentive to save and no way to encourage people to be independent. My suggestion would simplify a whole range of schemes that are wholly designed to get around the taxation of savings, and would be a major step forward.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09031759000082"></a>The second point that I want to put to the House is about recognising the importance of passing down modest levels of accumulated savings from one generation to the next, and in particular allowing people who have built up a pension pot, and who believe that they can get by by drawing income from that capital rather than converting it into an annuity, to preserve their pension pot and not to have to convert it into an annuity, and to pass that savings pot down to the next generation to go into its pension pot without being lost to an annuity conversion or being subject to high levels of taxation. We must accept that, in the current situation, it will take several generations to build up the levels of capital in this country that will give people the independence that we want them to have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09031759000083"></a>I know that it is asking a lot of the Minister to leap to those suggestions in this Bill, but I ask him to consider the other suggestions. Meanwhile, I welcome the Bill.</p>

<a name="09031759000084"></a><b><a name="90317-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09031759000276"></a>Lord Morgan:</b> My Lords, this is a modest seeming Bill that embodies important, progressive principles. It dispels the commonly held illusion that poorer people do not save, do not want to save and cannot save, and it confirms what the Institute for Fiscal Studies and others have shown: that matching payments of this kind can provide people on poor incomes with an effective incentive to save. It can make a real difference to their lives, notably in dealing with the problems of indebtedness. As my noble friend has observed, previously higher paid people have had benefits through the tax system: for example, up to 40 per cent tax relief on ISAs.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09031759000085"></a>The Bill is an attempt to deal with lower paid people, and is therefore an attempt to deal with an implicit class bias in our current savings and taxation system. At a time when ordinary people feel powerless in the face of unaccountable and irresponsible capitalists in our society, it takes a perhaps modest step towards empowerment, and the Treasury and its officials should be congratulated on it. It is not a rash experiment, as we have heard; it has been thoroughly tested in two major Treasury schemes in which, I believe, 22,000 people took part. The schemes proved the popularity and effectiveness of regular savings among less well-off working people of working age, and showed that new savers can be generated and the pattern of saving behaviour altered.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09031759000086"></a>The Bill offers, as we have heard, a clear and simple structure for saving, with the Government matching savings by 50p per &#163;1. Perhaps &#163;1 per &#163;1 would be an even more attractive scheme for people in the gateway scheme. It covers up to 8 million people: a wide range of poorer people on various allowances, benefits and tax credits. A simple system of passporting makes it straightforward to proceed from entitlement to benefits to eligibility for the gateway scheme, and the fact that there is no means test is of enormous merit, given all the indignity that has been associated with means-testing.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09031759000087"></a>The Bill is very helpful to women, among others. Women with scant means who are trying to manage household budgets will find it helpful, and it will reinforce one of the points made in a debate last week in your Lordships&#146; House on the impact of our current economic problems on women. In that connection, I was pleased to hear that carers will be included in this scheme. We have been pressed, strongly and rightly, to include carers, who are commonly on lower incomes. It is difficult to see why people receiving a particular allowance should be included and people receiving a carer&#146;s allowance should not. The role of carers was recently highlighted in the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Bill passed in the Commons by my honourable friend and former pupil, Hywel Francis, the MP for Aberavon. I am glad that that principle is now to be extended.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09031759000088"></a>The Bill has many good features. It will run for a reasonable period and is due to start in 2010, which may be a better year than 2009 to launch such a scheme. There is to be a variety of providers, and  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_125"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>important among them will be the Post Office with its wide accessibility for ordinary citizens. I should like to think that a savings gateway account would be an ideal scheme for the proposed post office bank that has been discussed in connection with the Postal Services Bill. Advice will be available from the Government and bodies like credit unions, and as we have heard, no restrictions will be put on the use of the savings accumulated. That is unlike the schemes of a somewhat similar nature in the United States where purposes like housing are specified.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09031759000089"></a>As we have heard, the Bill should be welcomed on all sides of the House. It enjoyed cross-party support in the House of Commons as a measure for financial involvement, financial education and financial inclusion. For people of a conservative outlook, you would think that a saving gateway would be a welcome form of escape from the dependency culture in which so many working-class people have been imprisoned over the generations. It should encourage a greater mood of self-reliance and enable categories of people not hitherto involved in saving to become familiar with the principles of financial management. That is particularly valuable in the middle of this economic turmoil, when the basic principles of financial management personally, let alone nationally, have clearly not penetrated into many people.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09031759000090"></a>For those of us on the left, the idea of a saving gateway scheme should be welcomed as a way of extending social equality and opportunity. It will do something modest but none the less important in principle towards weakening the entrenched class divide in this country. It offers help to those who need it the most. Tackling financial exclusion is a way of tackling social exclusion more generally. I believe therefore that important social as well as financial principles are embodied in the Bill and I warmly support it.</p>

However, I should say immediately that this would not have been my position when it was brought forward originally. This is a cash savings account for individuals on low incomes with excellent incentives and the promise of kick-starting the saving habit among people on lower incomes by the provision of matched funding. Encouraging people who do not normally do so to engage with financial services will promote financial inclusion and will undoubtedly help those on low incomes to manage their finances, plan for the future and guard against the financial insecurity that plagues our society at present. That is all very much to be applauded, but in its original form, the Bill intended that while other income replacement benefits were to be part of the scheme, carer&#146;s allowance was specifically to be excluded. The Treasury Minister in another place said at Second Reading:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="09031759000183"></a>&#147;We have thought carefully about making carer&#146;s allowance itself a qualifying benefit. However, although all recipients of carer&#146;s allowance will have low earnings, many may be in higher earning households; in fact, carer&#146;s allowance recipients are less likely to be in poverty than the average adult. Extending the scheme to all carers regardless of their level of savings or other financial circumstances would therefore mean that it was poorly targeted.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 13/1/09; col. 171.]</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_126"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09031759000173"></a>While that statement may be technically correct, it has none the less caused great concern as the figures from the Work and Pensions Committee later showed. It said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="09031759000184"></a>&#147;While the evidence suggests that Carer&#146;s Allowance makes a modest contribution to reducing poverty among carers, further exploration of this data is needed to examine how far the differences shown are related to uneven take-up of this benefit; ineligibility for CA when the cared for person is not a recipient of relevant benefits themselves; and issues relating to age&#148;.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09031759000092"></a>It is misleading to compare carer&#146;s allowance recipients with the general population. They should be compared with people who share other characteristics; for example, gender and age. They may be clustered just above the formal poverty line but they tend to have lower incomes than the general population. Many of them have retired early and have a small occupational pension which takes them just above the threshold for means-tested benefits, but they are by no means well off. Carer&#146;s allowance recipients are in the bottom two quintiles of income distribution compared to 37 per cent of all adults. This clearly shows that the Minister&#146;s claim that carers may be in high-earning households was not quite accurate.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09031759000093"></a>Carers also spend many years on a low income and claiming benefit. More than two-thirds of carer&#146;s allowance recipients claimed the benefit for more than two years and 40 per cent receive it for more than five years. This makes it extremely hard to accrue savings. We should remember that caring is a long-term business.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09031759000094"></a>Poverty statistics take into account only income, not household expenditure, and clearly carers have higher costs for things such as heating and transport. Like other families, carers are feeling the pinch in these difficult economic times but for them this is no change; they have always found that caring leads them to financial difficulties. They face higher costs associated with caring, such as heating, water and transport costs, and at the same time do not get much support from local authority services. Many families do not receive publicly funded care and are forced to arrange their own care, which can be expensive and of poor quality. That places a very heavy burden on their budgets.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09031759000095"></a>Research carried out by Carers UK&#151;I declare an interest as its vice-president&#151;published in December last year found that many carers are living in poverty. From a survey of 1,700 carers, 75 per cent reported that they struggled to pay essential bills; 52 per cent were cutting back on food; and 54 per cent were in debt, of whom nearly a third owed more than &#163;10,000 and were resorting to bank overdrafts and credit cards.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09031759000096"></a>So, for all these reasons, it was inconsistent to exclude carer&#146;s allowance but include other income replacement benefits. Carer&#146;s allowance should be treated the same as other benefits. In addition, excluding carer&#146;s allowance sent a negative message to carers, who saw themselves excluded from a government policy that was extending to other benefit recipients. At a time when the Government are making carers a high priority&#151;indeed, they have a very proud record as far as carers are concerned&#151;this was inconsistent. Following publication of the National Carers Strategy last June, the Government committed themselves to ensuring that by 2018 no carer should be forced into financial hardship by their caring role.</p>

I pay tribute to my honourable friend Steve Ladyman, the former carers Minister in another place, who has worked very hard to have carers included in the Bill. The Minister has now said that it is right that the Government should be open to listening to arguments and that when they find good and persuasive ones they should change their mind. I am glad that they have done so. I wish the Bill a speedy passage through your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

That low ratio may not matter very much when we have full employment, the opportunity for overtime and an approximate matching of income and expenditure, but increasingly, as the recession deepens and financial insecurity grows, people need rainy-day savings.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09031759000099"></a>We in this country have not done very well in allowing people to access their illiquid savings&#151;to get early access to the tax-free lump sum of their pension during their working life, for example, if they face repossession&#151;or to draw down capital from their home through safe equity-release schemes in retirement to cope with growing need, particularly the wish to stay at home rather than go into long-term care. We make it very difficult for people to borrow from themselves, to move between capital and income and to move, as the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, said, between pre-retirement and post-retirement assets. We have hung on to financial products that are increasingly not fit for purpose, designed for one gender and a different generation.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09031759000100"></a>The saving gateway is therefore to be welcomed, especially as it will include help for carers, which is excellent news, as my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley indicated. Since 1997 we have transformed income welfare; tax credits and pension credits, underpinned by the minimum wage and greatly improved state pensions, together have tackled poverty. But the disparities in wealth are still twice as great as those in income. Following in the footsteps of the child trust fund, we are increasingly engaged not only in income welfare but in asset welfare, and rightly so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09031759000101"></a>In the saving gateway, as my noble friend explained to us, the Government will be adding 50p to every &#163;1 saved over two years, to a maximum of &#163;25 a month or &#163;900 in total. The early gateway pilots, as he said, showed that people who had not hitherto saved did so, and that, even when the 50p-matching incentive stopped, they none the less continued to save. They regained control over their lives. They worried less when the washing machine broke down; they could plan a little more, weather stress a little better, spread their bumpy outgoings and avoid high-cost borrowing or getting into debt. As one participant said of the saving gateway:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09031759000185"></a>&#147;It made me feel more secure and I didn&#146;t feel so panicky. Before, I would panic if I thought something was going wrong&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09031759000102"></a>The scheme is limited to people of working age on low incomes, passported on to it by their benefit claims&#151;income support, JSA, tax credits and now the carer&#146;s allowance. Incidentally, they are passported, not means-tested, which is good to note. Why, as the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, said, is the scheme confined to people of working age? Why are pensioners denied access to it? My noble friend was typically generous in addressing that issue, and I am grateful&#151;at least, I think I am&#151;for his pre-emptive strike. Essentially, his case was that pensioners are thought to have less need and greater resources, and therefore they can cope. I challenge that. On any needs and resources analysis, I argue, pensioners have the greater claim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09031759000103"></a>My understanding is that pensioners were excluded because the Government followed the recommendations of the IPPR report by Sodha and Lister, researchers I expect to respect.

<ul><a name="09031759000194"></a>&#147;is sensible, as it makes most financial sense for pensioners to be consuming resources they have saved during their working lifetimes&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031759000174"></a>They add that only better-off pensioners would take it up, and that instead their pension credit should be increased. I do not know whether their remarks are underpinned by research about pensioners&#146; savings, expenditure, coping strategies, vulnerability, needs or indeed their likelihood to panic if the washing machine breaks down. There is certainly no evidence of any of that in their report, merely the statement offered that those of working age should acquire the savings habit while those of pension age should acquire the spending habit. I see why they might say that&#151;they do not want pensioners going without in order to leave something to their family&#151;but the notion that denying them the saving gateway would thereby encourage pensioners to change their behaviour and spend is, in my view, flawed and possibly pernicious.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09031759000104"></a>The IPPR believes that pensioners need income, hence the recommendation on pension credit rather than capital. It is wrong&#151;they need both. Of course the IPPR&#146;s proposal to increase pension credit is nice but, the &#163;1 billion or &#163;3 billion price tag aside, it rather misses the point. Pension credit supports income. The 70 year-old needs modest savings just as much as the 40 year-old. Pensioners on pension credit do not usually have&#151;in the words of the IPPR&#146;s report&#151;&#147;spare&#148; resources to consume, which is why they are eligible for pension credit in the first place. They are usually poorer, older women. They do not have occupational pensions, they certainly will be too old for the personal accounts that my noble friend cited, and they may well be pensioners for 25 years or more. In comparison, the typical lone parent on income support is on that benefit, on average, for less than three years.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09031759000105"></a>The notion that pensioners should consume, run down and run out of any tiny savings they may have, and expose themselves to the buffeting of every minor financial calamity over 25 years, seems to be the height of folly. We are asking pensioners to gamble on their own longevity. Will your washing machine die before you do? Will you be in residential care before you need to repair your roof? Their needs over time&#151;and the length of time is key&#151;will grow. Far from consuming, they, too, need to save if they do not have a cushion

As for their resources and their ability to meet those needs, half a million pensioners have no savings at all. One and a half million have less than &#163;3,000. How will they manage? They will not necessarily go into debt; instead they will go into denial&#151;of heating or of food. Many simply have no margin at all to deal with the unexpected.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09031759000106"></a>Pensioners at 70 need to smooth out bumpy expenditure just as they did when they were 40. They have the same need to feel in control of their finances, the same hunger for a bit of security, and the same neediness and vulnerability if that is denied. In other words, the 70 year-old, as much as the 40-year old, needs not only income, but capital as well.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09031759000107"></a>We do not require claimants of IS or JSA to have consumed all their savings before they can get benefit and be passported on to the saving gateway. Their first &#163;6,000 of capital is disregarded, and thereafter a notional tariff applies, just as in pension credit&#151;and rightly so. It is a false economy of the state to strip out, 1930s-style, any modest savings. Why then is it acceptable for someone on JSA to have &#163;6,000 of capital yet be eligible for the saving gateway, but for a pensioner with only &#163;600 of capital to be excluded? Just because the first person is 40 and the second person is 70 will not quite do, with an equality Bill coming our way.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09031759000108"></a>I beg my noble friend to bring forward an amendment to bring poorer pensioners&#151;those on pension credit&#151;into the saving gateway. We have tackled wonderfully well the issue of the poverty of pensioner income. We now need to think again about the poverty of pensioner savings. Then the saving gateway would really make a difference.</p>

<a name="09031759000109"></a><b><a name="90317-0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09031759000279"></a>Lord Newby:</b> My Lords, the aims of this Bill are undoubtedly admirable and we support them and it. The Minister explained that there are two principal aims. The first is to encourage those on the most modest incomes to save sums regularly, so that they develop the savings habit and in doing so have the funds to hand to deal with emergencies or to fund essential capital expenditure. The second is to promote financial inclusion and to bring people into contact with the financial institutions, often for the first time.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09031759000110"></a>So far, so good. However, I have several doubts about whether the Bill will achieve these aims, not least, as the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, almost put it, because of its mouse-like qualities. First, and uniquely among government savings initiatives, the Bill provides for only a limited period during which eligible people will be able to get government support for their savings. We believe that this is two years, although the Bill says nothing firm about a time limit. But a time limit there definitely is.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09031759000111"></a>This is unlike all the current principal savings incentives offered by the Government. For example, it is completely unlike the ISAs, where, in effect, there is an unlimited period in which to make savings. One can see by the amount of advertising done by the financial institutions towards the end of the financial year that they know that many people simply will not put aside cash or other forms of saving unless they are reminded of it and unless the tax incentives, year on year, are brought fully into view.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_130"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90317-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09031759000112"></a>Secondly, the tax benefits for making pensions provisions last for an individual&#146;s entire lifetime of making contributions, which can be up to four decades and beyond. Even under the child trust fund scheme, a second payment is made after seven years and parents can make top-up payments tax-free for the 18-year life of the fund. So why do the Government feel it necessary to subsidise tax incentives for those who are rather better off over the long term but to support the very poor for only two years?</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09031759000113"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Morgan, talked about the inherent class bias in the current savings regime. The Bill does not go as far as it might in redressing that bias, particularly now that carers are brought within its remit, which we welcome. As the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, said, many people are carers for significantly longer than two years and, in my view, they require a longer period during which to have an incentive to continue saving.</p>

<a name="90317-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09031759000114"></a>I mentioned that we assume that the period of the incentive will be two years. The Minister said so, but we would not know that from reading the Bill. On this and on every substantive issue, the Bill is completely silent. It has 32 clauses and 29 separate delegated powers. We protested about this when it was debated in the Commons and I am protesting about it again. It is a very inadequate way of dealing with legislation to have all the substance in secondary legislation, which, as we know, will be unamendable.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09031759000115"></a>The second reason why I am doubtful whether the Bill will achieve its aims is that I am concerned that not enough effort will be made or incentives given to encourage a high percentage of potential beneficiaries to set up a savings gateway account. The evidence from the pilots was indeed encouraging but, when this becomes a national programme, eligible individuals will, as I understand it, simply receive a notice of eligibility, of no value in itself, which they then have to take to a participating institution&#151;I will come to that in a minute&#151;to open an account. How many will actually do so? I suspect that it will be a significantly smaller proportion than took part in the pilot.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09031759000116"></a>My reason for thinking so is in no small measure underpinned by what happened with the child trust funds. All parents were sent, in effect, a cheque for several hundred pounds; all they had to do was deposit it with one of the many institutions that were offering child trust funds. But we know that in the poorer constituencies barely 50 per cent of parents took that bankable asset to the bank and opened an account. In the poorer sections of those communities, the percentage who did not was significantly higher, and the Government had to do it for them. My concern is that the same principle will apply in this case and that, for many people, simply getting a letter from HMRC&#151;unless it is couched in different language from most letters from HMRC, many may struggle to understand it&#151;is not in itself incentive enough for them to set up an account at a bank.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09031759000117"></a>That brings me to my third and arguably most significant concern. All this is predicated on there being banks and other institutions near at hand into which people can deposit their new-found savings. When evidence was taken in another place, the institutions  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_131"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>were extremely discouraging about the likelihood of their participating. The BBA has followed that up in a briefing that noble Lords will have received. It says that it is concerned about the complexity of the whole scheme and adds:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09031759000186"></a>&#147;Our second major concern has been the commercial viability for potential providers. Banks are likely to be interested in acting as providers only if the SG design is fundamentally simple, set-up costs were low and if therefore a business case could be made ... No bank has yet committed to acting as a provider&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031759000175"></a>We know that the banks undertook to introduce basic banking accounts only with great reluctance and one could argue that the costs of opening those accounts were less and the amount of money in them might well be greater. Can the Minister say anything about the likelihood, in his view, of any of the principal banks participating in this scheme? If they are not minded to do so at the moment, does he have any intention of asking the nationalised banks to join in?</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09031759000118"></a>The Government then said that the Post Office would offer these accounts. However, when Alan Cook, managing director of Post Office Ltd, was asked in another place what percentage of the market share he would need to make Post Office participation economically viable, he replied:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09031759000187"></a>&#147;That is a tricky question to answer, because it is not yet clear to me how it can be economically viable&#151;full stop&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031759000176"></a>Is it the Government&#146;s view that, if the Post Office cannot make this scheme economically viable&#151;and it cannot, as Alan Cook made clear&#151;it should, none the less, go ahead? Alan Cook also said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="09031759000188"></a>&#147;I would not ... want to trivialise the cost issue ... I would need to find a partner to provide the administrative capability and would pay that partner to do the work&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031759000177"></a>Can the Minister inform the House whether such a partner has been found, and on what basis that partner might do the work for the Post Office?</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09031759000119"></a>If there are problems with the banks and the Post Office, what about the building societies? When questioned in another place, Adrian Coles of the Building Societies Association said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="09031759000189"></a>&#147;I am certain that some societies are sympathetic ... and will want to offer it, but others, in the current environment of low profitability, low margins, difficulties in the mortgage market and very low interest rates, may decide to stay out of the market&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031759000178"></a>He is saying that, frankly, many building societies will not carry out the scheme. As we know, unless the Nationwide does it, there is no building society with a national branch network either. We are then left&#151;I do not say this pejoratively&#151;with the credit unions, which are the fourth group of institutions that might be expected to offer this service. When questioned in another place, Mark Lyonette said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="09031759000190"></a>&#147;Even we are looking, to some extent, for hidden subsidies, although not Government cash ... We may be looking for social landlords to do some of that collection business for us&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Saving Gateway Accounts Bill Committee, 27/1/09; cols. 26-28.]</p>

<p><a name="09031759000179"></a>It is absolutely clear that the credit unions are finding it difficult, even with their very low cost base, to commit themselves to the scheme at this stage. My principal concern&#151;I would welcome the Minister&#146;s view on this&#151;is that neither the banks, the Post Office, the building societies nor the credit unions are yet

Without a significant number of them offering the scheme, frankly, whatever else its virtues or demerits might be, the thing will not fly, as Alan Cook said.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09031759000120"></a>Will the Minister bring us up to date with the provision of financial advice to people on low incomes? It is all very well offering people this opportunity, but I suspect that one of the reasons why the pilots worked was that there was a bigger support system around people to encourage them to participate. I hope that the Minister will tell us where matters now stand with the Thoresen pilots and when he expects that a national scheme of financial advice will be available to those on low incomes as well as to everyone else.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09031759000121"></a>Even if we put all that to one side, we have to accept that the scheme has some rough edges. Some people will not qualify who should qualify; poor pensioners are clearly in that bracket. Others will qualify who would not naturally be among the first flush of people who wish to qualify. I already know several early-20-somethings&#151;unemployed graduates with very affluent parents&#151;on jobseeker&#146;s allowance who are totting up how much they might make out of participation in this scheme. I do not think that that is anything other than a second-order issue, but it demonstrates the complexities of achieving a watertight Bill. I hope that the Bill is a success but, for the reasons that I have given, I have real doubt whether it will meet the Government&#146;s ambitions for it.</p>

We shall raise some detailed issues during the Bill&#146;s passage and we shall seek to improve it, but we shall not oppose it.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09031759000123"></a>The most curious aspect of the Bill is why it has taken the Government nearly eight years, since the publication of their document <I>Savings and Assets for All</I><I>,</I> to reach this stage. The other scheme floated in that document was the child trust fund, which was legislated for in 2004 and which has been in operation for some time. The child trust fund concept was not piloted and I think the jury is still out on whether it is a success on the various criteria set for it. That is a debate for another day.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09031759000124"></a>The savings gateway concept has been piloted, not once but twice, and it is hard to argue with that as a process. However, the evaluation of the larger, second pilot scheme was not very encouraging. It did not give a massive amount of confidence that a savings gateway will result in an overall increase in savings. Indeed, the evaluation found that there was no evidence of an increase in net wealth as a result of the pilot and only limited evidence that other expenditure had been reduced to accommodate the saving that was made. That suggests that the saving was coming from other sources, possibly informal savings.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09031759000125"></a>Furthermore, among savers at the higher income end of those included in the pilot, there was statistically significant evidence of switching from other formal savings sources, rather than of additional saving. That  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_133"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is entirely rational behaviour as the top-up which the Government will pay is too good an offer to miss for those who qualify for the scheme. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, pointed out that people will seek to exploit that. The Government are quite good at that; it is exactly the same behaviour that occurred when the Government set up the stakeholder pension arrangements.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09031759000126"></a>The evaluation of the pilots produced evidence that there was an intention that the majority of savings accumulated under the scheme and the top-up would be wholly or partly retained as savings at the end of the scheme. The report came out in May 2007. I am not sure whether there is further evidence of what happened to the balances that were accumulated at that time but, if the Minister has any further evidence of what has happened since then, I am sure the House will be grateful for it. Did the intention of holding on to the savings turn into reality or were the savings withdrawn?</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09031759000127"></a>I ask these questions because the savings gateway scheme is a modest one. It is targeted at a narrow group and lasts for only two years. It is much less comprehensive than the lifetime saving account which my party has proposed in the past. As explained, it is intended to kick-start a saving habit rather than be a part of a long-term structure of support for savings. As with all such schemes, we need to be sure that the public expenditure involved, which is over &#163;100 million a year in the first three years falling to around &#163;60 million in steady state, genuinely leads to higher saving as opposed to short-term switching followed by withdrawal once the government bonus has been paid. As I have said, I do not think that the pilots have produced any evidence on that, thus far.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09031759000128"></a>I am sure that the Minister will not have definitive facts on all of these issues today, but I hope he will agree that a scheme such as the savings gateway has to be justified in the long term by hard evidence about the impact on savings behaviour. I put the Minister on notice that we shall want to explore that further in Committee.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09031759000129"></a>We will lend our support to the Bill, not because we have particular faith in the solution that it puts forward, but because as a matter of principle we support savings. My noble friend Lord Blackwell spoke eloquently on that. The same cannot be said of the Government if we judge them by facts, rather than their words, because the plain fact is that the savings ratio was 9.6 per cent in 1997 and at the last count was 1.8 per cent. It was actually negative earlier last year. This is yet further proof that the Government have turned the UK from a nation of savers into a nation of borrowers.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09031759000130"></a>One of the many urgent tasks facing the next Government is to reverse that trend and to help the citizens of our country again to embrace saving rather than debt. We have already set out our proposals to make savings income-exempt for basic-rate taxpayers, which should go some way towards helping those who have the virtue of saving but whose incomes have been hit by falling returns. I hope that the Government will follow our lead in next month&#146;s budget. My noble friend Lord Blackwell would go even further than I have suggested, but of course our nation&#146;s finances are perhaps not strong enough at this stage to go as far as my noble friend would suggest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09031759000131"></a>One of the things that we will want to look at in Committee is whether it is sufficient for this Bill to be targeted solely at the recipients of benefits. We understand that the passporting proposals are simple to operate, but I am not sure that they are necessarily simple to understand. Why should being poor but without benefits deprive people of access to the scheme? We know that many people resist the idea of applying for benefits and some groups, such as low-paid single people&#151;whether or not they have affluent parents&#151;have limited access to benefits. Surely, saving by these people is just as important as for those on benefits.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09031759000132"></a>We will be supporting the extension of the scheme to carers, as announced by the Minister. It did not surprise me that the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, turned out today to argue that case, which, in her usual way, she did so well. However, whether the extension to carers should be dependent on the receipt of a carer&#146;s allowance is another matter. Many carers do not claim the allowance or do not know that they are entitled to it. We are not convinced that linking savings policy to benefit entitlement is the correct approach and we shall want to look at that in Committee. In that light, it would be right to look again at pensioners, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, suggested; but I suggest to her that the receipt of pension credit should not be the important consideration because many pensioners do not wish to apply for it.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09031759000133"></a>As well as stimulating savings, the stated objective of the savings gateway proposals, as the Minister explained, includes the promotion of financial inclusion by encouraging people to engage with mainstream financial services. This is another bit of motherhood with which all parties can readily agree, but again the question will be whether the savings gateway in fact achieves its aim. The evaluation of the second pilot study indicated that, while many of the participants described themselves as non-savers, in fact almost all already had formal financial accounts and more than 40 per cent had financial assets of more than &#163;2,000. Few took up the offer of financial training, saying that they already knew enough about how to manage their finances.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09031759000134"></a>There is nothing in the Bill and little in the Government&#146;s proposals to date to deliver anything significant in the way of financial inclusion alongside the savings gateway. I echo the request of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, about the Thoresen proposals, because something is needed to support the savings gateway. I am sure that we will return to this issue in Committee.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09031759000135"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, set out some of the evidence that was given to the Public Bill Committee in another place by the British Bankers&#146; Association, the building societies and the Post Office&#151;I will not repeat the detail. It is very clear that there is no one group that is convinced that it is worth it to them to get involved in this scheme. The key issue is whether any of them can make it work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09031759000136"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, suggested that the Government might &#147;ask&#148; the nationalised banks to take this up&#151;I think that is the word he used&#151;but I hope the Government will not be twisting the arms of the nationalised banks to get involved in this scheme  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_135"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and in effect force them to cross-subsidise because the market would not get involved in this scheme. That would be a very unstable foundation on which to build new savings behaviour.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09031759000137"></a>The economics of the savings gateway proposal revolve around a number of issues which I am sure we will return to in Committee. They include the information required to be maintained and provided both to account holders and to HMRC. The ability to transfer accounts between providers, which we understand the Government favour, has a major impact on costs, according to the British Bankers&#146; Association, and is one of the key issues to make it unattractive to the banks. So too would the requirement to pay interest, although we note that the Government have decided not to mandate the payment of interest in their draft regulations, but of course in doing so they have diminished the attractiveness of the scheme, particularly in view of bodies such as the citizens advice bureaux. I think we will need to return to all these issues in Committee.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09031759000138"></a>The Bill will be a difficult one to scrutinise since it amounts to not much more than one long regulation-making power, as the noble Lord, Lord Newby, has pointed out. The Minister may rest assured that that will not deter us from the task of scrutiny at which your Lordships&#146; House excels.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09031759000139"></a>In sum, we have a number of concerns about whether this Bill will have the effect that the Government desire. At the macro level, it seems unlikely to make any significant contribution to restoring savings, but if it contributes to a habit of saving and financial security at the micro level, then it probably is worth a try.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09031759000141"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, commenced our debate with some valuable insights around the importance of promoting savings to developing a strong economy. I have known the noble Lord for many years&#151;we were colleagues at work together&#151;I have greatly respected his understanding of these issues and find myself broadly in support of his observations about the need to develop a stronger savings culture. We spoke a little about this last night in the debate following the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s Statement on the G20 meeting of Finance Ministers and central bank governors over the weekend. However, my noble friend Lady Hollis also reminded us of the need to be careful when making comparisons about savings ratios to take into account different preferences in terms of assets, and that a low reported savings ratio does need to take into consideration, in a proper evaluation, interest such as property ownership. Generally speaking, countries with higher savings ratios would tend to have higher use of rented accommodation. We have a very high owner occupation, by contrast, and we also have high pension savings. However, the central thrust of the noble Lord&#146;s point in that respect was well made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09031759000142"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, suggested that funds saved in a savings gateway account should be excluded from debtor claims where an individual has fallen into default. As we set out in the draft regulations, a savings gateway provider will not be able to set-off a debt on one account by taking money that a person has saved in the gateway account. The noble Lord suggested going further, protecting these funds from claims by third-party creditors where an individual is in default. The interests of creditors need to be balanced against savers&#146; interests. We should not rush into subserviating the interest of the saver over the interest of the creditor without thinking about it very carefully. However, I commit to the noble Lord to give this matter further consideration before Committee.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09031759000143"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, also raised a question about whether the savings gateway accounts should not have an impact on Social Fund entitlement: those who save should have preferential access to the Social Fund. In the last month of 2008 the Government published an informal consultation document on the Social Fund, and they published the responses to this consultation last month. In the light of the significant interest in this consultation, the Government are planning more detailed public debate reform of the Social Fund during 2009, providing further opportunities for interested parties to express their views. In taking this forward the Government will continue to consider the impact of the savings gateway on the Social Fund.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09031759000144"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, also suggested&#151;although he did not necessarily expect me to reply to it&#151;that people who have pensions cannot pass on those pensions but are obliged to annuitise them, and that that was invidious. I remind him that the purpose of pension savings is to provide an income in retirement. It is for this reason that tax relief worth an estimated &#163;19 billion net in 2007-08 was given. Allowing tax relief savings to be used for other purposes would not be a fair use of taxpayers&#146; money. For those who have different needs a number of alternative savings options are available, including ISAs.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09031759000145"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, asked a much broader question about why the Government need to tax savings at all, although the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, reminded us that the Opposition are currently minded to exempt&#151;at least, I believe, from basic income tax&#151;income from savings. Nearly everyone is entitled to a personal allowance which allows a certain amount of income to be earned tax free, although I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, was right to identify that this has an element of social-class or economic-category bias in the sense that we are offering further incentives, inducements and rewards to those who are already better off than many in the community by virtue of the fact that they are paying tax. Above the existing facility that is available to earn a part of one&#146;s savings income tax free, there are other products such as individual savings accounts, child trust funds, employee share schemes, SAYE and share incentive plans. Indeed, there is a multiplicity of plans and arrangements that encourage people to save.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09031759000146"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Morgan, shamed me with the proficiency with which he extolled the merits of the saving gateway. He did so with much more conviction  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_137"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>than I was able to do. I will pass on to the team who have worked on developing this Bill and carrying out the pilot schemes his congratulations on a first-class piece of work. It was also a delight to hear the contribution from my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley, who has a proud record of supporting carers. I am pleased that she took encouragement from my remarks about recipients of a carer&#146;s allowance being able to participate in the saving gateway.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09031759000147"></a>I failed miserably to pre-empt the contribution from my noble friend Lady Hollis of Heigham. We greatly value her informed and measured contribution to so many debates around issues relating to gender, savings and age; we take everything that she says very seriously. Her observation, based on one of those involved in the pilot, that the saving gateway account had given that person control over his or her life was a wonderful way of summarising one part of what we are trying to achieve. It aligns with the observation made by the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, about the importance of thrift.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09031759000148"></a>I repeat my remarks about the important benefits that are already available to pensioners through the tax system and other benefit arrangements. Pensioners are not necessarily excluded from the saving gateway and some may be eligible through tax credits. However, the saving gateway is targeted primarily at working-age people on lower incomes. As the noble Lord, Lord Newby, said, there are some rough edges. That is the price that one pays for producing a scheme that is simple and easy to administer. It is a matter of getting it very largely right, rather than completely right, in terms of participation.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09031759000149"></a>There are, as I said, significant supports to encourage people to save for their retirement. In particular, there are generous tax reliefs to incentivise pension savings, which were worth around &#163;30 billion in 2007-08. As I also said, we will introduce personal accounts, which are intended to provide a highly attractive, low-cost option to those in the private sector on low to moderate incomes who currently have no occupational pension arrangement. That will extend, from recollection, to 5 million or 6 million people.</p>

<a name="90317-0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09031759000150"></a>We will continue to support programmes for those in receipt of pensions and I will carefully consider the contribution from my noble friend, although I would not wish to raise her hopes. Her observation about the shortcomings of the IPPR report on pensioners was apposite. She drew my attention to the IPPR report a few days ago and I set aside quite a lot of time to read the relevant section, although I found that I needed very little time, because it was very short and somewhat inadequate. At the very least in Committee, we will ensure that we have a more complete debate on the issues that my noble friend raised.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90317-0005.htm"/>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09031759000151"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, raised a point that I had anticipated about the balance between the wording in the Bill and its dependence on secondary legislation; he asked whether the Bill was essentially a carrying document rather than a document of substance. Many of the important features of the saving gateway, including the list of qualifying benefits and credits and the method of calculating maturity payments, are set out in the Bill. However, many of the details of the scheme&#146;s  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_138"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>operations are relatively technical and are better suited to secondary legislation. It is also important that there is some flexibility for the scheme to be amended, developed and improved in the future in the light of experience to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives without the need for further primary legislation. We will of course look closely at the report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee on the Bill and will consider these issues again carefully ahead of the Committee stage.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09031759000152"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, raised questions about providers&#151;a point also covered by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. The noble Lord asked whether we were creating something that no one would be willing to offer in the commercial market. I have in front of me quotations from Mr Alan Cook of the Post Office which take me to a rather different conclusion. I think that banks, building societies and credit unions all now recognise the increased value of a loyal depositor base from retail deposits, rather than reliance on wholesale deposits. The opportunity is here for banks and building societies, including the Post Office and credit unions, to develop a new customer base, because we are seeking to promote a new savings habit among a group of people who either do not have a savings habit at the moment or&#151;this is very important&#151;have savings but not within the regulated formal banking system. Taking people into the regulated financial system will, in itself, be a huge benefit arising from this important legislation.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09031759000153"></a>I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, would expect me to point out that there are no nationalised banks. There are banks in which the Government have a large shareholding and there are banks in temporary public ownership, but there are no nationalised banks.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09031759000154"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, also raised questions about Thoresen and issues concerning advice. I will ensure that, when we come to this matter in Committee, I am informed and can advise the House or I will write to those who have participated in this debate, updating them on where the Thoresen projects are at the moment. I am afraid that this matter does not currently fall within my sphere of recollection but I will definitely ensure that we are well informed ahead of Committee.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09031759000155"></a>Finally, the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, welcomed the Bill with what, for her, was an unusual and distinct enthusiasm, which will warm the hearts of new Labour and the left. There is a belief that after many years we are finally beginning to get things right and this may well be the start of a trend. She asked why it has taken us so long to bring about the scheme. The answer is that we have been carrying out pilots. If we had not, we would probably be criticised for that as well. Pilots will produce hard evidence. The noble Baroness said that she wishes to see more detail of that hard evidence. When we next come to the Bill, we will make every effort to satisfy that requirement.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09031759000156"></a>Questions were asked about the use of savings balances, but I am not sure in my own mind that that is necessarily relevant to the legislation. The purpose is to establish a habit and a pattern of saving without being prescriptive on the use of that saving. It someone used the saving to finance a special need or to meet an emergency, that would seem to be entirely consistent  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_139"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 139</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with the expectations of those who advocate thrift. The important question is: having run down the balance through force of necessity, will people, when circumstances permit, re-engage with the financial institution with which they have established a relationship and a comfort level? Will walking into a bank or building society no longer be an inhibiting or intimidating experience but one with which they are comfortable?</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09031759000157"></a>The noble Baroness also asked whether the targeting was appropriate and, in particular, whether it should be defined in the way that the eligible community is. On that, the real value and virtue of this approach is its simplicity. We are creating a product that is simple, easy to administer and easy to understand, without the need for a means test or complicated form-filling. No doubt, as we go through the detail of the Bill in Committee, noble Lords will have an opportunity to test those attractions versus the counterarguments about the appropriateness of the defined target group, or the &#147;rough edges&#148; issue, as the noble Lord, Lord Newby, described it.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09031759000158"></a>I think that I have covered nearly all the points that were raised on Second Reading. If I failed to do so, I will of course write to any Member who raised a point that I overlooked. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

I again declare my interest as a councillor and a member of the executive in the London Borough of Sutton and&#151;perhaps because of that&#151;as a member of the Sutton Partnership Board, the local strategic partnership; the Safer Sutton Partnership Service, which is the local CDRP; and numerous other bodies that councillors inevitably find themselves on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09031759000160"></a>More pleasantly, I thank the Minister and her officials on behalf of my noble friends for the considerable lengths to which they have gone to help us to understand the purpose and intentions of some parts of the Bill; to persuade us of the virtues of other parts of the Bill; and generally to convince us not to be a nuisance at this stage. The Minister has been partially successful in that. We certainly have a better understanding. I am not certain that we have a greater liking for some parts  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_140"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the Bill and, inevitably, there are some parts on which we simply disagree. That disagreement will be resolved in the normal way in a democracy. We are grateful for the lengths to which the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Patel, have gone to work with us on this.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09031759000161"></a>Chapter 1 relates to the duty to promote democracy. First, for the avoidance of any misunderstanding, my noble friends and I have no disagreement whatever with the importance of promoting democracy. Indeed, most of us have spent most of our adult lives doing exactly that: trying to encourage an active and participatory democracy; helping people to understand the system&#151;for all its virtues and faults&#151;better; and to be able to work in that way. We have no problem whatever with that.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09031759000162"></a>Secondly, there were suggestions at an earlier stage that we did not recognise that there is a problem. Yes, there is a problem. We certainly recognise that. It is generally accepted that, for a range of reasons, local government has improved hugely in its efficiency and effectiveness in the last decade or so.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09031759000163"></a>Sadly, the public perception of local government has not improved at the same rate. There are reasons for that, which are rather deeper than a simple lack of understanding by the public. Of course it is good, right and proper that the public should understand how local democracy works in all its many aspects and that local authorities should do whatever they can and more to promote that, but there is a more fundamental problem than seems to be addressed in the Bill. It is very difficult to persuade people to be interested and to read something when they are simply not interested. You can explain&#151;most local authorities explain their processes and procedures&#151;but if the public are not interested or have a deeply cynical view because the local authority may be simply unable to do what they think it should do, no amount of well written literature or excellent websites will convince people to take an interest in that in which they are not interested.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09031759000164"></a>So we have some reservations, to put it no stronger than that, about making it a statutory duty for principal local authorities to promote democracy. We have no problem with their doing so, indeed, we would encourage them to do so, but making it a statutory duty seems to us to be missing the solution to what is a fundamental problem. Nevertheless, we accept that the Government want to make that a statutory duty and that in doing so, they are responding to many representations made to them, not least by the Councillors Commission, to which the Minister referred many times. We share the reservations of the Local Government Association, which, in accepting the need for a statutory duty, stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="09031759000192"></a>&#147;The LGA believes the Government could be much lighter in its approach by just setting out the ... duties and then leaving it to local authorities to decide what works best for their communities and residents&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031759000180"></a>That sums up our position very well. It is for local authorities to determine what is best to suit local circumstances, local culture and local conditions.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09031759000165"></a>The Minister has assured us throughout previous stages that the Government intend a light-touch approach; that they are trying very hard to curb the natural  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_141"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>instinct to be prescriptive. I entirely accept that. I am certain that that is the Minister's intention and strong wish, but it all depends on the guidance. As usual at this stage of a Bill, we have not seen the guidance. We do not know what is in it. Inevitably, as guidance is written, there is a need to explain a bit more what is meant, or even what is not meant. As that goes on, gradually it becomes more and more descriptive and prescriptive.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09031759000166"></a>Until we see the guidance, final reassurance is not there. Guidance is guidance by definition, but inevitably it becomes a standard by which any local authority is judged. If a local authority is judged to be in some way falling short of the standard in the guidance, which may be simply by perception because the local authority is unable or unwilling to do what petitioners want it to do, for instance, it is judged by that. What is, I am sure, a genuine desire to be light touch gets heavier as we go along. Those are our concerns and that is why we would much rather take the position of the Local Government Association of making it a statutory duty but leaving local authorities much freer to determine how they fulfil it.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09031759000167"></a>Amendments 1, 7, 14 and 16 add the words &#147;to use reasonable endeavours&#148; at appropriate places in the Bill. That is in part to try to provide some reassurance to local authorities against the dangers that I have just described and, secondly, because of the need to balance the duty with the cost. The Minister said in Committee that the Bill provides for the extra cost. With respect, a Bill or even an Act, does not in itself provide any extra money. It suggests what might be the total cost of its provision; it does not give local authorities any money. I oppose specific grants for specific tasks. However, it means that any additional resources are wrapped up in the general settlement and invisible&#151;indeed impossible&#151;to discern. In earlier days, as a leader of the council, I was constantly being told, when any new duty came in, that it was in the SSA. We do not have SSAs any more but the system is still there and any additional resources for extra duties are always said to be buried somewhere in the settlement and nobody can ever find them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09031759000168"></a>That might well be the case. Local authorities fortunate enough to receive any additional funding&#151;small as it would be&#151;would have it as part of their general grant settlement and would have to balance its use with all the other increasing demands placed on local authorities these days. Even those authorities fortunate enough not to be floor authorities, would not necessarily recognise any benefits simply by the enactment of this Bill. Many local authorities, particularly in London, are what is called floor authorities and will not get any additional resources anyway. Using &#147;reasonable endeavours&#148; is a qualification that would enable local authorities, I hope, to act in a proportionate way in meeting their statutory duty and not in a way that some of their residents might expect them to do, particularly if they are dissatisfied with the outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09031759000170"></a>In Committee, in support of the Bill, the Minister referred several times to the recommendations of the Councillors Commission. The clause recommends the commission&#146;s recommendations 1a and 1b&#151;they are encapsulated in the Bill&#151;but they are only some of its recommendations. Recommendation 1c said,</p>
<ul><a name="09031759000195"></a>&#147;raising interest in and providing information on how to stand as a councillor&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031759000181"></a>Recommendation 1d said,</p>
<ul><a name="09031759000196"></a>&#147;proactively promoting the role of councillor and the activities of elected members&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90317-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09031759000171"></a>Therefore, the total recommendation is not fully met in this clause. I imagine that the Minister will say that it is adequately covered by Clause 1(2). However, such was the importance given to it by the Councillors Commission that a passage in the report supporting their recommendation said,</p>
<ul><a name="09031759000197"></a>&#147;there exists a relative consensus that local authorities should play a greater and more proactive role in councillor recruitment, though it is clear that this should supplement rather than replace the role of political parties&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031759000182"></a>It went on to speak of the All-Party Parliamentary Local Government Group&#146;s report, which echoed that view, and concluded that councils should do more to encourage people locally to consider putting themselves forward for election. It argued that councils should have a formal duty to do so, recommending that there should be a new legal duty on councils, possibly on the returning officer, to provide information about the role of councillor in order to support recruitment.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09031759000172"></a>Those were actually the Councillors Commission&#146;s recommendations. Having them in Clause 1(2) in a rather general sense does not, in any way, give them sufficient regard. If the Minister is rightly going to cite what the Councillors Commission wants, and incorporate one part of its recommendations in the Bill, the other part is of at least equal importance and should also be recognised and included. That is the purpose of Amendment 2.</p>

The noble Lord is actively involved in and very knowledgeable about local government as it operates at this time. However, from my experience from long ago, my first question when I read,</p>

<p><a name="09031767000063"></a>in Amendment 1 was: why is it necessary to put those words into the clause? Is it because, if they were not in it, there would be the fear that unreasonable endeavours would be used?</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09031767000002"></a>I cannot imagine a council, council officers and those in the general milieu of the local government scene in any area not using reasonable endeavours. If the noble Lord, Lord Tope, is implying that no endeavours would be made at all without that phrase, I beg to differ. More than once in Committee and on Report, the spectre has been raised of too much prescription and too much law being laid down as to what one can and cannot do. The Minister is in the position of being damned if she does and damned if she does not.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09031767000003"></a>The clause and, indeed, the Bill make a reasonable endeavour to be clear. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, is saying, &#147;That is all very well as far as it goes, but I

Where do we stop? There is no doubt that, from his experience and mine, the day we finish with this Bill we will think of 100 ways in which it could have been improved but we did not do so. In other words, the second thought is always there. I simply ask whether this amendment seeks to do too much.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09031767000004"></a>Amendment 2 would insert the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09031767000081"></a>&#147;the duty of members of the authority as democratically elected representatives&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031767000064"></a>All the members of the authority are democratically elected, unless the noble Lord, Lord Tope, can tell me of circumstances in which a member of a local authority is not democratically elected. Again, I ask&#151;I do not want to make too much of this&#151;why the noble Lord and his colleagues think that these amendments are necessary. I think that they are superfluous and I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.</p>

<a name="09031767000005"></a><b><a name="90317-0005.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09031767000093"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Tope, for the gracious way in which he introduced this first debate on Report. We went over this Bill in great detail in Committee and I am very glad to share our understanding with him. Clearly we are all very much in favour of promoting democracy and we recognise that there is a problem in so far as we would like to see a livelier and more engaged local democracy in our communities. We have that common ground between us, so I will carry on trying to persuade him to support me on things with which he may, strangely, disagree.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09031767000006"></a>In this short debate, I will address the noble Lord&#146;s amendments and speak to my own and I will briefly recap what the duties to promote democracy set out to achieve. Clause 1 places a duty on all principal local authorities&#151;including county and district councils, unitary authorities and London boroughs&#151;to promote an understanding of their decision-making arrangements and those of various other public authorities that provide or influence the provision of services in their area and to promote existing opportunities to participate in those arrangements. Local authorities are expected to promote such understanding to people who live, work or study in the area. It is an ambitious intention, but, as it is set out here, it is relatively modest. I take my noble friend&#146;s point and should say that we have tried to balance it so that it is not overloaded by detail and certainly not overloaded by prescription.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09031767000007"></a>In essence, we want to encourage greater involvement in local democracy and we start from the premise that there is a lack of understanding. We aim to ensure that people know what services the council and other public bodies operating locally provide, what councillors do, how decisions about services are made and how people can participate in and influence them. People will then stand a better chance of getting involved in local politics, which, as I have said, means standing not just as a local councillor but also as a magistrate or school governor. The duty is intended to ensure that the relevant information is available to those who seek it and that it is promoted beyond people who would normally get involved to those who are less engaged and therefore underrepresented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09031767000008"></a>In Grand Committee, we spent some time discussing the evidence and I do not want to repeat what I said at that time. The Councillors Commission, having considered the evidence, thinks that this is a vital way forward in the effort to revitalise local democracy. Indeed, evidence continues to come forward. Recently, officials have been seeking to add a question to the citizenship survey about what people think of their councillors, but the proposal had to be dropped because in the trials that we carried out not enough people knew who their councillor was or what they did for the responses to be meaningful. That is a serious finding.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09031767000009"></a>Also in Grand Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Best&#151;he is not in his place&#151;speaking as the president of the LGA, said that the duty to promote democracy should be recognised as a core function of local authorities and that the association supported the duty on the basis that it was not overly prescriptive. As the noble Lord, Lord Tope, gracefully acknowledged, we are trying hard to achieve a light-touch approach. The duties are not prescriptive; they set out the scope of what we are asking local authorities to do, but we have not suggested how they should go about it. For all the reasons that we have given in debates in this House over many years, we do not lightly seek to put duties on local government.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09031767000010"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tope, pointed out the dichotomy between the measurable achievements of local government &#151;the real successes that we have seen in improving services as measured by the CPA over the past decade&#151;and the perception of the community that local government is somehow still not up to the mark or even failing. Local government has faced many challenges over the past years and it is frustrating for those working in the service to know that their achievements have not been accepted by the local community. We are trying to address issues of reputation and perception as well as seeking to engage more people through attracting them to serve in local government. We need to do this for all the reasons that we have discussed so that we can ensure that future councils are shaped by a more diverse range of people who reflect the views and experiences of the full community.</p>

<a name="90317-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09031767000011"></a>However, what is gratifying is how local government has already responded positively to the duty to involve, which comes into force in April. It marks the next step in making sure that people have the opportunity to become involved because they know how to do so. We heard examples of councils doing something along the lines of what we seek; indeed, many are doing it very well. However, it is not done well or at all in other places. Therefore, in the duty in Clause 1, we are trying to ensure that every person, no matter where they live, is able readily to access the information and knows how to seek it out. We want all local authorities to see promoting democracy as a positive and essential part of their core business. We recognise that it is a new responsibility, although it is bound to build on existing work. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, is right to say that we have addressed it in terms of a new burden and so have provided additional funding. I take his point that the funding is not ring-fenced, but it has been provided. By requiring local authorities to promote understanding of the council and the connected functions of other

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09031767000012"></a>I understand where the noble Lord is coming from in his Amendments 1, 7, 14 and 16. We debated the issue in Committee. The concept of &#147;reasonable endeavours&#148; is perfectly sensible but he will not be surprised when I say that it muddies what we see as a clear and unambiguous duty on local authorities, especially as authorities would be expected to do only what is reasonable to meet any duty, including this one, unless there was some absolute standard of compliance on the face of the legislation, which is certainly not the case here. The provisions are intended to set out the scope of the expectation but with no detail about how local authorities should discharge their duty; we trust in the ability, creativity and commitment of local authorities to develop the best approaches to putting that duty into action.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09031767000013"></a>Amendment 2 seeks to clarify the information about councillors that local authorities will be required to provide. I agree that this is an important part of what we are asking local authorities to do. We set out previously that we considered it essential that the role and the functions of councillors should be covered. The noble Lord has anticipated my reply, because in Clause 1(2)(b) there is a duty to promote understanding of,</p>
<ul><a name="09031767000082"></a>&#147;what members of the principal local authority do&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031767000065"></a>However, he was right to make the argument and to refer back to the Councillors Commission, because the statements in the subsections indicate a proactive commitment to promoting democracy. As my noble friend said, we do not want to overload the Bill with too much detail&#151;we are caught between a rock and a hard place however we do this&#151;but the spirit of the Councillors Commission lives on in that clause.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09031767000014"></a>Amendments 5 and 6 are brought forward by the Government in response to issues raised in Committee. This is an example of how much we value the experience on the other side of the Chamber; I certainly listened to the arguments. One of the most important debates that we had was around the need for the duty to promote democracy to capture partnership working. We are tabling these government amendments to seek to make explicit our intention that the duties to promote democracy include the work of local authorities and connected authorities which is reflected and developed in partnership with others. This may be the first time that we have captured that in legislation. It is important and I am grateful to noble Lords for promoting the debate. Whether this is through a formal partnership arrangement such as CDRPs and LSPs, or a loose partnership that is set up for a specific issue, we want to ensure that they both fall within the scope of the duties to promote democracy defined in Clauses 1 and 2. This is a significant development. We have seen a flourishing of these partnerships in scope and diversity, particularly local strategic partnerships, which play a key role in the democratic and decision-making arrangements in relation to the community strategy,   


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_146"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bringing together statutory bodies and the third sector, making vital decisions in support of the local area agreement process and so on.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09031767000015"></a>There is a general sense in many places that these bodies are not transparent enough and that the general public have little awareness of what they do and thus, inevitably, little chance to influence or take part in them. So, as part of our commitment to greater openness and influence, we want to ensure that that no longer remains the case. This duty as a whole is designed so that local authorities will promote understanding of the opportunities for people to participate in and influence the making of decisions, as well as of their connected authorities, for the reasons that I have explained. It was recognised in our debates in Committee that this can be achieved in partnerships. We agreed that this should be recognised explicitly under this duty, and amendments were laid in Committee both to the main duty under Clause 1, where noble Lords sought to include a requirement to promote understanding of the democratic and decision-making arrangements of partnerships, and to the list of connected authorities under Clause 2, to which noble Lords sought to add specific partnerships.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09031767000016"></a>I explained that the requirement to promote understanding of the local authorities and the connected authorities would be bound to include their involvement in partnership working, but I understood that what noble Lords really wanted to achieve was an explicit recognition of the important role that partnership working now plays in shaping services and the life of the community. We have therefore sought to find a way to amend the legislation that will achieve all our aims. It is not possible to name all relevant partnerships, or even specific partnerships. We have therefore expanded and clarified the definition of &#147;democratic arrangements&#148; so that it clearly includes work taken forward in partnership. The clause refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="09031767000083"></a>&#147;arrangements, in relation to any authority, for members of the public to participate in, or influence, the making of decisions&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09031767000066"></a>to which our amendment adds the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09031767000084"></a>&#147;by the authority (including the making of decisions by the authority in partnership or conjunction with any other person)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031767000067"></a>That means that, where councils have a duty to promote the understanding of democratic arrangements and of Clauses 1 and 2, they will be required to provide information about how partnerships are composed, what they do, how they work and how they make their decisions as part of a partnership. That would apply to Clause 1 in relation to decision-making by the council and to Clause 2 in relation to decision-making by the connected authorities. The amendment will ensure that councils have to explain about, for example, the LSP&#146;s role in the local area, how that relates to the work of the council and the connected authorities and how the public can participate in or influence their decision-making.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09031767000017"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree that this is a useful and positive amendment that improves the Bill, that it clarifies the intentions behind the duty and that, essentially, it will improve the awareness of local people and their influence on the decision-making process as a whole.</p>

She was right to refer to the quite considerable debate that we had at various points in Committee on the nature and role of partnerships. From my experience, if anything needs more explaining to and better understanding by the public, it is the partnerships that now exist, their ever increasing role and importance and the part that they play in the community. I am grateful to her for listening to the points that we made in Committee. We recognise the difficulties in meeting them in legislation and I thank her and her officials for their endeavours in trying to do so. I hesitate to say that this is an historic moment&#151;that is perhaps a little over the top&#151;but it is a significant step forward in legislation, and one that we welcome.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09031767000019"></a>I must be a little less warm in my welcome for her comments on the amendments that I was speaking to, although they did not come as any great surprise. We are, however, at one in our desire to promote the understanding of democracy and to promote an active and engaged role in our local communities. We will continue to have the concerns that I expressed, at least until we see the guidance. That, I am afraid, is inevitable, because the devil is in the detail and the detail will be in the guidance. If the guidance truly encapsulates the light touch that the Minister genuinely wishes, then well and good&#151;it will be helpful to local authorities. If it starts to go further than that, though, we will feel that our fears are justified. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I thank the Minister for her extensive meetings and correspondence as well as for what we on these Benches agree is a genuine desire to achieve agreement on the Bill. I also echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord Tope; clearly all of us in this House are supportive of promoting local democracy to give local communities real information and, with that, real powers to influence and make decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09031767000021"></a>With this amendment we return&#151;after a very long time, it seems&#151;to the question of what it is that local authorities must promote. Opposition Amendment 3 is simple: it would add to Clause 1 the duty for a principal local authority to promote the understanding of,</p>
<ul><a name="09031767000085"></a>&#147;the democratic arrangements of such connected authorities as the principal local authority considers appropriate&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90317-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09031767000022"></a>It was suggested in Grand Committee that the Opposition&#146;s approach to this duty was destructive. I do not feel that we need to rehearse all the same arguments as before, and I think our position is clear. Many parts of this Bill are unnecessary either because they increase the amount of box-ticking a local authority  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_148"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>must perform, or because the provisions will not amount to very much at all in practice. However, I accept that this is not a universally shared view, and I have come back with an amendment which I hope will be seen as constructive.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09031767000023"></a>It is not our view that local authorities should not promote understanding of the facilities and services available to local people. I believe that the more people are able to engage with their local communities and institutions, the bigger the benefits to those communities. I do not believe, however, that the needs of communities are best served by placing a highly detailed duty on local authorities, uniformly across the country and written in an Act of Parliament.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09031767000024"></a>Amendment 3, therefore, would allow local authorities to assess for themselves which bodies connected to them were suffering from a lack of understanding or public promotion. They could then take steps accordingly. No doubt, the Government will be issuing guidelines, so local authorities will not be flying blind on this. They will have an idea of what is expected of them, but our approach would allow them discretion on how to implement it.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09031767000025"></a>So, for example, in an area where the Magistrates&#146; Association was running a successful outreach programme, the relevant local authority would not need to waste time and money running a duplicate programme. Equally, if a local authority felt that local people were underinformed about, for example, an integrated transport authority&#151;a strong possibility&#151;then it could step forward into that breach.</p>

I never got around to declaring, as everybody else did in Committee, how many years I spent on a local authority, partly because I thought that some noble Lords would think that that was a disadvantage&#151;that because I had been there so long, I would be stuck in my ways, and not in line with this exciting modern thinking the Government are coming out with.

Although the Minister has not yet spoken to her amendments in this group, I will comment on them since they are identical to amendments I moved in Committee to include parish meetings and community meetings in Wales. Community meetings in Wales, of course, are exactly the same as parish meetings in England. I thank the Minister for tabling these amendments. The only difference is that she has got them in the right place&#151;I had them in the wrong place. These are minor but useful matters; when what we say in Committee is listened to and acted on by the Government, however minor the subject, it makes us feel that at least it is worth while turning up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09031767000032"></a>Amendment 10 would include regional development agencies in the list of connected authorities. There was quite a lot of discussion about this in Committee, so I shall not go through it all again, but regional development agencies are becoming increasingly important as funding agencies and with the new arrangements to set up leaders&#146; boards in places where they do not exist. To miss them out is simply to miss out an important part of the governance of the region, which has a considerable impact on local authorities. That is the purpose of Amendment 10.</p>

I am pleased to know that we share so many of the assumptions about the values of local authorities and democratic arrangements. What divides us is not principle but some aspects of process. I am very grateful for the way in which she debated the detail in Committee and made such a positive and important contribution. Where we differ is that the noble Baroness suggests a different way for local authorities to provide information to local people about the functions and democratic arrangements of public bodies that provide or shape public services in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09031767000034"></a>Amendment 3, in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, would simply replace Clause 2, which defines the duty of the connected authorities, with a general requirement on local authorities to promote understanding of the democratic arrangements of the connected authorities that the local authority considers appropriate. I fully understand the intention behind the amendment.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09031767000035"></a>Let me explain very briefly why Clause 2 is slightly repetitious given our earlier debates, and why we have sought to establish a list of connected authorities. It is simply because we want to be clear about the minimum extent and scope of the requirement. We want to be assured that everyone, no matter where they live, will  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_150"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be able to understand more than they do now about the public authorities in addition to the local council that affects their life. These public bodies impact directly on the key services&#151;safety, health, education, transport, waste and economic prosperity&#151;which, so far as the general public are concerned, work in mysterious ways. They are all services that people would like to know more about and, we argue, need to know more about. These services will all benefit from closer engagement with local people, as well as wider involvement and representation. They are on the list because they have asked to be on it&#151;they want that greater engagement. </p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09031767000036"></a>I wrote to noble Lords on 27 February to explain more fully the three criteria that we used in developing the list. First, the bodies included must have a strong presence in the local authority area; secondly, they must make decisions that are directly relevant to people in the local area, and therefore it is right that their governance arrangements are better known; and, thirdly, they must provide opportunities for the public to participate in or influence the making of decisions.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09031767000037"></a>We have taken a broad view of the opportunities to participate because we think that both participative and representative routes are important ways to influence services. My letter explained that those opportunities vary between the different bodies, depending on their function and structure. Each organisation has designed mechanisms that suit its particular area of operation, and we certainly do not intend to alter that. These opportunities include a wide spectrum of involvement such as: contributing views and influencing policy, for example by taking part in consultations or panels; directly electing representatives; making representations to councillors and other representatives; and standing as a councillor or taking on other civic roles such as that of a school governor.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09031767000038"></a>We want this duty to be appropriate and not overly burdensome. We do not want to impose on local authorities a long list of every public organisation that has an interest, however remote, in their area. It is always difficult to know where to draw the line, and some people may interpret the criteria slightly differently. However, as I say, we have aimed to reflect those bodies of interest to most local people. We believe that by so doing we can guarantee that the same opportunities exist for all communities. That is why I cannot accept the amendments to replace Clause 2, with its set of clear purposes and the lists of connected authorities, with the amendments which would leave it up to every local authority to choose how to proceed. That is not because we do not trust local authorities&#151;far from it; the raft of freedoms and flexibilities in recent years stand witness to that&#151;but because this is a new opportunity to open up parts of public life and policy which are so significant that they should be included in statute for all communities to take advantage of. There is consensus around this. The list has been drawn up in consultation with the LGA and the representatives of these bodies. They are content, indeed enthusiastic, to be included in the list.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09031767000039"></a>I repeat that there is nothing in the legislation to stop councils promoting understanding of any other organisation that has a particular relevance in the area. Each local authority will decide how best it can  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_151"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fulfil this duty so as to complement the public relations work that the organisations do themselves. We seek a simple, single port of call provided by local authorities on behalf of organisations so that information is presented in a strategic and accessible manner, and consistency in the amount and quality of information available on the different bodies. The aim is not to replace the efforts that connected authorities already make in promoting themselves but to supplement and support that. I know that the noble Baroness was anxious about that. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Tope, in the previous debate: the statutory guidance must be proportionate and not over-prescriptive. That is a very important point to put on the record. We will encourage councils to work jointly with the connected authorities to maximise the benefit of any existing campaigns to promote the organisations, avoid duplication of effort, and extend the reach of these campaigns more widely than the bodies could do alone.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09031767000040"></a>We appreciate the intention of Amendment 10, in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Tope, on regional development agencies, as they are, indeed, significant regional players. I reassure noble Lords on the critical point. If a local authority believes that the RDA structures and activities are relevant to its area, there is nothing at all to stop it promoting understanding about its work. However, RDAs are not active in every region and are certainly not active in the same way. They do not primarily engage directly with local people and therefore do not meet the relevant criteria. They do not meet the criteria for having a local presence and providing opportunities for people to influence and participate in shaping service decisions. However, given government Amendments 5 and 6, on partnership work, which we have just addressed, we would expect that partnership work with local authorities and RDAs would be covered already by the duty.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09031767000041"></a>There is also the issue, which noble Lords have not raised, of the Homes and Communities Agency. That is on the list, and it could be argued that they are similar bodies. I want to explain why the HCA is there. It is a nascent organisation. Given the range of powers of the HCA and people&#146;s interest in its activities, we have erred on the side of caution and responded to the HCA, which wanted to be on the list. As the HCA matures and its processes become established, we would look to review its inclusion on the list.</p>

<a name="90317-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09031767000042"></a>I have taken the advice of the chief executive of the HCA, Sir Bob Kerslake, who has said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="09031767000073"></a>&#147;The vision of HCA is focused around people and places. To create the places where people want to live, work, shop and entertain themselves, you need to engage and involve the local communities to help shape, deliver and sustain the place they carry out all this activity in. HCA will be working with our delivery partners, especially the local authorities, to ensure that there is the opportunity, not a one off opportunity either, for appropriate local involvement in defining and delivering the type of place they want&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031767000068"></a>I am happy to have that on the record.</p>

That means that principal authorities in two-tier areas in England and throughout Wales will be required to promote understanding of democratic arrangements at this tier of local government in their area. Where parishes exist in unitary areas in England, they will also count as connected authorities, and those councils will therefore be required to promote understanding of them to local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09031767000044"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, pointed out, in some areas the democratic arrangements at parish and community level are carried out through parish or community meetings rather than through parish or community councils. We understand that leaving parish and community meetings off the list of connected authorities might, therefore, have led to a gap as regards our intention to include the range of democratic arrangements at the parish and community level. This government amendment, helpfully prompted by the noble Lord, seeks to plug that gap. I am very pleased that he is pleased with that. I beg to move.</p>

Making this information available in Braille, audio or large print will not suddenly make blind and partially sighted people and those who are print-disabled in any other way more politically active, but unless democratic information is available in accessible formats, they cannot even get to first base and engage, even if they want to.

They are a genuine attempt to deal with a very difficult problem. I read very carefully what the Minister said in Committee. He said that the amendments were unnecessary because local authorities are already required by the Disability Discrimination Act to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people when providing services and delivering their functions. I am sorry to say that that provision does not appear to be working or, at least, to be working well enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09031767000049"></a>In recent research carried out by the Royal National Institute of Blind People, the organisation which I chair, a range of 22 local authorities around the UK were asked whether they could provide information, such as council tax bills, in accessible formats for blind and partially sighted people. Just 9 per cent&#151;two authorities out of 22&#151;had front-line staff who could answer the query. In most cases, the caller was directed to various departments to reach someone who knew the policy on accessible formats. More than a third said that they could not offer Braille or audio for people who could not read print. How are people to be expected to behave like responsible citizens in those circumstances?</p>

We have had useful discussions since Committee and I know that the Minister is on our side. I look forward to hearing how he thinks we can secure real change.

That was a long way back in the 1970s, and my friend had very poor sight; she taught me a lot about how partially sighted people cope with the written word, the typeface that is needed and the various equipment available to help people in that position. Indeed, she got herself elected to the local authority in Southampton where I was a member with her and she did a lot, not only to promote the local authority, but to encourage others, not just with sight disabilities but other disabilities, to become involved with the council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09031767000059"></a>However, the problem, as the noble Lord, Lord Low, pointed out in his contribution to the debate on the Disabled Persons (Independent Living) Bill in your Lordships&#146; House last Friday, is that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="09031767000078"></a>&#147;Making services and information accessible is a legal requirement under the DDA. Yet, the public sector still too often fails to meet these obligations&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/3/09; col. 1398.]</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09031767000060"></a>I have seen a snapshot survey published by the RNIB which suggests that very few councils are in a position to offer full services to those with disabilities. At Grand Committee, the Minister appeared to wash his hands of responsibility, by saying that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="09031767000079"></a>&#147;We have to trust local authorities and their track record&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/1/09; col. GC 91.]</p>

<p><a name="09031767000061"></a>In terms of the bigger picture of this Bill, that is quite some movement on the Government&#146;s position. On the one hand the Government have put together this enormously overdetailed Bill, setting out what local authorities must and must not do, while on the other hand they are saying, in effect, &#147;Once we have put this great burden on you, you must get on with it and it&#146;s none of our business any more&#148;.</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09031767000062"></a>The Government created the Disability Discrimination Act. What are they doing to make sure it is implemented? Would this not be a good time to concentrate on working out how to help local authorities implement existing duties, rather than creating a Bill full of new duties?</p>

<a name="09031781000001"></a><b><a name="90317-0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09031781000089"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> My Lords, before I address this group of amendments, I put on record the recognition for the amount of work that the noble Lord, Lord Low, and the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, have done over the years in support of fighting&#151;rightly&#151;for the rights of people with a range of disabilities. Just looking through their past record, I can see that it is a tribute to the work they have done that they have achieved so much.</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09031781000002"></a>Amendments 4, 8 and 26 deal with the issue of accessibility for people with disabilities to information disseminated under the duty to promote democracy. Amendments 4 and 8 seek to ensure that information disseminated to local people by councils in discharging their duty to promote democracy is available in formats accessible to disabled people. Amendment 26 adds an additional clause to the Bill, which would require local authorities to publish an annual report listing any information that they have disseminated under Clause 1 which they did not make available in formats accessible to people with disabilities.</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09031781000003"></a>I reassure noble Lords that making information accessible to traditionally underrepresented or hard-to-reach groups is a fundamental principle of the duty to promote democracy; I thank the noble Lord, Lord  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_156"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Low, for recognising and supporting that duty. We intend that this will be clearly set out in both statutory and best-practice guidance. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Low, and the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, aim to achieve a wider goal than that offered by these amendments, and would like to ensure that local authorities and other public service providers supply all information in a way that is accessible to people with disabilities. I greatly support the wider principle and the spirit behind the amendments. However, I do not believe these amendments, if accepted, would do much to further this aim as they are legally unnecessary. Let me explain. The Bill has been drafted in the light of other legislation. We will expect councils to promote democracy while also complying with other existing legislation. The Disability Discrimination Act requires councils to make reasonable adjustments so that disabled people can access information.</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09031781000004"></a>Additionally the current disability equality duty requires, among other things, public authorities to have due regard to the need to take steps to take account of people&#146;s disabilities and encourage them in public life when fulfilling their functions. Councils will be expected to operate under the planned equality duty which will replace the DDA and other equality duties. It will broaden and strengthen the current requirement on public authorities and will require public authorities to consider how they can meet different needs. The Office for Disability Issues is working closely with the Government Equalities Office to ensure that protection from disability discrimination is properly reflected in the new equality Bill.</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09031781000005"></a>In the light of this, it would not be legally or practically desirable to accept these amendments and build into this legislation a requirement that is in effect broadly covered by the Disability Discrimination Act, where it is reasonable for the authority to make such adjustments. In fact, it may undermine the general equalities duties, as well as other legislation that does not have specific disabilities access requirements built in, but which is fully intended to operate in the context of the general equalities duties on public authorities.</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09031781000006"></a>The equality Bill, which we hope will shortly be joining us in this legislative Session, will be accompanied by statutory codes of practice produced by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which is keen to stress that information should be accessible to all people. The Equality and Human Rights Commission will be taking forward work to publicise and champion the new duty, which of course will be very high on its as well as the Government&#146;s agenda.</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09031781000007"></a>Amendment 26 is particularly concerned with monitoring the accessibility for disabled people of information disseminated by local authorities when promoting democracy. This amendment will require local authorities to produce annual reports on the information which has been made public or available under Clause 1, but which was not made available in formats accessible to disabled people. I understand that the noble Lord sees this as a discipline on local authorities, but we feel that the effect would be to impose on local authorities an unnecessary bureaucratic process and therefore an additional burden without necessarily making more information available to people with disabilities in accessible formats.</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09031781000008"></a>I know that monitoring is of particular interest to the noble Lord, Lord Low, and I would like to outline the various monitoring efforts that the Government are already making in regard to this issue and, I hope, address some of the issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi. For example, as part of the comprehensive assessment, the inspectorates of local services will look at how well local priorities express community needs and aspirations. The inspectorate has made clear in its framework document for comprehensive area assessment that understanding the needs and aspirations of communities should always include those whose circumstances make them vulnerable and those who are hardest to reach or hear. Inspectorates have also indicated that they may need to better understand the extent to which local partners are sensitive to the particular communication or other needs of minority or marginalised groups.</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09031781000009"></a>There is also recourse, through judicial review instigated by an individual or the Equality and Human Rights Commission, against those public authorities that failed to give regard to the disability equality duty. Similarly, if a listed public authority fails to publish a disability equality scheme, or comply with another requirement of specific public sector duties, the commission could issue a compliance notice against them and subsequently enforcement actions would follow were those specific duties not complied with.</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09031781000010"></a>As I have said, I of course support the spirit of these amendments. As the noble Lord has shown, in terms of the research that he has commissioned, we have clearly seen that some public authorities are still struggling to meet their responsibilities under this existing legislation. However, I believe that the situation is improving in some areas. Recent reports suggest that the disability equality duty is being used to make improvements for disabled people, and stakeholder groups with which the Office for Disability Issues works closely suggest that the duty has been used in a positive way to make changes. In fact, research published in December examining the experience of public authorities in implementing the disability equality duty, found that greater priority was being given to disability equality issues within public sector bodies, and there were examples of mainstreaming disability equality and policy-making. However, clearly there are still challenges to achieve our commitment of equality for people with disabilities by 2025, which is why the Office for Disability Issues will be following up with a toolkit called <I>P</I><I>roducing </I><I>Better Information for D</I><I>isabled </I><I>P</I><I>eople</I><I>,</I> which will be published in April and specifically aimed at local authorities.</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09031781000011"></a>Although I am unable to accept the noble Lord&#146;s amendments, there are a number of additional actions that I will commit to take forward, which may help to support the principles behind the amendments and will give an extra push to efforts already being made in this area, I hope. First, I intend to write to Trevor Phillips in his capacity as chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, passing on the concerns outlined by noble Lords in relation to accessibility, and asking the commission in its monitoring role to look at ways in which local authorities&#146; provision of  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_158"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>information to people with disabilities can be monitored more closely and in a way that achieves tangible change.</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09031781000012"></a>Secondly, we will clearly set out reminders about the requirements on local authorities under equality legislation in both the statutory and best-practice guidance accompanying the duty. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Low, for generously accepting my offer made in Committee for him to be involved in the drafting of the guidance. We will of course be involving the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the Office for Disability Issues and the Government Equalities Office in producing the guidance, as we are keen that it covers these points clearly and strongly.</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09031781000013"></a>Thirdly, I will discuss with colleagues in government the importance of the issues raised by these amendments to see whether there are other avenues available to us in forwarding this agenda. I will write to my right honourable friend Harriet Harman, in her capacity as Minister for Women and Equality, informing her of these debates and asking for her views on the topics raised.</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09031781000014"></a>Finally, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Low, and the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, for tabling the amendments a second time, and allowing us the opportunity to further raise the profile of these important issues. I hope that I have gone some way to reassure them by my reply and that they understand why I must resist the amendments. There is little advantage in merely having provisions in this Bill that are so similar to what is already required under the Disability Discrimination Act, which requires authorities to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people. Instead, we should promote the issues raised by these amendments and ensure that all is done to improve in real terms the way the public authorities discharge their current and future duties. With this, I hope that the noble Lord will agree to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I am very grateful to all noble Lords who spoke in support of the amendment and to the Minister for his extremely comprehensive reply. His response is very helpful and shows that he certainly supports the principle of the amendments if not the actual amendments themselves.</p>

<a name="90317-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09031781000016"></a>The Minister is right to suggest that the ultimate goal is for blind and partially sighted people and others who have difficulty reading print to have the same access to information as everyone else. He is also right to say that there is the option for judicial review, though we had obviously hoped to find a more constructive approach than suing people. So I am grateful that he has made a number of concrete suggestions for tackling the problem across government. I hope that the Equality and Human Rights Commission will pick up his request and run with it and I look forward to working with him and his officials on the guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09031781000017"></a>For the rest, I will read the Minister's remarks in detail tomorrow and follow up appropriately. I understand the point and would not wish to undermine other

However, I am sure that he realises that we will return to the wider issue in the context of the equality Bill when it comes to this House in due course.

<p><a name="09031781000075"></a>I do not particularly want to debate the word &#147;significant&#148; today. I believe that that can be left to the common sense of the principal local authority concerned.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90317-0008.htm"/>


<a name="90317-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09031781000020"></a>There are many cases where the catchment area for most of the school&#146;s pupils does not coincide with the area of a local authority. People might travel long distances to schools in some areas in London but in most places this problem, in relation to this part of the Bill, is a matter of a school which is on one side of a boundary. Located near a boundary and clearly on one side of that boundary, it is in one local authority area but will be attended by lots of students from the other local authority. I explained this in some detail in Committee when I gave two examples from just outside the city of Bradford&#151;a part of the world which I think the noble Lord, Lord Patel, knows fairly well, as do I. One school serves people in the Oakenshaw area and the other people in the villages around Keighley, with one school in Kirklees and the other in north Yorkshire. Significant numbers of pupils attend those schools. It is ridiculous that someone turning up at the city hall in Bradford or looking on the website in search of how to become a governor at one of the schools should be told that, as the school is not in Bradford, they do not include that information. Surely the question ought to be whether the information that is available to people is useful in answering the questions they are likely to ask and the inquires they are likely to make, not whether the school is on one side of the border or the other and therefore ruled out bureaucratically because it is on the wrong side. If a lot of parents and children live in Bradford and go to school just outside Bradford, or any other situation throughout the country, then surely they ought to be helped by this information.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09031781000021"></a>The same applies particularly to primary care trusts and hospital trusts and boards. In many parts of the country there are traditional arrangements where people in one part of a district or county go to a hospital in another district or county and they are in different primary care trust areas. If they are in the same area and county, I suppose that the county might provide that information anyway. The example I gave concerns people in the eastern parts of Pendle, particularly the parts which before 1974 were in the West Riding of Yorkshire, who traditionally go to Airedale Hospital, which the Minister revealed he also had close contacts with and knowledge of. In that situation, most people in Barnoldswick and Earby go to Airedale. So if they go to their local Pendle council shop in Barnoldswick to get this information, they will be told, &#147;No, we cannot provide this information. It is not available here. You&#146;ll have to go and ask someone in Bradford or Keighley&#148;. That is nonsense. It is not a sensible way to do it.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09031781000022"></a>I cannot understand why the Government are resisting these amendments. They are common sense and easy to operate. They rely on local knowledge about what is sensible and what is not sensible. They really ought to go in. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09031781000024"></a>As the noble Lord will remember, in Grand Committee I mentioned living in Loughton, which makes me an Essex man. I was very pleased to introduce to the proceedings a piece of my knowledge&#151;that Epping Forest College, in Debden, is the recipient of a considerable sum which has lately been spent on it to vastly improve its facilities. It intrigues and delights me every time I travel from Loughton and into Debden to see the stream of youngsters coming to the college. They come from the Debden Central Line station, a 10 to 15-minute walk, and they are always impeccably dressed and well behaved. I would imagine that they appreciate the education they are receiving in that facility.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09031781000025"></a>I raise that point because I am trying to understand the significance of the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on this issue. I imagine that he knows where he is coming from; he wants people who are interested in the democracy of the institution, whether it is this place or any other that he mentioned from his wide knowledge, and have the ability to participate in it.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09031781000026"></a>I am intrigued to know about a place such as the Epping Forest College in Debden. When I said that the majority of its pupils must come from somewhere else, the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, told me, sotto voce, that 70 or 80 per cent of its pupils do not live in the area. As Debden, which is on the Central Line, is just into Essex, the students come from further afield, so a dozen London boroughs must provide students and take advantage of the facility. I do not have a clue about the financial arrangements and so on, but if we are all in favour of young people taking advantage of the quality of the courses at that college, and if they are convenient, we say good luck to them. We, the politicians, have sort out the nitty gritty of that process.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09031781000027"></a>I can understand, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has told me, that it is a frustration when one believes that one is entitled to participate in the democracy of an institution to find that, although it is local, it is not within a local catchment area. So I would be grateful to the Minister, when she replies as effectively as she always does, if she could explain the significance of this in a place like the Epping Forest College, where 80 per cent of pupils do not live in the catchment area. The 20 per cent do have rights, but the rights for the other 80 per cent are so scattered that they are very difficult to marshal. I rest my case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09031781000029"></a>Amendments 9 and 9A seek to extend the scope of the duty on local authorities beyond their geographical boundaries. They seek to provide local people with information about the democratic arrangements of  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_162"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>hospitals, clinics and schools that are not based in their area but that a significant number of local people attend or use. They seek to do this by amending the descriptions of maintained schools, Clause 2(2)(d), and NHS and foundation trusts, Clause 2(2)(f), within the list of connected authorities, to add those that are attended by a significant number of students or patients living in the area, even where this service is not in the home authority.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09031781000030"></a>While I appreciate the intentions of noble Lords here, and as we discussed in great detail in Committee, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, pointed out, we do not believe that these amendments are necessary. Nor do we believe that these are reasonable or practical requirements to place on local authorities. These duties will require all principal local authorities to promote understanding of the democratic arrangements of the local authority and connected authorities, among other things, to people who live, work or study in their area. Let us remind ourselves that this duty is about promoting understanding of the democratic arrangements for public bodies set up either to be influenced by citizens, directly or indirectly, or run by lay citizen representatives. It is not designed to cover all conceivable information about public services in general.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09031781000031"></a>Inevitably there is a fine balance in addressing the needs of the community and minimising the burden on local authorities. In doing so, we are also very mindful not to increase duplication of information where this is not necessary. We ask all local authorities to promote democratic understanding in their areas, and we do not only mean providing information by newsletters, leaflets and on websites, although this is important.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09031781000032"></a>It would be the responsibility of the local authority in which the hospital or school is based to promote understanding of its democratic processes to all of its local people. This is additional to the information that these services provide directly to their students, patients and other users. This amendment would lead to unnecessary duplication that would affect the local authorities which are under the duty, the local people who are the target of the duty, and the connected authorities mentioned here: schools, NHS trusts and foundation trusts. I will explain further.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09031781000033"></a>First, there would be a duplication of effort between councils in gathering this information, as they would each be collecting information on bodies in both their own and their neighbouring areas. As such, there would be a significant overlap in the scope of the duty on local authorities.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09031781000034"></a>Secondly, a larger volume of information would be aimed at individuals: they would receive information about services both in the local authority in which they live and about facilities in neighbouring areas. Local people could be bombarded with information about all the NHS trusts in all the local authorities surrounding their home area. From the citizens&#146; perspective, many of these facilities will not be relevant to them and this could lead to the information being confusing and unclear. This would also, of course, add to the burden on local authorities.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09031781000035"></a>Lastly, the amendments would lead to duplications in requests for information, as these bodies would receive requests not only from the local authorities in  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_163"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which they live, but from several local authorities whose residents use those facilities. Surely it is more efficient to divide the burden of collecting and disseminating information on these bodies between the different local authorities, in the way the Bill suggests, rather than require them to overlap, as the noble Lord&#146;s amendments suggest. The statutory guidance would suggest methods of disseminating this information, once the effort of gathering and collating it had been done, that could maximise the number of people who would benefit from it, such as by providing links to websites, placing leaflets in strategic locations, and using posters in the area. In this way, councils can ensure that those who see the information are those for whom it is relevant and important.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09031781000036"></a>As noble Lords know, it is usual that requirements on local authorities relate to their geographical area. This provides a clear limit to expectations, and fits with the funding regime. There is nothing to stop local authorities working together if it is more practical to do so. But that is a decision for the local authorities involved. As noble Lords know, we are providing new money to cover this new duty, but this is based on working with local people, according to our definition and within the local authority boundary.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09031781000037"></a>We are also concerned about using a phrase such as &#147;significant number&#148;, and although the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has said that some common sense would have to be applied, this would not provide sufficient clarity as to when a local authority must provide information, and when not. &#147;What constitutes a significant number?&#148; would be the question that would be continually asked. There is nothing to stop a local authority providing this additional information if it chooses to do so. We just do not believe it is right to require it.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09031781000038"></a>I hope I have reassured the noble Lord that the best way to achieve what we both want to see happen, which is that information reaches those people who have a genuine connection with and are affected by these services, is to focus on targeting information by suggesting intelligent methods to do this in guidance, rather than creating overlaps by broadening the scope of the information that councils must gather. In this way, the information is sure to reach the right people, and councils&#146; burdens are minimised.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09031781000039"></a>We expect local authorities to take a sensible approach; to consider how to imaginatively promote democratic understanding, as we have set out in these duties, in a way that is relevant to their local communities. We will work with the LGA to ensure that we cover these points in guidance. I remind noble Lords that the aim of the duty to promote understanding of connected authorities, which will be made clear in the guidance, is to give local people an overall picture of local democracy in their area. We emphasise that it is open to local authorities to promote connected authorities that are not on the list, where they are relevant to local people. As such, we consider both amendments to be unnecessary, and I ask the noble Lord to withdraw.</p>

With great respect to the Minister, he did not answer the local questions I asked him and about which I thought he would have local knowledge.  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_164"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Why will parents of children in Oakenshaw not receive from their own council in Bradford information about their local school, and about how to become governors of the school that their children attend, and that almost all children in Oakenshaw attend? That is the basic question. When the Minister suggests that what is required is an efficient system, who is the efficiency on behalf of? Is it the internal efficiency of the organisation of the local authority, or is it the efficiency of the system that provides the information required by people in Oakenshaw or wherever it happens to be? With great respect to Ministers generally, it seems to me that there are times when they should read the briefings they are given, apply some common sense to them and say, &#147;No, this is wrong&#148;. The answer that the Minister has just read out is ridiculous. I am sorry to say that but I believe that it is.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09031781000041"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Graham, mentioned London. I accept that London is a different case but one or two of the other big conurbations may also be different cases, particularly Greater Manchester. The place that everyone thinks of as Manchester is divided into different councils, in the same way that London is, although it has nothing like as many as London. However, everyone thinks of Trafford, Salford and Manchester as just Manchester, unless they happen to live there and know differently. Therefore, I agree that there are problems.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09031781000042"></a>Perhaps I may go through one or two things that the Minister said. He said that our proposal is not necessarily reasonable or practical. I am not in favour of doing anything that is not necessarily reasonable or practical. He also said that not &#147;all conceivable information&#148; can be given. I am not suggesting that it should be all conceivable information; I am suggesting that the information given should be the sensible information that most people who live in a particular place require. He said that we do not want duplication where it is not necessary. I agree entirely with the Minister. However, the whole purpose of the amendments is to assert that in some cases it will be necessary to make councils do what the Government want them to do under Chapter 1 of the Bill&#151;that is, to provide sensible information. He suggested that councils should have to promote the information to all their own local people. However, boundaries do not respect things such as a council&#146;s &#147;own local people&#148;; they cross community boundaries and the catchment areas of hospitals and schools. It does not seem right to promote the information to your own local people but not to other people who use your facilities.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09031781000043"></a>The Minister said that the information should relate to a geographical area. I agree. Later in the Bill, when we talk about the results of the sub-national review and multi-area agreements and even economic prosperity boards, the Government will tell us that what matters is not the precise boundaries of a particular local authority but the economic geography of the area&#151;that is what people keep calling it&#151;the area which is economically and geographically sensible because it is a unit. It may be the city region or in other areas it may be something different. The Government would no doubt argue that Workington, Whitehaven and perhaps Barrow in West Cumbria are part and parcel of the same economic geographical area, and I would  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_165"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 165</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>agree. They use one argument there, yet here they say that geographical areas have to be the boundaries of local authorities. However, in many areas those boundaries are quite arbitrary: some are historically arbitrary and some are arbitrary in modern terms, but they are arbitrary.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09031781000044"></a>Finally, the Minister used the words &#147;genuine connection&#148;. There is nothing more genuine in terms of a connection than the hospital that you always go to, whether for an appointment or when the ambulance turns up. When the ambulance men ask, &#147;Where do you want to go?&#148;, you reply, &#147;That hospital&#148;, because that is where everyone in the area goes. There is nothing more genuine than the school that all the children in a village or suburb attend. With regard to the concept of connected authorities in the Bill, I can only refer to the authority of which I am a member. When Airedale General Hospital wanted to put in a bid to become a foundation trust&#151;I do not know how far that bid has got or how far it is going&#151;it came to Pendle council over the border in Lancashire and said, &#147;We recognise that traditionally a third of the people in Pendle come to us rather than go to Burnley. We recognise that the East Lancashire Primary Care Trust has had a contract with Airedale for many years in order to pay for these patients. We would like Pendle to have representation on the primary care trust board&#148;. There cannot be anything more &#147;connected&#148; than that in the Government&#146;s concept of the word. There will be direct connectivity with representation from one authority over the border in a hospital in a different authority.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09031781000045"></a>The Government say that they cannot accept most of the amendments that we put forward. They say that they understand them and, although they may not agree, they recognise that there is a sensible case to be made. However, in this case, I think that the Government are being resistant and obdurate, and I do not understand why. To me, it is common sense that this option should be written into the Bill. As I said, I am extremely tempted to test the opinion of the House. However, I shall not do so because this Bill has a lot of track to go down yet. It has to go to the House of Commons, and the Government have a lot of time to continue to think about this matter and to put something sensible into the Bill. I hope that they will do that as the Bill progresses through its further stages in this House and the House of Commons. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We return to an issue that was subject to some considerable debate in Committee. Amendment 15 proposes to leave out Clause 3 relating to monitoring boards, courts boards and youth offending teams, and Amendment 17 would leave out Clause 4 relating to lay justices. The other amendments are consequential on those two principal amendments.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09031781000047"></a>This will probably be one of those areas where we simply disagree with the Government but perhaps I may start with where we do agree. We certainly agree that a better understanding among local people&#151;indeed, the public in general&#151;of the functions of all those bodies is desirable. It is certainly desirable that people understand better how they can become involved in, or even in some cases become a member of, those bodies. All that is desirable. We recognise that the membership of the magistracy, in particular, needs to be very much more diverse than is currently the case. Therefore, all that is common ground between us. We certainly recognise that any assistance that local authorities can give in bringing about that greater understanding and involvement&#151;enabling people to understand what is involved if, for example, they seek to become a magistrate&#151;will be beneficial. All that is desirable and no one would think otherwise.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09031781000048"></a>However, there is a huge difference between local authorities assisting voluntarily with the various bodies in bringing that about and the Government placing a statutory duty on them to do so. That is simply a step too far. For instance, it is not, and should not be, the statutory responsibility of a local authority to encourage people to know more about becoming, and then to become, magistrates, desirable though that may be. It is good if a local council, in discussion with its local magistrates or, indeed, with the Magistrates&#146; Association wishes voluntarily to put something on its website or to make available leaflets that explain those roles. That is desirable. I hesitate to say it, but this could even be suggested in the guidance. However, to make it a statutory duty of the local authority is a step too far. Making it a statutory duty is also inconsistent with what the Minister has assured us throughout is intended to be a light-touch approach. The roles of a local authority and the local magistrates are not close enough, in this sense, to be consistent with a light touch.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09031781000049"></a>When we discussed Clause 4 in Committee, several concerns were raised. I wondered, without making too much of an issue, whether there was a potential difficulty between the relationship of a local authority, in its use of a magistrates&#146; court, and this duty. That could happen, although I do not want to exaggerate. The noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, several times asked what a local authority would do better than those bodies  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_167"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that are doing it now. She never really received an answer. It is those bodies&#146; job and responsibility, which most of them are carrying out, to better inform the public and seek a wider and more diverse membership. How will a local authority with a statutory duty to do that do it better than it is being done now?</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09031781000050"></a>The Minister&#146;s only reply was that this will be in the wider context of civic engagement and that is desirable. Somebody looking at a council website, wondering what is involved in becoming a councillor, will not suddenly say that they would much rather be on a prison monitoring board than become a councillor. It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be involved with an independent monitoring board for a prison or a visiting committee, or who wants to become a magistrate, will look at the local authority website in the first instance. They are more likely to look at the appropriate website for that authority. It is just inappropriate and wrong to make it a statutory duty.</p>

<a name="90317-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09031781000051"></a>I am sorry to see that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, is not in his place. In Committee, he expressed qualified support for my view. He said that if we are talking, as we are, about lay justices, why is there no similar duty for tribunals? I am not for one moment arguing that there should be. Indeed, for the same reasons, there should not be, but it seems to be an inconsistency and the Minister agreed that she would think about that inconsistency. I would like to believe that her thoughts have led her to believe that having the statutory duty for lay justices is inappropriate and that we are not now, as a result, going to add tribunals to the list. That is a point for consideration. Clauses 3 and 4 are simply wrong. It is wrong to place a statutory duty on local authorities in this respect and it is inconsistent with the proclaimed light touch. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09031781000053"></a>If the Government had had the sense to accept Amendment 3, they might have got quite a bit of what they wanted but still kept some of the duties that they required. I am afraid that now we really must support Amendments 15 and 17 because, without going back to the debate that we had in Committee, we believe that the amount of detail and regulation that the Government plan to put behind these duties is&#151;based on my long experience in local government&#151;frankly absurd. I hope that the Government can think again on this. We all want to promote local government, but the regulation is so detailed that I request that the Government think again. That is all that I have to say; we have said it many times before. I ask the noble Baroness to persuade her colleagues to think again on this.</p>

Then he backed off from the notion that we should make sure that this happens by including a duty that is consistent with the rest of the Bill. I will try again to explain why it is so important that these functions are also captured by the duty.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09031781000055"></a>I will state briefly what the clauses do and why. We had a long but&#151;largely due to me&#151;rather confused debate on this in Committee. I will make sure that this is now on the record. Very briefly, the information to be provided, which is captured in Clause 3, will include information about how the bodies function; what they do; how a person can be a member of, or take part in, these bodies; and what is involved in doing so. The duty does not require councils to explain the decision-making arrangements of the bodies.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09031781000056"></a>The difference between these bodies and those listed in Clause 2 is that the bodies listed in Clause 2 have broad responsibilities and offer a wider range of formal and informal opportunities for ordinary members or sections of the public to be involved in their decision-making. The bodies listed in Clause 3 are different. Their functions relate to the administration of justice services, so it is not appropriate or necessary for their decision-making arrangements, other than their civic functions, to be included. In carrying out their functions, they simply seek to recruit ordinary citizens to serve on them and to fill the important lay judicial and inspectoral roles from the local community. These roles include monitoring the day-to-day life in local prisons or removal centres, ensuring that proper standards of care and decency are maintained as part of an independent monitoring board or making recommendations to improve the administrative services provided by the court as part of the court board.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09031781000057"></a>These are important functions within the community. There has long been concern that the pool of people who take part is not broad or diverse enough. There is a genuine appetite among the organisations, and a real need, to ensure that a more diverse range of people put themselves forward. For example, the recruitment of new members is critical to independent monitoring boards, not least because many IMBs are currently understrength. The difficulties of recruiting new members, especially in low population areas, where many of our prisons are located, and of ensuring that membership reflects a broad range of ages and backgrounds are a constant challenge for IMBs. That is one good argument for why this should be a duty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09031781000058"></a>The aim, therefore, is to spread awareness of the work of the organisations among groups that are underrepresented and people who may be unaware that such opportunities are available. As I said, the people who do this work are not as representative of their populations as they might be. Only one-third of court board members are women, according to figures from June 2008. Nationally, 80 per cent of magistrates are over 50 and the average age is 57. Although the proportion of IMB members from black and ethnic minority communities is around 7 per cent, the proportion of members of these communities on individual boards hardly mirrors the composition of the local population.</p>

They or their representatives have all welcomed the opportunity offered by inclusion in this clause to further promote their lay roles, in addition to the work that they already do to attract a wider and more diverse range of people to take them up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09031781000060"></a>In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, was concerned that the duty might have a perverse consequence, where the fact that the council was committed to promoting greater diversity or understanding of the bodies&#146; roles would demotivate the bodies themselves from doing so. I hope that I can address the question raised by the noble Lord. It is understood by the bodies concerned that we intend to build on what they do, amplify and enhance it and spread the word further, to ensure that the roles are promoted even more widely and to take a joined-up approach across different public bodies to make it more likely that citizens will be able to access information and get involved.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09031781000061"></a>We are not in any sense imposing those requirements on the public bodies in question. We are not saying that councils are superior to those bodies. We are not saying that they will be able to come up with amazing feats to inspire people that the bodies are less capable of doing themselves. We are saying that giving councils that role means that there will be an additional opportunity, an additional focus, with greater attention generated and a boost given to the efforts that the bodies themselves are already making. There is an argument for additional effort in this area and for saying that that will be achieved only by imposing a duty. That will help to increase publicity about roles.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09031781000062"></a>The council can provide a single point of contact for and will reach out to those who are not already aware of a specific role but who may be helpful to the organisations concerned and interested in finding out what is on offer. I am concerned that, if responsibility remains solely with the bodies concerned and that help is not provided, we will be stuck in the current situation where, in many cases, only people who already know about the bodies or have a professional interest can approach them for information. We want it to be made clearer to the public what those bodies do and how to take up opportunities. We think that requiring local authorities to promote information about their important range of local roles means that they can be promoted more effectively and coherently.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09031781000063"></a>Clause 4 deals essentially with lay justices, commonly known as magistrates. The same arguments apply. The noble Lord asked me about the question raised by my noble friend Lord Borrie. We thought about that. He mentioned the fact that the tribunals were not mentioned in Clause 3. We have reviewed that since Committee. We have confirmed that, as they operate at national level, they do not meet our criteria for inclusion. The Tribunals Service at the Ministry of Justice confirms that it does not consider tribunals to be appropriate to be included in the duty. I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising the point and for allowing me to explain why it is not included.</p>

Let me start by making it clear that I was certainly not proposing that tribunals should be included&#151;quite the opposite. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, was not here, I thought that I could at least give the Minister the opportunity to clarify that point, which arose in Committee.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09031781000065"></a>We agree with almost everything that the Minister said in her reply, but it still did not address the key point. Of course it is desirable that there should be greater knowledge and understanding of the functions of all those bodies. Of course anything and everything should be done to encourage a wider and more diverse membership, although I had a little concern when the Minister appeared to be straying into suggesting that local authorities might help with recruitment. I think that she was probably talking about Clause 3, but she mentioned Clause 4, which concerns lay justices. I think that we are all agreed that local authorities must stop short of trying to recruit magistrates. That would be a dangerous path down which to go.</p>

We all agree that that is not a path down which local authorities should go. In moving the amendment, I said that I accept and believe that anything that a local authority can properly do in association with these bodies, especially local magistrates, to promote understanding, to encourage people to take a greater part and to bring about greater diversity is clearly desirable. Indeed, I think that I went as far as to say that, despite my misgivings about guidance, reference to it as a desirable action could be included in guidance. Voluntary assistance and even active engagement by local authorities are very different from placing a statutory duty on those authorities. If there needs to be a statutory duty, it should rest with the appropriate bodies, not with the local authority. That is the key difference between us and the Government and a point on which we will just have to continue to disagree. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="09031781000068"></a><b><a name="90317-0009.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09031781000106"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> My Lords, I shall speak to government Amendments 21 to 23. First, I welcome the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, on this set of amendments, which are intended to improve the arrangements set out in Clause 5. They explain how counties and districts can work together in county areas to provide information to the public on how they can participate in or influence local decision-making by bodies listed in Clauses 2, 3 or 4. We listened to noble Lords&#146; comments that it was not necessarily clear to councils that the responsibility for requesting and collecting information from the connected authorities and those bodies listed in Clauses 3 and 4 falls to counties in two-tier areas.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09031781000069"></a>Clause 5 currently establishes how the duties will work in two-tier areas and clarifies the responsibilities between counties and districts. The arrangements are that the duty applies to districts as well as counties, which means that if citizens go to districts for the information it will be available there and they will not need to be directed to the county instead. Counties will be required to explain how they work, how district councils work and what they and their councillors do. That will also apply vice versa, with districts having to explain about counties. To avoid duplication, in two-tier areas the county will be taking on the burden of collecting the information from the connected authorities and will be required to pass it on to the districts. Should the county not pass the information on to the district, the district will not be deemed to have failed in its duty. Districts can also request and collect additional local information from bodies that they may think are particularly relevant in their area, if they so wish.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09031781000070"></a>The county responsibility for requesting information from the connected authorities was therefore implicit in our drafting of the Bill, which explicitly required both counties and districts to promote understanding of democracy and required counties to pass on any information that they received to their districts, but did not explicitly say that counties must take on the role of requesting the information from connected authorities. We agree that it would be useful to make that role explicit, so that there is no room for doubt. Counties must be clear that there is an expectation being placed on them, and districts must be clear that this is not an onerous duty requiring them to take on work beyond their capacity. Government Amendment 21 therefore makes explicit the requirement for counties to request information from the connected authorities at least once a year. It states that counties must request the relevant information from their districts, connected authorities and the bodies listed in Clauses 3 and 4 at least once a year. The provisions already require that the county must then pass on that information to its districts.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09031781000071"></a>County councils are clearly best placed to take on this role. They have greater capacity, enabling them to put resources into the role, and as they cover all of the area covered by each of the individual districts it makes sense for them to request the information from the connected authorities, which will in many cases be the same for each of the districts. That will ensure that connected authorities are not burdened with multiple requests for the same information.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_172"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90317-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09031781000072"></a>We have recognised that role in our allocation of funding for this new burden, which assumes that more work will be carried out by the county than by the district. For that reason, we think it unlikely that many districts will choose to collect information themselves, although they can collect information from other bodies that they may feel are particularly relevant to the local area if they so wish.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09031781000073"></a>I remind noble Lords that districts in two-tier areas are required in the same way as counties to promote understanding of their council, their connected authorities and their roles in Clauses 3 and 4. They are far from being excluded from duties relating to the promotion of democracy and we fully expect them to take as proactive a role as the counties in going out to their local people to ensure that awareness and interest are raised.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="0903182000001"></a>Clause 5 simply clarifies the arrangements for the information-gathering required to fulfil one aspect of the duty. All we are doing is making that aspect the responsibility of counties so that the burden on districts in two-tier areas, and the number of requests for information, is minimised.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="0903182000002"></a>Most districts would find having to collect and update information from the entire list of connected authorities burdensome, considering their size and capacity. We do not wish to create such a burden. Consequently, the Bill is drafted to recognise that this will be far easier for the counties to take on. Districts will also bear in mind that they will not have been allocated funding to take on this role; therefore, it is unlikely that they will want to carry it out for the entire county. However, as I have said, we recognise that districts may want to collect information from local organisations.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="0903182000003"></a>Amendments 22 and 23 are consequential on Amendment 21. Amendment 22 removes the time limit of at least a year that had been attached to the requirement upon counties to pass information on to the district, in Clause 5(6)(a). Its purpose is to avoid repeating the time limit which would also appear in new paragraph (za), should Amendment 21 be accepted. Logically, it makes more sense that the requirement of &#147;at least once a year&#148; is attached to the requirement to request information in paragraph (za).</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="0903182000004"></a>Amendment 23 is also consequential on Amendment 21. Its purpose is to remove text which would become unnecessary were Amendment 21 accepted. This ensures that paragraph (a) cross-refers to the new paragraph (za) rather than repeating its text clarifying the type of information and bodies referred to. I am sure that that is crystal clear to everybody.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="0903182000005"></a>Noble Lords will see, therefore, that we have listened to their concerns about the clarity of different roles in two-tier areas. Consequently, I hope that they will accept our amendment. Once again, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, for supporting these amendments. I beg to move.</p>

We still have serious doubts about many aspects of this Bill. However, when the Government have made a concession&#151;and the noble Lord may not like that word, but that is what it is&#151;it is important to recognise that they are taking steps in the right direction.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="0903182000007"></a>In Grand Committee, noble Lords rightly raised the question of district councils. I said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="0903182000247"></a>&#147;If the duties in Part 1 are to become law, the Government should recognise the importance of district councils and the key role that they play in promoting democracy&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 26/1/09; col. GC13.]</p>

<p><a name="0903182000240"></a>I went on to express my concerns that we should not, however, encourage the unnecessary duplication of work. The noble Lord took those comments on board. The Government&#146;s proposals are not yet perfect but they are an improvement on the original wording of the Bill. However, the wording might, once again, need to be changed at Third Reading.</p>

<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="0903182000008"></a><b><a name="90317-0009.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0903182000309"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> My Lords, I, too, welcome these amendments. I welcome the Minister&#146;s speech a great deal more than his previous one. I will give him one cheer at least, maybe one and a half out of three cheers for this one&#151;well, perhaps one and three-quarters.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="0903182000009"></a>I do not regard these as concessions, except in the technical sense. Government Ministers and their civil servants&#151;the Bill team&#151;listened to the debate in Grand Committee and no doubt went away and discussed it with other people and agreed that the Bill, as it stood, was not perfect. No Bills are perfect when they come to this House, particularly when they start here. I am not going to jump up and down and say &#147;Concession, concession&#148;. I will say thank you for going some way towards the case that some of us put forward in Grand Committee. The Government have not gone far enough. However, we can perhaps draw a line under it now.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="0903182000010"></a>I have one or two questions. I am still concerned about how the county council will collect information at a very local level unless it is able to involve the district councils. In some places, the county council might have local people with all this information. However, in many places districts will have much better local knowledge to bring it all together and about which organisations ought to be included among the connected authorities that should be on the list of ways in which people can get involved.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="0903182000011"></a>The county will know about the schools and education system, and they may know about the social services system but they will not know about many of the local groups and organisations which, nevertheless, ought to be included as connected authorities, because they have a financial relationship with the council, because they have council representation on it or are in a partnership&#151;in one sense of that word&#151; involving the council</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="0903182000012"></a>I will not go through the list of local organisations in Colne, with which I entertained&#151;or otherwise&#151;the Grand Committee. I remembered about 10 or 11 of them, without thinking very hard. All are genuinely connected organisations because they have links, quite close ones in many cases, with the council. I am a member of quite a few of them and go to their meetings. The district council has this information at

If the district council has information anyway, can it be included in the information that the county council is collecting?</p>
<a name="time_23"></a>
<a name="90317-0009.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="0903182000296"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="0903182000013"></a>The Minister suggested that districts could help in collecting information, where it was a sensible thing to do by co-operation with the county council. Will districts be prevented from doing this because it is not in this legislation or in practice? Again, local authorities, in general, are fairly sensible organisations doing things in a fairly sensible way, given the opportunity. Will a county and a district be able to get together in a district and work out, between themselves, how they will collect this information and which organisation should be collecting it? If so, it does not matter what the legislation says about where the responsibility lies; it is a question of whether there will be a sensible outcome.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="0903182000014"></a>If the information handed down by the county to the district is incomplete, what does the district do, before publishing its document regarding how people can get involved? Does the district send it back to the county with a list of organisations that ought to be in it and are not, or can it write them down on a piece of paper and send them to the printers with its document? Can the district add things without any onerous burden? As the Minister said, we do not want onerous burdens. Can the district add things to the document from the county council?</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="0903182000015"></a>My final question is quite important. Will the information that a citizen gets, if he goes to the district council&#151;the town hall&#151;be identical to the information he gets if he goes to the county council information office just down the road, or perhaps even in the same building if they are really joined up? Will the document the county produces and puts on its website be identical to the one published by the district and put on its website? That seems a fairly crunch issue. They clearly ought to be identical. However, they can only be identical if the district is involved in collecting some of that information and if the county is able to take it from the district.</p>

<a name="90317-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="0903182000016"></a>I welcome the amendment relating to the 12-month period. The Minister undersold it. Originally, the Bill said that the county would only send the information to the district every 12 months. It now says that the county will collect the information every 12 months but will pass it to the district when it gets it. I made that point in Committee and am grateful that it was picked up. However, there are some important questions and I wonder if the Minister can answer them.</p>

Some elements of this will be about common sense and the counties and districts sitting down and talking this through. Nothing prevents the districts from collecting lots of this information, as I have said, but one of the important points for us is that it is clear who is accountable for collecting the information and how it is done. However, the noble Lord raised issues that are probably worth reflecting on in <I>Hansard</I>, and if there is something on which we can elaborate further I am happy to write to him in more detail.</p>

Noble Lords will have noticed that these amendments are identical to those moved by my noble friend Lady Hamwee in Committee. On 3 February in Committee, she explained their purpose very fully. Your Lordships will be pleased to know that I am not going to repeat all that. Let me simply say for the record that Amendment 27 would repeal legislation that establishes a salary threshold for politically restricted posts in local authorities. Amendment 28 would repeal current legislation that requires council employees to resign on nomination as candidates in an election to be a councillor to their employing council by substituting a requirement that they resign immediately on election, if they are so fortunate.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="0903182000021"></a>Amendment 29 would reduce to three months the period during which most former councillors cannot take up employment with a council after their period of service comes to an end. The current 12-month period would be retained for politically restricted posts and for councillors who have been involved in the appointment of senior council staff. We had a constructive

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="0903182000022"></a>We have retabled these amendments to give the Government another opportunity to extend their thinking and to explain what they are doing, or more particularly why they are not taking the opportunity now to meet their commitment. The recommendation originally came from the Councillors Commission, and we have had the Government&#146;s White Paper, in which they made a commitment to abolish the salary rule. However, we understand from the Minister that, rather than taking this very obvious opportunity to fulfil the commitment that the Government have already given and which enjoys all-party support, they are deferring it and putting it into a draft Bill for further consideration, even though there is all-party support for it and recognition of the need to do it; so we may or may not see a draft Bill eventually becoming a Bill, and even longer after that becoming an Act of Parliament, if nothing else has intervened in the mean time to prevent that happening.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="0903182000023"></a>It is genuinely puzzling to all of us why the Government, having made the commitment with all-party support, and having the obvious opportunity, with the Bill now in Parliament, to fulfil that commitment, are now reluctant to fulfil it and are pushing this off to a draft Bill for unnecessary further consideration as a draft Bill that may never actually become an Act of Parliament because of other means entirely outside our control. We have tabled these amendments again to try to understand why the Government are apparently so reluctant to fulfil the commitment that they gave. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="0903182000024"></a><b><a name="90317-0010.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0903182000317"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> My Lords, Amendment 27 would remove the link between the salary level and the designation of a local authority post as politically restricted. We certainly support the policy behind the Widdecombe rules, which preserve the visible political impartiality of senior local authority employees. In <I>Communities in Control: Real People, </I><I>Real Power</I>, our 2008 White Paper, we acknowledged that, with regard to the link between salary and political restrictions, change to the Widdecombe rules is desirable. We are satisfied that the removal of what can be perceived as a blunt instrument will not undermine the important principle at stake. The remaining categories of officer that will remain subject to political restrictions will, in our judgment, continue to cover the most senior officers. That is broadly why I am sympathetic to the intention behind the amendment.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="0903182000025"></a>It is clear that noble Lords feel strongly about the need for reform along the lines proposed in Amendment 27 to make it happen more quickly, and that there is cross-party support for this. I can therefore put the noble Lord out of his misery by telling him that I will take the amendment away and reconsider it. I know that noble Lords will appreciate that, as always with these matters, there are technical drafting points at issue. There would, for example, need to be knock-on amendments to Sections 3 and 3A of the 1989 Act, which refer back to the provisions that would be removed by Amendment 27. I will come back to noble Lords on that point at Third Reading, so the noble Lord can regard that as a real victory.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="0903182000026"></a>I am afraid that I cannot give as much satisfaction on Amendments 28 and 29, as they are much more complex. They address the relationship between being a local authority officer and a local authority member. We have talked a lot about how we want to encourage people to stand as councillors and take an active role in representing their community. Indeed, the burden of the suggestions made by the Councillors Commission related to promoting the role of councillors and so on. However, we need to be a little cautious about the amendments. Neither of the proposals in Amendments 28 and 29 was recommended by the commission after its very comprehensive investigation into this topic, and I can give reasons why that might be the case.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="0903182000027"></a>Amendment 28 would permit officers who are not subject to political restrictions to remain working for an authority while simultaneously seeking election to it. At present, the legal position is that if such people have political ambitions or a desire to offer their services to the public as a councillor, they are free to seek election to every council in the country besides the one that employs them. However, if they think that the best capacity in which they can serve their own council is as a councillor, they are asked to give up their employment before accepting nomination for election. In effect, one has to choose whether one wants to serve as an elected member or as an employed official.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="0903182000028"></a>If an employee has a realistic chance of being elected to the authority for which he or she works, the position is not entirely different from the one that applies to someone who has already been elected. The conflict of interest already starts to apply. The candidate will inevitably, and indeed in some respects quite properly, be looking ahead to the long term and to carrying out the duties of a councillor. From a practical point of view, the period between being elected as a member of a council and having to resign one&#146;s employment will necessarily be very short, as Amendment 28 recognises. A person would be unable to serve any notice period. There are therefore big issues such as future income and time in this situation.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="0903182000029"></a>Even if an employee has no realistic chance of being elected, there are grounds for objecting to permitting retention of employment by the council while standing for election. The possibility is opened up of candidacies that might be perceived as undermining the relationship between employer and employee. What if voters believed that employees were standing for election against sitting councillors as part of a strategy in pay negotiations? I am afraid that that might undermine confidence in the democratic process.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="0903182000030"></a>Amendment 28 would not in fact permit council employees to stand for election to the council by which they are employed; it would remove the statutory prohibition but whether a person was subject to any restrictions would then be a matter of contract and employment law. That opens up the possibility of different provisions applying across the country or indeed within the same authority. It raises the prospect of party political considerations interfering or being perceived to interfere in decisions by existing councillors as to whether a council employee should be permitted to stand for election. So while I applaud the sentiment  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_178"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of seeking to widen the category of person who is able to offer their services as elected members of authorities, to include existing employees of local authorities is fraught with practical problems.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="0903182000031"></a>Amendment 29 seeks to allow local authority members to take up paid employment with the local authority they used to be a member of just 12weeks after leaving office. Presently, the period is 12 months. I ask noble Lords to consider very carefully the effect of such a serious reduction in the interval between leaving office and taking up employment. On the most practical level, most posts in local authorities take at least 12 weeks to fill. The effect of Amendment 29 would be that councillors who had lost their seat would be able to put in their application for employment by the council from which they had just been unseated virtually before the ballot papers were counted.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="0903182000032"></a>That officers of a local authority are fairly appointed on merit is a fundamental and legitimate expectation that the citizen has of those working on their behalf in their local authority. The 12-month buffer gives citizens and officers confidence that the former local authority member has attained employment through ability and honest competition, and helps him or her to be free of the spectre of having used some undue influence in winning the post.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="0903182000033"></a>Simply put, I remain unpersuaded that there is any substantial reason for change, especially change that might damage confidence in the performance of the local authority. I am unaware of any evidence that the existence of the 12-month buffer period is acting as a disincentive for able people to put themselves forward as candidates for election to local authorities, or that reducing it to just three months would have any appreciable effect on increasing the willingness of people to come forward. So I do have a problem with the amendment. However, I hope that is overcome by my response to the first of these amendments, which I am sure the noble Lord will take in very good part.</p>

I suppose that I should mark the fact that we have moved away from Chapter 1 about democratic involvement and into Chapter 2, which relates to petitions. It will come as no surprise to the Minister to hear that I would much prefer that the entire chapter on petitions did not exist. It is unnecessary. To produce eight full pages and getting on for 3,000 words of primary legislation telling councils how to deal with petitions is a waste of legislative time and, some would say, an insult to local authorities. I would certainly say that it is not the best way to go about it.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="0903182000037"></a>I am less agitated about Clause 10 than I am about the rest of the chapter. No doubt the Minister will remind me that in Grand Committee I said that this was a well drafted clause and showed how the rest of the clauses on petitions should be done if the Government insisted on legislating on petitions. I stand by that because it is brief, clear and leaves local authorities to work out exactly what they are going to do. Nevertheless, it is not necessary. This is not something that councillors cannot do now. If councils want to set up an e-petition facility on their websites, they can do so. I do not know whether any councils are doing it, but I am absolutely certain that the best approach would have been to work out sensible guidance in co-operation with the Local Government Association and send it round to councils. Whenever Ministers such as the noble Baroness go around the country making speeches, they could include this as something that should be done. Articles could be written in magazines and there could be a general acceptance within the local government world, or what people nowadays, in a rather modern way that I do not really approve of, call the local government community. It that were done, I do not doubt that the great majority of councils would have e-petitions up and running within 12 months. In fact, they would get them ready more quickly than as a result of legislation that made it compulsory.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="0903182000038"></a>It really is a nonsense to introduce legislation that forces councils to do exactly what the Government want on issues such as this. If the culture in local government was to adopt e-petitions and they were accepted as something that everyone just did, all councils would have them. That is the right approach. One of the reasons why that is a better way is that different councils would set them up in different ways. We would see diversity of provision in e-petition systems around the country. The Government will say that they want everyone to be exactly the same, but the problem is that unless you have diversity of provision, you will never know what best practice is. The best approach is to let people do their own thing and then learn from one another on the basis of best practice.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="0903182000039"></a>The Government believe that they know how to do things in detail. The nanny state comes along and says, &#147;This is exactly what you have to do and exactly how

If you don&#146;t do it our way, you will be breaking the law&#148;. That is ludicrous. I therefore have no hesitation at all in moving this amendment to take Clause 10 out of the Bill. That would not prevent councils from setting up e-petitions, and indeed it might even encourage them, but this is the wrong way to go about it. It is a top-down, new Labour, centralised state way and it should not happen. I beg to move.</p>

I sympathise with his feeling that this is an attempt by centralising government, local or national, to have things done exactly as they feel they should be done. But that is not necessarily so. I believe that the noble Lord has wide experience, so he must have seen petitions drawn up in many ways. By and large, when someone asks someone else to sign a petition, they sum up in two sentences what the petition is about and the petitioner then signs it. No one examines the syntax or logic of the motion because it is the issue that matters. The issue is accepted by the petitioner and he signs it. However, if the petition is capable of misinterpretation, certainly after the event when the result is known, to say that the petition did not mean this or did not mean that would be anti-democratic and not in the interests of pursuing the issue.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="0903182000041"></a>I had some experience of petitions during my service on Enfield Council. They invariably argued against an action of the council in the planning field, for instance, or in the education field. I remember the actions of my friend the late John Mackie, the MP for Enfield East, at the time of the introduction of national comprehensive education in the mid-1960s. A tremendous petition was presented to the council and to Parliament in the name of the voters and residents of Enfield. When it was examined it was found that many hundreds of people who had attended the Enfield or Edmonton markets had signed the petition but had no right to do so. The noble Lord&#146;s concern is misplaced. There needs to be some guidance and a method whereby petitions can be made clear.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="0903182000042"></a>Another petition with which my good friend the late lamented John Mackie was involved concerned a planning issue where big sums of money were at stake. When people sign a petition they are generally driven or motivated by how the issue affects them. That is all very good and correct, but I do not think that we should be too mealy mouthed and say that a petition should be acceptable in whatever form the promoter wishes it to be. There is nothing wrong with the Government giving the appearance of being heavy-handed; if petitions are to have relevance and validity they must be seen to be well drawn up. I am talking not about the contents of the petition but about its style and its manner.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="0903182000043"></a>I cannot accept the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, which can be summed up as being against the policing and shaping of petitions in the way proposed by the Government. I believe that the Government&#146;s proposals are far better than the present situation.</p>

I seldom compliment the Government on what they do but the introduction of the online petition scheme at Downing Street has been very useful in providing the oxygen of publicity on various causes, such as the Lisbon treaty and a new bank holiday. Members of the House may disagree on whether the petitioners were right or wrong, but if we are looking for an increased engagement between local people and local authorities, Clause 10 may help to facilitate that.</p>

I welcome her support and that of my noble friend, who made some very telling comments. I know that we are pre-empting a larger debate, which will surface as we go through the amendments, on whether we should legislate for petitions at all, and I shall use those arguments as we come to them. I am confused by the noble Lord&#146;s opposition now to a clause that he said he was in favour of in Committee. He was relatively full of praise for the clause and congratulated the Government on it. During later discussions he went so far as to say that he did not seek to leave out e-petitions. I was hopeful that we might maintain some consistency and I am surprised by his new-found opposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="0903182000046"></a>I can only confirm what I said in Grand Committee, which was that e-petitions are an invaluable tool. As the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, said, we need to look only at the success of the No. 10 e-petition site and the experience of local authorities such as Bristol and Kingston to see how effective e-petitions can be in communicating community concerns and giving public bodies the opportunity to address them in ways that they could not have dreamt of even five years ago. Therefore, it is only right that our legislation should show that people can make petitions in this way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="0903182000047"></a>The noble Lord seems to think that this is happening, or might happen, in many more places, but so far we are aware of only three local authorities operating e-petitions out of the 388 authorities in England. We want to make more happen and we have chosen this vehicle to do that. We want to achieve both visibility and a systematic way of drawing petitions to the attention of the community, as well as their rights under the Bill to receive acknowledgements and action. We will come on to that in later amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="0903182000050"></a>I do not know which the three local authorities are. One is Bristol and one is Kingston, but whether the third is also Liberal Democrat run I do not know. The two named by the noble Baroness certainly are. Perhaps that says something; I do not know.</p>

<a name="90317-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="0903182000051"></a>If it is made clear to local authorities what e-petitions are and what they are meant to do, if local authorities are given clear guidance on how to conduct them and if they are encouraged to do it, then I think that this should happen, particularly if it was a joint initiative between the LGA and the Government. If this were to be done in a serious, voluntary way, half the authorities in the country would set up schemes within 12 months and most of them within two years. Once it became known that other councils were doing it, there would be a demand for it locally and those councils that did not want to do it would be forced to do it by their residents, local newspapers and other local groups. There is no doubt about that and that is the way to do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="0903182000052"></a>Unfortunately, the people who write this legislation do not understand local government and how things work locally. They think that the only way to achieve anything through a local authority is to send out ever greater amounts of detailed prescribed legislation, delegated legislation, regulations and guidance and to keep beating the local authority over the head. That is way that it happens and local authorities, to their credit, survive.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="0903182000053"></a>Our experience of an e-petition facility is the No. 10 Downing Street website. The noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, said that it is a success and there is no doubt that some campaigns have been able to make successful use of it. But, as a means by which people can influence legislation and public policy, it is not very successful; in fact, it is completely useless in most cases. Most of the petitions receive not even a cursory consideration within the system of government and the corridors of power. For example, if petitions are put up on the site about matters that are the responsibility of particular departments, I see no indication that they are even referred to those departments for consideration; they are simply dealt with by No. 10 Downing Street.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="0903182000054"></a>To try to find out how government departments deal with all this&#151;because if the legislation is going to insist that local authorities do this, it really ought to be a matter of, &#147;Do as we do&#148;, and not, as it appears at the moment, &#147;Do as we say, not as we do&#148;&#151;my noble friend Lady Hamwee and I put down a series of Written Questions, which we are continuing to pursue. The information that we are getting is fascinating. It is fascinating because we are not getting any information. We are simply being told, in the case of most departments, that they do not deal with petitions as petitions; they just regard them as correspondence and deal with them as such. So far as I can tell, no government department, including the Department of Communities and Local Government, which is sponsoring this legislation, has a petition facility on its own website, and, on the information that we have been given so far, only two of them, one of which I think is Defra, have set up a link to the No. 10 e-petition facility from their own websites. So the position within Whitehall is not satisfactory if the Government are promoting this for local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="0903182000055"></a>I am not going to go through the wodge of information that I have received in Written Answers in any detail, but I shall be compiling it all in due course. Two points come out of it. One is that the Bill will require local authorities to give special consideration to what at the moment are valid petitions and what in due course will be called Section 12 petitions&#151;that is, petitions that fit within the Bill. None of that takes place in government departments at the moment. None of them is required to look at petitions in any particular way other than simply replying to them and giving an answer. One or two departments have said that they operate the &#147;Whitehall standards&#148;. I am not sure what they are. They probably just refer to correspondence. It would be interesting to know whether there are any specific Whitehall standards in relation to petitions. I do not think that there are.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="0903182000056"></a>Nothing in the Bill about how a local authority will have to receive a petition, acknowledge it, deal with it, consider it and refer it to a committee to be considered if that is what people want, and nothing of the rules about what constitutes a petition&#151;how many people have to be on it, and so on&#151;applies to government departments. If the Government are insisting on all these things being forced on local authorities in this detailed way, they ought at least to get their own house in order and apply similar standards to their own departments&#151;particularly to the Minister&#146;s own department, although the latest Answer that I have had from her suggests that people there are now thinking, &#147;Well, if we&#146;re going to say that Westminster, Lancashire, Pendle and Bradford have got to do this, then perhaps we&#146;ve got to do it as well&#148;. It will be interesting to see the result of this process. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I do not want to reiterate the arguments that we had; I shall say simply that one of the reasons we brought this part of the Bill forward is that we know that only one in five councils makes publicly available details of how to submit a petition. Based on the evidence that I presented in Committee, we believe that information explaining how authorities deal with petitions is inadequate and unsystematic; that many people in many communities are disadvantaged by that; and that there is an appetite in the community to know more, to do more, to have an impact and to know that changes follow when people can be bothered to petition. So we have concluded that there is a role for central government to build   


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_184"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 184</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on best practice, as many noble Lords reiterated in Committee, to embed it and to open up some new opportunities so that the community itself can drive public service improvement. That ambition starts by ensuring that citizens across England and Wales know how to petition their council and know that their petition will trigger action.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="0903182000058"></a>The chapter will provide minimal frameworks that will give flexibility to authorities, protections for local authorities so that they are not overburdened, and guarantees of action and clarity for local people. To achieve that, we need to put some things in place, such as a definition of what a &#147;local petition&#148; is so that councils are not legally obliged to respond to every piece of correspondence they receive or to petitions on issues they cannot influence; a duty to acknowledge petitions and publicise responses to petitions and the authority&#146;s petition schemes so that people know that their petition will be dealt with; a duty to respond substantively to petitions, including an ability for petitions to trigger full council debates on issues that a large number of people support; and a way for people to appeal if they think their council has not given due consideration to their petition.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="0903182000059"></a>There are areas over which we diverge in principle as well as process, but I listened closely to concerns that there was too much detail in the Bill about what qualifies as a petition to which a principal local authority must respond. In Committee, noble Lords also made the important point that petitions that genuinely represent the concerns of the community should not be rejected for technical reasons, and I completely agree. Our amendments therefore make it clear that we expect councils to take petitions from local people seriously and to ensure that they are not rejected on technical grounds. They give greater flexibility and improve the Bill. More importantly, they will improve the petition process. I am grateful to noble Lords for supporting those improvements. I am particularly glad to have the support of noble Lords on the Benches opposite.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="0903182000060"></a>We had a major debate in Committee about the notion of &#147;validity&#148;. I was persuaded by the arguments that were put principally by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. Amendments 31, 41, 44, 54, 60, 68, 70, 78, 79, 80 and 94 therefore remove the label &#147;valid&#148;. Noble Lords were concerned that that label might suggest that there was a class of petitions that fell into the category of &#147;invalid&#148;, and we do not want to give any such impression; we never intended that there should be. The change clarifies that authorities will be legally obliged by this chapter to respond to certain petitions defined in Clauses 12 and 14. Any other petitions, however, such as petitions not signed by local people or those that relate to issues that the authority cannot influence, will not in any way be invalid. The difference will be that while local authorities can choose to respond to such petitions, they will not be legally obliged to respond to them. The change makes it clear that local authorities should consider how they will respond to all kinds of petitions, whether or not they are required by the law to do so.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="0903182000061"></a>We are also clear that citizens must be able to know what to expect. Local authorities will set out clearly and publicly their commitment to dealing with petitions  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_185"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in their petition scheme. Again, if local authorities want to go beyond what is strictly required in the criteria of the petition scheme in the Bill, Clause 18(1) provides that petition schemes can include elements beyond the requirement of the Bill. That means that an authority could specify in its scheme that it will respond to all petitions on all subjects, no matter if the petition is signed by a local person or about a local issue.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="0903182000062"></a>The scheme is a major step forward for local people. Whether they live in England or Wales, they will be guaranteed that their council will have a way of responding to petitions and, under Clause 11, they can find that on the council&#146;s website. Clause 11(6) provides that whatever the scheme says the council will do, it will be legally obliged to follow through. If the scheme says that the council will acknowledge petitions within two weeks, people will know when to expect the acknowledgement. There will no longer be any mystery about what happens when you submit a petition, whether that is for more allotments or better flood defences, or about when people will hear the council&#146;s decision on the matter.</p>
<a name="time_26"></a>
<a name="90317-0011.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="0903182000299"></a>7.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="0903182000063"></a>There were also concerns about other details in the clause. The role of the petition organiser is very important. They will receive the acknowledgement and response from the authority; they will have the right to ask the Overview and Scrutiny Committee to review the adequacy of the response. It is vital that there is one person with whom the authority can deal to avoid the need, self-evidently, to contact all signatories individually.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="0903182000064"></a>We listened to concerns that petitions should not be rejected simply because they do not nominate a petition organiser. So Amendments 45, 52 and 93, taken together, provide that, if the petition does not identify an organiser, the petition will not be rejected. Instead, the authority will be required to contact signatories of the petition to agree with one signatory that they will act as the petition organiser. That is sensible: it avoids the local authority being able to give in to any temptation to reject a petition on technical grounds.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="0903182000065"></a>We also debated in Committee the merits of the requirements in Clause 12 that petitions must be addressed to the authority. Members of the Committee were concerned that &#147;address&#148; is an ambiguous term, and our intention was simply that the petition would need to be presented to the authority in order for the authority to consider it and take action. This is a little obvious, as it would not be reasonable to expect an authority to respond to a petition it has not received&#151;we are getting into the realms of the surreal here. We therefore concluded that there is no need for an explicit provision on this subject. Amendment 42 removes the requirement that petitions must be addressed or presented to the authority. That will make the legislation clearer, and remove a potential obstacle.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="0903182000066"></a>Amendment 49 removes the requirement that petitioners must add the date along with their signature. Amendment 51 is consequential to that, and we were convinced by the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on this point. Indeed, he has tabled Amendment 50, which has exactly the same effect as  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_186"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>my Amendment 49. I am very pleased that we agree on this major issue. I prefer to stick with my drafting: I think it neatly achieves the same effect. We want these proposals to make it as easy as possible for citizens to express their views. Adding a date beside a signature may be a small request, but we agree that the loss of response from the council is a high price to pay for petition organisers who simply forget to add a date column to their form.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="0903182000067"></a>In a similar vein, Amendment 61 removes the provision that petitions on the same subject as another petition received in the previous six months do not qualify as active. We are convinced here by the argument that it would be easy enough for authorities to respond to such a petition, but if no new information were available, they could simply say no. But it may be that, in that period of time, the situation has changed and it would be useful for the authority to reconsider the issue. The Government believe that removing this exclusion will not place significant burdens on authorities. We are persuaded of that; it will ensure that petitions are dealt with transparently. So I hope that will be welcomed by noble Lords.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="0903182000068"></a>During our debate in Grand Committee, Liberal Democrat Peers urged that e-petitions should be dealt with in exactly the same way as paper petitions. We are entirely in agreement here: we do not want people to be disadvantaged just because they signed an e-petition or visa versa. I should make it clear that the drafting of this chapter, where electronic petitions are provided for in a separate clause, does not mean that electronic petitions will be dealt with differently from paper petitions. It is a matter of drafting. I can reassure noble Lords that both electronic petitions and paper petitions will be part of a local authority&#146;s single petition scheme.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="0903182000069"></a>There is, however, one inherent difference, which we discussed. Principal local authorities will become aware of electronic petitions at an early stage, when someone first decides they want to set up an e-petition and asks the council to host a petition on its e-petition facility. At that point, by definition, there will not be any signatures. In contrast, authorities will first become aware of paper petitions when they are completed; the signatures will be there when the petitions are presented to the authorities. So, for instance, at the point the authority receives a request to host an e-petition, it cannot tell the organiser how it intends to deal with that petition. Given that it does not yet have any signatures, the authority will not be able to tell, for example, what the strength of local feeling is on the issue. The Bill&#146;s drafting is intended to recognise this single difference, but that is where the differences should end.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="0903182000070"></a>Amendment 58, therefore, remedies an inconsistency in the Bill&#146;s treatment of electronic and paper petitions by providing that electronic petitions should be acknowledged once they are completed, and that means that they will both be treated exactly the same. I believe that this package of amendments will help to ensure that these provisions put the needs and convenience of local people first. These provisions should be there to support communities so that they can express genuine  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_187"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>concerns. They must avoid the potential for petitions to be rejected on technical grounds; they must build on good practice.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="0903182000071"></a>In Grand Committee, noble Lords worked hard to identify what could be done to streamline the process and to create a better system. I am very grateful for that work and am also grateful for the positive support of noble Lords opposite. I commend our amendments to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="0903182000072"></a><b><a name="90317-0011.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0903182000327"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for tabling these amendments. My noble friend Lord Hanningfield and I have added our names to a number of them. Following a meeting with the noble Baroness between Grand Committee and today, she impressed on us that the Government had been looking again at the whole issue of petitions. I think that all of us who have followed the progress of this Bill knew that the Government would have to give ground and accept that they had not initially thought through properly the provisions contained in this Bill.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="0903182000073"></a>We were particularly exercised by the Government&#146;s peculiar notion of a Government-approved valid petition. In Grand Committee, my noble friend Lord Hanningfield gave an example of a petition which may not have been valid, but none the less should have been dealt with. He raised the obvious point that, if local authorities start throwing out petitions as not valid, that will alienate people&#151;not help them to engage in the democratic process.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="0903182000074"></a>We were also against the concept of a petition organiser. Indeed, my noble friend Lady Morris moved amendments and argued eloquently that, by designating a petition organiser, the Government risked creating self-appointed busy-bodies who would hamper, not help, the engagement of local people with genuine grievances with their properly elected representatives.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="0903182000075"></a>The Government clearly were listening. These amendments as tabled may not have been exactly the amendments that we would have put down on Report, but the Minister has made a real attempt to deal with some of the sillier aspects of this Bill. The Opposition are relieved to support that. I would not like this to be seen, however, as carte blanche support for the Government: it is not. There are many problems remaining with the Bill, and although these amendments go some way towards dealing with some of our concerns, I reiterate our belief that some of these clauses are simply unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="0903182000076"></a>The Government have a little luxury of time; because of the parliamentary Recess, there is a longer than usual pause between the stages of this Bill. I urge the Government to use this time constructively. I have signalled my support for these amendments as far as they go; I do not wish to repeat everything said in Grand Committee. The Opposition made ourselves abundantly clear then about what we thought of this Bill. Those thoughts are recorded in <I>Hansard</I><I></I>for the Minister to refer to, and the Government could yet make a better Bill. I hope they will choose to do so.</p>

I will respond to the Government&#146;s amendments, and I am not going to press Amendment 50, which was put down by mistake. I had not actually noticed that the Government had taken the date out. That was my fault.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="0903182000078"></a>The Minister congratulated those of us who took part in all those Grand Committee sessions. She said noble Lords &#147;worked hard&#148;. I thought the Government simply thought we were hard work. Either way, I take it as a compliment and thank her for that. She also repeated what she has said throughout this Bill, that only one in five councils make information available about how to provide petitions, and we just disagree about the facts there. What she means is that when her officials looked on council websites, they could only find that information on one in five websites. That is different from whether information is made available or not. In the case of my own council, information is made widely available on the announcement notices for meetings, which are stuck up everywhere. It is also on the website if you look for it.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="0903182000079"></a>The real problem here is one I have raised previously in that a lot of council websites are a bit old-fashioned, and some are pretty awful. I am not suggesting that the Government bring in a detailed Bill to help councils put their websites together, although that would be their approach under this. I am suggesting that the Government, together with the Local Government Association, should spread best practice. Some councils have very good websites, but that does not include my own, I am afraid.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="0903182000080"></a>The problem is that there is an old-fashioned approach to some websites; they provide a limited amount of information which is set out in traditional council-ese that those of us who are used to agenda papers will understand. A lot of websites are very good at telling you how to get somebody to do a special refuse collection from your backyard if you are throwing furniture out, how to get the rat-catcher out or promoting events in the local park, but not so good at promoting local democratic involvement or making it easier for people to find out what is happening at the next area committee meeting. I am glad to have the nodding support of the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, who is in his place now.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="0903182000081"></a>I will go through some of the amendments very quickly. A lot of them are to take out the word &#147;valid&#148;. I am extremely grateful for this as I waged a campaign against &#147;valid&#148;. I fear that they will now be called Section 12 petitions, at least within local authorities, unless people think of a better term. Perhaps they will be called parliamentary petitions, although that would give the wrong impression, like when we used to have parliamentary trains. The Government have seen sense on this; this simple amendment does a lot to change the difficulties that many of us foresaw of this scheme discouraging or even preventing a lot of the petition work which takes place already and restricting people&#146;s rights.</p>

We were arguing together about that. On the date, the Government have made a common-sense change. Making it absolutely clear that e-petitions and paper petitions will be treated the same by the procedures of the council is sensible. The six-month rule will stop councils saying that they have had one petition and the next five that come from different parts of the area on the same subject will be rejected simply because they have already had one, or that they will reject one after four months if circumstances change. That is absolute common sense.</p>

The Minister has been clear throughout in recognising that petitions come in a wide variety of forms. More often than not, they are not set out in the way originally envisaged in the Bill. We have just debated a clutch of amendments which in effect recognised that. The purpose of Amendment 37 is that a local authority must in its petition scheme comply with the statutory requirements&#151;that goes without saying&#151;but that it will not necessarily be in trouble if it does not comply with some of the voluntary aspects of the scheme. There is always the danger that some vexatious people may apply for judicial review or refer to the district auditor or any number of other places. The amendment makes it clear that that is the case.</p>

<a name="90317-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="0903182000085"></a>On Amendment 39, the Minister has told us on several occasions that local authorities may act as they wish within the statutory provisions on petitions. The amendment gives effect to those words and makes it clear that local authorities are free, if they wish, to depart from the voluntary aspects of their petition schemes to enable them to be more flexible and, more often than not, more obliging in dealing with the petition; and to enable them not to be unnecessarily restricted by their petition scheme. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="0903182000087"></a>The petitions regime, which this chapter introduces, does not impose any onerous burden on local authorities. If a council gets a petition it must acknowledge it and take appropriate action in respect of it. As a matter of ordinary public law, if a council received a petition and responded in a wholly unreasonable manner, it would even now be liable to challenge by judicial review or perhaps, although it is rather more difficult to see how, by the district auditor. The situation will not be all that different after the petitions provisions of the chapter are in place.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="0903182000088"></a>One difference will be that the profile of petitions will be raised. People will know where and how to submit petitions and, crucially, that they will be guaranteed a response. There is a theoretical chance, I admit, that raising the profile of petitions and increasing the number that councils receive could lead to an increase in legal action against councils. Our judgment is that it will not. If all councils have a clear procedure for dealing with petitions, this will serve to protect them from any accusation that they have acted in an unreasonable manner. All a council has to do to avoid legal action is to comply with its own procedures. That is no different from what it has to do in relation to every other function it discharges.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="0903182000089"></a>As noble Lords are aware, the Bill requires principal local authorities to have a petition scheme which secures at least the requirements set out in this chapter. An authority&#146;s scheme can go wider than these provisions but Clause 11(6) provides that, whatever commitments are made in a scheme, the local authority is legally bound to comply with them. The problem with Amendment 37 is that it limits the requirements in the subsection to cover only the statutory parts of its scheme&#151;that is, only those which stem from this Bill. If we were to accept the amendment, local authorities could set a petition scheme which voluntarily goes wider than the requirements of the Bill, and then pick and choose whether to uphold the commitments they had made in their formal scheme when dealing with any petitions which fall under the voluntary part of the scheme. This would certainly create a two-tier scheme where it would not be clear to petitioners how their petition would be dealt with.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="0903182000090"></a>Amendment 37 would therefore increase the risk of legal challenge because it would invite argument that the council had committed to doing one thing in its petition scheme and then done something else entirely. The amendment would not oust any court jurisdiction to consider whether an authority had acted reasonably in its response to a petition; it would just mean that, instead of assessing whether the council had complied with its published procedures, a court would have to examine wider issues of reasonableness. We share the objective that citizens should have a clear understanding of how their local authority will deal with petitions. However, I fear that Amendment 37 would undermine that objective. Therefore, on that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw it.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="0903182000091"></a>Amendment 39 would insert express provision that nothing in the chapter,</p>
<ul><a name="0903182000291"></a>&#147;prevents a ... local authority from relaxing the requirements of its petition schemes so as to apply it more widely than is required by this Chapter or the scheme&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_191"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 191</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0903182000242"></a>The concern expressed by the noble Lord is that, once a principal local authority must have a petition scheme, for it to act in response to petitions which fall outside that scheme would be considered in some way to be unreasonable or a waste of resources. I do not believe that this concern is justified. I do not think that any aspect of the requirements of the Bill could be interpreted as imposing any sort of exclusive set of obligations for the handling of petitions. As such, I believe that there would be no grounds for criticising local authorities for continuing to exercise their public law powers in response to petitions which fall outside their petition scheme.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="0903182000092"></a>The provisions of this chapter are deliberately framed in a manner which makes it clear that authorities are given a very wide discretion on what to include in their scheme, and how to respond to petitions. The Bill does not set fixed limits on how a function is to be discharged by principal authorities. While local authorities must do at least what their petition scheme says they will, they will have the discretion to respond to any petition, even if it does not meet the requirements of the scheme which they have set out. Nothing in the Bill prevents local authorities responding to any petition they receive.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="0903182000093"></a>I hope that the noble Lord finds those assurances helpful and that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_192"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 192</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>four broad themes as being the reasons why this approach to a petition scheme is not the best one, and could be dangerous. First, these are detailed, top-down rules set by central Government and laid down in legislation and in guidance which will apply to all local authorities. They will apply in all circumstances, in all types of localities and types of councils, and in all circumstances in terms of the issues that the petitions concern. Despite the Government&#146;s response that the whole thing is flexible, and that local councils will be able to deal with the matter as they wish, and despite some of the very useful changes which have been made between Committee and Report, we submit that this is still a top-down, bureaucratic, legalistic, inflexible system. It will cause problems because people will have to spend a lot of time working out how to deal with it, whether this petition comes within the rules, whether that one does not, and if so, how it will be dealt with, whether the petition is about subjects which the council can legitimately deal with, and, if not, whether it should be passed to somebody else, and other issues. If only two or three petitions a year are presented to a council, these issues will not matter too much, and will be sorted out. However, if 500 petitions a year are presented to a council, it will have to employ at least one person, and probably two, to deal with them, whereas in the normal circumstances petitions are simply acknowledged and passed to the appropriate body in the council to deal with, which might constitute a committee, the executive, a lead member or the full council, or it might simply be a letter from a council officer saying, &#147;We have understood this and this is what we are going to do&#148;&#151;or are not going to do.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="0903182000098"></a>At present, petitions are dealt with sensibly and flexibly. We do not oppose the Government&#146;s general view that there ought to be a better system in many councils. Indeed, it is widely thought that Hazel Blears is the Minister really pushing petitions. She made a speech about this only last week. Salford is one of the councils whose method of dealing with petitions we are having difficulty finding out about. It does not appear to have a scheme or to deal with petitions very well. However, I believe that Hazel Blears should sort out her own council rather than imposing this measure on the rest of us. Detailed, top-down rules are not the way forward.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="0903182000099"></a>Secondly, the detail of the rules and of the legislation is ridiculous. I have said this before and I say it again because I have spoken to a lot of councillors and a few council officials from around the country. I have asked every one of them that I have talked to at conferences and other places, and in e-mail discussion forums, &#147;Do you know that this is being landed on you? Do you know it is happening? Have you been consulted about it? What do you think of it?&#148; First, they do not have the slightest idea it is happening; secondly, when I tell them what is in it, they are horrified; and thirdly, they say, &#147;Why don&#146;t you do something about it?&#148;, to which I say, &#147;I have been trying but we really need to persuade the Government that a change of approach is necessary&#148;. The detail and extent of the scheme is not the approach. In Committee, I tried to get the Government to accept a more framework-based approach, with a page of legislation at the most, and then trust councils to get on with it.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="0903182000100"></a>The third problem is that it is too bureaucratic and too legalistic, with the result that it will cost money and resources. There is no doubt that it will be expensive to run. It is not clear where councils are supposed to get those extra resources from to deal with the schemes in this legalistic and bureaucratic way.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="0903182000101"></a>The fourth danger is that it will restrict people and it will impose a straitjacket on informal and spontaneous activity. Some of the amendments brought forward by the Government have dealt with that. Nevertheless, a great deal of the devil is in the detail and the detail will be in the guidance to be put forward by the Government. We should ask ourselves what will be in that guidance. We do not know. The guidance may reverse some of the improvements to the Bill. I am sure that the Minister does not want that to happen.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="0903182000102"></a>There are three ways to do this. The first is to do it through what I call gullible legislation, which pins people down and does not let them move unless they do exactly what you want. The second way is through best practice, advice and encouragement, which we would prefer. We believe it could be done perfectly adequately without legislation, if only the Government were prepared to let go and trust local authorities. The third way is through genuine framework legislation, which still leaves a great deal of leeway for local authorities to be trusted. Regrettably, the Government have rejected that. If the Government were talking about framework legislation, we would not be totally opposed to going further than petitions and making a legal right of residents to attend meetings to put a point of view when councils are making decisions. Many Liberal Democrat councils now do that, as do others. That would enable people to talk to the decision-makers when they make decisions. Every month of my life, I take part in meetings like that and they are very successful. If the Government were serious about it, they would roll the whole thing up in a community empowerment provision in the draft Community Empowerment Bill, but they will not do that at the moment.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="0903182000103"></a>The noble Baroness set out four principles in Grand Committee, reported in <I>Hansard</I> at col. 39 on 26 January 2009. The first is that people should be able to have their say about the services for which they pay. We agree with that; we have no problem with that; and we have no problem with the important role that petitions can play in that.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="0903182000104"></a>Secondly, they have a responsibility to listen and give feedback on petitions. We have no problem with that; sensible councils do that already. If the Government want to put it in legislation as a general duty, we do not have a great problem with that, although we would prefer a voluntary approach.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="0903182000105"></a>Thirdly, there must be a clear process for dealing with petitions and responding to them but there must also be flexibility and autonomy. We believe that the words of the Minister in Committee do not tally with what is written in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="0903182000106"></a>Fourthly, we should all build on best practice. I return to the basic principle that if you want to build on best practice, you have to know what best practice is. You will never know what it is unless there is  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_194"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 194</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>diversity of practice across the land. As long as everyone does the same thing, in the same way, under government regulations, best practice will never break through because the authorities with the ambition, enthusiasm and vision to create best practice will be prevented from doing so.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="0903182000107"></a>My final point is that it is very important that a petition system is not a sham; that petitions are seen to be dealt with seriously; and that, even if they do not get what they want out of it, people see that it has been discussed and dealt with properly. There is nothing between us on that. We do not believe that the way to do it is through eight pages and 3,000 words of prescriptive legislation. We believe that there should be a much more flexible and voluntary approach.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="0903182000108"></a>At this stage, we will not agree on this, but I put the case again in the hope that someone may listen. This Bill has a long way to go. Once it has gone through your Lordships&#146; House, it has to go to the Commons, and by that time people in local government around the country may realise what is in it and what is happening and pressure may be put on the Government to cause them to change their mind. I hope so. For the moment, we can only argue the case. I beg to move.</p>

My noble friend Lord Hanningfield and I, in Grand Committee, added our names to all the equivalent stand-part Questions. We argued then, and I have much sympathy with the noble Lord when he says today, that these clauses are not necessary. We argued this point at great, one might even say exhaustive, length in Committee. I am not sure that I have much more to add by way of fresh argument. Our position remains that there is too much detail. Telling local authorities how to deal with petitions is a bit like teaching your grandmother to suck eggs.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="0903182000110"></a>However, as I indicated earlier, the Government have been forced to concede various points on this issue. They have listened to us up to a point, and if they refuse to listen to us after that point, then perhaps they will simply have to learn by their mistakes.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="0903182000111"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that we do not need these clauses in the Bill. The record will show very clearly that that is our position, just as it will show for ever more that the Government insisted on their course of action. I think that my comments can be applied to all the &#147;leave out clause&#148; amendments in this chapter of the Bill. I do not think I will make our case stronger simply by going over the arguments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="0903182000112"></a>In the mean time, I urge the Minister to think about what we have said. I hope that she will be able to come back at Third Reading, which will fall after the Easter Recess, and tell us that she has been able to make a better Bill.</p>

Clearly, there is agreement about the principles that we are trying to achieve, which the noble Lord read out. We believe that all the clauses in the Bill are necessary. They contribute to a system in which petitions are not something which people in local government try to get off their desks as fast as possible, with the least possible fuss, but instead are seen as valuable sources of information about what people want in order to ensure that their local community is somewhere they want to live and that local services meet their needs.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="0903182000114"></a>Clauses have not been drafted in isolation. We have, for example, learnt from Medway council, whose petition scheme offers petitioners a right of review very similar to the one in Clause 17&#151;best practice from which we have learnt. In the past year, petitioners have been so satisfied with the responses they have received that only four out of 89 have used that right.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="0903182000115"></a>We believe there is a need for a legal framework to ensure that local petitions are taken seriously. We want to balance that with the need to keep burdens on councils to a minimum, particularly in these very difficult times, when it is very important that people know how the money that they contribute through their taxes is spent and how their concerns are taken into account by local decision-makers. We need to balance that with enough flexibility so that the best councils can continue to build on best practice and continue to innovate. We believe that we have achieved that in the Bill, particularly with the amendments we have made. The provisions in the Bill are so flexible that they do not remove anything that already exists. They provide guarantees that people will receive answers when they petition their principal local authority, but they do not restrict which petitions authorities can respond to, as we discussed in Grand Committee. The proposals do not create a two-tier system, they do not increase the complexity of arrangements for citizens and we are alive to the need to minimise burdens on councils now more than ever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="0903182000116"></a>If councils are to be legally required to respond to petitions, we need to make sure that the requirement extends only to issues of genuine concern to their communities and that petitions are not exploited mischievously. Clause 14 provides that principal authorities do not need to take steps with regard to vexatious, abusive or otherwise inappropriate petitions. This gives councils the ability to ensure, for instance, that their e-petition system is not abused by those who want to stir up community tensions or a hate campaign against a local family or council officer. Clause 16 also protects councils from being bogged down in replying to petitions on issues which they are unable to influence.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="0903182000117"></a>However, by setting out a requirement for authorities to have a petition scheme, Clause 11 puts in place the foundation stone to ensure that our proposals on petitions meet the four key principles to which the noble Lord referred. I hope that he will think about the changes that I have made, that we have tried very hard to do some of the things that he wanted, and that the principle, as set out in the Bill, is something that he could live with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="0903182000121"></a>The amount of public consultation that takes place nowadays is fairly large; it is certainly enormous compared with the situation 30 or 40 years ago. Quite often in  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_197"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 197</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>districts where councils are trying to make a difference&#151;because they are thought to be disadvantaged in some way, or there are environmental or housing problems or whatever, or they are putting forward regeneration or planning schemes&#151;a lot of consultation is involved. The amount is so great that people often complain of consultation fatigue and say, &#147;We don&#146;t want to be consulted any more; we just want you to get on with it, please, whatever you are doing&#148;. A huge amount of consultation already takes place.</p>

<a name="90317-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="0903182000122"></a>However, in planning and licensing applications a formal, legal consultation process is set down involving deadlines, procedures as to what has to happen to representations, the relevant council committees and the various ways that the applications can be dealt with. That is in legislation. For example, there is a deadline by which councils are supposed to deal with planning applications&#151;eight weeks, or 13 weeks for major applications. Councils will have their own systems for advertising applications, notifying neighbours and asking for representations, which may well involve petitions. They often do; if people get worked up about a scheme, they get their neighbours to sign a petition or they go to the town centre and sign one. A lot of petitions are submitted as part of the normal planning application process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="0903182000123"></a>As regards the wider process&#151;the plan-making process, which now involves the local development frameworks&#151;a huge amount of consultation takes place. The planning authority has to draw up a scheme of public involvement, although I have forgotten the exact terminology for it, which is set out in the Planning Act which we took through this House only recently. The representations are fed into the planning process and the council will have a detailed scheme as to how that works, which may involve petitions.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="0903182000124"></a>Putting those petitions into the Section 12 petition scheme, as it will inevitably be called, is ridiculous. It will not work, because petitions will also have to go into the formal planning process, anyway. If people demanded that they should go to an overview and scrutiny committee and then that there should be a debate at the full council meeting, in some cases that would begin to border on the unlawful. That is because the way in which the process has to be done is set out in the planning legislation, the planning regulations, and the council&#146;s adopted schemes that have to be approved by the Secretary of State and are formal documents.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="0903182000125"></a>Equally, it is important that licensing applications are dealt with in a proper manner. In taxi, alcohol or premises licensing, you are dealing with a quasi-judicial function where the council has by law to set up a separate committee. The members of that committee have to have training and they make the decisions. The rest of the council cannot do anything about it if it does not like it&#151;as I know to my cost&#151;when they make wrong decisions. Any representations have to go into that process and if they do not, it is a waste of time anyway, because they will not have any impact on the decisions that are made about the issue of the petition. Planning and licensing applications that are dealt with in legislation ought to be excluded from this particular petition scheme. It is common sense that  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_198"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they should be excluded, and if they are not, councils will get into real difficulties in how to deal with them, and they may get into legal difficulties if they start trying to deal with legitimate planning application or licensing matters outside the particular tram lines of the planning and licensing systems.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="0903182000126"></a>We are not trying to be awkward in any way in putting forward these amendments. We are very concerned that the Government have not thought the provision through properly and have got it wrong. I do not ask that these amendments be approved tonight&#151;well, I do, but I do not expect them to be approved&#151;but I ask the Government to think very clearly about these matters.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="0903182000127"></a>My final point is less important in terms of the legal background to all these decisions. Let us imagine that a council is proposing to build a new leisure centre with three possible sites and it is carrying out a formal public consultation process. Petitions may well come in with regard to that. People may want it in one particular site, residents in one area may say they do not want it anywhere near them under any circumstances, thank you very much. Whatever the petition says, they may say they want it somewhere completely different. They may say they do not want it at all, or it is the wrong sort of leisure centre.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="0903182000128"></a>Petitions come in as part of consultation processes, so it would be wrong to have a system set down in the law of the land that says that petitions coming in have to be dealt with in some way outside that process, and that people have a right to have full council debate before the consultation process is properly concluded, for example. The council will come into it at the end of the process, when the recommendation to the council is made and the council will accept that recommendation, or it may refer it back. But it would be wrong to have people able to go to the full council half way through the process to pre-empt a carefully structured consultation that is taking place, and a carefully structured decision-making process. It would be disruptive and a recipe for people who understand how to work the system to try to pre-empt decisions in ways that would not be helpful to good decision-making.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="0903182000129"></a>I am totally in favour of democratic decision-making, and of people being involved in decision-making, but where major schemes like this have been put forward&#151;or even small schemes such as what to do about a piece of land in somebody&#146;s back street&#151;when a consultation process is taking place in a proper structured way, it would be completely wrong to allow petitions from people to bypass that and go through this new system. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="0903182000131"></a>I begin by making it clear that the list of issues which are excluded from the duty to respond to petitions should be very limited. We know that building petitions into council decision-making processes will empower people. We therefore want to minimise the issues which are excluded from the duty to respond to petitions, to keep the scope of the duty as broad as possible.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_199"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 199</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90317-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="0903182000132"></a>There are some issues which it makes sense to exclude, such as licensing and planning applications. We intend to do this because we want to avoid setting up parallel routes for considering local people&#146;s concerns. There are already extensive processes for public involvement in planning and licensing applications, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has said, so we do not think that petitions on these subjects need to go through this separate system.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="0903182000133"></a>I have a technical reservation about Amendments 47 and 48. Although these amendments capture the broad aims of our intention, the drafting would need to be longer and more complex than they suggest. For instance, we want to ensure that, in addition to planning applications, planning enforcement and the decision not to enforce would be excluded. I refer noble Lords who would like to see what this extra detail would look like to SI 3261, the Overview and Scrutiny (Reference by Councillors) (Excluded Matters) (England) Order 2008. This order took the same approach for the Councillor Call for Action as we intend to take for petitions. It excludes planning and licensing matters from the scope of the Councillor Call for Action power and is over 30 lines long. Adding these provisions to the Bill would therefore make this chapter substantially longer.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="0903182000134"></a>Amendment 48 contains one additional exclusion: it provides that issues on which the authority is currently carrying out a formal public consultation should be excluded. This is an interesting idea and the rationale is the same as for excluding planning and licensing applications, namely that we do not want to duplicate public engagement processes which already exist. However, I think that further reflection is needed with local government on how such an exclusion might work in practice. For instance, I know that many community groups form petitions precisely to respond to consultations. I wonder if an electronic petition signed by 500 people differs in any real way from 500 separate e-mails sent responding to a consultation, with identical text provided on the website of a community group.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="0903182000135"></a>So I think that we should reflect further on this idea and seek views from the sector. I have a similar worry about Amendment 83, which provides a narrow order-making power so that planning and licensing matters may be excluded from the scope of the topics which trigger a response. It is worth noting here that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not find the order-making powers in the Bill inappropriate. It is our intention to use the order-making power to exclude these issues, and I believe that issues should be excluded only if there is a genuine reason to do so, so that we do not dilute the benefits of these proposals. However, my concern with such a narrow order-making power is that it would not enable us to respond to any new ideas, such as the one that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has put forward, which might be suggested by local authorities themselves in response to consultation.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="0903182000136"></a>These issues need to be thought through in detail, and using secondary legislation will allow us to do that. The Government intend to consult on which issues should be excluded from the duty to respond to petitions after the Bill receives Royal Assent. We intend  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_200"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 200</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to keep exclusions to a minimum, but it is important that the exclusions should be able to respond to the suggestions of local authorities themselves. I therefore ask that Amendments 47, 48 and 83 not be pressed so that we can reflect on these issues in more detail, in collaboration with the sector, and put forward exclusions in secondary legislation which achieve our joint aims.</p>

I am not suggesting in any way that our wording is ideal, so I thank the Minister very much for that answer. His answers are improving as the night goes on. I am not familiar with the overview and scrutiny order to which he referred me but I shall no doubt become familiar with it in the coming days and have a good look at it. I thank him for that. I particularly thank him for the very clear commitment he has given on licensing and planning&#151;that the Government&#146;s intentions are exactly as we have put forward. I think that that was the first time the Government have stated that quite so clearly. That provides at least some justification for our having this discussion.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="0903182000138"></a>On the other issue&#151;general formal consultations&#151;I accept and understand that getting a precise formulation for this is more difficult because it is not referring to existing statutes. It may well be that the scheme will be drawn up so that rather than being excluded, such petitions will be included in the consultations already taking place. &#147;Redirecting&#148; is a more positive word than &#147;exclusion&#148;. However, that is just some thinking off the top of my head which occurred to me while I was listening to the Minister&#146;s very welcome comments. On that basis, I have some pleasure in begging leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We will discover by what process headings of clauses get changed. I attempted to amend this heading in Grand Committee, when I tried to get rid of &#147;valid&#148;, but the Public Bill Office told me that I cannot table an amendment to change a clause heading. However, the process by which the change is made will now occur. How it will happen I am not quite sure. It is probably a bit like how the Conservatives used to choose their leader in the old days.

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="0903182000142"></a>There is only one remaining issue with which I am not happy: the requirement, which was the old paragraph (c), that a petition under Clause 12 has to be signed by at least the specified number of people who live, work or study in the authority&#146;s area. There is a parallel provision somewhere about the number of people who have to sign a petition to have it debated. It seems to us that this provision is still unnecessary and will lead to a lot of problems locally. The worst thing that could happen is that an authority could set the bar too high, so that lots of perfectly reasonable petitions would not qualify to be dealt with in this way.</p>

Just because an authority is big, such as a large city or a large county, does not mean that it does not have small communities, which might want to put forward a petition in which quite low numbers might be appropriate&#151;20, 25 or 30&#151;whereas the authority might say, &#147;We are a big county, or a big city, and we will set the bar at 1,000&#148;, or whatever. It seems to us that this matter should be left to local common sense and not be dealt with through an attempt to lay down arbitrary numbers.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="0903182000144"></a>In Grand Committee, the answer from Ministers was that authorities will be able to set different levels and numbers for different purposes. It is not easy to see how to do this in any sensible way that will not get the barrack-room lawyers really going. The context of the petition is important, as is its purpose. It may be that a petition covers a whole county, but only covers a relatively small number of people who have a particular interest in something. Rock climbers, for example, may be interested in a few crags in the county and petition the county planning department over something in relation to them. It may be people sailing on mill lodges or reservoirs. It may be anything. It may be people who are a special interest group, who are only a few and so widespread that they cannot be related to the communities in which they live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="0903182000145"></a>I have been trying to think of how this could be done since Grand Committee. It is going to be very difficult and I ask the Government to look at this again. We have time left in this House and we have the whole of the House of Commons procedures when the Bill goes there, so they have a chance to do so. They have not got it right yet, so I hope that they will look at it again. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="0903182000146"></a><b><a name="90317-0013.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0903182000349"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> My Lords, I do not think that I can add anything to what I said in Grand Committee on this important clause and on this element of it. In subsection (2), which states that petition schemes must specify the number of signatures of people who live, work and study in a local authority&#146;s area, we intended to free local authorities to decide for themselves what the threshold number of signatures should be. The noble Lord would surely approve of that in principle. When we consulted about this, there was no consensus on what the threshold should be, so this clause allows local flexibility. Some issues are of concern to the whole borough, whereas others are of concern to people in just one street or people from a particular ethnic group or with particular interests. Some authorities already respond to all petitions that they receive. Because we want to minimise bureaucracy, the Government urge those authorities to continue to do so. Other authorities may believe that a higher threshold for the number of signatures is more appropriate&#151;for example, because the population in their area is very high.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="0903182000147"></a>As I said before, principal authorities can set different thresholds for different topics, proportionate to how many people are affected by different issues. The threshold chosen will be in an authority&#146;s scheme, which must be publicised under Clause 11(4). That will ensure that local people know what the threshold is for their area. We do not think that the requirement on authorities is burdensome. It will be open to authorities to take account of the number of signatures that a petition has attracted in deciding on the proportionate response to it. We expect that authorities will set a very low threshold&#151;perhaps less than 10 signatures&#151;for petitions that are guaranteed a response.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="0903182000148"></a>We want to ensure that responding to petitions is not a simple tick-box exercise. That is why we propose that authorities should have to set local thresholds at which petitions will trigger a debate of the full council, which is of course a slightly different issue. A threshold is needed there to ensure that issues of significant concern to the community are debated without overloading the council. These thresholds would be 5 per cent of the local population at most.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="0903182000149"></a>I appreciate that the noble Lord is struggling with the concept of some of the process, but Clause 12 is so important to the whole architecture and purpose of what we are trying to do that I hope that he will not press his attempt to remove it entirely.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="0903182000151"></a>The Minister talked about a threshold. I do not understand how you determine different thresholds for different issues in the same council or even within the same department. An authority might have a threshold for street lighting but there might be a petition from people in one street who want a new street light. In looking at that petition, the authority will have to take into account how many people live in that street. A petition for better lighting on the main road or the local motorway is a different matter altogether and many more people may be required to make up the threshold. If only 10 people come forward, the authority will say that it is less important. Potholes are a topical subject following the winter weather that we have had. There might be five huge potholes in a dead-end street. A petition about that signed by all the residents in that street might have 20 names on it, but people in the rest of the county are not going to sign it.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0903182000152"></a>The point that I am trying to make is that the issues on which people petition are so varied that it is not just the subject of a petition that might be liable to different thresholds but the context&#151;that is, the number of people who can legitimately sign it. I do not think that the concept of thresholds is at all sensible. Thresholds are rigid and councils will have enormous difficulty with them. Those who do not want petitions will set high thresholds, whereas those who are quite happy to deal with petitions will set low ones, which will be meaningless. In a big county or big city, a threshold of 10 for a petition of any kind is meaningless. It indicates that the council will accept everything. Therefore, I believe that the Government have to think again about this. They have time and I hope that they will do so. I have done my bit to try to persuade them to do so, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="0903182000153"></a><b><a name="90317-0013.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="0903182000354"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> My Lords, Amendment 59 picks up any remaining issues in Clause 13. It is, effectively, a stand-part debate on Clause 13. &#147;A requirement to acknowledge valid petitions&#148;&#151;those in Clause 12&#151;is another heading that will have to be changed. I clearly do not want to remove this clause as a whole. The particular issue that I want to raise at this last attempt is in Clause 13(1)(b), which refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="0903182000292"></a>&#147;what the authority has done or proposes to do in response to the petition&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903182000154"></a>It says that the acknowledgement must give information about that.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="0903182000155"></a>In Grand Committee, I tried to rewrite Clauses 13 and 14, in a fairly ambitious way, to get them to make more sense. There are two different issues here. One is the procedural issue of how a petition is dealt with, and one is the substantive issue of what is being dealt with. Take, for example, a petition about potholes. The procedural issue concerns how the petition is received by the council; whether it is accepted under Clause 12; how it is acknowledged; what information people are given about how it will be dealt with; and how it is dealt with. Is it dealt with by an officer or a councillor? Does it go to a particular committee for discussion? Does it go to a joint committee of two authorities for discussion, as it perhaps would on my patch? What happens? That is the procedural side, which people need to know about.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="0903182000156"></a>On the other hand, there is what the council will do about the issue that is referred to in the petition. I call this the substantive issue. Clauses 13 and 14 would be a great deal better if these two responsibilities of the council were dealt with separately in this way. That did not meet with the agreement of the Government when I moved the amendments in Grand Committee. They have done nothing about that. We are left with quite a messy series of detailed rules and regulations, which are difficult to understand, set out in nearly two pages of primary legislation.</p>

<a name="90317-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="0903182000157"></a>I ask the Government to look at these clauses again and try to rewrite them so that they make sense to anybody who picks them up and reads them&#151;or gets a report from their council, setting them out&#151;if and when this legislation is passed. We all understand how it will work now, but it took us quite a long time to sit down, understand it and work it out. I ask the Government to look at separating the procedural responses to petitions from how the substantive matter in the petition is dealt with. They are two separate things, but they are muddled here. I beg to move.</p>

I realise that this is a peg on which he can introduce the argument. I understand that, but we are really dealing here with the nub of a great deal of local people&#146;s disenchantment with the effectiveness or significance of a petition that may have generated a great deal of heat. Noble Lords know the situation. People with whom you discuss a subject will say, &#147;I went to a meeting. I supported something and signed a petition, but nothing happened to it&#148;. What they mean is that it went to the council, which decided not to take action on it. As politicians,  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_205"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we have been accused time after time of failing to do something. The person saying that means, &#147;You have not done what I wanted you to do, even though I am not sure what I wanted. Once you have taken action, I am agin it&#148;.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="0903182000159"></a>Rightly, Clause 13 lays down not merely that it should be acknowledged but that action should be taken on it and that the petitioners, through the voice of the senior petitioner, should be told precisely what action is to be taken. If it falls short of what the petitioners wanted, they have access to their councils and through the press; they will continue their campaign. It is unreasonable to say to the Government and the Minister that in attempting to put together a package that deals with petitions, the answer is to strike out Clauses 13 and 14 and produce a new comprehensive clause that deals with the points. As far as I can see, the Government are on good ground in the proposals in the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, with the best of intentions, is barking up the wrong tree.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="0903182000161"></a>Essentially, the acknowledgement in the subsection is the procedural step set out in Clause 13(7), which tells the petitioner what is the substantive step, as listed in the options in Clause 14. The complication, and why the clause is constructed as it is, is that the acknowledgement may in some instances also be a substantive step, because it may simply say, &#147;Yes, we are happy to do that&#148;, and it will just be done. So it will be responding to a recommended action. That is the simple answer in response to the specific question, but I am happy to write to the noble Lord to give him some further examples if that would help.</p>

<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="0903182000162"></a><b><a name="90317-0014.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0903182000357"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> My Lords, I am grateful for that reply, to which I shall come in a minute. The noble Lord, Lord Graham, is quite right: people put forward petitions and proposals to councils and turn up to council meetings and say, &#147;They did not listen&#148;, when what they mean is, &#147;They listened but they did not agree with us&#148;. I think that he was actually agreeing with what I was saying, although he did not realise it.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="0903182000163"></a>It is very important that people understand two things&#151;this is where the Minister and I completely agree. First, they should understand what will happen to their petition&#151;how it will be dealt with, how it will be discussed, who will decide on it and what processes the petitioners, or perhaps the organiser, can take part in to discuss and debate it with the people who will make the decision. That is perfectly normal procedure in councils that do it well. We do not disagree about that at all.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="0903182000164"></a>Secondly, there is what the council does about the petition and how it decides what to do about it, whether to fill in the potholes or tell people to go to get a bucket and shovel and do it themselves, or whatever. It is true that the first stage&#151;telling people how a petition will be dealt with&#151;may end the matter there. If people are petitioning about a pile of rubbish, the council's operational services, or whatever they are  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_206"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 206</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>called, may simply say, &#147;We will remove it&#148;, and remove it the next day. They may have removed it before the arrival of the letter telling people that it will be removed, in a well ordered situation. There is no problem about that. That is exactly what I tried to set out in the rewrite of the clauses that I tabled for Grand Committee. The noble Lord, Lord Graham, says that it is unreasonable to expect the Government to do that. I would say that I have done that for them; all they have to do is to tweak my amendments and everything will be all right; but I would say that, wouldn&#146;t I?</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="0903182000165"></a>I am not sure that there is any point in the Minister writing to me to tell me how things will work. I think that I understand how things will work. I have spent a lot of time reading the Bill, listening to the Minister and reading her correspondence. We all understand how it will work. My complaint is that Clauses 13 and 14 do not set it out clearly. They are a muddle and ought to be rewritten so that they do set it out clearly. That is my point and I request that the Government look at them during the Bill&#146;s remaining passage through Parliament. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="0903182000172"></a>Subsection (6) was referred to by the Minister in Grand Committee as an &#147;indicative list&#148;. At the risk of sounding like a Minister, that is unnecessary. I would go further and say that it is potentially misleading, even dangerous.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="0903182000173"></a>We discussed lists in Grand Committee. An indicative list always carries a danger as regards what is and is not on it and why. Should any petitioners actually read this Bill when it is enacted, the list will be potentially misleading and dangerous by suggesting to them that if they produce a petition, it might be successful, which would be good news, and that it might be considered at a meeting of the authority, which they would probably expect. The provision goes on to say that the authority could hold an inquiry, or a public meeting, or commission research and so on, which raises all sorts of expectations of what an authority might do. That is completely unnecessary. A local authority can decide to do any, or all, or even none of those things in response, provided that it takes steps in response to the petition as required by subsection (5). If we are to have anything, I prefer Amendment 64 in the name of the Conservatives, which simply says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="0903182000272"></a>&#147;A principal local authority&#146;s petition scheme must secure that appropriate steps are taken in response to the petition&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903182000244"></a>That virtually repeats subsection (5) but at least it is a better catch-all than the indicative list in subsection (6). As I have said, that may give rise to all sorts of expectations from anyone who chooses to look it up and, most importantly, is absolutely unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="0903182000174"></a>In Amendment 65, we accept that if we are to have this indicative list in subsection (6), surely it must be appropriate to include the fact that a local authority is quite likely to be operating executive arrangements and that the petition is more likely to be referred to the appropriate cabinet member or council leader than to a public inquiry or public meeting. Yet the indicative list does not refer to that at all. Perhaps that is another illustration of the danger of lists, particularly indicative

Our intention is not to destroy the clause, or even the chapter, but to accept that, if we are to have it, it should be clearer and more specific and should not include indicative lists that may well be misleading. With the intention of being helpful, I beg to move.</p>

We debated this in Committee, and I am afraid that we disagree about what is to be achieved by this indicative list. I cannot add a huge amount to what I said before. We are doing things in the Bill to make it clear to local people what is served by petitioning their councils for improved services or whatever.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="0903182000176"></a>We included Clause 14(6) to illustrate some of the things&#151;this is not an exhaustive list, by any means&#151;that the authority could do in response to the petition. It certainly does not limit the authority to doing anything. Our thinking was that if legislation for the first time requires local authorities to take action in response to active petitions, it would surely be positively helpful for the legislation to set out a range of actions that might be appropriate, quite simply so that people can see what the intentions of the legislation are in the Bill. The list simply has the legal effect of identifying the nature of the discretion that is being exercised by principal authorities, but it also serves to make it clear to local authorities that the steps that they take in response to petitions should be substantive. That will also be clear to the courts in the event of a legal challenge.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="0903182000177"></a>The noble Lord did not move Amendment 64, although he spoke to it, so I will say simply that it would make it less clear what kind of step it is appropriate to take in response to a petition, and it would give rise to far too many ambiguities. Let me give noble Lords an example of something that might seem appropriate but would not add a great deal to what exists already. That brings me to the issues that Amendment 65 raises.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="0903182000178"></a>Amendment 65 would add to the list in Clause 14(6) that the petition could be referred to the appropriate cabinet member or the council leader. It is an interesting suggestion, and I appreciate the rationale behind it. I know that noble Lords were concerned in Committee that the list should reflect the kind of sensible steps that authorities might want to take when they receive petitions. In fact, the amendment covers exactly the kind of things that local authorities will do when they receive a petition. The cabinet member and the council leader are both well placed to act on the petition. They have the power to make the request in the petition a reality, to launch a public consultation or an inquiry, or to hold a public meeting. That illustrates the key difference between the items listed in Clause 14(6) and Amendment 65. The items in Clause 14(6) are all public actions which citizens can see have been taken in response to their petition.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="0903182000179"></a>I really do understand the intentions behind Amendment 65, but I have a real fear that if this were added to Clause 14(6) it would give the impression that a council would have fulfilled its duties if it referred a petition to a cabinet member, notwithstanding

That is because it is essentially an internal process, one for authorities to go through before deciding how they will respond to the petition: whether they will do what it asks for or follow through on any other steps. I am reluctant to add internal management processes on to the face of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="0903182000180"></a>One suggestion in Clause 14 is for a similar &#147;internal process&#148;, and it is there for a good reason. It enables petitions that address the provision of health services in the council&#146;s area to be properly directed to the overview and scrutiny committee, which has powers to scrutinise such matters. What we want to ensure, and what Clause 14(6) sets out, is the range of actions that might help resolve the issues raised by the petition. Petitioners could be invited to attend a public meeting or a cabinet member might want to commission some research to get a better understanding of the issue raised. Essentially, it is about a substantive response. As I have said, referring a petition to a cabinet member or council leader would be a necessary step, but would not be sufficient. It would indeed mean legislating to preserve the status quo.</p>

The suggestion that petitions with a higher threshold would have a status that enabled the petition organiser to require a debate in full council is not appropriate. Different councils debate things and do things in different ways. For example, in some councils, the appropriate place to discuss a petition is the area committee and taking the petition to the full council would not be appropriate if it is about something that occurs in a specific area, therefore the procedure under this legislation would probably be contrary to the council&#146;s standing orders.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="0903182000184"></a>The question of how petitions are dealt with and which body should debate them should be subject to local flexibility depending on the interests of the petitioners and the particular structures and institutions of a  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_210"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 210</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>council. For example, in a large county council, people may want a petition to be debated in one of its area committees. Again I refer to my own county of Lancashire. People might not want a petition to be debated at a full county council meeting in Preston that might not happen for another two or three months when it could be debated at one of the Lancashire locals. These are joint committees of the county and the district which exist in each of the districts. That is just one example of what might be a more appropriate structure for debating the petition.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="0903182000185"></a>Once again the Government are trying to put all councils into the same straitjacket. They have been doing it for over 10 years and it is not something we approve of, but in this instance it is not a sensible proposal. Most councils have a procedure whereby members of the council can put down motions to full council. In some it may require just one councillor, but in others it may need two, three or four councillors. However, by and large, the procedure by which a matter can be debated in full council is by one councillor proposing it. That is the normal, democratic procedure and a councillor representing an area and its residents can do that. It would not be appropriate to have some kind of system which bypasses the normal council structures. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="0903182000186"></a><b><a name="90317-0014.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="0903182000370"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> My Lords, I am afraid that, again, this is something on which the noble Lord and I disagree in principle. This is an important provision which gives members of the public real influence over the issues which their elected representatives discuss. I bow to the noble Lord&#146;s experience but, because Clause 15 requires the principal local authorities to specify a threshold number of signatures which would give an automatic right for the matter raised in the petition to be debated by the full council, this will mean that members of the public will be able to put an item on to the agenda of local decision makers. Members of the public will be able to observe the debates and will know that all ward councillors can have their say on the petition. It is a genuine benefit.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="0903182000187"></a>We believe that the threshold should be high enough to ensure that full council meetings are not overwhelmed and that they have time to consider issues such as the authority&#146;s budget, but the threshold should be achievable. The national authority has the power to issue guidance as to the appropriate threshold figure, to specify by order a threshold figure that will apply to all principal authorities, or to direct a principal authority to amend its petition scheme, including the threshold specified in it, but in order to ensure that debates are held when a substantial number of people sign a petition we believe that the threshold should not be higher than 5 per cent of the population living within the local authority area. That is what we will put in our order-making power but it is very much the upper limit.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="0903182000188"></a>I return to my main argument that it is an important way forward for local communities to know that if sufficient people are concerned about an issue they will be heard and the matter will be debated by the full council. Of course, in practice, a council puts items on its agenda for full debate under different influences and for different reasons, and this additional right will be welcomed by local communities.</p>

I am sorry to say that but I really do believe it. It undermines representative democracy and the role of councillors as the people who take issues forward on behalf of their resident constituents.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="0903182000190"></a>The Minister said that people have a right to be heard. I could not agree more. I would not object if the Government came back with a statutory right for people who have an interest in an issue to be heard by the body that makes the decision, the council committee. I have been on councils that have been doing that for many years. People should have the right to be heard at the point of decision making, but a full council is not an appropriate place to have that debate. It may or may not allow the petitioners to speak and put forward their views but, because there are so many people there, the whole process is so formal that, usually and often, it is not the appropriate place to end the process.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="0903182000191"></a>Many councils already include a right in their standing orders for petitions to be received. If the right contained in this legislation is retained, people may regard this threshold as the point at which that right is triggered and existing rights may be removed. At the moment, that is the first part of the process when a petition comes in. People give notice that they want to present it to the council; they stand up and perhaps say a few words&#151;or not, depending on the standing orders&#151;then hand it in. It then goes through the process of being properly debated by the appropriate people in the council, which is when people have the opportunity to see the decision being taken in a democratic way. Full council as the end process is no good; by that time, decisions will have been made, whips will be on and the decision will be known before the meeting starts. If you take a petition to a council meeting at the start of the process, the whole thing is much more open and it can go to places where people will not have closed minds. The Government have got it the wrong way round. I am not against people presenting petitions to full councils or any other body, but the Government are being too rigid and prescriptive, and are likely to exclude people who can present petitions at the moment.</p>

<a name="90317-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="0903182000192"></a>It is clear to me that consideration of these matters has not finished. I will be astonished if further amendments are not put to the Bill before it gets through Parliament, particularly in the House of Commons. I put forward these thoughts in a hopeful and constructive way. We are not trying to block this at all&#151;we are on the same side as the Government in what we want to see&#151;but we are worried about the way it is being done.

Before I get to the meat of the issue, perhaps I may make a rather more general remark or two. I find myself frequently in meetings where we talk about devolution, decentralisation and the shift of power from the centre to local authorities and to community organisations. It is great to be part of those discussions and to feel that that mood is a cross-party consensus view shared by Members of this House. At the same time, though, one is always anxious that local authorities just do not command the kind of local support and respect that that decentralisation, that move to devolution, implies.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="0903182000194"></a>The Bill is necessary. It promotes local democracy, tries out some new things and does some things differently, brings in petitions and attempts to find new ways of engaging people. We cannot feel complacent that everyone is comfortable with the way in which local authorities operate. This is about restoring people&#146;s faith in local government, increasing their confidence and involving more local people in the processes. My amendments are but a small part of a much bigger picture in which the trade-off for the political consensus about devolution is that there must be some change and some things being done that make a difference to how people feel involved and engaged in local processes.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="0903182000195"></a>The amendments relate to councils&#146; overview and scrutiny functions following valid petitions. They extend the arrangements for holding officers to account from just a council&#146;s own staff to appropriate officers from partner organisations that operate in that council&#146;s area. I am grateful to the Local Government Association for preparing these amendments, which are intended to strengthen the accountability to the community of all local public officers while ensuring that the democratically elected council is at the heart of this process.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="0903182000196"></a>In Committee, there were some crossed wires, leading to clarification from the Minister that Clause 16 was not about public meetings that could turn into kangaroo courts where lowly officers were publicly pilloried by an angry mob. No, the holding of officers to account relates just to coming before and giving evidence to overview and scrutiny committees meeting in public. So, too, of course, does the proposal in these amendments for extending the list of individuals covered. The senior officers who would be covered by these amendments could come from the primary care trusts, police authorities, waste disposal authorities and others.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="0903182000197"></a>Select Committees of this House and another place summon civil servants and officers of public bodies, as well as their political masters. This has enhanced public scrutiny and shed light on public service provision. At the local level, holding officers to account from a range of local public bodies has similar merit. Indeed, since local authorities are being obliged to promote the work of such bodies and the public may, however

I understand very well what he is trying to achieve and I think that there is a good case for it in many respects, as many of the bodies to which he is referring do not have the same open, democratic accountability as do local authorities. The problem that we have is one of principle&#151;a quite strongly held principle&#151;which is that members, whether they are Members of Parliament of members of local authorities, are the ones who are accountable. It is a firm principle. In Committee, my noble friend Lord Greaves was corrected by the Minister when he made some perhaps injudicious remarks about civil servants. The Minister explained quite clearly and rightly that it is the Ministers who are responsible and that, if we wish to cast blame or aspersions, we do so on the Ministers, not on the officials who support them.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="0903182000199"></a>The same principle applies in local government: it is the officers who advise and support the members. Throughout my 35 years in local government, members have always called on and expected officers to be at committee meetings&#151;overview and scrutiny, as it is now&#151;to be questioned by councillors. But it is still the councillors who are responsible to the electorate for what is done and what is said. Those meetings, where councillors question officers, sometimes robustly, are held in public; the public and petitioners can hear it. But it is still the members who are responsible. I see the Minister nodding in agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="0903182000200"></a>This clause, which the noble Lord seeks to extend, for reasons that I understand and sympathise with, breaches that principle. If this were to go ahead, I certainly think that it should apply beyond simply local authority officers. However, it is the principle that is wrong and, if the principle is wrong, the amendments to extend that principle must be equally wrong.

<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="0903182000203"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Best, did a superb job in explaining what Clause 16 is all about. He demolished the argument that we were somehow creating a kangaroo court in order to pillory junior members of authority staff&#151;not at all. However, I should like to postpone discussion of this until the next group of amendments.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="0903182000204"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s amendments start from the position that the requirements in Clause 16 are important; they would extend them in a bid to strengthen local authorities&#146; ability to act as advocates for their local communities. I welcome the fact that in principle the noble Lord, Lord Tope, accepts that. I welcome his focus, and that of the noble Lord, Lord Best, on the empowerment benefits that this could bring citizens. The noble Lord, Lord Best, described this as creating a more equitable and accountable arrangement. However, I do not think that the amendments would deliver quite what he is looking for.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="0903182000205"></a>Amendment 71 would apply Clause 16 to petitions that requested that a local authority officer or a relevant person from any of the range of connected authorities listed in Clause 2 attend a public meeting of the local authority. Those organisations include parish councils, police authorities, primary care trusts, NHS trusts, the National Offender Management Service or the governing body of a maintained school. The exception is the Homes and Communities Agency, which is listed in Clause 2 but which Amendment 71 would not include.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="0903182000206"></a>As I said, I have considerable sympathy with the intention behind the amendments. I appreciate their aim and I think that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, who is not in his place, would do so, too. He noted in Committee that local authorities sometimes find themselves bearing the brunt of their constituents&#146; ire in relation to decisions made by other public bodies over which the authority has no control. So the amendments are intended to give local authorities the ability to investigate such issues where they are raised by petitioners. Local authorities would be expected to require a relevant person from the organisation in question to attend a meeting of the overview and scrutiny committee and give evidence.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="0903182000207"></a>The reason why I say that the amendments as drafted may not achieve their aims is that overview and scrutiny committees can request that anyone attend their meetings and give evidence, but they have powers only to require officers of their own local authority or, in relation to health matters, an NHS body to do so. The amendments would place a requirement on principal local authorities that they would have no powers to meet if other bodies refused to co-operate.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="0903182000208"></a>I know that noble Lords opposite have expressed concern about the principles behind Clause 16, and we will come to those in the next group of amendments. They may be relieved to hear me sound a note of caution. I firmly believe that it is right for local people to be able to influence the way in which O&amp;S committees hold the executive of a local authority to account. As I said, I am sympathetic to the amendments, but we have heard genuine concerns from noble Lords about the impact of the proposals in general, including the ability of O&amp;S committees to manage their workloads. This should not prevent us from moving forward with measures that will genuinely empower citizens, but it is

<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="0903182000209"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Best, will understand those concerns and why I cannot support Amendments 71 to 75, but I commend him for bringing them forward. I hope that he will agree to withdraw Amendment 71.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="0903182000217"></a>Amendment 82 has been called and I am moving it. It seeks to remove the power of the appropriate national authority, which is presumably the Secretary of State in England, to determine in effect what a local authority&#146;s petition scheme should or should not contain. Amendment 84 similarly seeks to weaken that provision. Throughout this discussion we have heard that the Government want to adopt a light-touch approach and that they do not wish to inhibit what local authorities do with their petition schemes beyond the most minimal requirements set out in the Bill. Therefore, it seems entirely unnecessary to us to have these reserve provisions, as it were, which allow the Secretary of State, or the appropriate national authority, to overrule what a local authority has determined, which must comply with the law. I have expressed my reservations and concerns about the guidance that we have not yet seen. The Minister aspires to it being light touch, yet Clause 19(4) says that the guidance,</p>
<ul><a name="0903182000295"></a>&#147;may include a model petition scheme&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903182000246"></a>The guidance could include a model petition scheme whether or not the relevant subsection is included in the Bill. Putting it in the Bill just reaffirms our concern that the guidance may not be as light touch as we are told. I would be reassured if that subsection were taken out, although I shall not be fully reassured until we see the guidance. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="0903182000219"></a>I remind the House that Clause 19(1) provides a power for the appropriate national authority to make orders about what should be in petition schemes, and what should not be in them. This power will be used

Clause 19(3) sets out particular issues which these orders cover. Amendment 82 removes the power for the appropriate national authority to make these orders and Amendment 84 is consequential.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="0903182000220"></a>I have listened carefully to noble Lords and I appreciate that they have concerns about this power. I want to offer some reassurance. I am receiving notes because my draft has numbers of amendments deriving from some weeks ago so I shall have to cross-reference. The provision in Clause 19(1) is a fairly typical reserve power which has been scrutinised with the rest of the provisions in Clause 19 by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. Clearly, the committee is expert in this matter and it is always quick to alert the House to any unusual or excessive delegation of powers. The DPRRC considered those provisions to be acceptable for good reason because they are standard practice. I can assure noble Lords that there is nothing sinister or unusual in their inclusion here.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="0903182000221"></a>We have been clear from the very start about our intentions in relation to Clause 19(1). Quite simply, our plans are to use this power to set a maximum threshold for the number of signatures required on a petition for it to trigger a debate of the full council. The proposal to have a maximum threshold of 5 per cent of the local population is an important one. It is unique. If we are to raise the profile of petitions as a mechanism to encourage people to influence local councils, it is obviously essential to have a sensible figure. If the power to fix such limits is not to be included in subordinate legislation, it would have to be in the Bill. I have listened to noble Lords telling me how much this Bill is overdetailed and I am not persuaded that adding a technical detail is a good idea. What happens if the figure we propose turns out not to be appropriate?</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="0903182000222"></a>Outside the proposal to set a maximum threshold for triggering a debate of the full council, we are committed to keeping this power as a reserve to be exercised only where consultation with the sector or evidence indicates it is necessary; that is to say, if there is a clear need to act to ensure a minimum set of standards for citizens. I make this commitment again because it is important and puts the provision in perspective. Noble Lords might ask, if that is the case, why take the power at all? The first answer is simple: we are committed to ensuring that local authorities take seriously the petitions they receive, and this power clearly indicates that we are prepared to act if evidence shows that local authorities are not creating schemes which are accessible, effective and meet expectations.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="0903182000223"></a>This is not uncommon; for example, a similar provision is contained in the power of the well-being regime in the Local Government Act 2000. The principle of giving discretion to local authorities with scope to intervene if necessary, in this case enabling local authorities to set out their petition scheme but taking a power to step in should those schemes not be sensible and effective is, therefore, not a new one. In the case of the well-being regime, we have never exercised the power  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_218"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column 218</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in question and have no present intention of doing so. We hope that, in the case of petitions, the existence of the power will ensure that it does not need to be used.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="0903182000224"></a>The second answer is that we recognise that legislation is not always a precise science. Situations change, evidence emerges and some things are simply too detailed to put into the Bill. We all agree that secondary legislation is there for a purpose. Continually overseeing minor amendments to primary legislation is not a good use of parliamentary time. I hope I have reassured the noble Lord of the principle behind the provision in subsection (1) and that he will consider withdrawing Amendment 82.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="0903182000225"></a>Amendment 85 removes subsection (6) from Clause 19. This provision permits the appropriate national authority to direct a principal local authority to amend its petition scheme if an authority were to set an inappropriately high threshold for the number of signatures required to receive a response to a petition. In this instance, the appropriate national authority could make a targeted intervention without the need to exercise the order-making power and require an authority to set a lower threshold. That would avoid disruption to other principal authorities which were operating effective schemes.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="0903182000226"></a>Noble Lords are perhaps concerned that this provision is somehow part of a government job-creation scheme, and I take their concern to be that there will be staff dedicated to monitoring petition schemes on a daily basis. That is not the intention and it will not be the case. As I mentioned in Grand Committee in our discussion of impact assessments, the Government are committed to reviewing the impact of all policies, and the petitions requirements in this chapter are no exception. We are committed to carrying out a review of the petitions duty within three years of implementation, and because the requirements set out in the Bill put an emphasis on local authorities making their decision-making processes more transparent, including providing clear and accessible information on their website, a use of disproportionate staff resource will not be required.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="0903182000227"></a>In summary, I assure noble Lords that this power of intervention would not be used other than in extremis, if at all, and certainly not without good evidence that the local authority in question was failing to uphold the requirements set out in this chapter. Should such an instance occur, nothing would happen without prior communication with the authority in question. The provision makes it clear that we are committed to ensuring that standards everywhere can be raised to those of the best, so that people can be confident that their concerns will be taken seriously no matter where they live. Where one or two local authorities fail to meet those standards, the provision confirms that we are not in the business of disrupting the good practice of the rest; instead, we will take action in relation to those few.</p>

<a name="90317-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="0903182000228"></a>I hope that the noble Lord is content with that explanation and that he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="90317-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="0903182000230"></a>In a sense, the Minister is saying that, in the end, the Government do not trust local authorities. I understand the desire to bring everyone up to the best standards, as the Minister said, but that will never be achieved, because by definition if you are best, you are better than everyone else. We all want to improve standards. I perhaps have greater faith in local government than the drafters of the Bill do, because although not all local authorities will operate the petitions process as well as others&#151;that will always be the case&#151;generally authorities will want to do this well and many are doing it already. They will want to make it work, and that will happen. I hope that the Minister is right in her reassurances that it is very unlikely that these provisions will ever be used. We all join in hoping that. If they are, the intentions of the legislation will have failed, and none of us wants that to happen. I will of course beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The DPRRC agreed that the negative resolution procedure is appropriate for any orders extending petitions provisions to the other bodies listed in Clause 20(2). Parish councils are often at the heart of local communities and deliver services which communities care strongly about. It is, therefore, right and proper that local people should be able to raise their concerns with their parish council, and we will work closely with the sector to develop the most appropriate way that people can do this through petitions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="0903182000232"></a>I confirm that we have no current intention to apply a petitions duty to all local authorities included in the list in Clause 20(2).

I hope the noble Lords will welcome this amendment, which I commend to the House.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000005"></a>I shall speak to Amendments 123 and 124 in the name of my noble friend Lord Howe. Sadly, the Committee is denied his customary elegance, but I shall do my best. Clause 32 provides for disclosure of information by HMRC to enable the Department of Health to collect statistical data about the earnings and expenses of GPs and dentists. I understand that this type of data gathering has been carried out annually over a number of years, but it appears that since 2005 the disclosure of this particular information by HMRC has been technically illegal, which is why matters need to be regularised by means of this clause.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000006"></a>I have no difficulty with the principle of what is proposed. Subsection (4) specifies that the information that is disclosed has to be in a form which does not,</p>
<ul><a name="09031768000121"></a>&#147;enable information relating to a particular person to be ascertained from it&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031768000096"></a>The Explanatory Notes say that this means that the information has to be presented as an anonymised summary of earnings and expenses, and will not extend to matters unconnected with doctors&#146; and dentists&#146; professional activities.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC36"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000007"></a>The trouble is that the clause does not quite say that. It says that the information has to be presented,</p>
<ul><a name="09031768000122"></a>&#147;in the form of a summary or collection of information so framed as not to enable information relating to a particular person to be ascertained from it&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031768000097"></a>Taken literally, that could apply for the disclosure of identifiable information relating to a specific GP practice with more than one partner. You would not be able to ascertain the income of one individual, but you would be able to ascertain the income and expenses of the partnership.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000008"></a>The wording of the clause is not as tight as I would like to see it. It does not amount to a guarantee that all information will be anonymised. One could, for example, envisage a summary of information covering a particular town or area of the country. As I read it, such a summary could still, strictly speaking, be legally disclosed within the terms of this clause. When we talk about an anonymised summary, we tend to think of a brief resum&#233; of aggregated data. But a summary could be much more elaborate than that. You could have an anonymised summary which showed clearly how doctors&#146; income varied between rural and urban areas, between the north and south of the country and whether they were dispensing or non-dispensing practitioners and so on. You could also have a summary which made it quite clear that the range was between the highest and the lowest levels of net income enjoyed by GPs&#151;in other words, not just an average or mean. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us what precise form these summaries usually take.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000009"></a>Equally, nothing in the clause reflects the assurance contained in the Explanatory Notes that only information relating to doctors&#146; and dentists&#146; professional activities may be passed to the Department of Health. The wording of subsection (2) could allow the Department of Health to be given data about unearned as well as earned income. Again, the drafting is, to my mind, uncomfortably loose. It could be taken to allow the department to gather information for purposes other than the annual earnings and expenses inquiry. I appreciate that Clause 32 is meant to do no more than consolidate existing arrangements. I have no doubt that the Minister will assure me that there is no intention to go beyond those arrangements. Nevertheless. I argue that we could perhaps do better as regards the way in which the provision is framed. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09031768000010"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09031768000133"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b><b></b>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, for her kind words; I will ensure that my noble friend receives them and those of the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege.

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000011"></a>I will address the amendments together. Amendment 123 seeks to limit Clause 32 so that it relates only to the income or expenses of dentists or GPs in respect of their professional activities. The GP earnings and expenses inquiry and the dental earnings and expenses inquiry draw on the anonymised and aggregated analyses that the HMRC transfers to the NHS information centre for health and social care. The resulting reports are intended to provide single, trusted sources of information on GP earnings and expenses and dental practitioner earnings and expenses that can be relied upon by the four UK health  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC37"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>departments, the British Medical Association and British Dental Association. It is worth noting that my officials have been in discussion with the British Medical Association and the British Dental Association about these matters. Both organisations are closely involved in the production of the inquiries and agree that it is vital that they continue.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000012"></a>I completely agree with the noble Baroness&#146;s sentiments that it is in no one&#146;s interest to use HMRC data for GPs and dental practitioners that are unconnected with their professional activities. Having said that, this is a rather complex area and I hope that noble Lords will bear with me while I explain further. As noble Lords know, GPs can be contractors or salaried employees. Where GPs operate solely as contractors, the relevant data would be unaffected by the proposed amendment. However, where a GP draws a salary of any kind it is not possible, from analysis of the tax data, to unambiguously confirm that the recorded employment earnings of GPs relate to professional medical activities. This is because the tax data that the HMRC analyses record the business of the employer but not the occupation of individual employees, as this information is not needed to calculate tax liability.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000013"></a>Given that it is impossible, in practice, to have certainty in this regard, the income of all salaried GPs could be ruled out of the analysis by the proposed amendment. This would be highly undesirable given the large increase in the number of salaried GPs over recent years from 3,117 in 2003 to 7,246 in 2007.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000014"></a>The amendment seeks to insert a safeguard into the process, and I would like to reassure noble Lords that the most important safeguard is that the data in question must be anonymised and aggregated. Also, the whole process is overseen by a group known as the Technical Steering Committee. The membership of the committee includes representatives from the four UK health departments and the British Medical Association. They are of the view that the data in question are a necessary part of the inquiry. I hope that that reassures the noble Baroness and that she will feel able to withdraw this amendment.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000015"></a>I turn to the second amendment in this group. Amendment 124 would prevent the HMRC from sharing analyses from which information relating to a group of persons can be ascertained. I appreciate the intention of the amendment&#151;that we should seek to preserve taxpayer confidentiality to the greatest possible extent.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000016"></a>In the reports, the earnings and expenses are analysed through a range of groupings that are useful both to the Government and the professions. For example, the GP inquiry breaks down overall GPs by contract type, by country within the United Kingdom and by employment status. This highlights the difficulties that are faced when one tries to find an appropriate level of safeguard, and why the Government have decided that the most appropriate safeguard operates at an individual level.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000017"></a>Let us be clear on precisely what the clause as currently drafted permits. It is not enough for the information simply to be anonymised. The HMRC must also bring the anonymised data together at an  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC38"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC38</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>aggregated level, and only then may it disclose the summarised information to the NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000018"></a>The current practice is for HMRC not to release aggregated, anonymised statistics based on less than 30 cases. This figure would be increased if statistics were thought to be potentially disclosive at, for example, practice level; that is, when there are large practices. The safeguards mean that there is no possibility whatever of any individual being identified from the data disclosed. Nor is there any possibility of a particular GP&#146;s practice being identified because aggregation is done in a way which cuts across individual practices and protects against that disclosure risk. For these reasons, I hope that the noble Baroness will not press her amendments.</p>

Perhaps she would write in that case to my noble friend and to me. How is the information stored? Who precisely has access to it? Can she give us an assurance that protocols are in place to prevent the information leaking?

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000023"></a>I shall start with two cases that outline the need for the amendment. Rachel Leake was registered on the transplant waiting list because of renal failure. Her daughter, Laura Ashworth, was on the organ donor register and had said that she wished to donate her kidney to her mum. Tragically, Laura died of a severe asthma attack, leaving her two year-old daughter orphaned, with her mother, who was on dialysis, to care for her. Laura&#146;s organs were donated to three patients in the UK who were on the transplant waiting list, and consideration of donation to her mother was rejected, even though, in life, she had expressed a wish to donate and was even considering being a live donor. There was wide publicity about and outrage at our system that prevented a mother receiving an organ from her deceased daughter even though it was her daughter&#146;s wish. Interestingly, if Laura had begun the live donor process, her wishes might have been respected, because we have different criteria for live and for dead donors.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000024"></a>I shall tell the Committee about another case that had no publicity. A young man collapsed in the gym and was taken to hospital and into intensive care, where it was discovered that he had suffered a subarachnoid haemorrhage and was declared brain dead. The family was contacted. At that point, it was revealed that his father had died three months previously. His mother said that her other child was on the liver transplant waiting list and understandably asked whether the liver of the child who had been fit and well but was now dead could be considered for transplant to the child who was already on the organ donor transplant waiting list. She was told no.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000025"></a>This woman had lost just about everything. She had lost her husband and her well son; she was losing her already ill son; and the little ray of hope that might have come from this tragedy was being put out.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000026"></a>What does my amendment do? I should say, our amendment; I am grateful to other noble Lords who have put their name to this. It will allow a family member or close friend who is already on the transplant waiting list to be considered in the cross-match process for organ donation, if the family represent the deceased person&#146;s wishes to donate an organ to that specific person. This amendment on preferential organ donation would also have to consider the suitability of the organ and, of course, the appropriateness of the cross-match process, as well as the needs of other patients on the waiting list. This is not directed donation. The family of the deceased cannot direct where the organ goes.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000027"></a>We have an increasing problem in this country. The need for organs outstrips the supply. In 1954, the first kidney transplant was a revolutionary and complex treatment for organ failure; today, transplantation is the standard and preferred treatment for organ failure. Organ transplantation is cost-effective; the average yearly cost of dialysis is more than &#163;30,000, while the cost of a kidney transplant is around &#163;17,500. Let us not forget that the closer the tissue match, the lower the risk of rejection&#151;so in related donors your chance of that organ lasting longer is much greater.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC40"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000028"></a>Today there are 7,877 people on the organ donation waiting list, increasing at a rate of about 8 per cent a year. Last year, 1,000 people died waiting for an organ or after being too ill to withstand transplant. Such is the shortage of organ donors that this morning I had to amend my figures because, since last Thursday when I originally expected to speak, a further 30 people have been added to the waiting list for organs.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000029"></a>I consulted widely on this amendment, including with Professor James Neuberger of NHS Blood and Transplant, the British Kidney Patient Association, the British Organ Donor Society and Professor Nadey Hakim, who was the world president of the International College of Surgeons, and others. All have been sympathetic to my amendment. The Minister kindly met me to discuss this amendment, and I thank her and the Department of Health most sincerely for those helpful meetings. She has also written to me, and I shall try to address some points in her letter. Before I do that, I should say two things very clearly. First, I reiterate that this is not directed donation and, secondly, it is not presumed consent.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000030"></a>The current law seems to conflict with the spirit of the Mental Capacity Act guidance, which requires staff, when appropriate, to respect an advance statement of wishes and the processes for live donors and dead donors are at variance. That variance seems to be incompatible with the spirit of the Mental Capacity Act. In the helpful letter that I received from the Minister, she pointed out that the amendment recognises the need to ensure that others in urgent clinical need of an organ are not harmed, such as patients registered on the urgent heart scheme, liver patients registered as &#147;super-urgent&#148; and renal patients identified as highly sensitised. The amendment does not exclude any of those people from prioritisation.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000031"></a>It is important to recognise that there is no objective test of prognosis, however. Some patients are put on the list late because the list is too long, so time on the list itself does not correlate to clinical need; it is only when you get very close to death that the prioritisation can be said to hold a degree of accuracy.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000032"></a>Following a death, the family give or withhold consent for organ donation and that consent can subsequently be withdrawn. Consent becomes irreversible probably at the point of knife to skin of the recipient&#146;s operation, although there is some dispute about it. It seems as if there has been one case in which it was deemed to be irreversible form the time when the organs were taken out of the donor&#146;s body, so they were not repatriated. There does not seem to be a clear statement anywhere as to the point of irreversibility to withdraw consent.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000033"></a>The Minister&#146;s letter refers to &#147;guidance&#148; being needed, but rarely do we have sight of guidance before we legislate. It usually comes later, so I humbly suggest that the guidance and details of this could be written once the principle outlined in the amendment has been accepted. The letter also stresses the need for this to be &#147;closely monitored&#148;, but monitoring procedures are already in place through the Human Tissue Authority, and all steps of the transplant process are registered subject to audit, evaluation and reporting, The devolved  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC41"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>nations must be consulted and I hope that the Minister can tell us that this has happened and will inform the Committee of their response.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000034"></a>Let me explain the practicalities of the amendment. A family is told of the reality of their loved-one&#146;s death, and after brain-stem death consents to organ donation. The family says that there is a brother, sister or whoever already on the organ transplant list and that the person who has died expressed a wish to donate to that person in the event of death. The transplant team would explain that this relative could be considered along with others but that there was no guarantee because it will depend on the cross-match and the state of the organ, but that everyone will be kept informed. If another patient is moribund and in desperate need of that organ it would be discussed with the family, and if the family still consents to donate, the organ will be given on clinical need. It will be noted on the clinical record of the relative who did not receive the organ so that the family will still get something in return for their gift. The name of the person who did not receive the organ would be asterisked as having been closely in the frame but superseded on clinical need.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000035"></a>Such situations would be rare but should help all groups in our population to understand that we want to support organ donation as giving the gift of life, not raiding their loved-one&#146;s body for organs. Many people want to give the gift of life in the event of a tragedy. If they have another family member or close friend who is awaiting transplant is it right that their expressed wishes should be rejected outright, as at present? Currently families lose someone only to find that they cannot gain some good from that death by donating an organ to another loved one who is dying from the lack of a transplant. I should point out that donors often donate several organs, so it is only one that will go to the person who is named by the family. The other organs would go into the pool. It would be helpful if we could drive up donation rates.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000036"></a>The Minister concluded in her letter that the Department of Health was actively considering a change in policy and saw real merit in the proposal. The amendment reintroduces discretion and compassion to clinical decisions for a family faced with the tragedy of a dead loved one who, through that death, has become a potential donor. On concerns that placing this in primary legislation might be too blunt an instrument, I can only say that death is a pretty blunt instrument, so how long will we have to wait and what will be the mechanisms to implement the change needed? If it is not primary legislation what will bring about the changes that we need to push up donation rates? If more detailed guidance is needed, who will write it and when? Will the Committee be informed when this has happened and how?</p>

<a name="90317-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000037"></a>The clinical community to whom I have spoken feel that it needs the discretion that this amendment would give. That community wants to know what will happen if the same situation arises at a weekend, or even next weekend. The organ donation situation is dire and cannot wait any longer. There have been enough committee reports.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000038"></a>There is some important history. A family wanted the organ to go to only one ethnic group, which was deemed to be contrary to race relations. It was from that case that the decision was made that a family could not express any wish at all. I wonder whether that was gold-plating on a decision, with which I agree, that no one should be able to specify one ethnic group. A few other cases similar to the one that I outlined earlier have appeared over the years and have been referred to the transplant authority. Anecdotally it seems that compassionate decisions have been made and have not gone down the hard line, but the trouble is that it depends on whose watch such decisions are made. The key is the interpretation of any guidance. I suggest that people have become inappropriately rigid because no guidance can allow for every eventuality, but we must respect the wishes of the person who has died. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09031768000039"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09031768000139"></a>Baroness Golding:</b><b></b>I strongly support this amendment. When the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, spoke to me about it, it reminded me that when my daughter had kidney failure, the young daughter of one of her best friends immediately asked whether she could be matched to see whether one of her kidneys could help my daughter. People need to be able to do something when a close friend or relative is ill and they feel helpless. This would help the living. This amendment should be strongly considered. Unfortunately, we seem to be no closer to presumed consent and, until that day comes, every little helps to enable people on the waiting list to say that when they die, they want to be able to do something to help their remaining family and people who are in dire need. This amendment should be given strong consideration.</p>

I do not believe that there is any issue relevant to this amendment that she failed to mention when moving it so persuasively. This is a permissive amendment, and I cannot see any way in which the Government could feel that it is contrary to existing government policy. Subsection (1)(b) states that if:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031768000108"></a>&#147;D had expressed a wish, or the family of D had expressed a wish ... that a particular organ or organs ... should be considered for transplant&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031768000098"></a>It does not state that it must be given to that individual. Subsection (2) states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09031768000123"></a>&#147;the suitability of D&#146;s organ or organs for transplant to R, and ... the needs of other patients waiting for an organ transplant&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09031768000099"></a>should be considered. The amendment is permissive, but so persuasive that it is crucial to see it in the Bill. I strongly support it.</p>

I wish to add my support for the amendment and to make one point about its wording. Noble Lords will know, because I have spoken about it before, about the experience of my friends who lost their only child at the age of 15 due to a brain haemorrhage. They managed to get through an unimaginable tragedy by dint of the support of their family, their faith and the knowledge that because of their decisions, donations from Daryl&#146;s body helped, they think, at least 25 other young people.  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC43"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It was particularly important for them, and they subsequently took part in a project with the Department of Health called, I think, &#147;Patient Voices&#148;, to encourage people from minority communities to become donors. There is a lack of organs from particular minority communities. For biological reasons, it is important that people from minority communities receive compatible organs and tissue.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000042"></a>The second reason why I support this amendment is because it does what the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, said it does. It takes the point established in the Mental Capacity Act about people being able to make an advance statement of their wishes and have it respected. That is the key to this. In this House, we have had repeated arguments about presumed consent. Whatever one&#146;s view of that, where somebody has made an indication of his wishes, it is important that it is observed. The only point that I would make on that is that I suspect the Minister might seek to turn down the amendment on the basis of the wording. If it could be reworded to have as strict conditions for the notification of consent as is the case in the Mental Capacity Act&#151;for example, that the consent must be recorded in writing&#151;I would be happy with that.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000043"></a>Having said that, I echo the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay: what more do people want who wish to increase the number of organs that are available for transplant but who wish to do so within a framework that understands the ethical considerations and objections that some people have? When are we going to move forward on this? We seem to be running out of options, and the situation simply gets worse. When we know that so many people want to do this, it is, frankly, perplexing.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000045"></a>I want to take up the ethical issue, which the noble Baroness has raised, and I plead again that we discover the right way in which this amendment can be so expressed that the ethical fears are dealt with. It seems to me that there is no basic ethical objection to everything that has been spoken about in Committee this afternoon. Therefore, we need to be able to find the right way of wording this so that it will not be subject to ethical criticism. I am sure that we can do that, and I very much hope that we shall be able to do so with this amendment.</p>

I regard this body of mine as being mine in life and it is for me to say in what way it should be disposed of after my death. I regard that as an absolute. I recognise that many people do not, but this goes some way along that road. For example, I would have the gravest reservations about any organs from my body after my death being used to save the lives of Mr Adams or Mr McGuinness, or any of the gangsters with whom they have long been associated. To me, this seems a very reasonable movement along the path. I would like to go a long way farther.</p>

I am pleased to be able to inform the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and the Committee that such a change has already been agreed in principle by the Department of Health and that the process of implementation has started to be worked through. I pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, for her work on this. We have been in dialogue on it since our last debate on the issue in this Room.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000050"></a>Members of the Committee will be aware that current policy is that organ donation is a gift and the donated organ is allocated on the basis of clinical need. This policy, as has been mentioned, reflects a case a few years ago where a patient's family agreed to a donation on the basis that the organs could only be given to specific ethnic group. However, as the noble Baroness has clearly set out, this policy has led to some rare but difficult situations where the clinical team would have preferred flexibility to take account of a patient&#146;s, or their family&#146;s, wishes. Department of Health officials have been working with the Human Tissue Authority and NHS Blood and Transplant over the past year to consider the various legal, ethical and public health implications of a review of the existing policy that would give a deceased donor similar opportunities as a living donor, as the noble Baroness mentioned, to donate an organ to a close relative or friend.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000051"></a>It might be helpful to outline some of the issues to be considered. Perhaps the key consideration, as the noble Baroness recognises within her amendment, is the need to ensure that others in urgent clinical need of the organ would not be harmed&#151;for example, patients registered on the urgent heart scheme, liver patients registered as &#147;super-urgent&#148; or renal patients identified as &#147;highly sensitised&#148;. There are also legal implications to consider&#151;for example, whether or not directed deceased donation could be seen as discriminatory or open to legal challenge. The numbers involved are  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC45"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>likely to be so small as to make it difficult to show discrimination. However, any change of the policy would require careful monitoring. If, following monitoring, there was evidence of disproportionate impact, we would need the flexibility to reconsider the policy and the justifications for it.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000052"></a>NHS Blood and Transplant has written to the Department of Health, giving its views and those of the Human Tissue Authority. There was agreement by both organisations, and broadly across the transplant community, that unconditional directed donation was acceptable in exceptional circumstances where the following principles apply: that there were no others in urgent clinical need of an organ who may be harmed by directed donation; that there was appropriate consent to donation; that the deceased had indicated a wish to donate to a specific named relative or friend, or relatives had expressed that wish on their behalf; that the intention to donate was not conditional on the directed donation going ahead; and that the need for a transplant was clinically indicated for the intended recipient.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000053"></a>I assure Members of the Committee that Department of Health Ministers have agreed in principle to a change of existing policy to enable the directed donation of an organ from a deceased donor in certain exceptional circumstances. However, there are a number of important areas that still need to be worked through. First, it is vital that we agree a UK-wide approach. It would be unacceptable for there to be different policies in different parts of the UK. As Members of the Committee know, organs donated in one part of the UK can be transplanted in another. Therefore, the implications of any change of policy would need to be considered and agreed by all the UK Administrations. NHS Blood and Transplant has already written similarly to Ministers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. I am aware that the framework proposed by NHS Blood and Transplant is being actively considered by Ministers in Scotland, and that Ministers in Wales and Northern Ireland have already agreed in principle. A review of policy in this area is justified, and they want it to be subject to certain safeguards. We are making progress and are very busy indeed on this. The Department of Health will work with the other health administrations to take this forward as quickly as we can.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000054"></a>We are considering the safeguards necessary to support the implementation of any change of policy&#151;for example, the need for guidance for professionals in the transplant community. In recognition of the fact that there will always be difficult cases that require further discussion, arrangements for the decision-making process and lines of accountability will also need to be clear. Implementation of the framework will also need to be monitored routinely to understand how consistently, accurately and legally it was being applied.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000055"></a>In conclusion, I hope that I have given Members of the Committee some assurance that we have agreed in principle to a change of policy and that work is in hand. However, as I say, any change would have UK-wide agreement. The best approach would be to have more detailed guidance, possibly supported by directions. I understand that that guidance is also in draft.</p>

<p><a name="09031768000058"></a>I am extremely grateful to all Members of the Committee who spoke. I reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, that I spoke to Elizabeth Buggins about the amendment; she was supportive. The noble Lord, Lord Walton, said that this is permissive and the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, referred to the need to be able to express how you would wish to be disposed of after death.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000059"></a>The Mental Capacity Act, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, referred, requires something in writing for advance decisions to refuse treatment. When the best-interest decision is being made on behalf of someone who has lost capacity and their advance statement of wishes is being considered as part of that information, we are obliged to seek the views of as broad a group as possible. We often have only the verbally expressed views of family and friends; you are looking for consistency in that verbally expressed view. Similarly, with funerary wishes, we will ask the family if they know how the person wished to be disposed of. Very often, there will be only a comment about burial or cremation&#151;that is what guides the way in which the body is disposed of. It is quite rare to have that in writing. I went through the guidance on the Mental Capacity Act to address the point that was raised. I hope that that has answered it.</p>

<p><a name="09031768000060"></a>I had a helpful conversation with James Neuberger about the monitoring that is needed. We discussed possibly asterisking on the register&#151;or however&#151;and about monitoring the outcome. I understand that there may be difficulties if this is locked in primary legislation and if there needs to be a subsequent review, because it would need further primary legislation to undo it.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000061"></a>With those comments and the overwhelming support that I have had from all parts of the Committee&#151;noble Lords who are not here today have also expressed overwhelming support for this amendment&#151;I beg leave, holding the Minister to her Easter promise, to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09031768000063"></a>I broke my back in 1958 and was taken to a nearby accident hospital at Swindon. I sustained a complete lesion at T5 and had many fractured ribs, a suspected head injury and serious internal haemorrhaging. My top half was in agony and I had no feeling below my breasts, which was most confusing. My life was saved by blood transfusions. Having lived through the night, and when the bleeding was controlled, I was transferred to the spinal unit at Stoke Mandeville Hospital the next day. We were treated in an old nissen hut but the medical nursing and physiotherapy were world-renowned, and the support from fellow patients was invaluable. Once I left hospital and got married, I realised that not all paralysed people went to spinal units, with the disastrous results of bowel and bladder problems, sepsis from infected pressure sores and irreversible problems such as joint contractures. That is why, with colleagues, I founded the Spinal Injuries Association 35 years ago.</p>

<p><a name="09031768000064"></a>We are extremely concerned about the crisis situation that many people with spinal cord injuries, and their families, find themselves in at present. In many part of the country, people cannot be admitted to a spinal unit with the expertise needed to treat and rehabilitate  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC48"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>them, so complications set in. One of the worst is depression. Since 1980, the number of beds has fallen while the proportion of people surviving spinal cord injuries has increased. Pressure on specialist spinal cord injury beds has led to long-term spinal cord injury people being admitted to general hospitals where they are not offered basic spinal cord injury care requirements, get the complications I mentioned and so increase long-term costs to the NHS.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000065"></a>Amendment 126 inserts a new clause entitled,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031768000117"></a>&#147;Admission of patients with spinal injures&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031768000100"></a>It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031768000118"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State shall by regulations establish a national bed bureau for patients with spinal injuries to monitor and manage the availability of hospital beds for patients with spinal injuries ... The bureau must in particular aim to meet the following objectives ... to provide a single commissioning service across England and Wales for the provision of beds in spinal units ... to work with primary care trusts and hospital trusts to co-ordinate information on the availability of hospital beds for patients with spinal injuries within each strategic health authority; and ... to ensure that beds are made available to patients with spinal injuries as soon as possible following admission, both when a patient is admitted for the first time and when a patient is urgently readmitted&#148;.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000066"></a>Spinal cord injury centres are classed as specialised services under the Department of Health&#146;s national definition set. Specialised services are those with low patient numbers requiring a critical mass of patients to make care costs effective. Specialised services are vital, but expensive in isolation. Primary care trusts currently come together to form consortia to commission such services. The Government&#146;s commissioning framework includes many of the recommendations made by the independent review of commissioning arrangements for specialised services led by Sir David Carter.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000067"></a>However, the system does not seem to be working as far as spinal cord injury patients are concerned. If it were working, a spinal cord injury patient with a medical emergency, whether a new acute injury or a readmission condition, would be promptly admitted into a place of safety. This is not happening in a large proportion of cases. I am told that there has been no improvement in the care offered to spinal cord injury patients since the South of England Board was established. Matters are worse than before, and I keep hearing of severely injured tetraplegics&#151;people with broken necks&#151;having to be kept in general hospital intensive care units on respirators, costing, on average, &#163;2,000 a day. They could be having expert treatment in spinal units for less cost if the facilities existed and if free spinal beds and funding were transparent across the country in a true National Health Service spirit.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000068"></a>At the opening of a cancer centre two weeks ago, Alan Johnson, the Secretary of State for Health, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031768000119"></a>&#147;This centre should reassure patients that the advances we have made recently in cancer services are only the beginning of what we intend to be able to provide in the near future&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031768000101"></a>That is good news, but in the amendment we are only asking for the correct treatment for spinal cord-injured patients, whose fate at the moment is a lottery. The noble Lord, Lord Darzi, always quotes his wish for high quality care for all. I hope that the Minister will seriously consider the amendment. I beg to move.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC49"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC49</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09031768000069"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09031768000150"></a>Earl Howe:</b> I support the noble Baroness in her very well considered amendment. To my mind, there are three main problems here. First, we do not know precisely how many spinal cord-injured people there are each year. We know roughly, but we have no nationally collected data and, on the basis that what you cannot measure you cannot have a proper policy for, the first lesson from the noble Baroness is that we need to know the numbers.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000070"></a>Secondly, there is a shortage of spinal cord injury beds. The spinal cord injury service in the UK has a total of up to 450 beds; the precise figure varies depending on how many beds are closed at any one time. They are located across eight NHS centres in England and one each in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Since 1980, the number of beds has fallen, while the proportion of people surviving spinal cord injuries has increased. Pressure on specialist beds has led to long-term spinal-injured people being admitted into non-specialist hospitals, where they are not offered basic spinal cord injury care requirements, and they often develop complications unrelated to the cause of their admission. Those complications increase rehabilitation time and reduce final outcomes.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000071"></a>Thirdly, there is a lack of co-ordination, which is the sine qua non of enabling swift and appropriate referral. This is not a case of asking for more money to be spent on spinal injury care, but rather that the same amount of money should be spent in a different way. At present, many of those with spinal cord injuries are spending time being managed in non-specialist centres by people who lack the necessary competence. As a result, they develop complications, as I said, which result in longer stays and poorer outcomes. It has been estimated by the SIA that if every spinal cord injury patient were appropriately managed from the outset, the cost of treating each person would be less. That means that one could treat more people with the same amount of money.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90317-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000072"></a>A survey was done last year by the SIA, which came out with some really quite alarming findings. Some 10 per cent of spinal cord injury patients did not receive any specialist care from a spinal cord injury centre. Some 21 per cent of new injuries did not get admitted within one month of their injury, and the average time from injury to referral was 28 days. It is salutary to read the brief that the SIA sent me, which says that for injuries sustained in rugby football, for example, two-thirds of those with complete spinal cord injury as a result of cervical dislocation who are looked after properly within four hours of injury make a full recovery. Only 5 per cent of those who are looked after properly after four hours will make a useful recovery and none will recover fully. It is rather like stroke, where you have to make certain that you go through a religious routine very swiftly after the incident has happened. If you do not do so, the results can be really very poor; the prognosis is poor.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000073"></a>That is the background. I hope that the noble Baroness will not mind my setting it out for her amendment as I have. It is important that the Minister understands what we are talking about here; this is a really very important area of specialist care, which I do not think receives the attention that it deserves.</p>

I declare an obvious interest, as someone who was paralysed at university more than 40 years ago from a spinal cord injury to my neck, and as vice-chair of the all-party group for the condition.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000075"></a>The number of Peers with spinal cord injury in this House misrepresents its incidence in the general population. Until Lady Darcy&#146;s untimely death last year, there were three of us in a House of around 750 Peers, which far exceeded the estimated numbers of spinal cord injured people in the general population, which are seen to be low enough for spinal cord injury to be defined as a specialist condition under the Department of Health national definition set. Currently, under Sir David Carter&#146;s <I>Review of Commissioning Arrangements for Specialised Services</I>, published in 2006, spinal cord injury is one of the conditions which should be commissioned at regional level of the health service by specialised commissioning groups, not at the national level. But this is patently not working, as we have heard described so graphically by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. What is urgently needed is a single commissioning body, as proposed in this amendment, and a national bed bureau.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000076"></a>What is the current position? The precise numbers of people with spinal cord injury in the country are not known and there is no easy means of establishing them. The most reliable estimate is that there are about 40,000 spinal cord injured people in the UK at any one time and around 700 new traumatic injuries each year. In percentage terms, these figures are small but, in terms of absolute numbers, 40,000 is still a significant group. There are also non-traumatic cases of spinal cord injury from a whole range of causes, such as viral infections, spinal tumours and so on. The incidence of these is thought to be substantially greater than for traumatic spinal cord injury, but, again, the precise numbers are unknown.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000077"></a>There are an estimated 700 people who need emergency first-time admission to a specialised spinal cord injury centre each year. Admission needs to be as soon as possible after injury in order to minimise the damage and not cause additional and entirely unnecessary complications. As noble Lords will hear many times, the earlier a spinal cord-injured person is admitted to a spinal cord injury centre, the less will be the cost of their care and the better will be the outcome. But there is also a vital need for spinal cord injury centre beds for readmission of both elective and emergency spinal cord injury patients.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000078"></a>There is enormous concern among the growing and ageing spinal cord injury population about the inability of district general hospitals to provide them with appropriate care for their existing condition, if they are admitted for non-spinal cord injury conditions such as a broken leg. Their concern is not about the hospital&#146;s ability to treat the broken leg but about the lack of experience and knowledge to provide appropriate pressure care and bowel management. I had not needed to have any in-patient care for more than 35 years, because of my excellent speedy initial care, but I have been admitted twice overnight in the past few years for

Both times it was abundantly clear that staff had no knowledge or awareness that my spinal cord injury needs required attention. It was entirely up to me whether or not they were met.</p>
<h5><a name="09031768000128"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000079"></a>Over the past two years the Spinal Injuries Association has been conducting research with the spinal injury centres to try to establish the true situation in the country. As we have heard, it found that the average time from injury to admission to a specialist spinal cord injury centre for newly injured patients is 46 days&#151;more than six weeks. This is the most crucial time for dealing with the trauma and preventing complications and can reduce the catastrophic effects of the injury. As a result of these serious delays, lengths of stay in specialist SCI centre beds are then greater than need be because the patients have complications that might have been avoided if they had been admitted more promptly. This in turn exacerbates the pressure on specialist beds and reduces capacity for specialist care. It is thought that at least 10 per cent of people with a spinal cord injury never receive specialist care from an SCI centre at all. What that means in terms of unnecessary complications, depression, increased life-long impairment and lack of rehabilitation is appalling.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000080"></a>I turn to the issue of readmission capability for people with SCI. A study in 2000 of readmissions to SCI centres found that almost half&#151;42 per cent&#151;of established SCI patients did not gain admission to the specialist care centre that they needed. What capacity can the present SCI service offer to meet the needs of both new and existing SCI patients? A total of only 450 beds are distributed between eight NHS SCI centres within host NHS trusts in England and one each in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. These centres developed in response to the Second World War and the needs of heavy industry and the coal mines, so they are generally not near contemporary centres of population. As a result, patients can be referred to centres hundreds of miles from their home and family and the scene of their accident, which can be for months, or even years on end. If you live in Cornwall and need specialist care for an SCI, you have to travel as far as Salisbury for the nearest SCI centre.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000081"></a>A further complication is that the host trust will too often divert funds away from specialist SCI services for which they were intended to plug leaks elsewhere within the trust. Trusts also have a tendency to use specialist SCI beds for non-SCI patients if they are unoccupied. A national bed bureau for patients with SCI, as proposed in this amendment, would help to ensure that the existing bed capacity was used to its optimum level. It would help to address the current wasteful situation where SCI patients spend weeks waiting for referral in a district general hospital; as we have heard, they often develop additional complications, such as pressure sores, which take months for the specialist centre to eradicate, so filling a bed for much longer than anybody wants.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000082"></a>The amendment would provide every A&amp;E department with a systematic and coherent system for placing their spinal cord-injured emergencies in specialist care.  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC52"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>What is more, it could heighten awareness of acute traumatic SCI in each A&amp;E department, and so reduce the incidence of missed cases.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000083"></a>Many Members of the Committee will have seen the article about Daniel James in the <I>Sunday Times  </I>on 15 March. He was paralysed in a rugby accident, taken to a local hospital and moved unnecessarily many times, and then had to wait until the next day for an MRI scan. He was put last on the list for the scan because the hospital was not aware of his injuries. His hands and arms were moving when he first had his accident, but after having to wait for an ambulance, which arrived at about 10.30 at night, when he finally arrived at Stoke Mandeville he had lost all movement and feeling in his fingers, which he did not regain. As a result, he has the sad renown of being the youngest person to go to Switzerland for assisted suicide.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000084"></a>Crucially, a national bed bureau would mean that we would start to get a true estimate of the level of spinal cord injury service that is required. As my noble friend Lord Darzi said in response to Amendment 35:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031768000120"></a>&#147;Commissioning cannot be improved without high quality information&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 26/2/09; col. GC 178.]</p>

<p><a name="09031768000102"></a>With a firmer grip on the numbers, I hope that we can begin to reverse the current decline and ensure that there are no more cases of people waiting weeks for referral to the care and rehabilitation that they so desperately need.</p>

<p><a name="09031768000085"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09031768000152"></a>The Lord Bishop of Ripon and Leeds:</b> I, too, associate myself with the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. That is not simply on the basis of Yorkshire solidarity, commendable though that undoubtedly is, but comes from my experience in particular. Most of my ministry has been in coal-mining communities. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, briefly referred to coal mining as an originator of the injuries of which we speak. I have awareness from working in a coal-mining village of the difference in treatment, and therefore in results, that is unique to the particular set of spinal injuries.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000086"></a>Some with mining injuries had excellent treatment and have recovered or, at least, have been enabled to cope well with their injuries. Others, whose original injuries had been no more serious, remained ill and, in some cases, died quite unnecessarily, because they had not been treated quickly enough or with sufficient skill. There is a particular need for a national policy on spinal injuries, which are different from the other serious injuries that we see and of which we speak.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000087"></a>I was almost surprised to hear that the number of new cases is as low as 700 a year. My own experience is of quite significant numbers. Certainly, if we add together both the immediate traumatic injuries, and those which appear through illness and infection, it is a significant number of people. Significant changes could be made in this area with significant results if the amendment were accepted into the Bill. I hope that we will do exactly that.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000089"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, has said, the existing spinal cord injury centres have grown up largely for historical reasons in places where, if one were planning the service from the beginning, one would not necessarily place them. I knew the late Doctor Ludwig Guttmann personally. He was most outstanding and inspirational. His idea&#151;his vision&#151;was to develop that famous spinal injuries centre at Stoke Mandeville, where the quality of treatment, management and rehabilitation and after-care of patients was of such very high quality, as it continues to be today. The National Health Service has funded it substantially, but a lot of the funding for the unit and many of the facilities that have been developed there has come through charitable activities&#151;not least those of Jimmy Savile and others, who have produced an enormous amount of funding.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000090"></a>I have to declare an interest, first, as a patron of the Spinal Injuries Association and, secondly, because my younger daughter, who suffered a spinal injury three years ago, received outstanding care at Stoke Mandeville. Elsewhere, for historical reasons, Dr Silver established a nascent spinal injuries centre in Southport, which has grown and developed. He later became the director of Stoke Mandeville.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000091"></a>For many years in the northern region, which is where I have lived and spent much of my professional life practising neurology, few services were provided for spinal-injured patients. I was brought up in the middle of the Durham coalfield in a mining community. At one stage, there was an attempt to build a spinal injuries unit in a district general hospital at Hexham, but the staffing levels and the ability to attract the appropriate level of staff, including nursing and medical, was not good. Eventually, the region decided to establish a spinal injuries unit at Middlesbrough. That unit at the James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, has an excellent reputation and has developed very well. But Middlesbrough is 50 miles from the biggest centre of population on Tyneside. The region includes Carlisle and Whitehaven. Patients suffering spinal injuries in the west of the region have to travel enormous distances to get to that centre in Middlesbrough. The unevenness of distribution of these centres across the country is unsatisfactory, despite the level of service that they give.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000092"></a>The one caveat that I have to say to my noble friends Lady Masham and Lady Wilkins is the heading of the proposed new clause, &#147;Admission of patients with spinal injuries&#148;. It is important to recognise&#151;I speak as a neurologist&#151;that these centres also treat effectively patients with non-progressive spinal chord deficits, illnesses such as transverse myelitis, spinal artery thrombosis and so on, which also cause quite severe degrees of paralysis.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000093"></a>I shall never forget, in the first year that I was a consultant, being called out by a GP at lunchtime to see a boy aged 17 who had cycled to school that morning. On the way home, he developed weakness in one arm and subsequently in the other arm, along  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC54"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC54</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with sensory loss. By the time he got home, he could no longer ride his cycle and was becoming paralysed in both lower limbs. I saw him at noon. By one o&#146;clock we had him in hospital and by two o&#146;clock he was on a respirator, paralysed in all four limbs, due to transverse myelitis. Subsequently, he was cared for brilliantly and, finally, was transferred to a spinal injury unit. He made an excellent recovery, eventually went to university and got an excellent degree.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031768000094"></a>That kind of non-traumatic neurological illness also needs to be handled in these units. It is important to take account of all those needs as well. It is crucial and, I fully appreciate, extremely difficult for the Government to overlook the historical background which led to the establishment of some of those units, frankly, in the wrong places; that is, remote from major centres of population. But the idea of having a national bed bureau and a single national commissioning service to improve the facilities of spinal injured patients and patients with spinal disease causing paralysis across the country is admirable. Hence, even though I would perhaps dabble a little with some of the wording, I strongly support the principle of this amendment.</p>

The noble Earl, Lord Howe, spoke about stroke, of which I had personal experience when the wife of an America relative came to this country some years ago and had a serious stroke. She was taken to one of our best teaching hospitals, not far from here, in the middle of the night. I spent the night there begging the staff to give her a brain scan. Her husband arrived, asked for the same thing and was told, in no uncertain terms, that that is not what we do in this country. That woman still cannot speak. Our practice has changed, but the average person cannot argue. If people with spinal injuries are in the wrong place, they are not given access to the right sort of care very quickly. We heard about the particularly moving tragedy of Daniel James. We cannot care in the way that we would want to for people who suffer these serious accidents. I hope that we can persuade the Minister to accept this amendment.</p>

Indeed, if we may put it in terms of before Guttmann&#151;and what an extraordinary man he was&#151;the life expectancy of people who had suffered a severe spinal injury was very short indeed. If they recovered from

Guttmann made the difference. It is due to him that so many people survive today.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000003"></a>Noble Lords may recollect that following the IRA/Sinn Fein attempt to murder my noble friend Lady Thatcher, who was then the Prime Minister, my wife and I, who were injured, were taken initially to hospital in Brighton and then, if my memory serves me rightly, she was transferred a week or two later to the spinal injuries unit at Stoke Mandeville, and I was allowed to accompany her. I might say in passing that it was later realised, just before I left Stoke Mandeville Hospital, that I had not been a fake; I had a fractured spine. I had fractured a vertebra in the course of the bombing, and it was not noticed until just before I left hospital. Oddly enough, it was the second time that I had fractured a vertebra and nobody had noticed until some time afterwards. I have been very lucky indeed in my life. From that, I conclude not just that I have been lucky, but that the diagnosis of such injuries among other traumatic injuries in a patient is not quite as easy as we might suppose at times. More to the point, it now seems quite likely that my wife&#146;s injury was more complex than the early diagnosis suggested. It might well have been better for her had she been airlifted straight to a spinal injuries unit immediately she was extricated from the wreckage of the hotel. To me, that underlines the force of what the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, and other noble Lords have said.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000004"></a>Twenty-five year ago, my wife and I were pretty lucky in that the spinal injuries unit at Stoke Mandeville had recently had been rebuilt, not least, as has been said, due to the work of Jimmy Savile. Things were different then from the way they are now. It was accepted in those days that a unit such as that at Stoke Mandeville should have vacant beds and that the bed occupancy rate should not be anything like as high as is now demanded. Of course, those empty beds were held at units like Stoke in those days for spinally injured patients. Now the box-ticking bed occupancy rate philosophy that has permeated the National Health Service requires that those beds are occupied. It is regarded as a failure if they are not occupied. Since spinally injured patients do not turn up obligingly to replace one who has just been let out of hospital, the only way that can be accomplished is by putting into such a unit patients who are in hospital for general surgery. The result is quite catastrophic, both for patients and for the health service. First, I suspect that many of those patients would be better off not in the spinal injuries unit but in the mainstream hospital.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000005"></a>Secondly, as we all know from some of the tragic incidents that have occurred, someone who is in need of a bed in a specialised unit may be weeks in getting one. Their recovery will be at least grossly impaired, and it may be that they will not recover at all. I emphasise that this is not just a matter of the medical and nursing care; it is a matter that in those units, patients generally stay for quite a long time. Many are young people who have suddenly been transferred from a life of action and taking risks, which is how they were before they arrived in hospital, and who find themselves facing a very different future.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC56"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000006"></a>My wife and I saw a number of patients who simply could not cope with that. They just turned their faces to the wall and died. They pulled up their roots. That so many survived was not least due to the peer pressure of other patients, which was enormously important, as well as the remarkable nursing care that was offered. That is in danger of going. The last time that I was at Stoke Mandeville, a year or so ago, the medical staff were gravely concerned at the fact that their bed occupancy rate was high solely because they had patients there who did not need the services that they could provide. Equally, they knew that elsewhere there were patients who desperately needed those services and who were blocking beds in other hospitals. I say that they were blocking beds because sometimes they were in high dependency beds, and even intensive care beds, where they did not need to be. They were damaging the interests of other patients.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000007"></a>Like the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, my wife recently had to have an overnight stay at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital. There is an excellent spinal unit there, and it is a wonderful hospital. It somehow underlines my belief that very often the best hospitals are in the worst buildings; and there are some pretty awful buildings there. It is a hospital where I find that people are happy. The atmosphere of the hospital is a quite extraordinary thing. My wife was on a general ward for an operation that was not directly related to her spinal injury, although it to some extent stemmed from it. The staff there were jolly good, nice people, who well trained, but they were not trained in dealing with a spinally injured patient. Fortunately, that hospital is very wise, and it was able to provide accommodation for one of my wife&#146;s carers to go with her. Otherwise, there would have been very considerable difficulties. It is much quicker to get a pressure sore than it is to cure one. It can be extremely expensive, both to the patient and to the health service.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000008"></a>So we are looking at a system which has come not to satisfy the needs of the patients. As I have said, the spinally injured may make much less of a recovery than might have been, with all that that entails for the patient, their family and, of course, for the public purse, with the costs which rattle on down for many years afterwards. Something needs therefore to be done to ensure that those beds are held open, ready for spinally injured patients. If that is not to be an inefficient system, it needs some form of backup of the kind which the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, envisaged. A little bit of planning could avoid great suffering and expense. It is time that it was done.</p>

It is evident from what has been said around the Committee today that the clinical pathways have not been sufficient to meet the needs. It is around the clinical pathways and quality of care which the Bill centres. There is obviously a great need, particularly in general hospitals, where patients go inappropriately and where there is insufficient knowledge, training and skills to be able to cope with spinal injuries and neurological conditions. While other conditions may well come to fore by our saying that the clinical pathways are not being met,  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC57"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC57</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>spinal injuries are very important in terms of quality of life and future development. By way of an interim measure, a bureau which supplied immediate care for people suffering from a spinal injury would perhaps stop inappropriate suffering and even death of patients. I very much hope that the Minister will support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09031777000010"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09031777000051"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> As my noble friend Lord Carlile has put his name to the amendment, perhaps I might make just one or two brief comments. Nobody ever accused the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, of not having backbone and of coming away uninjured; we do not realise quite how tough his backbone is.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000011"></a>I take three key points from the debate. First, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, the services which we have are the result of historical accident and great charitable effort&#151;I have no wish to denigrate that at all&#151;but I am not sure that those services would now be deemed to be the best if we were to start from scratch.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90317-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000012"></a>Secondly, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, was right that we are in urgent need of data on incidence, frequency and, most of all, location. Let us be absolutely honest: we shall not have a specialist unit in every district general hospital; there will always need to be a small number of highly specialised units which filter out their knowledge and expertise into secondary and primary care. The question is where they should be. The location of our current services is an accident. I do not know, and I would like somebody to tell me, whether there is a case for a new unit in Birmingham, because the new military hospital is there, which I imagine is seeing an awful lot of people with spinal injuries and is perhaps developing an area of expertise. Particular sports might attract a unit. For example, I imagine that if you were going to choose a location for a national centre in Scotland, you would want to find a location that was not only within a short distance of the largest centre of population but also within reach of people who have climbing accidents, who have a high number of spinal injuries.</p>
<h5><a name="09031777000046"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000013"></a>Thirdly, the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, was leading us to the right point on the collocation of those services with others. In this day and age, with research as it is, there is an increasingly convincing case for having spinal injury and neurological units, if not together, then in close proximity. I do not wish to take the Committee into territory that might be contentious, but some of the research&#151;for example, on stem cells&#151;is going on in neurology and will have applications to those with spinal injuries.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000014"></a>When the Minister comes to respond to the debate, she may feel that her department is unable to accept the amendment. However, perhaps she can take those points from this debate and indicate whether and how the department would be willing to review and update the overall provision of these badly needed services.</p>

<p><a name="09031777000015"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09031777000052"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> First, a debate like this shows the tremendous strength, expertise and personal experience in the Committee; I have found it very moving. To take  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC58"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>up the point of the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, to think that we will be doing a lot more building in the future is pretty unrealistic. With our tremendous difficulty with resources, globally as well as in this country, I cannot see new units being built. That is why there is great strength in the amendment. It says that we must work with what we have. The secret is in how we are going to commission, using the available services.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000016"></a>I like the idea of the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, that we should perhaps have an interim solution. I see the Minister looking more and more glum as she replies to the debate. I suspect that she will say that she is very sorry but she cannot go with a national bed bureau, so we will have to try to think of other ways of resolving some of these problems. As I have said, we must do it through commissioning.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000017"></a>The other area is awareness. I am appalled by some of the statistics. Just 19 per cent of new injuries were admitted on the day of injury, yet we have heard from people with enormous expertise that speed is of the essence; I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, has got her society going and tried to increase awareness of the issue. Can the Minister, thinking forward, say in her reply what the Government can do to ensure that there is much greater awareness of that, especially in accident and emergency units but also throughout the country? It is important that people are admitted within four hours of the injury if at all possible.</p>

<p><a name="09031777000018"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09031777000053"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> I do not want to detain the Committee. I want to make a couple of points and, in particular, add my support to this incredibly important amendment. I was impressed by the contribution of the noble Earl, Lord Howe. It seems to me that we have a win-win situation here.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000019"></a>I do not altogether accept that we cannot expand capacity. The foundation trusts, in general, build up considerable cash reserves and the capacity to borrow for capital projects. In the years ahead, however, after the following two years, there will be the most incredible squeeze on resources in the National Heath Service for revenue for ongoing expenditure. The Department of Heath probably cannot afford not to have the amendment, or something rather similar to it. We will be unable to spend at the same level as we have in the past. Here we have a possibility of improving the quality of services for severely injured or unwell people&#151;of course, we all want to see that&#151;while cutting the overall revenue spend, so I hope that the Minister will be able to support the amendment.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000020"></a>My final point is about bed occupancy. In mental health, we have always worked to 100 per cent bed occupancy and under government targets, we are being driven to a lower level: 85 per cent bed occupancy. I find it hard to imagine that other bits of the NHS are driving bed occupancy up to 100 per cent, so I hope the department can clarify that point because it is extraordinarily important.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000022"></a>I found the contribution made by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, very moving. He will not remember, but we had a conversation some years ago when he was campaigning on behalf of Stoke Mandeville Hospital. I expressed my support for his campaign because my grandfather returned from the war and was put back together at Stoke Mandeville. He lived for 25 years in a wheelchair and visited Stoke Mandeville Hospital two or three times a year, so I may have been six years old when my noble friend had her accident, but at that time, I was sitting on the knee of a grandfather in a wheelchair, so I am very sympathetic to this.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000023"></a>I wrote to the noble Baroness on this matter last week, and I hope she will forgive me if I repeat for the record some of the points I made in that letter. I fully sympathise with the situation she described but, at the moment, we are not convinced that primary legislation is the best route to achieving her objectives. In May 2006, Sir David Carter published his <I>Review of Commissioning Arrangements for Specialised Services </I>in response to a request from the noble Lord, Lord Warner, then Minister of State at the Department of Health. This report resulted in the establishment of the National Specialised Commissioning Group, the National Commissioning Group, and 10 new specialised commissioning groups, including one for spinal injuries. The noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, is correct that commissioning is the answer.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000024"></a>The new arrangements offered significant improvements in the organisation and governance of specialised services commissioning at local and national level. Specialised commissioning groups plan collectively, share risk through pooled budgets and co-ordinate strategic commissioning across PCT boundaries. No primary legislation was needed to establish them, and one of our concerns is that to place the arrangements for spinal injury services on a statutory footing might undermine the work being undertaken across the breadth of specialised services. That is not to say that we are by any means where we wish to be on this matter.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000025"></a>I understand that the Spinal Injuries Association sits as a partner on the south of England board for the commissioning of spinal injury services. The board has discussed making proposals to the National Specialised Commissioning Group for an English forum for spinal injuries, in similar terms to the proposed amendment, which could help set a strategic direction and address concerns across organisational boundaries.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000026"></a>No formal approach has yet been made to the National Specialised Commissioning Group or its support team. I am pleased to inform noble Lords and the noble Baroness that the director of national specialised commissioning is keen to meet representatives from the Spinal Injuries Association to discuss these proposals. The director is currently in consultation with the south of England board to explore how its existing collaborative arrangements are working, what wider applications they might have and a range of other options for improving commissioning arrangements, all of which has the potential to improve the experience

<p><a name="09031777000027"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, and my noble friend Lady Wilkins both mentioned the lack of data about the number of spinal injuries. We recognise that this is a problem.

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000028"></a>There is a strong case for improving the co-ordination of the commissioning of spinal cord injury services and we are looking to the National Specialised Commissioning Group to lead that.

I also thank the Minister, who is always helpful, for which I am very grateful. The Spinal Injuries Association recently received a letter from a consultant in Oldham who had had a spinal cord injured patient. He had contacted Middlesbrough to get the patient a specialised spinal bed, but he was told by Middlesbrough that it takes only patients from its own area. Recently, I was told that five tetraplegics are on respirators, waiting for beds in a spinal unit, in the intensive care unit of the Royal London Hospital.

He has already had a pressure sore. A few years ago, the Spinal Injuries Association did a survey of how patients get pressure sores. It found that most of them occur in intensive care units where everything is monitored, but basic skin is forgotten. How many more such patients in general hospitals across the country are getting into difficulties? How many paraplegics, who get just as many problems and get just as depressed, are in general hospitals?</p>

We have spent over an hour debating the important amendment proposed by my noble friend, and we are now on the seventh day of Committee. Some Members of the Committee will no doubt remember that I tried to persuade Her Majesty&#146;s Government that this amendment had great merit during the last Health Bill in 2006. I am introducing it again for the same reasons as last time. It would simply greatly encourage individuals and companies to invest in private medical insurance, which in turn&#151;this is the important part&#151;would greatly reduce the National Health Service waiting lists. That is the sole purpose of  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC62"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the amendment. If the proposed EC working hours directive becomes law, it will be even more difficult to dramatically reduce the waiting lists. This amendment would greatly help. For that reason, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09031777000038"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09031777000061"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> I know that I shall be unpopular with the Government for giving warm support to the amendment. When I became a consultant neurologist in 1958, I chose at the outset to be part-time in nine sessions, and I spent two half-days a week in private practice. That was an interesting experience and one which I greatly enjoyed, though I was absolutely meticulous in making certain that my nine NHS sessions were more than fulfilled, often amounting to over 60 hours a week.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000039"></a>At that time, I had a neurological ward with 28 beds, and of those 28 beds in the Newcastle General Hospital there were eight single rooms and two bays, one of 10 beds for women and one of 10 beds for men. Of the eight single rooms, two could be used at any time, if the situation so arose, for the care of private patients. I have no doubt whatever in my mind that, as time went by, the situation became very difficult because, under pressure from the trade unions at the time when Mrs Castle, subsequently Lady Castle, was Secretary of State for Health, slowly but surely private beds were withdrawn from NHS hospitals. We ended up with the ridiculous situation that there were in Newcastle three private beds, one in each of the main general hospitals.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031777000040"></a>I had by then become a full-time academic, and I was no longer undertaking private practice, after several years as a consultant in part-time practice. I had built up a major research unit for research into neuromuscular disease, for which I developed such a reputation that we had patients referred from other parts of the world to come to that unit for investigation. Very properly, it was the law that any patient coming directly to the UK for treatment from overseas had to be a private patient. That was absolutely right, because it was not the case for people who were visitors from overseas who happened to fall ill. Those who came specifically who were referred from overseas had to be private patients.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000001"></a>That decision by Mrs Castle gave the greatest impetus to the development of private hospitals outside the NHS of any decision of any Government. Before that time, many consultants in part-time private practice were geographically whole-time: they looked after their NHS patients and their private patients in the same hospital&#151;they were private wards, all of which were closed. I was thereafter compelled to refuse patients referred to me from the United States, Australia and other countries. I could not take them into hospital because no specialist facilities such as were required for the investigation of neuromuscular disease existed in any private hospital. I found that situation intolerable.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000002"></a>I have always believed that a partnership between the public and the private sectors is a benefit to the National Health Service provided that part-time consultants give their services, as they must for the time for which they are contracted, to the NHS. Individuals with private health insurance have paid their taxes and have in the same way as everyone else contributed to the costs of the NHS. The proposal would benefit the National Health Service by allowing  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC63"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC63</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more money to be developed on the private practice side which would go into the hospitals. I support the amendment, as I did under a previous Government. I am a Cross-Bencher; I am not a member of any political party; but I strongly favour this form of tax relief on private medical insurance.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000003"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09031795000248"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I shall address Amendment 127, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Palmer. It is a long and well established principle that most personal private expenditure is not eligible for tax relief. Our tax system has to be fair to a very large number of people and relief is given only where it supports specific government priorities. Premiums paid for private medical insurance are treated in the same manner as other personal expenses and are not liable for income tax relief.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000004"></a>Alongside general tax principles, there are several reasons why the Government do not allow tax relief for individuals paying private medical insurance premiums and why they do not support the amendment. The Government do not believe that public money should fund private healthcare. It is a longstanding and fundamental principle of the NHS that it provides a comprehensive, universal health service which is free to all at the point of use. For the Government to subsidise a minority of people who choose to take out private medical insurance would undermine the fundamental principle of equity in the NHS. It would reduce the money available to fund the NHS and other public services. I hope that noble Lords would agree that there must be no question of using tax breaks to subsidise a two-tier health system, which would discriminate against those who were not able to pay for their care. In addition, the level of coverage offered by private medical insurance plans varies widely. For example, it is very rare for them to cover emergency care and access to a private GP, and therefore no one taking advantage of the proposed amendment would be able to opt out of the NHS completely.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000005"></a>We do not believe that the proposal would be a cost-effective use of taxpayers&#146; money. We have been sparing in our use of tax exemptions and have introduced them only where we are convinced that they offer the best-targeted and most cost-effective support for our objectives. If tax relief was given to the 1.7 million individuals who currently pay for private medical insurance, the cost to the Exchequer would be &#163;810 million.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000006"></a>It is also highly likely that the amendment would cause a behavioural change, with many individuals who currently receive taxable corporate care changing to pay for it personally to gain the benefit. If a quarter of those who currently receive corporate private medical insurance moved, it would increase the cost of the amendment to &#163;1.32 billion. I hope that noble Lords agree that this would not be the best way of using funds available for health.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000007"></a>As with all tax exemptions, the most benefit from the introduction of this proposal would be gained by higher-rate taxpayers, who would get 40 per cent tax relief on the premium paid. It would give little or no benefit to those on the lowest incomes who most need the support of our healthcare system, and those who are not taxpayers would obviously gain no benefit from the amendment whatever.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000008"></a>It would be hard to justify granting relief for this expenditure and not for other expenditure which some might think equally deserving. Notwithstanding the support for the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, I hope that, on reflection, the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, will feel able to withdraw it.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000010"></a>With the greatest possible respect the noble Baroness has forgotten that the point behind this is to reduce NHS waiting lists. The new 48-hour directive from Europe will present terrible problems of prolonging the waiting lists for operations such as artificial hips, limbs or whatever. I knew that I would get absolutely nowhere and that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, would be sitting firmly without rising to his feet, as indeed would the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, but we ought not to lose sight of the amendment. I am particularly grateful to my noble friend Lord Walton of Detchant for saying that the idea behind this is to reduce the waiting lists in the NHS for hip replacements and so on.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>

First, private patient work will not change the public service nature of foundation trusts; secondly, private patient work will in every case benefit NHS patients and will not cause detriment to NHS patients. It is not good enough in my view to benefit some NHS patients if you cause detriment to others. One needs both safeguards. Thirdly, the approval of boards of governors will be required for any significant new private patient expenditure, to ensure that the fundamental principles and specified safeguards are adhered to. That would fulfil the requirement for local

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000013"></a>Currently, the private patient work of foundation trusts is dealt with through the private patient income cap. This was introduced in the context of the establishment of foundation trusts by the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003, and was restated in the National Health Service Act 2006. The cap was imposed by Parliament in response to understandable fears that allowing an open approach to income from private patients may radically change the nature of the NHS. I think that these fears remain valid today.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000014"></a>I declare an interest as chair of a foundation trust. Most Members of the Committee will be aware of that from previous debates However, I emphasise that our trust in east London has no interest at present&#151;I cannot say what it will be in 20 years&#146; time&#151;in developing private patient services. I am not coming here to plead for something from which my trust would benefit.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000015"></a>I was approached by the Foundation Trust Network to raise this issue, which I was content to do. The network has received expressions of concern from foundations across the country about the detriment to their work caused by the PPI cap as it is currently structured. I hope that in the minutes available to me I can capture those concerns and persuade the Committee that there is a case for reform, whatever that reform looks like.</p>
<h5><a name="09031795000239"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000016"></a>The proposed new clause would not abolish the cap. Rather, subsection (1) would require that whatever the framework is in the future&#151;we do need a new framework, in my view&#151;it must be the same for NHS trusts that are not foundation trusts and for foundation trusts themselves. There are six problems with the current private patient cap. First, and most obvious, is the uneven playing field. Those NHS trusts which are not yet FTs are not subject to any cap and can provide services to private patients without limit. At the other end of the scale, a mental health foundation trust has a zero cap and cannot provide any private patient work. As I have said before, that is not a problem for me, but it is a fact. In the middle are foundation trusts that provide acute care. The level of the cap depends on the amount of private work that a trust did in 2002-03, the year before the first foundation trusts were authorised. The cap varies because of that slightly odd way of doing things. One FT has a 30 per cent cap, whereas many others have a 5 per cent cap. It just depends on what proportion of their work was private in 2002-03. Over time, the inequities are likely to have perverse consequences. Trusts may elect not to become foundation trusts because of the private patient cap on the FTs, but not on NHS trusts. That would thwart the Government's public sector reform agenda. The aim is that all provider trusts should become foundation trusts.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000017"></a>Secondly, Monitor has expressed the concern that there are real administrative problems in basing the level of the cap on the 2002-03 earnings from private  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC66"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC66</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>work. As we extend further into the future, even getting hold of the data could be a problem. Thirdly, the Foundation Trust Network is concerned that the structure of the private patient cap is preventing a substantial and growing part of the NHS family from gaining income from privately funded work, which could be invested in improving NHS services. For example, apparently, a mental health foundation trust wants to set up a mother and baby unit. Through its business case, it has established that in order to be cost-effective the unit needs to have 20 beds. It has also estimated that NHS demand for these beds is 15 beds. The mental health foundation trust&#146;s argument is that, if it could have five private patients in its mother and baby unit, the unit would be cost-effective and, thus, it could have one. It says, without that, it might not have one.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000018"></a>A further example is that of an NHS foundation trust which is concerned that the private patient income cap will impact on the development of its cancer services.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000019"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09031795000252"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> On this mother and baby unit case, which I have looked at, in what circumstances would a person seek to go into a mother and baby unit as a private patient?</p>

<p><a name="09031795000020"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09031795000253"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> That is an extremely good question. Perhaps people coming from, say, the Middle East to Great Ormond Street Hospital would want to come to a very specialist service, which probably would not exist in a lot of other countries. It is not something that I am planning in my trust. Obviously, the Foundation Trust Network has looked into the possibilities and has established that this would be feasible from its point of view.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000021"></a>A further example is a completely different foundation trust, which wants to deliver a model of care to NHS patients that is not currently available under the NHS; namely, cancer care. It can achieve this only by increasing substantially its private income in that area, which it cannot do because it would take them over the private patient cap. In a completely different example, another trust wants a private company to provide equipment for laser dermatology for private and NHS patients. The equipment is very expensive and is not available under the NHS. That foundation trust knows that its NHS patients would benefit if only it could get hold of that equipment. Those are just a few examples of the arguments coming forward to the Foundation Trust Network from trusts around the country.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000022"></a>The fourth general problem reported to the Foundation Trust Network is that the cap means that NHS foundation trusts are precluded from supporting and delivering some of the Government&#146;s policies. I shall give a couple of examples. Mental health trusts are precluded from contracting with private insurance companies to deliver services for employees they cover, and also from delivering the return-to-work activity, which I happen to know a little about. I suppose that we probably could not do that work; it is no problem for us, but it might be a problem for patients.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000023"></a>Another area is the top-up issue; again, it is rather controversial, but there we go. NHS patients will not be free to choose a foundation trust to receive their  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC67"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC67</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>top-up treatment if that treatment would take the foundation trust above its cap. This is particularly likely to be a problem in cancer care, where the treatments are very expensive and some of them have not been approved by NICE, and also in dementia care where, again, expensive treatments have not necessarily been approved by NICE.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000024"></a>There is a barrier faced by some leading NHS providers against becoming foundation trusts, because of the extent of their private patient work. For example, Great Ormond Street has highly specialised care for tiny groups of children. To provide that care, it brings a couple of children over from some other countries so that they can sustain their highly specialist units within the hospital. However, it is in trouble in terms of becoming a foundation trust; it is not a foundation trust, ironically.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000025"></a>A very different issue, which happens to be important to me, is that some foundation trusts&#151;I do not know how many&#151;use NHS resources to help them provide private patient services. These trusts are below the PPI cap and, therefore, as foundation trusts, no one can actually do anything about this, as I understand it&#151;or are not doing anything about it, anyway. I would want to see a change in the law so that a foundation trust cannot use NHS resources to support its private patient work. Rather, to the contrary, if it is to do private patient work, it must demonstrate that that is beneficial to NHS patients and of no detriment to others.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000026"></a>The new clause does not indicate whether the level of private patient services should be higher or lower. I happen to have a personal view on that, but the amendment does not indicate it. If we can achieve agreement about the principles for the purposes of the Bill, I know that the Government will want to go in for a major consultation exercise about how the detail of this should be sorted out, ideally in regulations. This is not a simple matter. It is quite controversial, but if we could get the principles right, we could have something far better than what we have at the moment; certainly, what we have is pretty inadequate.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000027"></a>I propose two further safeguards in addition to the three principles that I mentioned at the beginning, which are important for me. One is a restricted rate of change in the percentage of private patient work over a period of time. You should not be able to leap to some huge private patient involvement, partly because that would threaten the public service ethos of the trust. Secondly, private patient work would not create an unacceptable divergence from existing services.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000028"></a>Will the Minister confirm her agreement with the following four propositions? They are, first, that proper control of the extent of private patient services within all health trusts is desirable&#151;that should not be too difficult; secondly, that the current framework for controlling the extent of private patient services is unfair and needs reform; thirdly, that reform should be done in a way that ensures that private patient work enhances and avoids detriment to services to NHS patients; and, fourthly, that the system should have an equal impact upon all trusts, whether NHS or foundation.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000029"></a>In conclusion, I suggest that getting the treatment of private patient income right could greatly help the NHS to weather the storm of public service restrictions

Will the noble Baroness, who knows that I hold her in great respect, deal with two questions? The first goes back to the mother and baby unit. How far does that estimate of 15 patients from National Health Service quarters reflect the seriousness with which the contribution that could be made by such a unit is regarded by GPs and others within the area? How do we know that, if such a unit exists, we would not find that the demand from health service quarters quickly increased? Would the hospital or trust concerned then be tied into giving access to private patients when it had become clear that the need from health service quarters was larger than anticipated?</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000036"></a>My other question is a simple one. The noble Baroness said that her foundation trust had no interest in this issue at all and that she was simply putting the case for the network. I am quite certain that, if she were in the chair in such a situation, a facility would be honourably and in the spirit implemented. Is she absolutely convinced that it would be approached in quite the same way in all trusts, and that, once having had a facility provided under such regulations, a trust might not be tempted to seek wherever possible to maximise income for the trust from private quarters as distinct from health service need?</p>

My own trust runs a very small mother and baby unit. It is interesting that the demand is very limited. For those severely mentally unwell mothers with newly born babies who come into the unit, it is immensely important, partly to get early treatment for the mother and partly to assess her capacity to mother that baby. It is a highly specialised service. However, we do not have a lot of demand coming at us, and I had never thought of private work. Whether we can continue to run a mother and baby

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000038"></a>I say in answer to the noble Lord&#146;s second question that I am as conscious as he and others of the incredible importance of protecting the NHS&#151;its principles, style and everything that we know and love about it. That is why I have not rushed into saying, &#147;And the future framework should look like this&#148;. I have been very careful in agreeing to table this amendment, and in tweaking it a bit, to say, &#147;All we&#146;re saying here is level playing field and no detriment to the NHS&#148;. I am assuming, and it is my understanding, that there would be lengthy consultation by the Government on how we achieve those principles. However, if you have clear principles&#151;we have had long discussions in the context of the Mental Health Act about having clear principles in the Bill&#151;it should be possible to adhere to them and to ensure that what the noble Lord and I fear would not occur.</p>

It is an Exocet amendment. If it were to be implemented&#151;and we will come to the motive of the noble Baroness in a minute&#151;it would completely undermine the National Health Service. I understand where the noble Baroness is coming from. She has tabled this as a probing amendment because she wants to provoke a debate about these issues. She is not saying that this is exactly what she would pursue. She made it clear that she would not wish it to apply to her trust, certainly while she is leading it. She said that there may be some interest in it in the longer term in a more refined form.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000040"></a>I regard this as a very dangerous amendment. I have talked to Anne Campbell, the former Labour MP who I presume has written to a number of Members of the Committee about her views on this matter. We have to go back to what happened in 2003 when the Bill establishing foundation trusts went through the House of Commons. Many MPs were opposed to foundation trusts being established. I recall moving between the tea room, the bars in the House of Commons and other places lobbying, not officially on behalf of the Government, in favour of the creation of these trusts. I believed in them because I believed the assurances that were being given by Ministers that they would not go down the route that this amendment suggests.

The fact is that we are down the road. The problem is how to make sure that we get the road designed in the best interests of the NHS. I am not suggesting that we go into private patient work.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031795000205"></a>&#147;The rules have been the subject of extensive comment both in Standing Committee and elsewhere. We have introduced a cap on the income that NHS foundation trusts can earn from private patients, so that NHS patients will always come first. We have also moved to ensure that the NHS in England will not become a two-tier service&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000182"></a>He then went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031795000206"></a>&#147;Let me make it clear that under clause 15(2) the regulator must impose such a restriction on the amount of private business that an NHS foundation trust can undertake. There is no question at all about that: he must exercise that provision&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000183"></a>Further on, he said:</p>
<ul><a name="09031795000230"></a>&#147;I give my hon. Friend an absolute assurance that the regulator must impose a cap on the volume of private patient activity that an NHS foundation trust is to undertake&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 8/7/03; col. 943-44.]</ul>
<p><a name="09031795000184"></a>My colleagues asked about the threshold to make sure that hospitals would not go further down this route, and undertakings were given. When we came to ping-pong between the Houses, a further assurance was given by Dr Reid, who was then Secretary of State, to try to make sure that we did not have problems in the Division Lobbies in the House of Commons.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000043"></a>In other words, this structure was based on those undertakings. This amendment challenges those undertakings. It may well be that there is an uneven playing field, but that is what Parliament decided at that time. It was on that basis that it went through. Members of Parliament must have known at that time, on the basis of the 2002 assessments, that individual trusts must have had different levels of private patient care in operation. It would have been known to them when they voted. They knew they were voting for an uneven playing field. It was on that basis that a large number of Members of Parliament abstained and many voted against it in one of the biggest rebellions in the House of Commons in the previous Parliament. It was not a full turn-out; the Lobbies were down, because many Members abstained.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000044"></a>I have gone to my old friends in Unison, who have very strong views on these matters. They are part of the story. The noble Baroness knows their involvement in all this. I now turn to what they have said to me and what they would like me to say to the Committee, just to remind the Committee of where we are.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000045"></a>In the event that this amendment was passed, it would simply replace the cap with a vague public interest test, which would be highly subjective and impossible to administer. Such a fundamental change would clearly run contrary to the Government&#146;s position when they set up foundation trusts. Many foundation trusts would obviously like to increase their income from private patients, and this amendment would mean that there was no limit on the amount of money that they could take in from cash-paying private patients. The logical outcome of this amendment is a two-tier system, which normal National Health Service patients&#151;</p>

This initiative is not designed to abolish the cap, unless a clearer, firmer and more even framework could be put in its place. I explained that, and I agree that you could read the amendment as implying the removal of the cap. All that it actually says is that the framework will be the same for foundation and NHS trusts. Unison has a misunderstanding on that, which is the basis on which it has briefed the noble Lord, in my view.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000049"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0005.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="09031795000267"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> However, the noble Baroness did, if I recall, correctly quote some figures of between 5 per cent and 30 per cent. Even with the increase from 5 per cent to 30 per cent in those National Health Service trusts, they are not able to have the advantage&#151;as they might see it&#151;or the privilege of the 30 per cent cap. There would inevitably be a lot more increased private treatment work inside those hospitals as they go to the higher cap limit. It was the noble Baroness who quoted the distinction between the 5 per cent and the 30 per cent, based on the 2002 figures. I am only quoting the fact that if National Health Service foundation hospitals move to 30 per cent, it inevitably means that they must be taking on more private work.</p>

There is no suggestion here that everyone move up to 30 per cent. I was stating facts. One NHS foundation trust has a 30 per cent cap, while others have 5 per cent. What we need is an even playing field and what that should look like is a matter for discussion with Ministers and a consultation across the country. No one is suggesting any increase in the cap&#151;any loosening of the system. I would like to see a tightening of the system, while others would like to see a loosening of the system, but this amendment does not address those issues.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000051"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0005.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="09031795000269"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> I do not think that those hospitals that already have a 30 per cent cap will volunteer to reduce it, will they?</p>

In other words, the ones taking 5 per cent will want to get up to 30 per cent as soon as possible, so it is inevitable that there will be more private work in those National Health Service hospitals.

The logical outcome of the amendment is a two-tier system, in which normal National Health Service patients are seen as less important because they are not bringing in any extra income into the hospital. The stated purpose of foundation trusts, whether or not one agrees with the concept, is to allow those hospitals that have achieved foundation trust status extra flexibility in the way in which they run their affairs, not to allow them erode the founding principles of equality and universality that lie at the heart of the NHS. To quote the then Health Secretary from the debates around the foundation hospitals when they were set up:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031795000207"></a>&#147;First and foremost, NHS foundation trusts will be NHS hospitals. They will treat NHS patients according to NHS principles&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 7/5/03; col. 709.]</p>

<p><a name="09031795000185"></a>That principle must always remain at the heart of our debates when we discuss these matters.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000058"></a>There is more to this question than preserving the principles of the NHS, although that should be paramount in our thinking. There is also a pragmatic reason for us to reject the amendment, relating to the conduct of the foundation trusts&#146; regulator, Monitor, and an ongoing potential legal situation. Unison has repeatedly aired its concerns that Monitor has failed to produce accurate guidelines on what NHS foundation trusts need to declare on income derived from providing services to private patients. The union engaged with Monitor for more than a year to end the dispute, but with no success. This began in late 2007, when Unison challenged the legality of Monitor&#146;s financial guidance to foundation trusts, which lets them avoid a cap on private patient income by setting up legal entities in the form of joint ventures or charitable organisations to do private patient work, creating a major loophole for foundations to exploit.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000059"></a>The cap limits the percentage of total income that trusts can get from treating private patients to the level of 2002-03. While the 2003 Act defines private patient income as charges relating to the treatment of non-NHS patients, prior to 2008, Monitor&#146;s financial reporting manual defined private income as that arising from activity provided directly to patients. In accountancy terms, this means that income received via special purpose vehicles&#151;a very interesting phrase&#151;does not count against the cap.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000060"></a>In July 2008, the <I>Health Service Journal</I> used a freedom of information request to reveal a confidential analysis of foundation trust private patient income by consultants KPMG. Foundations declared private patients earnings of &#163;165 million in 2008, but the widest definition of private patient income would increase this figure by 70 per cent to &#163;281 million. That is the assessment on which Unison is making its case.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000061"></a>Monitor consulted its members in 2008 on the interpretation of the law and amended its guidance on the private patient cap. It opted to retain its existing approach but to extend the definition of private patient income to include private patient charges for goods and services provided by associate and joint venture arrangements. However, Monitor claimed that it was unworkable for all income derived from private patients  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC73"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC73</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to be included in the cap, and the new definition stops short of including additional sources such as donations from charities, when the donation was funded by private patient charges made by the charity. Unison believes that the changes made still fail actively to reflect the intention and meaning of the law and, as a result, the union is continuing to seek a judicial review into the matter.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000062"></a>As more hospitals and other NHS organisations take on foundation status, we need to ensure that there is no room for error. It would therefore be premature to change the law so drastically before the meaning and practical functioning of the current legislation has been clarified by the outcome of this potential legal process.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000063"></a>Finally, I shall touch on one of the arguments being used to justify removing the cap&#151;the fact that mental health foundation trusts are effectively unable to raise any private income as their 2002-03 level of private income was zero. When the trusts were originally mooted by Alan Milburn in January 2002, they were clearly part of an agenda to separate the highest achieving hospitals from the rest of the bunch. It was originally intended that the only hospitals eligible to apply for foundation status would be those scoring a three-star rating. To begin with, it was not envisaged that all hospitals and mental health trusts would eventually be expected to apply for and be granted foundation status. It was a last-minute compromise prior to the 2003 vote that conceded the possibility of trusts having a chance to achieve full foundation trust status, which in itself has created the problem.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000064"></a>Finally, I offer a word on Anne Campbell and her particular problem, which she has outlined. It was an interesting letter. I have talked to her, and to the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, about it. I do not close this whole route off completely. In mental health trusts, a refining of the law could provide for a little movement. I do not see the need for a national review, but I hope that someone can turn up with an amendment on Report that is far more refined that this blunt instrument&#151;which, as we know, is a probing amendment&#151;and which might deal to some extent with the problems in mental health trusts because they are on a zero cap. I would like to think that if an amendment surfaced, even if it were not acceptable on Report, Ministers would consider whether there was any scope for further movement in this area.</p>

First, since I started working in the National Health Service in 1948 when it first began, I have been one of its most fervent supporters. I firmly believe in the principles that led to the establishment of the NHS, and those principles are continuing. Nevertheless, having private patients and services working in partnership with the NHS is of value to it and helps to nurture its development. That is why I support the amendment.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000066"></a>When I spoke so enthusiastically, with tongue in cheek, to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, I was simply concerned that any potential

However, when I heard the noble Baroness tell me what the costs would be, I was concerned. I am glad that the amendment was withdrawn. In this case, the argument of the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, has been powerful. She has drawn to our attention a whole series of problems that are beginning to emerge in a number of the foundation trusts.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000067"></a>What perhaps concerns me most is that the cap that has been imposed, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has said, was based upon the private charges in the base year of 2002-03&#151;six or seven years ago. The Government have themselves changed their attitude and developed many more public/private partnerships over the succeeding seven years. The cap needs to be considerably revised. As the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, has said, the legal framework of the private patient income cap is increasingly untenable. The amendment does not seek to remove the cap but to redefine it and, in doing so, to provide the opportunity to discuss how we can ensure that NHS patients derive even greater benefit from foundation trusts. For that reason, I support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000068"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09031795000277"></a>Lord Judd:</b> Before the Minister winds up this discussion, it might be of interest for the Committee to know just what the noble Baroness&#146;s position is. She has done a masterly job in presenting the case as the network wanted, but also clearly distancing herself from all the possible implications of that amendment. It would be immensely helpful if the noble Baroness, with whom I frequently find myself in complete agreement, could clarify whether she will vote for or against, or abstain from, the amendment.</p>

It seems to me that despite all that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has said, the world has moved on since we first debated the creation of foundation trusts six or more years ago. I suspect that we did not need reminding of how politically charged the issue then was, not so much between the Government and the Opposition as between the Government and their own supporters who were extremely suspicious of this new animal that Ministers were trying to foist on the NHS. Many of them could not come to terms with the idea because they did not feel confident that foundation trusts would in practice operate like NHS bodies. That was why the private income cap was inserted. It was seen as a guarantee that publicly owned hospitals could not move surreptitiously out of the NHS and into the independent sector.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000071"></a>We have now had several years&#146; experience of foundation trusts and it should be clear to everybody that they are, and always have been, very firmly members

Monitor, as regulator, has been outstandingly successful. Trusts are only authorised to operate within very strict terms and their managerial freedoms are counterbalanced by regulatory restrictions. But the private patient income cap was always going to be a problem. Because it originated as more of a political totem than anything else, it was set up in such a way as to be completely inflexible, which was never going to make sense in the real world. At the time I remember pointing out that the cap would prevent a forward-looking, go-ahead foundation trust from investing in a piece of capital equipment that it needed to treat NHS patients but which could only be justified financially if a certain number of private patients were also to avail of it. That absurd situation persists.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000072"></a>We now have the even more absurd situation of trusts such as those mentioned by the noble Baroness, and particularly health trusts, with low or zero private income caps being unable to implement government policy, which is the height of absurdity. The problem is not the rule but the inflexibility of the rule. Until his peroration at the end, I took the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, to be saying that there is no business case that would convince him that the rule should be relaxed. If that is his inflexible position, it is not a reasonable one and I am pleased that he slightly relented on it at the end of his speech.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000073"></a>The amendment is not quite in the form that I would wish to see. The noble Baroness has acknowledged that, but I genuinely believe that the time has come to amend the rule. I do not say that it should be done away with altogether or that there should be unlimited scope for a foundation trust to generate private income, but where a case can be made in the interests of the NHS for a trust to earn additional private income, why should it be prevented from doing so?</p>

<p><a name="09031795000074"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09031795000280"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> I wish to make only two very quick points at this stage. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, brought to life again for those of us who had the misfortune to be there, the battles of 2002. The fact that we ended up with such rigid agreements that many years after the fact are slightly absurd is entirely down to the way in which foundation trusts were introduced and sold by the Government. One of the key things that the Government did was to impress upon us all that foundation trusts would be liberated from the strictures of the NHS by having new freedoms. One of those new freedoms was that they would not be answerable in the same way as existing trusts.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000075"></a>I return to the opening, very tentative statement of the noble Baroness about the three conditions that she wanted: private patient work would not damage NHS patients; private patient work would benefit NHS patients; and there would have to be approval by governors for a significant increase in private work. I do not agree with the second point, because I do not think that that is sufficient accountability. I say to the noble Baroness that we are now five years into the existence of foundation trusts. It is high time for there to be a thorough review of the way in which they now work in the NHS. They are part of the NHS family, but we need to look in the round at what cost and what benefit they are to the rest of the NHS.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000076"></a>The noble Baroness is slightly premature in picking one particular aspect of foundation trusts and trying to change that; that is wrong. If she were to persist in doing that, I suggest to her that to satisfy those people who continue to have misgivings about an age-old problem in the NHS&#151;not whether there are private patient treatments but how there are private patient treatments&#151;there would have to be this: foundation trusts would have to accept the same principles, the same underpinning criteria, for selection for their agreement to private patient work, and they ought to be willing to give the same level of disclosure and accountability as other trusts. That is the level playing field that I would like us to examine before we go any further down either the road of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, or the road of the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000077"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09031795000281"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> Amendment 128, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, seeks to remove the current private patient cap that applies to foundation trusts. In its place, the amendment would introduce a new requirement for both foundation trusts and NHS trusts to,</p>
<ul><a name="09031795000231"></a>&#147;demonstrate the benefit to their NHS patients&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="09031795000186"></a>of any income that they may derive from private patients. The noble Baroness introduced this discussion with her customary thoughtfulness.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000078"></a>NHS providers should always focus their efforts on the provision of care to NHS patients. Any private work that they undertake should not compromise this fundamental objective, but there are different types of providers and so there are different ways to achieve the same end. NHS trusts are subject to the Secretary of State&#146;s direction. For example, he can direct them on their powers to provide services to private patients. NHS trusts are also performance-managed by strategic health authorities, which will expect them to follow national guidance on private provision.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000079"></a>Because NHS foundation trusts are not subject to these powers of direction or performance management, it was felt important that from the outset there should be some other protection in place. That is why, when we introduced the concept of NHS foundation trusts, we included in the 2003 Act an explicit restriction on private income&#151;the private patient cap&#151;for reasons that have been outlined by Members of the Committee. Members of the Committee will know that the introduction of a cap addressed a concern in Parliament that NHS foundation trusts would represent a step towards privatisation and destabilisation of the National Health Service.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000080"></a>As Members of the Committee may be aware, the way in which the law has been interpreted is the subject of an application for judicial review. The Government are an interested party in the legal proceedings. In those circumstances, I do not propose to comment in detail on the interpretation of the current provisions. Instead, I will restrict my remarks to the practical effect of the current law and of the amendment which has been tabled.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000081"></a>I understand that, in tabling the amendment, the noble Baroness seeks to highlight two issues. First, that the cap on private income does not apply to NHS trusts. Secondly, because the cap is based on levels of  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC77"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>activity in the financial year ending on 31 March 2003, there is wide variation between one NHS foundation trust and the next regarding the proportion of private work that they can now undertake.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000082"></a>I have already touched on the first of these issues. NHS trusts do not have a cap because their accountability arrangements are quite different from foundation trusts. There are different but no less effective safeguards in place. It is perhaps an oversimplification to suggest that there is a great disparity between NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts in this respect.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000083"></a>However, it is more difficult to ignore the second issue, that the variation in cap levels means that there will be some NHS foundation trusts with very low caps, or whose cap is set at 0 per cent. This is plainly true.</p>
<h5><a name="09031795000242"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000084"></a>What is the practical effect of those low and zero caps? One consequence may be the risk that continuity of care for some patients may be fragmented, as described by the noble Baroness. For example, if repeat cycles of IVF, for which a patient pays, mean that the cap is exceeded, the patient must go elsewhere to continue her treatment. More generally, some NHS foundation trusts may be unable to develop new patterns of service delivery, as outlined by the noble Baroness, which could potentially support our efforts to improve health and well-being, make services more widely accessible and available, and support innovation. We want NHS providers to be able to reach out into their communities, and work seamlessly and in partnership with their communities, the voluntary sector, employers and so on. This is especially, but not exclusively, true of mental health trusts. That this progress might be impeded by the private patient cap is a matter of some concern. The Government&#146;s position is that we seek to maintain and strengthen the protection of NHS services for NHS patients, which is non-negotiable. We cannot ignore the fact that the current cap locks some providers into historic levels of income derived from private charges, irrespective of what may be considered best for patients and public. For that reason, we are already discussing with a variety of stakeholders their views and concerns about this issue.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000085"></a>The interpretation of the current law is a matter for the courts and I have no desire to influence this. But we would like a broader debate about the longer term direction, as mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and about how to strike the best possible balance between protecting services for NHS patients, while at the same time creating maximum flexibility for NHS providers to serve the best interest of patients and the public. There are good reasons for keeping this approach under close review.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000086"></a>I turn now to the specifics of the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, which seeks to replace the cap with a new requirement for NHS foundation trusts and NHS trusts to demonstrate how any private income they earn benefits NHS patients. We have significant concerns about this approach, which would remove the restriction on NHS foundation trusts to grow their private provision. We recognise that income from privately funded work can be used  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC78"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to improve and widen the services for NHS patients. However, we believe that this amendment could potentially allow a market to develop in competition with the NHS. A test which simply requires private income to be used for the benefit of NHS patients could, in principle, allow an NHS foundation trust to generate almost half its income from private charges yet remain within the law and compliant with its terms of authorisation. We would not wish to see unrestricted private income in an NHS foundation trust leading to a poorer service for NHS patients&#151;for example, for this to interfere with its ability to carry out its NHS functions and obligations under NHS contracts with commissioners.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000087"></a>It is not clear how the proposed approach&#151;demonstrating benefit to NHS patients&#151;would work and be overseen in practice. Demonstrating benefit could be a highly subjective approach. I appreciate that the noble Baroness raised this matter in order to open the debate, but this proposal raises as many questions as it answers. Members of the Committee will understand that on this issue we are particularly keen not to introduce ambiguity and uncertainty.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000088"></a>I want to assure the Committee that our goal is to ensure that NHS foundation trusts remain focused on the provision of the high quality services they deliver for NHS patients. As part of this, we are committed to their ongoing development and share their desire to promote innovation, enterprise and partnership working. I do not believe that it would be sensible or timely to prejudge this debate, nor should we attempt to make changes to the current law while it is subject to an application for judicial review. Therefore, I would ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000089"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09031795000282"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> I thank the Minister and all Members of the Committee who have contributed to this discussion. In response to points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, FTs should be as transparent as NHS trusts. In fact, in my view, they are far more transparent because we have to account to our boards of governors and the local people who can go everywhere, including our wards. On the whole, the Secretary of State does not tend to do that. We are absolutely transparent to our local communities. We are also accountable to Parliament. I believe that those are good safeguards, but I would always support an evaluation of any model of treatment of any kind. However, at the moment, all evaluations of foundation trusts and NHS trusts show the foundation trust to be vastly better in terms of the quality of services that they provide. No doubt there are other ways of looking at these things, and I would absolutely support that.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000090"></a>As the Minister recognises, this is a probing amendment; there is no question of putting it to a vote at any stage. However, it is an important issue. We currently have a very unsatisfactory situation. I hope that we can continue discussions on how best to ensure that we have a better, fairer system in the future. On that basis, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I have spent seven Committee sittings in this Room listening&#151;actually, trying to avoid catching my noble friend&#146;s cold and, as Members of the Committee will see, my upper respiratory tract has finally succumbed so I did not succeed. However, I have sat patiently, listening to ways of improving the lives and safety of our citizens, and of improving already good health services for a very privileged population in this part of the world. This amendment is, for me, the most important. It addresses what we do for some of the most oppressed and unfortunate people in the world. I feel passionately about it, and ashamed that, as a privileged nation, we do not do enough.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000092"></a>This is a probing amendment, to clarify an unclear, confused and sometimes inhumane policy that has operated since 2004. Since then, there has been no free treatment for refused asylum seekers in hospitals except in emergencies. Ostensibly, this puts people&#146;s lives in danger and requires doctors to consider immigration status before treating a patient. This is difficult for  a doctor who simply wants to help the patient. Organisations representing asylum seekers have many examples of patient suffering which they, of course, have given to me.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000093"></a>People with non-life-threatening illnesses can be turned away until those illnesses become a life threatening emergency. As a simple example, what happens if you are a diabetic? You cannot access treatment because it is not an emergency, but if you go into a diabetic coma and could die, it is an emergency and you will then be treated. This is extraordinary.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000094"></a>Cases are cited where failed asylum seekers who have been admitted to intensive care from accident and emergency departments are charged for further treatment when they leave the intensive care unit. You cannot go straight home, but you have to pay for the rest of the treatment. Some asylum seekers who are too ill to be deported are denied treatment that would make them well enough to return home. GPs often refuse to register failed asylum seekers and refer them to accident and emergency departments instead. There have been examples of pregnant women being denied maternity care or being made to pay enormous fees.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000095"></a>Of all these examples, the one that concerns me most is that of people with conditions deemed not an emergency being refused treatment until it becomes one. I cannot imagine a concept that goes against medical ethics more than that; it is quite extraordinary.

As a Member of the Parliament in the other place whose constituency had its fair share of asylum seekers, because it was very close to Heathrow Airport, I know how long it can take before a failed asylum seeker actually gets returned home. It can be a very long time indeed.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000096"></a>Moreover, the UK is signed up to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951, which  says that host countries must provide those fleeing tyranny and persecution with access to health services, housing, education and employment. Even at the point of entry, when application is made for asylum, we do not do basic testing that would help the individual and protect our society. Testing for TB, hepatitis and HIV should be routine. If people are being tortured, swift referral to psychotherapy would help them and us&#151;our society. It is terribly important that children should have their vaccination status assessed and be vaccinated against childhood diseases if necessary. Why is that not done?</p>

<a name="90317-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000097"></a>I am well aware of the list of conditions exempt from these regulations. I have them here&#151;I have been sent the list&#151;and I thank the department very much for that. They are all conditions that are relatively obvious and are certainly a great danger to our society as well as the asylum seekers. We take those measures, but the rationale for the current policy was to protect us from health tourism, whereby foreign nationals deliberately come for healthcare. If you cross the continent of Africa and trust yourself to some unseaworthy little boat, are at sea for I do not know how long, finally make land and are accepted as an asylum seeker, apparently you have come deliberately for healthcare treatment and you are a health tourist. I am very sceptical.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000098"></a>Many people do come for medical treatment in this country, and they pay for it in the private sector where the healthcare is often world-renowned. Overseas visitors can be distinguished in most cases from asylum seekers, I would contend. Where are the figures for health tourism that you hear about? Is it just the anecdotes of taxi drivers, or is there real, hard evidence? This year the Royal College of General Practitioners concluded:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031795000213"></a>&#147;There is no evidence that asylum seekers enter the country because they wish to benefit from free health care&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000187"></a>Other doctors have supported this view, and the general opinion is that the psychological and physical health of asylum seekers, especially those who become failed asylum seekers, worsens progressively in the UK asylum system.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000099"></a>At this point, I shall briefly address Amendment 132, which would exempt HIV treatment from charges, irrespective of residency status. This would ensure that everyone in the UK, including failed asylum seekers, would be able to access HIV treatment while in the UK. We offer testing and counselling for HIV, which would, one hopes, reduce the risk of HIV being spread by sexual contact&#151;or would it? Might the fact that no treatment is available unless you pay for it make a failed asylum seeker less likely to have the test in the first place? I think that it would.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000100"></a>HIV sufferers are not a huge public health hazard in the same way as are the conditions on the exempted list that I mentioned under Amendment 130, but full-blown AIDS is extremely debilitating and might make an individual too sick to be sent home. What is gained then? We discussed the protection of our society from HIV when the Health and Social Care Bill came through this Chamber last year, and vigorously defended the need for some degree of protection for the HIV carrier from discrimination now and in future. This amendment seeks to add the right&#151;and it is a right, I contend, under the convention on refugees&#151;that AIDS sufferers receive treatment so long as they remain in this country. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have chosen not to charge for HIV treatment, so why do we in England? I remind this Committee that it is the only serious communicable disease and the only sexually transmitted infection for which treatment is not provided free of charge, irrespective of residency status.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000101"></a>Finally, in April 2008, Mr Justice Mitting ruled that failed asylum seekers should be classed as ordinarily resident in the UK and be entitled to NHS treatment. This judgment is currently being appealed by the Government through, I think, a judicial review. There is great confusion in the system. Vulnerable people are suffering as a result. This country is also probably in breach of an international convention on the status of refugees. We have no reason to be proud or complacent on this issue. I beg to move the amendment.</p>

I remember that one witness, a highly qualified medical person working in the sphere of care for people in this predicament, suddenly became very indignant in the course of giving her evidence and said that as a result of this policy, we are putting people in this country at risk from infection.

This is a serious issue. I find it almost inconceivable that as a civilised nation we can behave in this muddled, insensitive way. I agree with the noble Baroness when she spells out the acute suffering that many of these people have been through, even before they reach our shores.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000104"></a>I also strongly endorse her point that we keep hearing about tourism for health reasons but have never seen any hard evidence to substantiate it. It all seems to be impressionistic and anecdotal. This issue is far too serious for policy to be formulated on that basis. I am one of those, and I am sure I will be to my dying day, who believe that it is disgraceful that we all, in all parts of the political life of our country, allow ourselves to be influenced and held to ransom by the tabloid press. So much of the policy in this area is really dictated by the tabloid press, as distinct from what it should be: objective, sound analysis of what the problems really are, what the needs really are and how we as a civilised nation should respond. I am deeply grateful to the noble Baroness for having moved this amendment. I am sure that she will have unlimited good will from the Committee, and I am equally confident that my noble friend shares the anxieties expressed and will try to meet them in her reply.</p>

This is surely a perfect example of a group of people who need to be protected under the convention and our own legislation. I strongly support the amendment.</p>

I shall concentrate on the two ethical questions which the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, raised. The first related to the right of all human beings to have access to healthcare, which is included in a whole collection of international agreements, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which states that Governments may not limit equal access to healthcare. It seems that all sides of the Committee have a concern for compassion and a concern to establish that right of human access to healthcare. We have therefore come to a point where we need to find a way in which we can establish that.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000107"></a>Much of the best information on destitution of, and healthcare for, asylum seekers and refused asylum seekers in Leeds comes from the Rowntree report, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, was one of the major contributors. That the need for mental healthcare among those who have come to our country fleeing torture derives originally from that torture but has been added to by destitution and the ways in which they have felt unwelcome within our own society is one of the reasons why it is important that we find a way in which we can provide properly for their healthcare.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000108"></a>The noble Baroness developed fully the second major ethical issue; namely, that healthcare professionals are given by the present law the duty to consider a person&#146;s immigration status rather than their need for care. That cannot be acceptable in any society, and the BMA has described it as such. I hope that we shall be able to find a way in which people from a wide variety of situations and political convictions can come together in compassion for some of those in most need in our society. Acceptance of this amendment or something like it would be a way in which we could signal our compassion and alleviate the fears not only of asylum seekers but of hundreds of others in our cities who are seeking to help them and who find it impossible to explain to them the justification for our present law.</p>

I have been struck by the wide range of individuals and groups who are dismayed by the Government&#146;s current policy on healthcare access for refused asylum seekers, whether they be children, old people or torture victims. During my time on the Joint Committee on Human Rights&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Judd, has reminded us of that&#151;I was struck by the information we received from people working in the health field as to how the policy was operated, which seemed to all of us to be in many cases inhumane and counterproductive.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000110"></a>Since that was two years ago, I had a look at the more recent evidence session before the Home Affairs Select Committee on this question, which was in November of last year. That was a very informative session, some of which is worth putting on the record today. Professor Nathanson of the BMA described the situation as,</p>
<ul><a name="09031795000232"></a>&#147;the asylum seekers, the failed asylum seekers, the undocumented individuals&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09031795000188"></a>do not access healthcare very often.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031795000214"></a>&#147;The evidence is that they access services late; that they believe they have no right of access; but very often they are frightened to access; and ... more often of course they do not know how to&#148;.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000111"></a>The committee asked what would happen to a doctor who acts in a clinically disobedient way and provides medication when the patient has not paid. The answer came from Lisa Power at the Terrence Higgins Trust. She said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031795000215"></a>&#147;There would certainly be disciplinary activity within the hospital were the hospital to seek that. There are a large number of clinicians who are so&#148;&#151;</p>

At the time of my membership of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, we heard a large amount of evidence about the activities of the Revenue retrieval teams. I believe that they exist and that they undertake activities.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000114"></a>I ask the Minister this: is it not rather undesirable for the state to require people who have a very high ethical standard to take actions that require them to go to a lower ethical standard and then put them in the position of having to use stratagems in order to do their moral and professional duty? Is it not strange that professional health workers in Scotland and Wales, as I understand it, do not have to do this because in both jurisdictions that is a step too far? I share the view of the Minister that has been expressed by others and I am very optimistic that she will respond positively to what Members of the Committee are saying.</p>

As a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on AIDS, I should like to ask the Minister: why are people waiting in England for decisions about their status, or if they are waiting to be deported, denied HIV drugs? From a public health interest, why are those vulnerable people denied therapy, which would make them less infective? People with HIV/AIDS in the UK are covered by the Disability Discrimination Act. Are these individuals not classified as people? Is it not odd to treat them for TB and not HIV/AIDS if they are co-infected? Many people will not come forward with HIV because of stigma, and stigma among their own people is worse than other sorts of stigma. The present situation just makes a double stigma.</p>

One estimate I have seen is that there are as many as 20,000 of them and many are in the immigrant population, including asylum seekers. This risks the further spread of infection for obvious reasons. Many of these people are put off seeking tests, because they fear both that it might affect their immigration status and, as the noble Baroness has said, the potential costs of treatment should they be so diagnosed. The amendment will protect public health in this country and should therefore be supported.</p>

We reported this in our interim findings, and again in our third report, <I>Deserving Dignity</I>. To take HIV/AIDS as an example, we have had submissions from the National AIDS Trust, the Terrence Higgins Trust, the Refugee Council and the George House Trust. They basically said that it was a disgrace that refused asylum seekers are unable to access hospital care when the cost of caring, say, for a destitute mother with HIV/AIDS is so much greater than the initial treatment.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000118"></a>We have heard examples&#151;I will not repeat them&#151;of excessive charges for, for example, maternity care. Citizens Advice says that a mother can be asked for as much as &#163;2,500, which she will not have. I was interested to learn of a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that, while we know that asylum seekers suffer from persecution in their country of origin, their health may suffer further because of destitution in this country. In other words, we in the UK have become a source of persecution. Few of them have the means of supporting themselves, let alone their healthcare. We are just forcing them further into the accident and emergency category.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000119"></a>Refugee Action found that 83 per cent of those surveyed said that they had had serious problems since arriving in the UK, despite the relevant fact that four out of five in that survey were between the ages of 21 and 40. Any trauma suffered overseas is compounded by the isolation and deprivation that they experience when they arrive in the UK; and then, in many cases, they are turned away. One wonders why the Government are hesitating in the face of this evidence. Are they still clinging to the deterrent argument? We all remember that there was some logic behind that a few years ago, and some of us believed in it and expected it to work. It does not work; the evidence is otherwise. We have heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, and the Royal College of General Practitioners that there is no evidence that immigrants enter the country because they wish to benefit from free healthcare. That was endorsed by the British Medical Journal. In 2005, the then Minister was asked what health tourism cost the NHS. He admitted that it was,</p>
<ul><a name="09031795000233"></a>&#147;not possible to give a definitive assessment of the scale of health tourism&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 1/3/05; col. 1076W.]</ul>
<p><a name="09031795000190"></a>I expect that the Minister will confirm that this is still the case and that it is a dead issue.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000120"></a>More important than that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, has said, it is against medical ethics to deny healthcare to anyone in need. There is plenty of evidence of the urgent need of so-called &#147;failed&#148; asylum seekers. They are not &#147;failed&#148;&#151;they are in many cases waiting to leave the country. Unfortunately, two out of five have problems accessing a general practitioner.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000121"></a>Finally, there is public opinion. Asylum seekers are constantly and unfairly confused with illegal migrants. I am not going to go into that, I just urge the Minister to look at the arguments in the Welsh Assembly to take account of the number of members of the public who are positively in favour of genuine asylum seekers and others who may have slipped through the net but who are still deserving of the highest standards of care, for which our health service has a good reputation.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000123"></a>First, I emphasise that we recognise and respect our duty to ensure that the provision of healthcare is fully compliant with human rights principles. That is why immediately necessary and urgent treatment for any medical need, including HIV and AIDS, must never be denied or delayed, irrespective of a person&#146;s right of abode or ability to pay. Decisions about need are  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC86"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC86</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>always clinical and are made solely by a clinical professional. I think I am going to repeat that: decisions about need are always clinical and are made solely by a clinical professional. The suggestion made by the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, the right reverend Prelate and others that this is not the case is somewhat unfair.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000124"></a>The regulation to which Amendment 130 refers already ensures that people seeking asylum or refuge have full, free access to healthcare throughout their application, including any appeals. This should already capture most human rights applicants, and we are currently reviewing whether any other genuine applicants are being excluded. I met the noble Baroness and my noble friend Lord Dubs, who is interested in this issue, to discuss that review. It is taking place now, and that is at the heart of what I have to say.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000125"></a>The amendment would extend this so that anyone who had made an application for leave to stay in the UK, either as an asylum seeker or under the human rights convention, would be exempt from charges, even if that application had been decided and, indeed, rejected. In other words, he would continue to receive free treatment indefinitely, even if it was established that he was not in need of the protection or sanctuary of the UK. In deciding whether such a significant extension is appropriate, we must, while still paying due regard to human rights principles, also take account of other factors.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000126"></a>The NHS, which is free at the point of need, is one of the most generous provisions that any country provides. We legitimately need to ask whether we can provide all healthcare free of charge to people who are not legitimate residents in the UK. Also, might such an amendment not encourage applications under the human rights convention, particularly for chronic conditions? I am dubious about that, and I share the questions of the noble Baroness about that. I am not saying that any of these arguments should justify the denial of human rights in the provision of healthcare. However, decisions on the extent of free NHS provision must consider all these factors, such as public health, clinical costs and cost implications.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000127"></a>In terms of retrieving revenue, it is the case that NHS trusts are obliged to charge and then seek repayment. However, if it is then obvious that the people whom they are trying to retrieve from have no funds, they are not required to pursue it.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000128"></a>On Amendment 132, HIV/AIDS is one of the world&#146;s most significant medical and human challenges. Although the number of new diagnoses of HIV in the UK appears to be stabilising, HIV continues to be a major global health concern with 2.5 million new infections in 2007. Once diagnosed, a patient requires lifelong treatment. I have already said that nobody should be denied clinical treatment if it is urgent or immediately necessary, nor should it be delayed, irrespective of their ability to pay.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000129"></a>However, this amendment would make all treatment for HIV/AIDS free, creating a number of risks that we would have to take into consideration. First, what is the capacity of the NHS to provide for a demand for clinical provision that its likely to be significant? What would the additional financial burden be, and is it affordable? Those are legitimate questions.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000130"></a>The approach that the Government are taking is an international one. We provide support to countries with high HIV prevalence to improve their own facilities and resources to combat HIV. The Department for International Development provided over &#163;1.5 billion between 2005 and 2008 for this purpose, and its AIDS strategy, published last year, included a further funding commitment of over &#163;6 billion over the next seven years to strengthen healthcare systems.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000131"></a>I am not saying that any of those arguments rule out extending free NHS provision, but we do have to consider those factors. Both the amendments raise complex issues, which is why the review of access to the NHS for foreign nationals has been set up. Both amendments fall within the review&#146;s scope; its recommendations will be put to a full formal consultation and agreed changes will be subject to the appropriate parliamentary process.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000132"></a>I should make a procedural point that the regulations to which these amendments refer are secondary, not primary, legislation, so the proposed means of amendment through this Health Bill is  not appropriate. However, I am pleased that the amendments have provided the Committee with the opportunity to debate these issues and for those views to be taken into consideration in the review. I hope that with those reassurances about our ongoing work to tackle those issues the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

There is clearly an entirely different understanding on the part of the department and of the HIV charities about the position of staff who are treating people with HIV. The Minister and her officials had a very helpful meeting with me and my noble friend Lady Tonge, during which they explained the point that the Minister made&#151;that clinical decision-making always takes priority over the assessment of whether somebody has proper residence status or the ability to pay. Yet we have this distinction about HIV being a communicable, infectious disease for which people have the right to have a test but not to have treatment. What do clinicians do in that case? They carry out the test, and it becomes immediately apparent that somebody immediately needs antiretroviral therapies, which will not be a cure but will enable him to live. We also know that antiretroviral therapies are comparatively expensive drug therapies in the NHS. If the clinicians work in a trust that has a policy that it will not treat people who are not eligible, what then happens to the individual? It seems that there is a problem here. For most conditions, we can get away with doing it on the quiet and being humane on the quiet, but HIV is the particular problem, and it is different from all the other conditions.</p>

I have thought and thought about this and feel we cannot simply say that it is the discretion of the medical practitioner to treat or to decide whether or not a situation is an emergency. We know of many examples of people not being treated when they need treatment. Whether it is because doctors do not understand the law or have not read the documents&#151;it is more likely that they have read them but do not understand them&#151;we know of examples of people being sadly neglected, especially, as my noble friend has said, in the case of HIV/AIDS.</p>

<p class="amendment_hs_quote"><a name="09031795000219"></a>It shall be the duty of primary care trusts and hospital trusts to work with passenger transport authorities, unitary authorities and county councils, as appropriate, to co-ordinate the provision of patient transport services provided by primary care trusts and hospital trusts with the provision of other passenger transport within the trusts&#146; areas.&#148;</p>

I shall be very brief, because there is one other important amendment to consider tonight. I have tabled the amendment because of concerns that I have been made aware of that an existing failure to co-ordinate transport for patients  is both wasting public funds and making travel to  and from hospital unnecessarily difficult for many people.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000143"></a>For example, I have been told that 25 per cent of the &#147;did not attends&#148; at Newham Hospital can be attributed to transport problems. This is a problem that will have been distressing for the patients concerned, who may not get another appointment for some time, and it is at an incredible cost to the NHS, which has a statutory duty to provide patient transport. While it is right for patients to have such transport provided, I suggest that it is not sensible for the NHS to be providing this service without any consideration as to whether passenger transport authorities, unitary authorities and county councils might assist in meeting that need, possibly at a much lower cost than that faced by the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000144"></a>My amendment seeks to insert a clause requiring primary care trusts and hospital trusts to co-ordinate and co-operate with those other authorities to address this issue. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000146"></a>The noble Baroness is absolutely correct that it is vital for the NHS to engage with its local passenger transport authorities and key partners. Providing a health service that is of high quality and is responsive to the needs of the patient lies at the heart of our vision of a modern NHS. Ensuring that people can access those services is part of this aim. I hope that significant steps have already been taken in this area. The Government have introduced a comprehensive policy framework on patient transport services,  which clearly sets out the expectation that NHS transport commissioners will work with other transport services when co-ordinating access to healthcare facilities.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000147"></a>Following a public consultation, guidance to PCTs published in August 2007 clearly states that they are responsible for commissioning ambulance services and patient transport services to such extent as the PCT considers necessary. Where necessary, patients with a social need for transport may seek reimbursement, as the noble Baroness will know. Alternatively, they may seek assistance in the form of a Social Fund payment. Patients not receiving a qualifying benefit may be eligible for assistance through the NHS Low Income Scheme.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000148"></a>We remain clear that multi-agency working can lead to more effective, user-focused transport services. For example, the Northwest Regional Centre of Excellence is soon to publish a document presenting examples of good practice on passenger transport. This will show how health organisations and local authorities have worked together across a range of health, transport, education and social care services to ensure that patients are offered the most appropriate transport service that best meets their individual needs. We are committed to supporting the NHS in ensuring that good practice such as this can be spread more widely. That is the core of what we want to do.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000149"></a>There is already a framework in place to support and encourage the NHS to work in partnership with other passenger transport agencies. I hope that the noble Baroness will feel reassured by this brief and rushed answer. As she rightly noted, we have one more amendment to discuss. I hope that she will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

For one dread moment, such was the heat generated by the debates on tobacco, I thought that we might all go up in smoke; but mercifully, due not least to the customary fortitude of my noble friend Lady Thornton, we have survived to address now the urgency of the needs of a small community of congenitally disabled people who, in the words from the scriptures, are living in sorrow and acquainted with grief.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000153"></a>I have interests to declare, not pecuniary, as president of the Haemophilia Society and architect of the independent public inquiry, headed so admirably by my noble and learned friend Lord Archer, into NHS-supplied contaminated blood and blood products, some of whose recommendations could be implemented by acceptance of the new clause, either now or on Report, pending fuller debate and further action on its findings as a whole.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000154"></a>I am most deeply grateful to my noble and learned friend and his colleagues in the inquiry team, Dr Norman Jones and Judith Willetts. Their report, exhaustively researched, is one also of excelling integrity and humane concern for arguably the most stricken minority in Britain today. I warmly acknowledge, too, the help of my noble friend Lord Turnberg who, as immediate past president of the of the Royal College of Physicians, served the inquiry with such skill and commitment until he and his wife Edna were so tragically bereaved.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000155"></a>When I set up the inquiry two years ago, 1,757 haemophilia patients had already died from being infected by their NHS treatment with HIV and/or  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC92"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC92</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>hepatitis C. The death toll has since risen by more than 200, and many more are left terminally ill by what my noble friend Lord Winston, vice-president of the Haemophilia Society, has described as the worst-ever treatment disaster in the history of the National Health Service.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000156"></a>Yet the grievous death toll is not the whole story; the haemophilia community suffers privation at a depth that most other people can barely imagine. I had a letter yesterday from a friend of a haemophilia patient infected with hepatitis C, which described his plight. He is uninsured due to the prohibitive premiums imposed by insurers on people with his condition. He can no longer work full time and his income is in sharp decline. Travel and other costs are becoming too high for him to cope with, and a mortgage deal is out of the question. In the noble tradition of Good Samaritans, the man who wrote to me has himself been helping his friend financially, but now he, too, is facing the loss of full-time employment. This is but one example of the urgency of the need now for purposeful action on the Archer report, of which approval of this new clause would be a clear signal to the haemophilia community that at long last its plight has been recognised at Westminster and in Whitehall.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000157"></a>For parliamentarians, there can be no higher duty than that of ensuring just treatment for those afflicted and bereaved by contaminated and life-threatening medication supplied by the state, and the emphatic backing of the report's recommendations by the mass media as a whole shows how clearly that duty is understood by the people of this country. It was just as clearly understood, too, by my right honourable friend Harriet Harman MP, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the House of Commons, when speaking on 5 March. Already having thanked my noble and learned friend Lord Archer, for his &#147;important work&#148;, she told my honourable friend Dr Brian Iddon of her,</p>
<ul><a name="09031795000234"></a>&#147;congratulations to the campaigners&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09031795000191"></a>on having,</p>
<ul><a name="09031795000235"></a>&#147;brought to the public&#146;s attention the injustice that they have suffered&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09031795000192"></a>from contaminated NHS blood and blood products. She also made it clear to the House of Commons that:</p>
<ul><a name="09031795000236"></a>&#147;The Government will respond shortly&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 5/3/09; cols. 993, 999.]</ul>
<p><a name="09031795000193"></a>Thus the Haemophilia Society now looks forward to a positive response to the landmark report that she so fulsomely welcomed.</p>
<h5><a name="09031795000246"></a>7.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000158"></a>There are two other issues to which I must briefly refer. The first is the sombre threat now of a third scourge facing the haemophilia community. I refer to the increasing number of haemophilia patients known by the Department of Health to have received blood from donors who subsequently died of vCJD, and the recently reported case of one hepatitis C-infected patient, a post mortem on whom revealed vCJD in his spleen. I was informed more than once on the authority of the Chief Medical Officer that the risk for recipients of blood donors who subsequently died of vCJD was purely &#147;hypothetical&#148;; but that demonstrably is not the case now.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC93"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column GC93</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000159"></a>Is donated blood currently being screened, or filtered to remove vCJD infection? If it is not, can my noble friend in replying to the debate say what protection is in place to safeguard recipients of donated blood? I understand, and my noble friend will confirm whether it is so, that technology is now available to remove by filter the abnormal prions which are the causative agent of vCJD and that it has passed EU-wide safety testing and clinical trials as required for its use in the UK. The haemophilia community, like Members of both sides of both Houses of Parliament, are anxious to secure ministerial assurances of urgent and effective action in this policy area, and I look forward to my noble friend&#146;s response to the questions that I have raised.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000160"></a>The other issue to which I must finally refer is that of Crown immunity, on which the Archer report raises in commenting on behaviour of the Blood Products Laboratory (BPL). The report says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031795000227"></a>&#147;In July 1979, the Medicines Inspectorate visited BPL. They reported that the buildings were never designed for the scale of production envisaged. They commented: &#145;If this were a commercial operation we would have no hesitation in recommending that manufacture should cease until the facility was upgraded to a minimum acceptable level.&#146;&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000194"></a>The report then says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031795000228"></a>&#147;BPL was rescued by Crown Immunity&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09031795000195"></a>and goes on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="09031795000237"></a>&#147;the existing plant continued production, relying on Crown Immunity to dispense with all the requirements of the Medicines Act, but was able to meet only about 40 per cent of the national requirements&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09031795000196"></a>Surely, words have lost their meaning if this does not mean that by the use of Crown immunity, a relic of feudal England, the lives of countless haemophilia patients were blatantly and gravely put at risk.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000161"></a>In this House on 10 March, the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, responding to me in exchanges about thalidomide, referred to,</p>
<ul><a name="09031795000238"></a>&#147;the tremendous amount of work that has gone into the marketing, testing and regulation of drugs, as encapsulated in the Medicines Act 1968, from which society has benefited greatly&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 10/3/09; col. 1059.]</ul>
<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000162"></a>There could be no clearer text for describing the enormity of the use by the BPL of Crown immunity to dispense with all the requirements of that renowned and vital statute. I beg to move.</p>

It is late, so I will attempt to get my words out quickly. The noble Lord, Lord Morris, has been a vigilant campaigner on behalf of people with haemophilia, especially those affected by contaminated blood products. He is to be applauded for calling the independent public inquiry, chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, which reported last month.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000164"></a>I declare an interest: my first husband, Graham Ingleson, and his brother, Anthony, died as a result of receiving contaminated factor VIII blood products. Graham was 34 years old when he died and, at the same age, I became a widow. The scandalously slow reaction by previous Governments to safeguard blood products imported from the United States meant that

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000165"></a>The amendment proposes establishing a committee that will go some way to righting a great wrong which was done to those people. It is not a big initiative&#151;it is just a committee&#151;which would be a small, uncostly affair. The committee would not only improve the care of those who have suffered from the blood scandal, it would also help thousands of people with haemophilia who, with the right treatment, could lead long and active lives, working and building families. They are great when they have their treatment. You would not even know that they have a disability. Finally, as I have often said in the past, those with the most expertise of long-term conditions are those who experience them. I welcome, under subsection (3) of the proposed new clause, the holistic spread of the proposed commissioners; namely, charity supporters, Department of Health officials and, most importantly, the patients.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000166"></a>Every year on the anniversary of my husband&#146;s death, I visit the church of St Botolph without Bishopsgate in the City of London. At the back of the church is a small memorial book, which names those haemophiliacs who have died as a result of contaminated blood products. Every year, new names appear. Every year, haemophiliacs living with the consequences of lethal treatment&#151;it was lethal treatment&#151;require the very best information, advice and support. The proposed committee could provide that help. The Government have this opportunity to show that they recognise the extraordinary plight of haemophiliacs and I hope that they, and Members of the Committee, will feel able to support this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000167"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09031795000309"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> At this late hour, it would not be right to go into the many issues raised in the Archer inquiry. It is a very good report, which deserves serious and detailed consideration by this House. If it has established one thing, it is that people from all political parties were in different ways involved and that some have taken responsibility. This is not a partisan issue. I would suggest that it is an issue that the House of Lords is well placed to look at in some depth. I do not want to dishearten the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester. I am not sure whether his proposal for a committee is right, but I am willing to listen to the Committee on that. What I am most concerned about is that the Government&#146;s response should be timely and appropriate. It is a great shame that the Government did not contribute to the inquiry chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, but they are under an obligation to respond in a timely fashion. The government response perhaps needs to be in two parts: one an urgent response to the needs of people who are currently living with the consequences of being given these blood products, whose needs are urgent and serious, and the other on the wider question of what we should learn from the inquiry. That response would be much longer and more detailed.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000168"></a>We would do well to consider things that happen in other healthcare systems, particularly the response in the American healthcare system, although it is an entirely different system, and what should happen in our healthcare system is not the same. Many deep

They deserve to be looked at, but let us not use them as a reason to delay responding to the urgent needs of people who need help now. Similarly, let us not use the urgent needs of people now as a reason to give a cursory response to those quite deep questions.</p>

I hope that we will have a constructive reply from the Minister this evening in so far as she has time to deliver one. I understand that the Government did not provide witnesses to the inquiry chaired so ably by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer. That was regrettable. I join the noble Baroness in congratulating the noble and learned Lord on an excellent and thorough report. Great credit is due to him, his colleagues and all those who gave evidence to him. One of the things that I have learnt from the report is that there are too many haemophilia patients currently suffering hardship and serious distress as a result of this worst of all healthcare accidents in the history of the NHS. The Government have a moral obligation to give careful consideration to the report and to respond to its recommendations for the sake of those patients.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000170"></a><b><a name="90317-gc0008.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09031795000311"></a>Baroness Masham of Ilton:</b> I declare an interest as a vice-president of the Haemophilia Association. This seems to be a reasonable amendment. People with haemophilia have had the most unfortunate time over the years since the emergence of HIV/AIDS. In the early years of HIV, it was found that 75 per cent of haemophiliacs at the Newcastle upon Tyne unit developed HIV, and many of them have died. Hepatitis C was also found to be a problem. So was variant CJD, and nobody knows whether it will present itself and to whom. It has been horrific for people who have died from CJD and for their families.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000171"></a>Safety in blood and blood products is of the utmost importance. While I was visiting a haemophilia unit in Leeds, the telephone rang. It was a teacher from a school asking if a haemophiliac boy could play football. There are so many questions to be asked and answered. A united committee could give support and information to those involved with this challenging speciality, which needs all the support it can get. This amendment may be the last on the Bill, but this is an important issue. The work with prions needs top scientists to find a way of protecting everybody from the dangers of contaminated or tainted blood. It could affect anyone at any time.</p>

<p><a name="09031795000175"></a>Amendment 133, laid by my noble friends Lord Morris and Lord Corbett, is based on a recommendation made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, in his recent report, published on 23 February. The report, as we all know, considered the supply of virus-contaminated blood and blood products, and its devastating effect on the haemophilia community in particular from the early 1970s until tests became available for hepatitis C and HIV.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000176"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that my noble and learned friend&#146;s report is a wonderful document. I warmly thank him again, and my noble friend Lord Morris, for their work on behalf of haemophilia patients and their families. We recognise that the lives of many people have been seriously impaired and appreciate that noble Lords wish to take every opportunity to remedy this situation as far as they are able.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000177"></a>The establishment of a statutory committee is one of a number of recommendations made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer. The Government take the report very seriously. We are giving careful consideration to all the recommendations. In light of this, it would be premature to implement any one of the recommendations before we have had time to consider the implications. However, some feedback from the Government on this matter is entirely possible before we reach the next stage of the Bill, which I hope that noble Lords will take into consideration.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000178"></a>My noble friend asked about vCJD screening tests. He is quite correct that no screening test was available. Getting a validated screening test is a priority. Prion filters are available, which we are testing with all speed. Those tests are still under way. Addressing this situation is a priority. We are taking the matter very seriously indeed.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000179"></a>There is no doubt that this group of patients has suffered tragic consequences as a result of these serious infections. It is important to ensure that the patients concerned and their families are properly supported, and to act to reduce as far as practically possible any future risk to patients who need blood and blood products.</p>

<a name="90317-gc0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031795000180"></a>I am sorry that we are unable to consider the matter further. I suspect and hope that we shall have a much longer and more serious debate on aspects of the report in the House. I have answered one question; we have dealt with it very briefly. That is not a satisfactory way of dealing with the important report of my noble and learned friend. However, until all its aspects have been considered, I would ask my noble friend to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="09031761000003"></a><b><a name="90317-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09031761000071"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State (Kevan Jones) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09031761000004"></a>An asset survey of service family accommodation (SFA) in England and Wales has been carried out as part of the housing prime contract with MODern Housing Solutions.  The survey was initially designed to compile an asset register (detailing for instance the make and model of boilers) but its scope was extended to collect &#147;standard for condition&#148; information and life-cycle data for planning purposes.  The results of the survey will provide improved management information to help us plan for the future and we will use the data from now on to inform reporting on the condition of SFA.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09031761000005"></a>Of the 44,000 properties in England and Wales, to date we have analysed condition data for over 40,500 properties.  The remaining properties will be surveyed between now and April 2010.  Consideration is being given to undertaking similar surveys of SFA in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where the properties are maintained under regional prime contracts.  A survey of the overseas housing estate is already in progress.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09031761000006"></a>The survey was visual and carried out by professionally qualified surveyors.  Over 300 items of data were collected for each property and the improved information resulting has led to changes in the numbers of properties in each of the four standards for condition (standard 1 being the highest and standard 4 the lowest).</p>

<a name="90317-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09031761000007"></a>Previously reported figures reflected the results of a condition survey undertaken in 1996.  The more detailed information collected in the present survey has changed the balance between standard 1 and 2 for condition.  Overall, around 90 per cent of SFA in England and Wales falls within these two standards but 32 per cent is now assessed at standard 1 and 57 per cent as being at standard 2, broadly reversing the previous position.  Standard 2 properties are considered to be of a high standard, and both those and standard 1 properties have been assessed by the NAO as meeting or exceeding the Government&#146;s decent homes standard.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09031761000008"></a>The condition of each property is assessed against eight groupings of items (for example, relating to the building fabric, or kitchen).  Each grouping receives its own standard for condition and the lowest of these decides the overall standard of the property.  Hence a property could be assessed as standard 2 (rather than 1) if seven of its groupings are at standard 1 but one is at standard 2.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09031761000009"></a>The number of houses falling into standard 4 has increased, though remains fewer than 450. Service families are no longer required to live in such properties, although some choose to do so.  From 2012 no families will have to live in properties at either of the two

We remain committed to housing our personnel in high-quality accommodation and this survey will help us achieve that objective.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09031761000011"></a>The Department for Transport is today publishing errata to <I>UK Air Passenger Demand and CO</I><I>2</I><I></I><I>F</I><I>orecasts</I> 2009, which was published in January.  Copies of the errata have been placed in the Libraries of the House. This follows identification of an input error to the 2009 GDP growth rate for the &#147;PBR Nov 2008 GDP forecast&#148; sensitivity test. The 2009 GDP growth rate was entered as +1 per cent, when it should have been -1 per cent. GDP growth rates for later years, the central case forecasts and other sensitivity tests are unaffected.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09031761000012"></a>This sensitivity test is relevant to those who are preparing evidence for the Stansted G2 public inquiry. The Department for Transport is, therefore, taking steps to alert participants to the minor corrections so they can use them in forming their evidence.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09031761000013"></a>The air passenger demand and CO2 forecasts, and net benefits of a third runway at Heathrow and a second runway at Stansted, have been re-estimated for this sensitivity test with this input error corrected.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09031761000015"></a>The net benefit of a second runway, with associated terminal capacity, at Stansted in the central case was &#163;10 billion. Under the &#147;PBR Nov 2008 GDP forecasts&#148; sensitivity test, the net benefit was &#163;8.7 billion. With the input error corrected the net benefit under this sensitivity test falls<b></b>to &#163;8.6 billion. This revised estimate is:</p>
well within the range of net benefits reported in table 4.4 (page 96) of <I>UK Air Passenger Demand and CO</I><I>2</I><I></I><I>F</I><I>orecasts</I> 2009 (&#163;4.3 billion to &#163;11.3 billion). 
<a name="90317-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09031761000016"></a>The net benefit of a third runway and sixth terminal at Heathrow, in the central case, was &#163;5.5 billion. In the &#147;PBR Nov 2008 GDP forecasts&#148; sensitivity test, the net benefit was &#163;5.4 billion. With the input error corrected the net benefit under this sensitivity test falls<b></b>to &#163;5.1 billion. This revised estimate is:</p>
well within the range of net benefits reported in table 4.4 (page 96) of <I>UK Air Passenger Demand and CO</I><I>2</I><I></I><I>F</I><I>orecasts</I> 2009 and in table 10 (page 35) of <I>Adding Capacity at Heathrow Airport</I><I>&#151;</I><I>Impact Assessment</I> (&#163;0.9 billion to &#163;9.7 billion); and,at the upper end of the range of net benefits reported in annexe B of <I>Adding Capacity at Heathrow Airport</I><I>&#151;</I><I>Consultation Document</I> (&#163;4.4 billion to &#163;5.2 billion).

<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09031761000017"></a>This shows that correcting this error does not materially affect the conclusions that follow from the results presented in <I>UK Air Passenger Demand and CO</I><I>2</I><I> Forecasts</I> 2009. I can also confirm that the error does not

In discussion, member states wanted short-term responses to the economic crisis to be consistent with long-term structural reforms. Industrial and economic support measures should be co-ordinated and respect single market rules. Member states agreed that priorities for competitiveness were SME access to finance, innovation and research, reducing administrative burdens and the energy internal market. I stressed the need for globally open markets, completing the Doha world trade round, reviewing the EU budget, active labour market policies and low-carbon investment. The key issues paper was formally adopted after some discussion on the text.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="09031761000042"></a>Over lunch, Ministers discussed the economic  crisis and the automotive sector. This continued  in the afternoon session where member states  agreed conclusions on the single market, avoiding discrimination and protectionism, as well as access to finance. The importance of research and innovation and underpinning infrastructure to foster green products and technologies were highlighted.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="09031761000043"></a>I emphasised the need for co-ordination at EU level to respond to the crisis in the European automotive industry, to avoid national protectionist measures and for European Investment Bank funding to the EU automotive industry to be sectorally and geographically balanced. I also said that the UK had reservations about the viability and value for money of vehicle scrappage schemes, but welcomed flexibility for member states to implement schemes as appropriate. In discussion the Commission raised concerns about the impact of the EU-Korea free trade agreement and in response I highlighted the wider benefits for the EU. The draft council conclusions on the automotive industry were adopted, with the presidency concluding that there will be a further debate on the sector at the next council in May.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="09031761000044"></a>The presidency briefly introduced its progress report on better regulation, highlighting the fact that over half of burdens come from Europe. The Commission was supportive of the report and said that better regulation was a top priority to help overcome the economic crisis.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="09031761000045"></a>Under any other business, a brief update was provided on EU enlargement, which the presidency said has been beneficial for all and the internal market and consumer market scoreboards. The Commission said that member states would be involved in a mid- to long-term strategy for the Transatlantic Economic Council before the EU-US summit in June. Regarding the external dimension of EU competitiveness, the Commission emphasised the need for regulatory convergence and the benefits of multilateral agreements. On the small business Act package of EU measures to support small businesses, the Commission stressed the importance of implementation in view of the current economic crisis.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="09031761000047"></a>Research Ministers agreed the importance of maintaining the drive to increase investment in R&amp;D during the current economic crisis. The UK argued that R&amp;D investment needed to contribute to creating the low-carbon, highly skilled, and digital economy Europe needed. The council agreed that there was a need to strengthen the knowledge triangle&#151;the links between education, research and innovation&#151;to ensure investments in R&amp;D made the maximum contribution possible to economic recovery.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="09031761000048"></a>The council discussed large-scale research facilities and their role in facilitating economic development. Council conclusions are expected on this at the May Competitiveness Council. During the debate on the location of research facilities, the UK argued that decisions should be made on the basis of science&#151;where the facility would best contribute to excellent research, and that these infrastructures were important in promoting the mobility of researchers across Europe. The council also took note of a presentation from the chair of the European Strategic Forum for Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) on ESFRI&#146;s 2009 priority list of large-scale research facilities in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="09031761000049"></a>Over lunch, Ministers discussed the Commission&#146;s proposal for a new legal status for European research infrastructures providing VAT and excise duty exemptions. On the basis of my letter to the Czech presidency, the Commission has been tasked with bringing the issue to the VAT committee quickly for a decision on the proposed VAT exemptions. The committee&#146;s decision would need to be agreed by ECOFIN Ministers. The UK noted that while its initial view was that these research infrastructures did meet the criteria in the VAT directive to be exempt from VAT, an acceptable solution on this could only be found in the VAT legislation or its implementing guidelines. The UK also stressed that it could not agree to substantive VAT wording in the research infrastructure regulation itself. Ministers also discussed how to facilitate a decision on the location of the European spallation source (ESS). Member states with an interest in ESS would discuss this further with the view for a decision to be taken before summer 2009.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="09031761000050"></a>Under any other business, the council took note of an update from the Commission on the request from Russia to sign an association agreement by paying to allow its researchers to compete for funds under the EC seventh framework programme. Member states had flagged up a number of questions on this issue which the Commission was currently considering. The council also took note of the progress made on negotiating a draft decision of the European Parliament and of the council on a European metrology research programme (EMRP) Article 169 initiative; First Reading agreement with the European Parliament is expected to be reached within the current legislative term. The Commission also introduced a new communication setting out the value of ICT facilities for science. The presidency informed the council that conclusions on the evaluation

<a name="09031761000051"></a><b><a name="90317-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09031761000076"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> My honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="09031761000052"></a>On 1 March I visited Gaza to see first hand the effect that the recent conflict has had on ordinary people. During my visit I pledged &#163;30 million for the first phase of reconstruction in Gaza, known as early recovery. This will help restore basic services, and rebuild damaged and destroyed homes, schools and hospitals. The pledge includes a new &#163;20 million provision and &#163;10 million from the support announced in January, bringing the UK response to the recent conflict in Gaza to nearly &#163;50 million.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="09031761000053"></a>The Foreign Secretary reiterated this pledge on 2 March at the Sharm el-Sheikh conference on Gazan reconstruction, and spoke of the need for a comprehensive peace between Israel and its neighbours. He made it clear that the Palestinian people need a single Government across the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Participants at the conference welcomed the Palestinian national early recovery and reconstruction plan presented at the conference, and confirmed it would form the basis for their support to Gaza. They said they would channel their assistance through existing international and regional mechanisms.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="09031761000054"></a>Access for much-needed materials will be critical for early recovery and reconstruction to take place. Following my visit to Gaza, I met with Isaac Herzog, the Israeli Minister responsible for co-ordinating aid to Gaza, and pressed for improved access and for a relaxation of restrictions on the type of goods that are allowed across the border. At the Sharm conference the following day, there was broad support for full opening of the crossings to Gaza to allow reconstruction to take place. In his speech, the Foreign Secretary endorsed principles for humanitarian access drawn up by the UN and other humanitarian agencies.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="09031761000055"></a>The current focus on humanitarian aid and early recovery does not diminish the need for full reconstruction. The World Bank, EC and UN will take the lead on a full needs assessment, working closely with the Palestinian Authority. Reviving the Gaza economy is also critical to the long-term recovery of Gaza. Jobs need to be created, large-scale public infrastructure needs to be repaired, and civil administration rebuilt.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="09031761000057"></a>With the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice I have today published the annual report of the Office for Judicial Complaints (OJC). The OJC provides support to the Lord Chief Justice and myself in our joint responsibility for the system of judicial complaints and discipline.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="09031761000058"></a>I welcome the publication of this report, the second produced by the OJC, which publishes details of the work undertaken by the office over the past year and the complaints which it has dealt with.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="09031761000059"></a>The OJC&#146;s 2006-07 report marked the first occasion on which comprehensive details of complaints received about judicial office holders had been made available to the public in this manner. I am pleased to note that the OJC continues to build on this foundation and believe that this report highlights the continued progress made by the OJC in delivering a high-quality, effective and transparent service to all its customers.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="09031761000060"></a>The Lord Chief Justice and I are keen to ensure that the disciplinary process for judicial office holders is both transparent and accountable. To that end, we have agreed that, from today, where a judicial office holder has been removed from office following disciplinary procedures, there should now be a presumption that both the identity of that judicial office holder, and the reason for their removal, should be made public. While mindful of this presumption, we will none the less continue to make decisions about disclosure on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="09031761000061"></a>Where a judicial office holder has been subject to a lesser sanction than removal this presumption does not apply. However, we will continue to give consideration to the disclosure of relevant information in cases that have attracted a high degree of interest from the public and media.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="09031761000064"></a>Today, I am announcing measures to strengthen regulation of the enforcement industry and clarify the rights, responsibilities and legal limits of debtors, creditors and bailiffs.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="09031761000065"></a>The Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act received Royal Assent in July 2007. It goes a long way to codify over 800 years of bailiff and enforcement law, following 10 years of assessment, debate and consultation. Last year my right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice asked for a reassessment to ensure that the enforcement provisions in the Act remain appropriate. Following a comprehensive review, I can confirm that the Government will not extend  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS11"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column WS11</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bailiffs' powers of entry and the use of force by enforcement agents. In addition, the Government will not implement Part 4 of the 2007 Act, which would have made changes in the areas of:</p>
attachment of earnings fixed tables;attachment of earnings tracing;charging order reforms; andinformation requests and orders.
<a name="90317-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="09031761000066"></a>We will, however, be offering help and support for people who need it now. We will be implementing the following measures in advance of full independent regulation:</p>
an online certificated bailiff register allowing debtors to check bailiffs' certification status;an extension to the certification process to ensure that all bailiffs provide a Criminal Records Bureau check with their application; andminimum training requirements and competences for inclusion in the certification process.
<a name="90317-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="09031761000067"></a>These measures will contribute to the development of the more permanent solution of full independent regulation in 2012.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="09031761000068"></a>Part 3 of the 2007 Act makes a number of important reforms to bailiff law which will remove archaic and complex legislation. The majority of these reforms received cross-party support during its passage. The changes will help debtors, creditors, bailiffs and the police understand what their rights and responsibilities  


<notus-date day="17" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS12"></a><b>17 Mar 2009 : Column WS12</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are when debts are enforced. Provisions under the Act will clarify the existing law and introduce a comprehensive code governing, among other things:</p>
when and how a bailiff can enter somebody's premises;what goods they can and cannot seize and sell; andwhat fees they can charge.
<a name="90317-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="09031761000069"></a>This will provide clarity for debtors and certainty for creditors and be underpinned by independent regulation of the enforcement industry. Regulation will not only improve the efficiency and effectiveness of both civil and criminal enforcement but offer protection to vulnerable debtors who genuinely cannot pay, and reduce the scope for abuse of the system. A formalised structure to regulate the industry would raise standards of professionalism within the industry and give the public greater confidence in it.</p>

<a name="90317-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="09031761000070"></a>We will produce a consultation paper which will set out the Government's intentions for a package of measures which will address concerns that have been raised about the behaviour of bailiffs, the fees charged and proposals for the regulation of the bailiff industry. It will also set out draft regulations on seizure of goods, and allow for detailed consideration of a standardised fee structure. The intention is to commence this consultation exercise with a view to implementing the changes in April 2012. This will allow business, local authorities, courts, creditors, the enforcement industry and the advice sector a substantial period to adequately prepare for and introduce the change.</p>

<a name="90317w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="09031754000005"></a>We have always taken the view that the cost of implementing EID is disproportionate to the benefits. However, the majority of other member states do not share our concerns. Hilary Benn recently raised these concerns again directly with Commissioner Vassiliou, and will continue to press for further changes to the requirements to help reduce the implementation burdens on our industry. However, EID is an EU obligation which we have to implement from 31 December 2009; failure to do so is likely to result in single farm payment disallowance and EU infraction proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="09031754000006"></a>Independent epidemiological modelling has identified that the introduction of EID and individual recording could reduce costs of managing an outbreak of exotic disease over the current UK system by up to 13 per cent as a result of fewer infected premises and fewer animals being culled. It will also improve our ability to track individual animal movements. There will also be management benefits for those farmers who want to make use of EID and gather individual performance data to make their businesses more profitable.</p>

We secured agreement from credit card lenders to develop fair principles for any interest rate increase they introduce on reviewing an individual's account. These came into force in January 2009 and provide extra protections when a customer&#146;s or group of customers&#146; interest rate is changed as a result of a perceived change in their ability to repay their debts. The Government have also implemented a number of measures to provide vulnerable and low-income consumers with access to affordable credit and free debt advice.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_51"></a><a name="09031754000063"></a>The Government are monitoring the market for high-cost credit closely, including through the new Consumer Finance Forum, chaired by Gareth Thomas, the Minister for Consumer Affairs. Our analysis suggests that lenders within this sector are beginning to support higher income groups or having to leave the market altogether because of their own financing difficulties. This is putting low-income groups at risk of being forced into the hands of illegal money lenders. We have established dedicated illegal money-lending teams across the UK to tackle this criminal activity, but we also want to avoid further restricting access to credit for these more vulnerable groups. The Government are not persuaded of the case for an interest rate cap because of the risk it will force more low-income consumers into the hands of illegal lenders. This view was supported by the Competition Commission in its market investigation of the home credit sector.</p>

payments are deducted from subsequent claim reimbursements, two months after the correction decision is formally published, but with the exception of late payment penalties, which are deducted at the time of the claim being submitted. In this case the correction decision is retrospective;the largest reductions have been approximately &#163;60 million for the failure to meet payment deadlines on SPS 2005 claims and approximately &#163;55 million for the inaccurate determination of the area eligible for payments under the arable area payment scheme (AAPS) in 2004 and 2005; andthey have been financed via a separate ring-fenced budget.<h2 align="center"><a name="09031754000313"></a>Safeguarding Children and Development Unit (Project Violet)</h2>
