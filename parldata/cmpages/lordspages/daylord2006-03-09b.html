<a name="60309-01_star0"></a><h3 align=center>High Hedges</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether they will take steps, other than by amending legislation, to clarify the word &quot;removal&quot; of hedges in order to facilitate the successful implementation of Part 8 (High Hedges) of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Baroness Andrews): </b>  My Lords, in the ODPM&#039;s guidance document, <i>High Hedges Complaints: Prevention and Cure</i>, the Government clearly set out their view that local authorities cannot, under the terms of Part 8 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, require action to be taken in relation to a high hedge that would result in its death or destruction. Unless the courts take a different view, there is no means of clarifying the term &quot;removal&quot; other than by amending legislation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer, but I am puzzled about why that appeared in the guidance when there was no consultation on it. It all relates to Section 69(3) of the 2003 Act, which concerns remedial notices. I understand&#151;the Minister confirmed it today&#151;that it is believed that, if the hedge dies, that is the equivalent of removing it. I looked up the word &quot;removal&quot;&#151;that is the forbidden action&#151;in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>. It is not in the <i>Concise Oxford English Dictionary</i>, but it is in the monster volume in the Library. Volume XIII of the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> defines &quot;removal&quot; as:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;The act of taking away entirely&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>That is exactly how it was treated in debates in your Lordships&#039; House. The noble Baroness has, as her department told me in a helpful meeting on Monday, no case law whatever on this, the definition is clear in the dictionary and there was no consultation, so on what basis has the ODPM put this out as the factual situation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, I pay tribute to the work that the noble Baroness has done in bringing the legislation to the statute book. Although the Bill was clear that hedges could not be removed and it set a limit of 2 metres below which they could not be cut, the issue of what constituted removal was not debated in either House.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_860"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 860</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60309-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>During the consultation, Hedgeline was consulted on the guidance as a whole, but it was local authorities that drew our attention to the need for further clarification of the practical implications. The legal interpretation that we put forward in the guidance was the best that we were able to obtain. There was no change in policy; there was clarification only. It is not customary to keep on reissuing guidance for further clarification.
</p>

<a name="60309-01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>Paragraph 6.24 of the guidance makes it clear that there is no one-third rule that stipulates that only a third of any hedge can be taken off before the trees might die. The guidance offers only an example of one type of tree in one type of situation and what it might tolerate. Given that the noble Baroness thinks that some local authorities are misinterpreting the guidance, I offer to write to every local authority to make it absolutely clear that it is only an example. I hope that that will go a long way to clarifying the situation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend will be aware of the profound concern of many Members of Parliament on the issue. How are we measuring how effective the recent legislation has been?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, I take the point entirely. When we brought forward the regulatory impact assessment, we assumed a minimum of 2,000 appeals by this time. In fact, there have been only 154 appeals. There have been 23 decisions so far. I will write to explain this in detail. There is no evidence that it is the hedge owner who is getting the benefit. It is not often that we on this side quote the <i>Daily Mail</i>, but if the noble Baroness were to look at the <i>Daily Mail</i> article of 8 March, &quot;ASBO for Leylandii Lout&quot;, she would find an excellent example of how the law is working to bring the situation under control.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Waddington: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that we really must stick to the facts of the matter and what the Act says? There is nothing in the Act that suggests that a remedial notice cannot be served requiring the reduction in the size of a hedge if there is a risk of the hedge dying. There is nothing whatever in the Act to that effect.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, there was no debate on the issue during the passage of the Bill, which is why we had to issue clarifying guidance. The noble Baroness quoted from the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>. I have the 1989 interpretation, which says that it is the act of taking away or doing away with a thing. That is the legal advice that we have received.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that there was no debate in the House on the word &quot;removal&quot; because its common-sense meaning was so clear to all of your Lordships? Can she explain what status the guidance has in the hearing of an appeal by a court or by an inspector?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, it is not of course statutory guidance, as the noble Baroness will know, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_861"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 861</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

but guidance that will be taken account of in any court case. It is up to the courts to come forward with any challenge to the interpretation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   My Lords, can my noble friend say how many appeals have been successful from the point of view of the hedge owner as distinct from those who are complaining?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, I believe that nine complaints were brought on behalf of hedge owners and that only two were upheld. I shall make sure that that is correct and write to my noble friend, but that is my understanding.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, while the Minister is making that clarification, will she confirm that if a council orders phased work&#151;the staging of the reduction&#151;and the hedge dies as a result, the hedge owner will be responsible for the dead trees?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, the hedge owner is not committing an offence. The reduction can certainly be introduced by staging and, if a stage cut is missed, the local authority can take steps to make it happen&#151;for example, warning letters can be sent, which can be very effective. However, if a cut involves the death of a hedge, the liability rests with the advice that has been given if that advice has been followed and is found not to be correct. It is a complicated point, and I shall write to the noble Baroness about it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Young of Norwood Green: </b>   My Lords, can the noble Baroness inform the House of any training, advice and support that the Government are giving to local authorities to ensure that the Act is properly enforced? Does she share my concern about the high fees charged by some local authorities to those seeking to use the legislation? For example, it costs &#163;650 in Sevenoaks, whereas South Derbyshire charges nothing and some councils offer concessions to pensioners. The average is &#163;345 in England and &#163;320 in Wales, so there is clearly some deterrent. What are the noble Baroness&#039;s views on that?
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60309-01_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord raises two important points. Because this is new legislation it is important to make sure that local authorities have the best possible advice. We have held six regional workshops, and we have trained 512 officers from 270 local authorities in the operation of Part 8 of the 2005 Act on the remedial works that they can require. We have held a major training session for inspectors in the Planning Inspectorate who determine appeals, and we have a website on which there are frequently asked questions. As to fees, the noble Lord is right: there is wide variation. I think that only Sevenoaks is charging as much as &#163;650; the average seems to be &#163;300 to &#163;400. We are keeping a close watch on the situation. We do not have plans to conduct a formal review, because the Act has not bedded down, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_862"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 862</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

but we are keeping the option of bringing forward a review within the five years in which we are required to review it.

<a name="60309-02_star0"></a><h3 align=center>Pensions: Public Sector</h3>
<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="60309-02_time0"></a><h5>11.14 am</h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Fowler </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What is their latest estimate of the liabilities of public sector pension schemes.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, as the Chief Secretary to the Treasury said in another place on 2 March, the Government Actuary&#039;s Department estimates the total accrued liability of unfunded public service pension schemes to be &#163;530 billion as of 31 March 2005. A technical note has been placed in the Library. At the last reporting date, the liabilities of local government pension schemes across the UK were around &#163;120 billion, with assets of around &#163;90 billion.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Fowler: </b>   My Lords, that is a vast unfunded debt. The Minister will have seen estimates in the press today showing that the true figure could be substantially higher. Does that not show how foolish and unjust it was for the Government to have gone back on their pledge to immediately move to increase retirement ages past 60 in the public sector, particularly when they are urging those in the private sector, who will help pick up the bill for the debt, to work beyond the age of 65?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, that is not a fair statement of the current position. The deal agreed by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions last year delivered all the savings that the Government originally targeted from the change in pension ages for the NHS, teachers and the Civil Service. As the deal makes clear, however, that is only part of the reforms needed.
</p>

<a name="60309-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>You can arrive at any figure for the unfunded liability. It depends on the discount rate that you use, and some of them have been quite silly. The key point and test, given that these are unfunded issues, is whether they can be met from public expenditure on an ongoing basis. The long-term forecast shows that, over 50 years, the percentage of GDP spent on these unfunded pensions will rise from the current 1.5 per cent to 2.1 per cent at the end of the 50 years. That is perfectly sustainable under the forecasts.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, I declare a modest interest in a fairly modest public sector pension. Does my noble friend accept that all the figures quoted&#151;whether by the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, or the Government&#151;are pretty meaningless? The main point, which I am sure will be of interest to many noble Lords, would be an assurance from the Government that they had no plans whatever to reduce current pension payments in the public sector. Can he give us that assurance?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I am not aware that there are any such plans. As I indicated, there are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_863"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 863</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

ongoing discussions about the future in relation to some of the unfunded schemes, and on local government schemes and the 85-year rule; but not, so far as I am aware, beyond that. We ask those who challenge the situation, particularly those on the Opposition Benches, what they propose to do: are they going to reduce public sector pensions?
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, as the Minister rightly said, the discount rate is key to assessing liabilities. Why do the Government use a discount rate of 2.8 per cent? Should they not apply the same principles as those applied by the Pensions Regulator in assessing the liabilities of private sector pension schemes? Does the Minister accept that the figure produced today by Watson Wyatt, suggesting that the liabilities are &#163;960 billion&#151;&#163;40,000 per UK household or 80 per cent of GDP&#151;and are based on a reasonable discount rate of 1 per cent after allowing for other risk factors? I do not know whether he considers that silly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the Government use the discount rate on which they are advised by the Financial Reporting Advisory Board, which was set up in 1996 under the previous government and contains, among others, many distinguished accountants. The discount rate that is currently used is 3.5 per cent, but that is due to change to 2.8 per cent next year.
</p>

<a name="60309-02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>I stress that the discount rate used is simply a means of trying to put a present value on a future stream of payments. The key test is whether that future stream of payments can be met from public expenditure. Having accounting changes from one year to another might be interesting, so long as one interprets the import of that properly, but that does not affect the ability of the Government to meet the payments going forward on a sustainable basis. The lower the discount rate, the higher the liability. Some projections have used a negative real discount rate, and those numbers are quite silly, but you have to see the figures in context. The ability to pay going forward is key.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, can I press the Minister on the age of retirement for people in the public sector? It has remained the same while life expectancy has risen substantially in the past 30 or 40 years. The age of retirement for British civil servants is now lower than that of civil servants in most other European countries. People under the age of 30 in the Civil Service have life expectancies well into their late 70s. Should not the Government reconsider the rather extraordinary concession made to young people starting up in public sector careers that they will still retire at 60 and then no doubt take second careers to add to their pensions?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, we should distinguish between retirement age and normal pension age for the purpose of the schemes. I think that it is right that, in the public sector at the moment, for local government schemes the normal pension age is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_864"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 864</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

65. The changes that were negotiated by the Secretary of State for new entrants into the other schemes will be 65, but that does not necessarily mean that that is the age at which people will retire. Currently under the Civil Service scheme the average retirement age is 62, which is close to the private sector average retirement age.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   My Lords, are the Government going to produce a proper balance sheet&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Sheldon: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend did not deal properly with the discrepancy between public and private pensions, which is likely to increase over the next few years. In particular, is my noble friend going to allow for the cost following the steady increase in life expectancy, which is likely to rise rather higher than many people are expecting?
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the Government Actuary&#039;s Department takes into account issues of longevity in dealing with the projections. The figures before us today reflect the changes from one year to another, and those assumptions are also built into the long-term public finance figures that were submitted in the Pre-Budget Report and will doubtless be updated for the Budget in a few weeks&#039; time.

<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spopq1"></a><b> Earl Howe </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>Whether the Mantoux test, advocated by the Department of Health for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection, is adequate for the purpose.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My Lords, the Mantoux test remains the internationally recognised standard test for the detection of tuberculosis infection. The tuberculin product used in the UK is the most widely used product for Mantoux testing and is the World Health Organisation&#039;s reference standard. A number of alternative tests are under review. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence will shortly issue guidance on their use.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spnew12"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Can I press him a little further: why has the Department of Health opted for an unlicensed skin test for TB, which has a high failure rate&#151;I understand that it can fail in up to 50 per cent of cases&#151;when there is a licensed technology proven in 11 countries around the world, the T-SPOT test, which is over 96 per cent reliable in identifying infection?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60309-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the reason why we persisted with the Mantoux test was that there were two options in Mantoux testing: Heaf and the current product. The Heaf test devices proved defective, so we <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_865"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 865</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

switched to the existing product under a properly contested open tender last year. We accept that the T-SPOT TB test is a useful new addition, but no alternatives to the present provider came forward in the competitive process. We are in touch with the company that manufactures the product to which the noble Earl referred, and we have encouraged the company to ensure that clinical trials, including their products, are published in as many peer-review journals as possible. We agree that it may have something to offer, and NICE may be saying something on the subject in its forthcoming guidance.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60309-03.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60309-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that 60 years ago, when I was a houseman in paediatrics, 75 per cent of children in north-east England and over 50 per cent of medical students had positive Mantoux tests? That was the result of the fact that a large amount of milk in the UK was contaminated with the bovine tubercle bacillus. The vast majority of those people had a primary infection that had healed, and very few of them went on to develop clinical tuberculosis. Is the Minister satisfied that the Mantoux test, as currently performed in the UK, is an indicator of active tuberculosis infection and not simply of previous tuberculous infection that may have healed long ago?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60309-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, Ministers like me are, to some extent, in the hands of scientific and medical advisers. We know&#151;I am advised&#151;that protection under the BCG vaccination has varied widely between studies in different countries, and we know the limitations that the noble Lord mentions. This is the World Health Organisation&#039;s standard test at the moment, but, as I said to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, other products are coming along. We need to have the clinical trials evidence before we change direction.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60309-03_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, how long does the Minister expect the trials to take, and when do we expect the research to be completed?
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="60309-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, that is down to the manufacturers of new products. It is for them to get into the public arena peer-reviewed evidence from clinical trials. That affects the decisions of licensing authorities in different countries and, in our case, the EU. We have to wait for that evidence to be in the public arena, but, as I said to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence will cover the topic in the guidance that, I anticipate, will be published before the end of this month.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60309-03_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   My Lords, given that the overall incidence of TB in the UK has risen by 20 per cent in the past decade, in London by 80 per cent, does the Minister agree that it is a public health issue of some <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_866"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 866</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

concern? Does he agree that priority should be given to developing the new technologies and getting them through their clinical trials as quickly as possible?
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="60309-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I do not think there is any question of us not trying to get things through clinical trials. Clinical trials in sufficiently large populations take time, and we have to rely on the standard and well established processes for that to be done. It is being done by the manufacturers, who, of course, have an incentive to get their products to market and through clinical trials as quickly as possible. I share the concern of the noble Baroness that TB is an important issue, on which we all need to do the best we can. That is why the Government published an action plan that went wider than just a particular vaccine or test; it contains a range of actions that were led by the Chief Medical Officer.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60309-03_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the issue of drug-resistant TB is of great seriousness and alarm? How can that be prevented?
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60309-03_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, that is an issue. I think that the noble Baroness knows that, to some extent, when we get resistance to all sorts of drugs, it is sometimes the overuse of those drugs that can lead to the build-up of resistance. We all have to be careful to ensure, where we can, that that does not happen.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="60309-03_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us whether cases of human TB have risen, fallen or remained the same over the past four or five years?

</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="60309-03_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, we have long been committed to the establishment of a new UN human rights council. We have said with our EU partners that we could accept, as a compromise, the text to establish the human rights council tabled by President of the General Assembly Eliasson on 23 February, although the UK would have preferred stronger language in a number of areas. We believe that the priority now should be to establish the conditions for the resolution to be put to the General Assembly to receive the broadest possible backing, in particular from the US. The EU fully supports President Eliasson&#039;s efforts to secure that. We continue to encourage discussion with the US to that end.

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 867</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Can she say whether the present discussions are ongoing or whether we are close to reaching a conclusion on the matter? Does the position of Her Majesty&#039;s Government reflect that of the rest of the European Union, or is it very distinct from it?

<a name="60309-03_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, I regret that I have not seen the article cited by the noble Baroness, but I undertake to do so immediately. The position of the UK is aligned with that of the EU. We are all seeking the same thing and are working actively at this very moment in the UN to ensure that the compromise receives the firmest and widest possible backing.

<a name="60309-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Anderson of Swansea: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the current institution is substantially devalued by the propensity of regional groupings to act on the basis of Buggins&#039;s turn without sufficient regard for even basic adherence to human rights by the countries proposed? On the basis of current soundings, what is the prospect of success of the new proposal?
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>

Those discussions are ongoing, but we are optimistic that broad agreement will be reached.

<a name="60309-03_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister take account of the Commonwealth&#039;s work on human rights, which is more extensive than that of the European Union, although both need to be taken into account? Is it correct that members of the new human rights council will be required to be elected directly and individually by the General Assembly and will be judged on their human rights records, with the provision that they could be suspended if they commit gross and systematic violations? Does that mean that countries such as Cuba, Zimbabwe, Burma, Iran and other police states will be excluded from the start?
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="60309-03_spnew16"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, we have high regard for the work of the Commonwealth on human rights. We work closely with other Commonwealth members on human rights and will continue to do so. I understand that the system of elections is as outlined by the noble Lord. The members of the council will be elected by members of the General Assembly. Therefore, whether Zimbabwe or other countries will be prevented from becoming members of the council as soon as it is established is entirely a matter for the General Assembly; it depends on the outcome of the votes in the General Assembly.

That is why we are working to that end. I reiterate: the Government have been arguing for a long time for a stronger and more effective body and we will continue to do so.

<a name="60309-04_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Cumberlege </b>   rose to call attention to Her Majesty&#039;s Government&#039;s plans for the National Health Service; and to move for Papers.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_870"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 870</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I start by declaring an interest: I chair St George&#039;s, University of London; I am a senior associate of the King&#039;s Fund; and I have other connections with the National Health Service. For most of my life, the health service has been my life. I grew up in it and, like many people in this country and in your Lordships&#039; House, I cherish it. I welcome this debate, and am pleased that, at this critical time, so many of your Lordships have chosen to take part. I am grateful to the Minister for being here today&#151;I know it is at some personal cost. I particularly welcome back the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth and look forward to what he will tell us.
</p>

<a name="60309-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The health service is an icon of Britishness, like wet summer holidays in Blackpool, garden vegetables and the man from the Pru. Yet Britain has moved on and the NHS has not. The delight of the NHS is that it was founded upon Christian Socialist ideals. It was a co-operative in the age when the co-op sent MPs to Parliament. Following in the steps of the mutual societies, it is a state mutual society&#151;each according to their needs. The NHS arose out of two great wars, when the state ruled and we ate healthy food in rationed amounts. Times change, and in a consumerist society that ethic of mutuality no longer works. A cancer sufferer feels entitled to every chance of life that they can grab, regardless of cost. Others may lose out, but they must fight their own corner.
</p>

<a name="60309-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>That is a radical change; the foundations of the NHS are being eroded and we have to find a new ethic. The Labour Party has always considered that it has a head start with the NHS, because it perceived itself to be guardian of a socialist ethic. New Labour is not socialist and has no discernable ethic. The NHS needs one badly. This House is admirably suited to the job of replacing the philosophy of Beveridge with a new one, acceptable for today&#039;s society, and we should set about that task now. In the 1990s, we made a start in adapting the ethos of the NHS to reflect the change to a consumerist society, without losing its founding principles. In 1997, this change was swept away. Billions of wasted pounds and nine years later, the Government are trying to regain the position that they so carelessly threw away on arrival.
</p>

<a name="60309-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>I should like to explain. Up to two or three years ago I could, like any other working person, visit my GP at an evening or weekend surgery. That has gone. It went because of botched negotiations of the new GP contract. Now, in an extraordinary realisation of the obvious, the recent White Paper, <i>Our Health, our care, our say</i>, without a hint of humility, states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;we will introduce incentives . . . to offer opening times and convenient appointments which respond to the needs of patients&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>So the Government paid GPs to close down and now it pays them again to open up. That is not good management.
</p>

<a name="60309-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>I acknowledge that managing the NHS is not easy. There are, and always have been, two contrary forces pulling at the health service&#151;local management and central control&#151;but to veer from one to the other is simply crass.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_871"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 871</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60309-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>When the Government came to power, they inherited eight regional offices. Four years later, they were abolished in favour of four regional directorates. The directorates lasted just one year and were replaced by 28 strategic health authorities. The strategic health authorities now face the chop and are to be merged into about 10&#151;almost the old regions back again. GP fundholding was scrapped and, nine years later, practice-based commissioning is to be put in its place. In 1997, the internal market had to go, to be replaced last year by payment by results. Here, policies could have been marginally adapted to achieve the same ends. Adaption is cheap but, of course, politically less heroic.  This is about political egos versus good management.
</p>

<a name="60309-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>In 1998, 100 health authorities were abolished and primary care groups formed. They were swept away in favour of 303 primary care trusts. Established just three years ago, these trusts are now to be merged into about 130. Their staff are expected to implement the huge changes in the White Paper while they are worried stiff about their jobs, mortgages and schools for their children.
</p>

<a name="60309-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>In June, the PCTs were told to divest themselves of services such as district nursing, but in October the Secretary of State told them that that was not her plan. The Health Select Committee commented:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;The Government&#039;s numerous announcements and subsequent retractions mean that it is still unclear what its policy is&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>The committee goes on to describe the Government&#039;s approach as &quot;clumsy and cavalier&quot;, and states that PCT reform has,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;produced a flawed and incoherent policy that is ill judged in the extreme&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>That is strong language for a Select Committee with a Labour chair and majority. The chairman of Basildon PCT told the committee:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;some staff have had different employer names on their payslips five times in ten years&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>However, that is by no means all. Ministers have a penchant for agencies. Agencies are set up, as was the National Care Standards Agency, where all staff were recruited only for it to be abolished 14 days later in favour of another agency, the Commission for Social Care Inspection, which, in its turn, is to be amalgamated in 2008. We have seen the establishment of the NHS University and its demise. The Leadership Centre, the Modernisation Agency, the National Clinical Assessment Authority, the Commission for Health Inspection and the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement have all been here one minute and gone the next. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence, a great survivor, necessary and admirable, is supposedly independent but is now being undermined by a panicked Secretary of State who feels moved to start prescribing herself.
</p>

<a name="60309-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Round and round we go, with managers and staff so dizzy that they fall off the carousel. Their falls cause injuries. They are not well looked after. The Christian Socialist ethic has been replaced by fear and recrimination. As the Select Committee said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;this approach to NHS staff has had a very damaging effect on staff morale&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_872"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 872</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60309-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>This is a nine-year chapter of bad management, which no commercial organisation could possibly survive. The Opposition have been patient. We have waited, and we have hoped that the extra money we welcomed will be well spent. Now we can no longer keep quiet. The top ministerial management is an embarrassment. It is hardly surprising that expenditure on the NHS has doubled in the face of all these changes and, according to the Office for National Statistics, there has been a less than 2 per cent increase in productivity. That is not bad; by any management criteria, it is a disgrace. It seems that just because the British public are compulsory subscribers, the Government have taken this as a writ to mismanage stupendously. Nicholas Timmins, the public policy editor of the <i>Financial Times</i> describes this expenditure bonanza as an opportunity squandered.
</p>

<a name="60309-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Looking to the future, the Government have recently published a framework document for 2006&#150;07 which bears little relationship to the White Paper. It tells us that 20 per cent of practices will be involved in practice-based commissioning by the end of this month. Really? They have hardly started. It also tells us that it will be 100 per cent within a year. I doubt it. With one or two exceptions, the Government have not managed to get clinical engagement. In lay language, the doctors do not want it. They are reluctant because they know the infrastructure is not there to support them. Computer systems are in their infancy and prone to break down. When I was a Minister, there were two consecutive years without a single case of home-grown measles. Not only have the Government been responsible for the debacle with the MMR vaccine, but the health of thousands of children is now being put at risk by significant failures in the new &#163;6 billion NHS computer system. The system was imposed on primary care trusts and has destroyed 22 years of perfect record-keeping. As a community paediatrician told <i>The Times</i>:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;The system is so bad, it&#039;s my opinion it will never work, but the department has spent so much, it&#039;s unwilling to go back and start again&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>When the internal market was scrapped in 1997, a gap was left in financial management. To fill this hole, payment by results&#151;a tariff system for contracting services&#151;was introduced. This is not small beer. By the end of this month, the total amount involved will be &#163;9 billion, and in a year&#039;s time it will be &#163;22 billion, or a third of the whole NHS budget. But one month before the start of the new financial year, the Department of Health finds that its figures are wrong. The tariff is withdrawn, and every finance director is left with months of worthless financial calculations, so no wonder there are expletives flying about.
</p>

<a name="60309-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>If management changes are irresponsible, managing the doctors of tomorrow is worse. Britain has a formidable reputation for medical training, not least because we have an enviable record in research and senior consultants with world reputations. It is good to see the Prime Minister, in his foreword to the White Paper, wanting,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;change to be driven, not centrally, but . . . by the people who use services and by the professionals who provide them&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_873"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 873</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60309-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Contrast this with the letter in last Saturday&#039;s <i>Times</i> from 86 of our most senior doctors, angry that they are not trusted even to select their junior medical staff. They write:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;How is it conceivable that an untested computer programme should replace selection processes carefully developed by dedicated professionals over many years?&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>How many of us would choose a secretary by computer? We would want to meet the applicants and assess their strengths and weaknesses. The computer system is not management. It is number selection, fit only for the lottery and hurtful to consultants. If the Prime Minister wants the professionals to be in charge, this is hardly the way to trust them. If Ministers decide that computers should choose medical teams, Ministers must take the rap when things go wrong. Patient safety should override ministerial whim and, as chair of an outstanding medical school, I think that the future of young doctors should not be decided by a machine, particularly in a profession where human contact is so highly prized.

</p>

<a name="60309-04_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The Royal College of Physicians has undertaken a review of professionalism&#151;professionalism in 2006, not an archaic view. It has taken 15 months and I have had the privilege of chairing it. There was no froth, no spin and no crisis. It was a solid piece of work laying new foundations for the care of people&#039;s health, which is absolutely dependent on patients trusting their doctors. All the time that this review has been going on, the management of the NHS has been going on as well. The ministerial team has displayed all those qualities that a doctor should not show&#151;vacillation, uncertainty, misdiagnosis and capricious changes in medication&#151;which is impacting on doctors as they plod on trying to deliver a service through a hail of bullet points aimed at obscured targets.
</p>

<a name="60309-04_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>It is of huge concern that the management is now degenerating into a farce. Five years ago the chief executive of the NHS and the permanent secretary posts were amalgamated. Now they are to be split again, and I am very sad that Sir Nigel Crisp is the casualty of ministerial whim. He is a man of integrity and has given some stability in a department of ever changing ministerial teams. I am delighted that he is to come to this House and I am sure that he will be a contentious contributor.
</p>

<a name="60309-04_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>What we need now is a two-year moratorium on management change, a time for thought and reflection, intense debate, and a search for a world-beating team to restore the NHS to a world-beating service. I would ask that the first and instant result from this debate is the immediate cessation of the system of selecting junior doctors, for that is endangering lives, and that those 86 very senior and very sensible consultants who wrote to <i>The Times</i> should be shown respect. I beg to move for Papers.

debate the NHS, an issue so close to the hearts of many of us. Today, I must congratulate the noble Baroness particularly on the magnificence of her timing. Her contribution to the NHS is well known and much appreciated, although, following her remarks, perhaps I may remind her just how many changes her government presided over in the NHS during the 1980s and 1990s.
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>This is not the first time that I do not find myself in entire agreement with the noble Baroness&#039;s views on the NHS&#151;comparisons of glasses half full or half empty spring to mind. My view of the NHS is definitely of the more-than-half-full kind. I will declare my interests and my reasons for that. I have been employed by the NHS. I have worked very closely with it in various occupations for 40 years. I have always been an NHS patient, will never be anything else and, most particularly, I owe my life to it. The dedication, skill, commitment and willingness to take risks of NHS doctors, nurses and associated professions saved my life when all hope of saving it was lost. So your Lordships will not be surprised to know that I am a huge fan. I am, I know, not alone in that, either in this House or in the public at large. But that is one of the paradoxes which always face us when we discuss the NHS. It is my belief and understanding that the experience of most people with the NHS is good and getting better.
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Only last week I talked to a friend who had had symptoms which required her to have a colonoscopy. She said: &quot;As soon as I saw my GP, it all swung into action. I saw a specialist in a week, had a polyp removed there and then, and I am now on the list for a colonoscopy every two years. I know that&#039;s very unusual and that I was very lucky&quot;. No, it is not unusual and she was not lucky. Yet such is the negative publicity that we hear all around and such are the scare stories put out by the media, that people think that their good experiences are unique and that they were lucky. Quite the opposite is more likely to be true: far from being the norm, it is unusual and unlucky to have a bad experience. The massive investment made by this Government and the reduction in waiting times and waiting lists, together with a much greater emphasis on patient and public involvement, have clearly made the NHS better, however difficult it is for other political parties to admit.
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The scorn poured on the so-called &quot;waste&quot; of these huge investments, which have resulted in 60,000 more nurses and 30,000 more doctors, is not appropriate and I would never question the ethics of those doctors and nurses. Neither should scorn be poured on the huge hospital building programme and the investment in so many new services, such as local walk-in centres and NHS Direct, which is so widely used. We should also note that anyone who has recently used the NHS cannot possibly have failed to notice how different the focus on the patient&#039;s needs and wishes is now from how it used to be.
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Today&#039;s debate is about plans for the NHS and in the rest of my remarks I want to concentrate on the proposals outlined in the White Paper <i>Our health, our care, our way</i>, with particular emphasis on the effect of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_875"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 875</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the proposed reforms on those who are by far the biggest providers of health and social care in our society&#151;the unpaid, so-called &quot;informal&quot; carers: your family, your friends and your neighbours.
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>For carers, as indeed for many people, there have always been two major problems with the way healthcare is provided. The first is that there has been far too much emphasis on hospitals, or what we now term secondary care, when most people&#039;s experience of the NHS has nothing whatever to do with hospitals&#151;it occurs in their local community, via their GP and their local primary care practice. The emphasis in the White Paper on choice about the GP with whom one registers will change the way in which surgeries operate. Surgeries should be open at times to suit the individual and his or her family, not the convenience of the practice manager. Furthermore, practice-based commissioning will lead to health services being developed which are not only of high quality but close to your home. That is important to everbody, but it is particularly important to carers, who often have limited time to take their relatives from place to place. Moreover, respite care is not available unless it is provided close to home or in the home itself. Being able to plan in advance&#151;especially for those carers continuing in paid employment&#151;is very significant. This will mean that the increased ability to plan treatments ahead and in a way which suits the patients and carer&#151;not just the provider&#151;is especially valuable, notwithstanding the teething problems with some computerised systems.
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The second issue that carers have always struggled with is the lack of proper co-ordination between health and social care. Your Lordships will be familiar with the &quot;Berlin Wall&quot; terminology that we have often used, and complaints about professionals not passing on proper information. When I was working full-time for carers I lost track of the number of times a carer would say something like, &quot;What I don&#039;t understand is how they all fit together. Why didn&#039;t social services know that Mum was being discharged and have it all organised in good time? Don&#039;t they ever speak to each other?&quot;
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>This has undoubtedly improved tremendously in recent years, as social care has been given more emphasis and as pooled budgets and better discharge procedures have become more common. But there is still a feeling that social care is in a sense the poor relation, instead of being an integral part of the care that people need. That is why the emphasis on setting national standards for social care and addressing workforce issues, including setting up the General Social Care Council&#151;I declare an interest as its inaugural chair&#151;has been so significant in raising the profile of social care and its standards.
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>Most people, especially those with long-term conditions, want to remain in their own homes as long as possible. The only way to do this is to ensure that we have fully integrated health and social care services so that vulnerable people&#151;either patient or carer&#151;do not fall through the gaps. The emphasis on this in the White Paper is very welcome. In the case of carers, it makes very sound economic good sense to provide <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_876"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 876</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

services which enable them to remain in work for as long as possible, and I am glad that the White Paper recognises this. Nor should we forget that carers themselves will be a drain on the NHS if we do not properly support them since carers are twice as likely to suffer ill health, either physical or mental, as a result of caring.
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>Carers UK recognises that the White Paper addresses several of the key recommendations for which it has been repeatedly calling and that the proposed reforms go a considerable way to recognising the support needed by carers as they are such a vital part of our nation&#039;s health and social care system. Provided they are backed up by the necessary resources&#151;the Minister will be familiar with the chilling statistic that by 2037 we will need an additional 3 million carers to care for the rising numbers of older and disabled people if services do not improve&#151;these proposals for reform will be most welcome and will continue the improvements in the NHS which all in this House and outside should be willing to celebrate.

<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="60309-05_spnew1"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </b>   My Lords, there is a saying that health is not valued until sickness comes, and that has certainly been my experience over the past six months, whether the word &quot;health&quot; means my own health or it means the health service. This debate is timely and I thank the noble Baroness for arranging it, and for her kind words, because if my calculations are correct, while the Minister was celebrating the anniversary of his arrival on this planet on 8 September last year, I was making preparations for my possible premature departure from it after being diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia. From that time until mid-January I spent about 11 and a half weeks in the tender and highly competent hands of the haematology unit of the Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth. Perhaps I may place on the record not only my thanks to many noble Lords for their good wishes during my time away, but also my profound appreciation to Dr Mary Ganczakowski and her colleagues, to Kay Heron and Sue Thomas&#151;who is no relation of the noble Baroness of that name&#151;and their nurse colleagues. Without their professionalism, I would not be here to tell the tale. I can assure your Lordships that I am very much alive and kicking, and it must be the Viking genes in my bone marrow.
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>I am aware that this is rightly a very technical debate. The fates have decreed that it comes when the National Health Service has entered the very forefront of public concern this week. As someone who could be described as a consumer rather than a professional, I want to confine my remarks to three areas: co-ordination, choice and stability. First, I turn to co-ordination. One of the issues arguably facing the NHS is continual reorganisation. Of course organisations sometimes need to be reorganised, but I have to say that the current plans to reorganise the PCTs&#151;I live in the thick of one of those: Fareham, which has overspent considerably&#151;could not be worse timed. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_877"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 877</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I say that in the light of the recently announced plans to reorganise local government. Surely the cart is before the horse, or whatever image comes to mind.
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>The balance is always between micro and macro management, but both are needed and it is a question of collective agreement and long-term policy about where each properly lies. The current plans have been severely criticised by the House of Commons Health Committee both because they come only three years after the previous reorganisation and because they are likely to set National Health Service organisations back by 18 months, with adverse effects on patient services. As a recently discharged patient, and I want to assure noble Lords that there are no special episcopal perks in the NHS aside from the odd joke, I want to be reassured that this will not be the case&#151;and not just for acute treatment, but for other more day-to-day, non life-threatening programmes. I am concerned, for example, that drastically imposed economies on such apparently small, but for patients and their families highly significant issues as parking charges, do not get imposed. We were lucky in that respect.
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>I do not want to labour the point unduly, but one of the most important keys to the well-being of a society is how it treats its most vulnerable people. Over the 10 years that I have been Bishop of Portsmouth, I have watched the Haslar hospital saga, and the growing consensus on the PFI at the Queen Alexandra hospital. While I have to say that the planned eventual closure of Haslar is not good news for Gosport&#151;and I do try to keep the big picture in front of me&#151;far too often one of the subtexts of the PFI plan seemed to paint a fanciful picture of a new building with plenty of land around and unlimited parking space, surrounded by a motorway ring road with easy access for all and sundry, including from the Isle of Wight, which is manifestly far from the case. Co-ordination means many things, from ensuring that patients do not suffer from casual or long-term economies to an adequate transport system&#151;I am thinking of natal units as well as emergency cardiac treatment.
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Secondly, there is the issue of choice. I am afraid that the shibboleth about choice needs a bit of debunking. I am not against choice. I am glad that there was an array of newspapers in the service station on the M3 this morning. But when, after a gruelling weekend of three big services in unusually hot weather at the end of August last year, I realised that I needed to see my GP, I am glad that I was able to do so on that Monday morning and quickly. That is what people want. I would have gone in the evening if I had had to do so, but at least I got there.
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>If I may speak for the church community with regard to consumerism, I was grateful to receive communion on Sunday mornings from whatever chaplain was available, regardless of denomination, and the form of service was not something about which I was prepared to grumble&#151;especially during chemotherapy&#151;or even write a letter to the local bishop, as that would be me. Moreover, I know that there are growing concerns among doctors, both <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_878"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 878</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

general practitioners and those who work in hospitals, and among nurses, about the long-term effect of the rhetoric of choice on ordinary people&#039;s expectations. I am sure that this has played a part in the attacks on nurses that received national news coverage recently. Choice, whether we like it or not, is part of contemporary culture, and I echo the words of the noble Baroness. Perhaps the kind of reflective and more wisdom-based rather than technocratic changes that are needed should try to shift the language of public debate more in the direction of manageable, limited outcomes, in order to prevent an increasing outbreak of false expectations. Choice in healthcare may be relevant to some elective surgery, short-term treatments or diagnostic procedures, but it is far less appropriate for life-threatening or chronic conditions. When I was diagnosed, I did not want or need choice. What I needed and got was the security of immediate care, which in all its respects gave me the confidence to keep going, especially in those difficult early weeks.
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Thirdly, there is the issue of stability, by which I do not mean, &quot;Stop the world, I want to get off,&quot; and nor do I mean no change&#151;far from it. However, all organisations need a collective culture that builds up a sense of identity, with loyalty and allegiance as essential parts of its well-being. Charles Swinburne, the 19th century writer, may have been in one of his sharper moments when he wrote:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;Body and spirit are twins; God only knows which is which&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>Part of any care organisation involves attending to both, however defined, religiously or not. There are inevitable positive spin-offs not only for the patient but for the whole ward.
</p>

<a name="60309-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>I do not envy a Labour Government having to face up to what is happening to one of their most precious jewels with which I grew up. There is a collective desire to get out of the mess. Briefly, I want to offer some advice from my work. If I want to set in motion a diocesan initiative, I know that I must convince a lay reader up the Meon valley, a church warden in inner urban Portsmouth and a country vicar in rural West Wight. I know that their first two questions to me will be: how does this initiative relate to the last one in addressing its weaknesses and building on its strengths; and how will it change things for the better on my patch?

<a name="60309-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Harrison </b>  : I, too, thank the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, for securing this debate and for encouraging those of us on this side of the House to return to our socialist roots. I believe that Nye Bevan would be turning in his grave with pleasure at the thought of the investment that has been put into the National Health Service by this enlightened Government over the past eight years. However, I want not simply to make a paean of praise, but to raise certain concerns. In doing so, I declare that I am president of the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society in Chester, where we are very concerned, as are Parkinson&#039;s sufferers throughout the land, at the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_879"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 879</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

threat to PDS nurse specialists. They play a vital role in helping Parkinson&#039;s sufferers, and I hope and believe that the Minister will take that issue up.
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>The Minister will also be aware of the importance of the medication regime. If it is disrupted for a Parkinson&#039;s sufferer, there is a problem controlling symptoms. I hope that he will lend his support to the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society&#039;s &quot;Get It On Time&quot; campaign, which seeks to establish effective medicine-management systems, to ensure that Parkinson&#039;s patients get medication on time every time. I also alert him to my experience of dispensing pharmacies, which tell me that in certain areas they are having difficulties securing vital medicines from suppliers. In my area, Lantus insulin and metformin tablets, to help and treat people with diabetes types 1 and 2, are in short supply, with all the threats associated with that.
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>It has been established that two out of five Parkinson&#039;s sufferers are unhappy with palliative care and believe that access to that care worsens as the disease advances. I hope too that the Minister will ensure that quality requirement No. 9 of the NSF for Long-term Conditions is applied rigorously. I share the concern of my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley about carers for Parkinson&#039;s. They play such a vital role in stabilising the lives of sufferers that I hope they are truly recognised by this Government, as I am sure they are. Finally on Parkinson&#039;s, I ask the Minister why free prescriptions are not accorded to Parkinson&#039;s sufferers, many of whom are below retirement age.
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>I return to diabetes. I very much welcome the January 2006 White Paper, <i>Our health, our care, our say</i>. Proposals such as life checks, information prescriptions and personal care plans are good news for diabetics, who value the ability to manage their lives&#151;and gain self-esteem thereby&#151;as well as to be economically active. However, I ask my noble friend why there is a lack of clarification about the additional resources that must be attached to the very laudable plans enshrined in the White Paper. Does he recognise that changes in the NHS such as practice-based commissioning, payment by results and the shifting of care from hospitals to the community will have significant implications, and will he ensure that we do not have fragmentation of services?
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>My final question on diabetes is a more general one of the money that has gone into the National Health Service, which is good and very welcome. However, the Government are setting a high priority on spending money wisely. I therefore ask the Minister to look at certain schemes&#151;I gave him notice of one of them before the debate&#151;in which I fear that money saved in the short term might be lost in the long term. The case to which I refer is that his department is commissioning research into commercial blood-sugar test equipment, and I hope that he is not guided simply by getting the cheapest price. The best equipment also has attached to it a good after-sales service, to make sure that it is tailor-made to patients. I give the example of two blind diabetics, for whom there was a capability of making a speaking monitor to give their blood-sugar results, thereby enabling them to remain at home and to lead active lives. They were therefore <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_880"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 880</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

not always having to visit their GP or local hospital to make sure that their diabetes was properly under control.
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>The second example is the laudable initiative by the Government to eliminate the number of missed appointments by patients at hospitals, which wastes money enormously. The Government have recognised the problem but I ask them please to ensure that those who might be struck off the list are properly advised and that that is not done without proper reference as to why they missed the appointments.
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>Finally under this heading, it has been brought to my notice that money is sometimes wastefully expended. For instance, in the chiropody services, in the wake of the BSE outbreak, all equipment is being sterilised, regardless of whether procedures are invasive or not. Indeed, it has been computed in one PCT area that as much as &#163;200,000 is spent on sterilisation of the appropriate equipment, but needlessly so. I hope that the Minister can turn his attention to that.
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>My final remarks are about the European Union and the failure of how we deliver our health services and share best medical practice across the Union. I am fearful that we do not do enough of that and learn from the comparisons that we might make with fellow countries. I have in mind, for instance, France, where, yes, more money is spent on the health service as a proportion of GDP, but a good health service results. That means a healthy population and, therefore, an active economy. For instance, women are tested for breast cancer from 45 onwards, men for prostate cancer from 50 onwards and a general test is given to people from 46 onwards, thereby catching diseases early and enabling appropriate medication to be given. I believe that HMG is moving towards that, for instance with the proposals for life tests.
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>One final point, which I am sure no one else will make in the House today, is that it would be encouraging if our medical professionals were given the proper language training within the European Union, so that they could converse and ensure the transaction of ideas. Ultimately, that would enable the benefit for all patients and practitioners to be spread more effectively throughout the United Kingdom and, indeed, the European Union.

<a name="60309-06_para8"></a>

That is rather different from the noble Lord, Lord Warner, who was previously a distinguished civil servant at the Department of Health. When I became Secretary of State and arrived at Elephant and Castle, he promptly handed in his cards and moved away. So there we are.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_881"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 881</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60309-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>I have three swift points to make. The first is to pinpoint a puzzle about the present-day health service. There is no doubt that the Government are spending more on the health service. I say that with a certain amount of envy, because I once did a waiting list initiative on &#163;25 million. However, the real test is whether the extra resources are being used to best effect. If, for example, you spend a disproportionate amount on pay increases, the benefit to patient services is limited.
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>What seems to be beyond doubt is that the public themselves do not always believe that the money is reaching the services. I saw a poll last week which asked whether people thought that the quality of the National Health Service had improved; 23 per cent said yes and 77 per cent said no. I recognise, as the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, pointed out, that when people are asked about their personal experience, those results are undoubtedly different, but that has always been the case&#151;it was my defence when I was Secretary of State for Health.
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Add public concern to the big financial deficit and the resignation of Sir Nigel Crisp&#151;to the discomfort of Ministers&#151;and the press are writing not about success but about crisis in the health service. Perhaps the lesson here is that, whatever else, good management is of the essence in the health service. I remember that when I introduced general managers into the health service, it was fiercely opposed. My opponents said, &quot;We do not want to see the health service run like Tesco&quot;. I am tempted to say, &quot;If only&quot;, because the health service is like any other big organisation&#151;it needs strong and skilled management locally and nationally.
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>It always seemed to me, and seems to me particularly today, that at the centre one of the obstacles to good management&#151;perhaps this lies behind the demise of Sir Nigel Crisp&#151;is that there are far too many people intervening and double-guessing. Ministers, civil servants and politicians may sign up to the general proposition of moving resources north, but not if it affects their own area. I see also that the Prime Minister now has his own No. 10 health adviser. Why does the Prime Minister need his own health adviser? Surely his adviser is the health secretary. That was certainly my view when a similar proposition was put to me. If you go the other way, people do not know to whom they are answering. It blurs the lines of responsibility and is certainly not good management.
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>As I went on in the health service, my view became that we would be better served if we could in some way separate policy development&#151;properly the function of the Department of Health&#151;from implementation and management of the service. My concept was for a health commission managing the service at arm&#039;s length from government, accountable to government but not run by it. I remember putting that to my noble friend Lady Thatcher. She thought for a little and then said, &quot;No, they would say this was just a prelude to privatising it&quot;. There was no doubt that, at the time, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_882"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 882</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that was exactly what would have been said, although I now note that the idea has the support of organisations such as the King&#039;s Fund.
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>That brings me to my second point. No issue is more bedevilled by party politics than the health service. In my view nothing has done more harm over the years and stood more in the way of progress than that. I remember in 1983 publishing a circular entitled, <i>Co-operation between the NHS and the private sector at district level</i>&#151;not exactly a threatening title. The idea was that, to reduce waiting lists, health service patients should have the opportunity of treatment in private hospitals, and health authorities should explore the potential of placing contracts with private nursing homes. That was described by Michael Foot as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;the most serious attack on the National Health Service since it was originally started&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>I am delighted that 20 years later it is now a mainstream policy of this Government. They rightly support co-operation between the private and voluntary sectors, because what matters is not what badge is being worn by the provider of healthcare but the quality and cost-effectiveness of that healthcare. Many people&#151;some with vested interests&#151;will snipe at that policy of co-operation, but I hope very much that the Government persist with it. In passing, I congratulate David Cameron on making it crystal clear that this party is not interested in introducing some new form of insurance system but is intent on developing the National Health Service. I hope therefore that there will be an end to all this nonsense about privatising the health service.
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>My last point concerns an area where there is no doubt that the service has gone backwards&#151;sexual health. We should remember that the sexual health clinics&#151;the GUM clinics&#151;pre-dated the National Health Service. They came out of a royal commission in the First World War and their purpose and achievement was to provide a free, anonymous walk-in service. Their justification was not just to help the individual, but to prevent the spread of disease. Today, 60 years after the inception of the National Health Service, we have delays before patients can be seen, and we have crowded waiting rooms and run-down premises.
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>I am a trustee of the Terrence Higgins Trust, which, together with a number of other organisations, has just carried out a survey of provision, of which one section was devoted to the views of clinicians. I shall give one extract from it. The clinicians were asked:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;Are HIV and sexual health sufficiently prioritised within your local health services?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-06_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>Nineteen per cent said yes and 73 per cent said no. Yet we are in a position where sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, are the greatest infectious disease problem in the United Kingdom today: 1.5 million new episodes are seen in sexual disease clinics, over 60,000 people are living with HIV, and chlamydia is doing a great deal of damage, particularly to young women.
</p>

<a name="60309-06_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>Here you can correctly talk of crisis, for not only is our treatment falling short, but our prevention effort has been inadequate over the past 10 years. This is not <br>&nbsp;<br>

a fashionable subject; politicians tend to be embarrassed by it or to avoid it. Something like HIV/AIDS does not come high up in the usual list of public concerns, yet it is a disease like other diseases, which is causing real damage to thousands of people. One test of the National Health Service is whether it deals with such challenges. I fear at present that this challenge has not been met. I urge the Government to put new energy and new purpose in bringing help here.

<a name="60309-07_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Murphy: </b>   My Lords, I add my thanks to the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, for bringing forward the debate, not least because I agree with much of what she said. I also send a metaphorical hug across the Chamber to the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, for his words about the way that the NHS is now and should be perceived. I thank him very much, and much of what I say will echo his words.
</p>

<a name="60309-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>I have been in the health service now for 42 years. Now noble Lords are all looking at me wondering how old I am. I was an auxiliary nurse at Nottingham General Hospital before going to medical school. My first job was on John Player ward for respiratory diseases, where one of my jobs was to polish the brass ashtrays twice a week. So to anyone who thinks that the health service has not moved on&#151;we have. I now have to visit several hospitals where I used to work as a houseman, notably Whipps Cross Hospital in east London. Anyone who thinks that the health service has not changed should come and see the difference. It has four times the amount of staff, and it has better qualified nurses and doctors than it ever had before. I had to work for a drunken consultant who was never there at night, struggling with an unqualified registrar to do surgical operations. That was in 1971. Frankly, the NHS has changed.
</p>

<a name="60309-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>Now I have moved on. I have been a clinical doctor and an academic for 25 years. I then became the chairman of a trust, the chairman of a health authority, and now I am in the stratosphere of the strategic health authorities. To me, that is a step too far for the next reorganisation. I have been through five of them; I am not going through another. The NHS cannot go on as it is. It has had a vast improvement in finances, which has been very welcome. In east London, we have had a 30 per cent uplift, which is the biggest uplift of any strategic health authority area. It was much needed in the areas that we serve, which have a diverse, impoverished population with very poor health records. There have been dramatic improvements in performance to targets; if you give us targets we will meet them. We always deliver the targets eventually. But patients are telling us that what they get from a rather mixed primary care service that is inadequate for the local population is not that much better. The patient experience has not improved enough in our poorest areas; there is still an attitude that people should be grateful for what they get.
</p>

<a name="60309-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, referred&#151;in other words&#151;to the NHS as being a bit like a political football. But I remind your Lordships that, with a few hiccups, the broad thrust of the global forces of policy <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_884"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 884</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

movement has been driven in the same direction. Conservative governments and now the Labour Government have moved quite a long way towards trying to separate out and introduce plurality of provision into hospitals, primary care and community services. To my mind that has been very much for the better. Self-governing trusts were the first thrust&#151;they did not quite get there because we lost the bottle&#151;and foundation trusts and foundation services introducing plurality of provision are the next, similar approach.
</p>

<a name="60309-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Yet again, I am afraid, I see a lack of political bottle to see it through. You cannot introduce plurality of providers without recognising the need for a failure regime for those who cannot perform. We have some superb managers in the health service&#151;I have worked in the independent sector and I know very well that we do not lack good and entrepreneurial managers&#151;but in order to benefit from their talents we need to free them up, set them realistic goals and have sanctions for those who do not perform. We cannot have services carrying on, knowing that they will always be rescued.
</p>

<a name="60309-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I am feeling pretty cross at the moment because of what has happened at my London strategic health authority. Your Lordships may all think from reading the papers that London is a basket case. Well, the North East London Strategic Health Authority will break even this year&#151;and I am very pleased to say that&#151;but what will happen to the money that it has not overspent? It will be loaned around to the other basket cases in London that have been overspending.
</p>

<a name="60309-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>The money that I was planning we should invest in the kinds of services referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Fowler&#151;such as our desperately difficult and challenging sexual health services and the maternity services in east London, which are in dire straits&#151;will be put on hold while we sort out the problems, again, in north-west London. Does that make good management? I suggest that it is not the managers that are at fault but the way in which they are supported within a national bureaucratic system.
</p>

<a name="60309-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>The NHS working like this is doomed to failure. There are no incentives to perform therefore it is not surprising that we have spent 50 per cent of the money on increasing salaries&#151;some are worthwhile; others I have more doubts about&#151;yet we have had almost no increase in productivity. Many services have improved, but nothing like as much as they should have done. Turnaround teams will come in and help failing hospitals but they will not be able to tackle the political issues involved in intervening to ensure that services which fail can be closed, taken over or removed. Monitor has raised this issue time and time again and I ask the Minister when we will have a failure regime.
</p>

<a name="60309-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>The second major problem is the weakness in commissioning and procuring services. We are now to have three layers. Primary care trusts have been largely a failure. We are going to reconfigure them to make them bigger, but will it make them better? I doubt it.
</p>

<a name="60309-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>I recently had a visit from representatives of the New York Public Health Department, which commissions services from the New York public hospitals. It is very <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_885"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 885</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

striking that this is done by senior clinicians and senior nurses&#151;people who have been in the services for years&#151;negotiating with clinicians directly and shaping the future. In other words, they are negotiating like with like. What do we have? Junior managers commissioning services in primary care trusts. We have tried very hard in my patch to change that and to engage clinical leaders in all the services.
</p>

<a name="60309-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>But at the moment in Britain, clinical leadership of services is not what we expect. I was very proud to be one of the first clinical directors at Guy&#039;s after Sir Roy Griffiths&#039;s report in 1983. It seemed to me then that we were beginning to engage clinicians, but we have lost it again. Senior nurses and senior doctors began to run services and were proud of training to do it properly. We have lost that. Clinical leadership is absolutely crucial in running the health service right.
</p>

<a name="60309-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>My time is up so I will make my last point. Your Lordships would expect me, as a psychiatrist, to mention the mental health services. It was Enoch Powell who said that it is the acute, voracious hospitals which suck up the money in the health service. The new White Paper about hospital care is uncosted because the money will be sucked in, yet again, to the acute hospitals. The people who really suffer from this are those with profound, acute mental health problems. They could be treated and would be eminently able to lead fulfilling lives if we gave them the support they needed. We are failing, yet again, to recognise that that arm of the NHS requires more investment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="60309-07_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, this is a topic of the utmost importance but perhaps I may remind noble Lords that it is a timed debate and that when the clock shows &quot;8&quot; we are actually in the ninth minute.
<a name="time_10"></a>
<a name="60309-07_time0"></a><h5>12.36 pm</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60309-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bilston: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, for tabling the Motion today, which affords noble Lords&#151;or myself at least&#151;an excellent opportunity to place on record appreciation for the wonderful services provided in our National Health Service by those hundreds of thousands of dedicated professionals in every facet of healthcare throughout the UK. In every city and town in Britain, millions of patients each day are receiving health treatment, which is saving lives and healing bodies and minds, through modern methods of service delivery unequalled at any time during the history of the National Health Service. I contend that our Labour Government are truly fulfilling their commitment to the British people by modernising and energising the National Health Service and by making the vital investments to secure the major and minor improvements desired by everyone in our country.
</p>

<a name="60309-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>In the few minutes at my disposal I can give eminent testimony to this proposition by citing the tremendous improvements that have taken place in recent years in my home town of Wolverhampton. The Royal Hospital Trust in Wolverhampton has achieved considerable success in access to services since 1997. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_886"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 886</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

For the past year, the trust has ensured that no patient waits longer than 13 weeks for a first out-patient consultation; no patient waits longer than six months for a day case or in-patient treatment; patients requiring treatment for cataracts wait no longer than three months; and similarly for patients requiring interventional cardiology or cardiac surgery. Equally importantly, since October 2005, no patient has waited more than 26 weeks for a CT or MRI investigation, and the waiting time for endoscopy investigations and treatment is now six weeks. The trust complies with the maximum two-week wait&#151;from GP to first out-patient appointment&#151;and the 31-day diagnosis-to-treatment period. In addition, over 90 per cent of access targets for cancer are achieved for the 62-day urgent referral for treatment. These achievements have been hard won by consultants, doctors, nurses and auxiliary staff, to whom I pay tribute, along with our Labour Government, whose generous investment, including our overspend in Wolverhampton, has brought about these major improvements.
</p>

<a name="60309-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>This is by no means the end of the story. There is more good news. Thanks to the good judgment and foresight of my right honourable friend the former Secretary of State for Health, Alan Milburn, he approved the building of a 21st century state-of-the-art heart and lung centre during his period in office. It was one of the first developments of its type to be built in the UK, at an estimated cost of &#163;57 million, and was built within budget and on programme. It was the biggest publicly funded scheme in the NHS at the time, funded wholly from the public purse. It is a magnificent facility, which has been serving the good folk of Wolverhampton, Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall, Worcester and south Staffordshire for the past two years, providing excellent treatment and care for a catchment area of more than a million people.
</p>

<a name="60309-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>I wish I had time to convey the many other additional and refurbished facilities implemented, such as the Deansley Centre for cancer services, which is also sub-regional and provides excellent cancer treatment and care; and the Benyon Centre, which operates a first-class children&#039;s service, and day case and in-patient facilities for gynaecology and endoscopy. In addition, since 2003, New Cross Hospital has had a new radiology department, offering a highly efficient and professional service, which removes from Wolverhampton patients the necessity of travelling to Birmingham or Stoke-on-Trent for diagnostic treatment. The primary care trust is also developing valuable community healthcare services, particularly in mental health, through the excellent leadership of Professor Jolley and his team.
</p>

<a name="60309-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>In conclusion, I say to the Minister: keep up the good work. I advise my right honourable friend the Prime Minister and my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health not to be overanxious about the additional expenditure. It is all beneficially contributing to rapidly improving patient care.

<a name="column_887"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 887</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

us all, valued by us all and it is our responsibility to see that the service it delivers is the best possible for the nation&#151;for all of us.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>Sadly, the current state of the NHS leads me to despair. This is not a political point; it is a statement of fact. The Government have poured money into the NHS, but with what result? There has been almost no increase in productivity, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, so graphically described in a brilliant speech. There is, not to put too fine a point on it, chaos.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>The current situation, in so far as we can even begin to unravel what has gone so woefully wrong, has been addressed by the oldest and least respected management response to a problem: &quot;throw more money at it&quot;. This is always a short-term response, but every investment should always be both forensically tested before undertaken and constantly monitored to make sure that the effects are as forecast. This has not happened, is not happening and, unless the most uncomfortable lessons of the current situation are learnt, we shall end up with an even greater mess than at present.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>In the 2004 spending review, the NHS is forecast to cost &#163;76 billion in 2005&#150;06. That, I repeat, is the spending review forecast, and takes no account of the deficits in the news this week. Those who say that even if the accumulated deficits amount to &#163;l billion, or even &#163;2 billion, this is not a gigantic problem as it amounts to only 0.12 per cent of GDP, should perhaps bear in mind that the reserve in the spending review amounts to &#163;2.7 billion. Do the Government believe that no other department will overspend?
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>Economists are frequently accused of manipulation of statistics, but there is no manipulation in my comments today&#151;that I promise. The reality which the latest news of the deficits in the NHS brings into focus is that government expenditure is out of control. More than that, it is dangerously out of control. This affects the NHS in particular, but it also affects every other aspect of our economy.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP has risen from 39 per cent in 1997&#150;98 to a forecast of 41.9 per cent in this financial year&#151;an increase in the proportion of the country&#039;s GDP of 7.4 per cent. The rise has been inexorable. If this rise had been matched by a corresponding increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of public services&#151;particularly the NHS&#151;there would be few who would criticise. However, this is patently not the case. The NHS is now in such a mess that every top brain that could be mustered should be mustered to try to help rescue it from a pathetic business situation where the staff are demoralised, the service is falling down in so many areas and, despite all the money thrown at it, deficits mount. Are Ministers listening to any of the messages being transmitted loud and clear from so many sections of the NHS?
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>We have already heard, in brilliant speeches, that the NHS has been subjected to reorganisation after reorganisation. The wonderful doctors, nurses, and all other employees are confused. This is not an over-the-top comment. I have heard so much of it, and, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_888"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 888</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

knowing what trauma has been experienced in business by reorganisation after reorganisation, I can utterly appreciate the frustrations and insecurity that have arisen. A demoralised, frustrated and insecure workforce can never sustain top quality service over the long term, which is what matters to us all.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Gaius Petronious, a Roman who had strong views, and has been proved right some 20 centuries later, famously vilified the concept of frequent reorganisation on the basis that it created an illusion of progress while producing chaos. My noble friend Lady Cumberledge gave us details of the merry-go-round of that process. When I was in business I had a quotation from Petronious on my desk, as did many of my colleagues in the companies in which I worked, and others. I recommend that Ministers&#151;particularly those involved in the NHS&#151;do likewise.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>A grim analysis, but the prognosis is even grimmer. The current situation cannot be allowed to continue. I do not want to criticise the Government, but I want to suggest that their lack of basic management experience and their gullible acceptance of the so-called solutions proposed by armies of consultancy experts must be addressed. There are many who can help, but they are not on the Government&#039;s radar screen. The genie has been let out of the bottle, and policies regarding the involvement of people willing to contribute their experience and expertise should be subject to much greater independent scrutiny.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>I was astonished to see proposals in the recent Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill to the effect that non-executive directors appointed by government can have pensions. This would be totally out of order in the private sector. It is just another example of government throwing money at a problem, and this time turning a blind eye to the fact that the burden of public pensions commitment on every household in this country is &#163;40,000, according to the news today.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>Please consult with people of proven international success in this country, even if they do not happen to be card-carrying members of the new Labour Party&#151;this is another, less effective, way of endorsing what my noble friend Lord Fowler was saying. It is in everybody&#039;s interests that this problem should be addressed and solved. This is a matter of higher priority than anything else, other than the security of the state.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>Even before the news this week, I was shocked into the realisation that the situation of one significant sector of our population has deteriorated so much during the past few years. My shocked reaction was to the &quot;Panorama&quot; programme last Sunday evening on the long-term care of the elderly and infirm. I hope that the Minister saw the programme. If not, I suggest that he obtains a video recording and views it as soon as possible. The situation depicted in the programme was nothing short of scandalous. We are an ageing population, we are living longer and we can no longer rely on family to look after us at any age, even old age&#151;or, indeed, middle age&#151;due to the inexorable erosion by the Government of the importance of the family.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60309-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>During a 12-year period I had first-hand experience of the parlous state of those who try to exist while suffering from long term, hugely debilitating chronic illness. No one who has not gone through this has any conception of how devastating it can be. Our elderly and infirm are now on the scrap heap. There is no dignity and little compassion and there is intense worry about financing long-term care. Is that fair? Is that just? Is it what one of the leading countries in the world should be doing to those who have contributed all their lives to the state?
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>I guess that it does not matter much to a Government who have so little respect or concern for the family. It does not matter that houses have to be sold and old people are left unable to pass on anything&#151;other than debts for care&#151;to their children and grandchildren. The NHS is there for them&#151;but at what price? Free to all at point of need? Do not even bother to answer. I do not think so. Surely we must reassess where the NHS is going&#151;and do it now. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth said, there is a collective desire to get out of this mess.

<a name="60309-08_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, for introducing the debate. I must declare an interest as I am a user of the National Health Service. I also have the privilege of being a member of many of the parliamentary health groups. Many of us from both Houses are kept up to date on health issues. Last night, I attended a dinner in another place. We were told how important it is to prevent deep vein thrombosis when patients go into hospital for operations. Each patient should have a risk assessment, and if they are at risk of blood clots and thrombosis they should be given blood thinners.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>Prevention is better than risking death, which can be prevented. More awareness of that matter should be made public and all doctors should know the risk. Far more people die of thrombosis in hospital than MRSA, but all those avoidable deaths should be prevented. I find many people using the National Health Service have problems of finding who provides what. I have come to the conclusion that it would be helpful to users of the National Health Service if there was an information hotline to the PCTs that could be of benefit to patients, carers and staff. The correct information is vital. It is not getting to the patients.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>The White Paper stresses health and social care working together in partnership. I have had experience of when that did not happen. We had to find which sling would be best for my husband, who for some time has had to use a hoist. The expert adviser on slings, who happened to be a health and safety officer from the hospital, advised that a sling made out of parachute silk, which could be sat on, would be the best. However, the occupational therapist from the social services who supplied the hoist would not agree to the parachute silk sling.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>I grew frustrated at such non-co-operation between two professionals, so I went to the firm that made the sling to buy one direct. That was not as simple as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_890"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 890</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I thought it might be. It had to be sanctioned by one of the professionals. I had to chase the health sling expert all over the north of England on his mobile telephone as he worked part time as an adviser to several health establishments. Getting something as simple as a sling, which I was paying for, became a major frustration because I was convinced under our circumstances that that sling was the most suitable. I was not going to give up. Many people might have done, but in the end the sling arrived and it has been useful.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>In an ideal world of course people from the caring professions should work together in co-operation. However, it was evident from the &quot;Panorama&quot; programme on Sunday evening about nursing homes how difficult and expensive social care has become.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>I am president of the Spinal Injuries Association. We in the UK have been some of the leaders in spinal injury treatment. I hope that that will continue in the future of the NHS. It is absolutely proved that patients who have spinal cord injuries and go directly to spinal units, as long as their condition allows them to be moved, have fewer complications such as pressure sores, depression, and bowel and bladder complications than those kept in general hospitals. The Spinal Injuries Association fears that if PCTs run out of money patients may not be sent to spinal injury units. We would much prefer the money for that specialised treatment to be provided nationally.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>Last week I asked a bright young man, who was a tetraplegic and had been treated at Stoke Mandeville hospital, what he would suggest if he could have one improvement. Without hesitation, he said, &quot;Better fresh cooked food&quot;. That would get patients better more quickly and would help to prevent pressure sores and be good for morale. Good food for better health should be a priority for such severely ill patients.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>I should like to bring to the Minister&#039;s notice the spinal unit at Oswestry. For those people who do not have suitable homes to go when they are ready for discharge, it has two halfway houses called Transhouse, one at Oswestry and one at Telford. They have all the facilities available for the patients to try out different equipment before the adaptations are carried out in their own homes. That avoids bed blocking and gives the patients time to get their houses sorted out. It would be of benefit if some other spinal units throughout the country had such facilities.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>There are so many demands on the NHS, but one section where improvements could be made seems to be for people who develop osteoporosis. Given that one in two women and one in five men over 50 will suffer a fracture, how do the Government justify the exclusion of osteoporosis from the quality and outcomes framework of the general medical services contract? What are the Government&#039;s plans to increase the early detection and treatment of individuals with osteoporosis, and will osteoporosis be included in the next review of the quality and outcomes framework?

<a name="column_891"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 891</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the additional workforce and capacity are there in support? An estimated 3 million people in the UK suffer from osteoporosis. Every three minutes, someone in the UK has a fracture due to osteoporosis. Each year more there are more than 230,000 fractures in the UK. Osteoporosis costs the NHS and the Government more than &#163;1.7 billion each year. The Government have a champion in the noble Baroness, Lady Royall. I hope that they will make use of her expertise as an adviser on the subject.
</p>

<a name="60309-08_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>I end by asking how the White Paper will be funded. Will the funding come from existing work streams in both health and social care or will there be any new money? How will the charging policies in social care be reconciled with healthcare where the premise is free at the point of need?

<a name="60309-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Stone of Blackheath: </b>   My Lords, I must start by declaring an interest. I have chaired a health charity called DIPEx for three years, which provides patients with information to help them live with serious conditions and health issues. The NHS has embraced our work and has been a wonderful support. I will describe what DIPEx does more fully later. Health is not my field. My knowledge in this area comes from having been with Marks & Spencer for 34 years, when our involvement in the health and well-being of our staff was a core policy; and Tesco&#151;mentioned earlier&#151;learnt from us.
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>Today I am going to talk about informing the patient. I learnt at M&S that when people have choices to make they want to know what other people did in similar situations. When people of any background are given time to talk about their illness, and are given help to understand their options by knowing what others did, their ability to cope is improved, their propensity to have better outcomes is enhanced, and it helps the well-being of their carers, friends and family.
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>So on the basis of what I learnt at DIPEx and M&S, I want to congratulate the Minister and the NHS on their emphasis on providing patients with information, and to press upon the noble Lord the need for these services to include patient experiences. Secondly, I want to thank the department for the support it has already given to DIPEx and to remind the noble Lord that the young need special information and stories from their own generation. Finally, I suggest that the Government support a conference that will bring together all those who wish to help the NHS to get the right information to patients at the optimum time.
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>Perhaps I may take a minute to quote from a book called <i>Information Therapy</i> written by Donald Kemper and Molly Mettler. They are developing, on a large scale, the concept of information prescription in North America. This quote from their book should give an idea of how it could apply to us here. As they come from Boise, Idaho, the original language is a bit American, so I have anglicised it a little for this quote. On the first page they say,

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;By offering every patient the right information &#039;prescription&#039; as part of the process of care, the NHS can achieve measurable improvements in medical outcomes, patient safety, overall cost effectiveness of care and patient satisfaction&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>The White Paper, <i>Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services, </i>shows that the Government understand all this and are beginning to use the term &quot;information prescription&quot; and that they intend to develop a system of delivery in the UK by 2008.
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>My first suggestion is that when developing information prescriptions for patients, of course people must have facts, and these facts must be properly researched. But people learn better from stories. So other patients&#039; stories and experiences should also be available to patients and they must also be properly researched. If the Government were to include properly researched patients&#039; stories in their information systems, this would be a powerful tool to help people make choices, give them support and help them manage their condition.
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>Perhaps I may now explain what DIPEx already does in the UK. DIPEx is the patient information system that includes the real patient experiences. It is the patients&#039; voice. We knew that newly diagnosed patients wanted to know what happened to other people in similar circumstances to their own: what choices did other patients make, and how did they feel now about the outcome of those crucial choices? This is exactly what DIPEx provides for them. It already has 33 separate sites: eight for cancers, four for the heart diseases and others for depression, epilepsy and rheumatoid arthritis. We are adding more every month.
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>DIPEx has hundreds of voices of real patients talking about their real-life experiences and feelings. It is accessed heavily by patients and their friends. It is also used for training all levels of health professionals. It is unique in giving the real patients&#039; perspectives from several angles. We ensure that with professional researchers, based mainly at Oxford University, covering patients&#039; stories that include the good choices and experiences people had, the difficult periods and dilemmas for patients and their families, and, in some cases, the bad times and wrong paths people felt they had taken.
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>We are really grateful for the Government&#039;s help and support since our inception, and for their encouragement recently to develop a new service YouthHealthTalk.org, which covers teenage cancer, sexual health for young people, acne, asthma, diabetes and the like. The department is supporting the launch of this young people&#039;s website on 22nd of this month, where Philip Pullman, the award-winning author, will be talking about the power of storytelling and Jon Snow, our founding patron, will explain how this new project will develop its own style for youth. So my second request is, of course, that the Government look favourably on the further funding needs of DIPEx and YouthHealthTalk.org.
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>My final point could easily be made in the next debate on the value of the voluntary sector: that we are envied abroad. Wherever we talk of DIPEx with <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_893"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 893</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

people concerned with patient information, be it in Europe, Australia, America or Russia, they say they have nothing as comprehensive as the voices we have collected at DIPEx. Our work is voluntarily organised by the trustees of our charity, and the stories are given voluntarily by good people who are ill and who know that they are helping others by telling us their stories.
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>People around the world are so interested in what we are doing here that they want to include DIPEx-type interviews in their own patient information services. So my final suggestion is that the Government lend support to a conference that is to be arranged here in London later in the year, where those leading the developments in patient information will consider the concept of information prescriptions, discuss the importance of including properly researched patient experiences in all systems and what needs to be done to adapt the new information structures we are building here to get the right information to the right patient who needs it in the right dose. I hope that the Minister might agree to speak at such a conference.

<a name="60309-09_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the noble Lord. What he said about patient information is very important. I know that everyone in the House will be delighted that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth, who is no longer in his place, is back and restored to good health. He said that he could not see why people would want choice if they had a very acute condition. If I had a very acute condition, I would want to know where was the best place to go, and I would want to be able to make that choice. Information on that is clearly very important.
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>I thank and congratulate my noble friend Lady Cumberlege not only on securing the debate but also on a devastating speech. Anyone listening to that speech must be asking themselves: why did Sir Nigel Crisp resign? Surely, it should have been the Secretary of State for Health. It is a damning indictment of the incompetence which has been shown by the Government. The fact that a senior civil servant has had to fall on his sword adds insult to injury. I am perhaps less charitable than my noble friend. I have to ask: what must it be like around the breakfast table in those households where the breadwinners are facing compulsory redundancy in the health service because of the financial mismanagement of this Government? They look at their newspapers&#151;they are worried about their jobs&#151;and what do they see? They see that the man who is apparently to blame is to be given a pension which most people could only dream of and a place in this House. What has happened to the concept of ministerial accountability? I suppose that the noble Lord, Lord Warner, will have some accountability when the newly ennobled Lord Crisp sits on these Benches and is able to ask him the questions, instead of providing the answers for the flip-flop policy which we have seen over a number of years. How can we expect people to have any confidence in our system if they see levels of incompetence on this scale and no one carrying the can for them?

</p>

<a name="60309-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>I was not impressed by the Secretary of State&#039;s response to this crisis, which was to go out the next day and make an announcement for a new &#163;1 billion PFI project, for which people have been waiting years. Does she think that we are stupid; that we cannot see that this is just a piece of spin to try and draw attention away from the real crisis which is enveloping the health service?
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>I give the Government credit. They have been as good as their word in increasing spending. NHS spending has been growing at 6.5 per cent in real terms. Public spending has grown in the biggest ever single leap; by 5 per cent of GDP. So the Government have certainly spent the money, but the money does not seem to be having much of an impact on the NHS where every year since 1997 productivity has fallen
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>I very much enjoyed the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, who asked a key question. Why should efficient health authorities in London find their plans damaged because they have to bail out other people? The Secretary of State should see to it that those who have been doing a good job should not be penalised. The King&#039;s Fund has estimated that 73 per cent of the new money going into the health service simply disappears like water in the desert soil. Of course, some of it is being spent on pay rises. I am second to no one in my respect and enthusiasm for the people who work in the health service, but they deserve better leadership than this.
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>If we have this scale of crisis now, with spending running at 6.5 per cent in real terms, what will happen in 2008, when the Chancellor projects the increase in total public expenditure coming down to 1.8 per cent? I am pleased to say that I have the answer. It is in the form of a quote from the previous Secretary of State, Mr John Reid, who told the <i>Health Service Journal</i>,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;after 2008 there&#039;ll be less demand on the primary and secondary sectors, but more importantly we will have got rid of the 1.25 million people who were on waiting lists. That should ease the challenge after 2008&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>Does he seriously believe that? If he does, he should not be anywhere near any government department or running anything. Anybody who has looked at the challenges facing the health service can see that fundamental reform is required.
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>I shall give one example. I used to be in charge of the health service in Scotland. I spent &#163;4.4 billion in my last year in office. Today, the expenditure in Scotland is more than &#163;9 billion. In 1997, my in-patient waiting time was 34 days. I acknowledge that that was far too long; we paid a political price for it. The Minister shrugs his shoulders. Today, the waiting time has gone up to 44 days. Out-patient waiting times then were 16 days less than they are today. The number of people waiting for six months has more than trebled. Spectacular spending has produced longer waiting times and waiting lists. Only today, we discover that a bit of a mistake, an error of judgment, was made on the consultant contract in Scotland. As with the Scottish Parliament, big numbers are always involved. The error amounts to &#163;273 million of unanticipated expenditure.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_895"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 895</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60309-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>This Government have tested to destruction the proposition that extra expenditure will result automatically in improved public services. So what is the remedy? The remedy lies in getting Whitehall out of interfering in the day-to-day activities of hospitals and GPs. It lies in breaking the state monopoly of the provision of patient services. I have a marvellous quotation which summarises what needs to be done. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;We must develop an acceptance of more market-oriented incentives with a modern, reinvigorated ethos of public service. We should be more radical about the role of the state as regulator rather than provider, opening up healthcare for example to a mixed economy under the NHS umbrella, and adopting radical approaches to self-health. We should also stimulate new entrants to the schools market, and be willing to experiment with new forms of co-payment in the public sector&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>More competition; ending the monopoly; bringing in charging: who said it? Was it David Cameron? No, it was Tony Blair, three years ago as Prime Minister. When will this Government put their rhetoric into practice? If they are prepared to do so, they will find common ground with people on these Benches and even some on the Liberal Democrat Benches. The truth is that they have been telling the people what they want to hear for far too long and the victims have been the sick and those in need of patient care, who are now suffering, along with the taxpayers, who are faced with liabilities and bills which are simply unsustainable.
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>So let us look for a radical reform of the NHS. Let us acknowledge that this model has failed, in the way that the old nationalised industries failed. They failed because they did not have to please their customers; they failed, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, pointed out, because they knew the taxpayer would always bail them out in the end; and they failed, most importantly of all, because they were constantly being interfered with by people who had political objectives and who were sitting in Whitehall, far too removed from the front line.
</p>

<a name="60309-09_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>I again congratulate my noble friend on the timing of this debate. Let us hope that the Government will learn from this lesson. Too many people have suffered. The Government set out&#151;with the best intentions, I accept&#151;on a policy which has produced a disastrous outcome.

<a name="60309-10_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Emerton: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, for raising this debate and congratulate her on her excellent speech. In the short time available, I shall link a statement made yesterday on Radio Four&#039;s <i>Today</i> by the Secretary of State, the right honourable Patricia Hewitt, where she referred to the need to balance financial accounting with the delivery of high-quality patient care, and paragraph 1.47 in the Government&#039;s White Paper which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;We need strategies for work force development that support radical shifts in service delivery and equip staff with the skills and confidence to deliver excellent services often in new settings.

</p>

<a name="60309-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>There is no doubt that much is to be done to redress the financial overspend, but there is a need also to redress the balance between emphasis on financial management and targets and patient care. The workforce will be required to meet this balance. The goals of the National Health Service remain unchanged; that is, the delivery of care to all at the point of need free of charge. The proposals for expansion of foundation hospitals and the proposals in the White Paper present many exciting challenges for new models of care, both in hospitals and the community. Certainly, these call for intensive workforce development to ensure that the highest quality of patient care is delivered.
</p>

<a name="60309-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>I was struck to hear a director of nursing and deputy chief executive of a foundation trust conclude his presentation last week on managing MRSA in his hospitals by saying that trying to engage board members&#039; interest in anything to do with patient care was one of his most difficult tasks, because most of the members of the board were business people whose focus was on finance. He said that it was difficult to engage them in patient-care issues. Perhaps if patients were referred to as &quot;customers&quot;, this might have more meaning to the members of that board. This point was again emphasised only two days ago by a group of 16 matrons and senior ward sisters who are on a clinical leadership course in a foundation trust in the Midlands and who came for a discussion with me in this House.
</p>

<a name="60309-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>Nursing has been my professional life&#151;I have to confess, for a longer time than the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, having gone through seven reorganisations. I am delighted that the Burdett Trust for Nursing has launched a Leadership and the Business of Caring project. It has commissioned the Office for Public Management to carry out a study to form the basis for the development of executive nurses and the boards of which they are members. Performance management of patient care is as important as financial management if we agree that patients&#151;or &quot;customers&quot;&#151;are the business of the NHS. While all members of the healthcare team play an important role in the care pathways, the nurse is the member of the team who provides 24-hour care and plays an important advocacy role to patients and relatives.
</p>

<a name="60309-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>Much progress has been made in healthcare delivery, in prevention, diagnostics, treatments, rehabilitation and long-term care in a fast-changing society, all of which is well informed. However, the media periodically expose some aspects of care that are far from acceptable; for example, in nutrition, personal hygiene, or cross-infection. These basic issues will remain important to the patient. Will the Minister give consideration to ensuring that a nominated person is given the responsibility, with authority for performance management of clinical care, to reflect care from the point of care delivery&#151;that is; the bedside, health centre or clinic&#151;through the organisation to the board? I am sure that the Minister will not be surprised if I suggest that this role might best be filled by the executive nurse on the board, who <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_897"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 897</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

would not only fulfil the role of clinical performance manager, but also be the guardian of patient care, restoring care and compassion in whatever setting of healthcare delivery.
</p>

<a name="60309-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>As well as being a nurse, I declare being a volunteer for more than 59 years. I am pleased that the White Paper acknowledges the part that the voluntary sector plays in the provision of health and social care. I am chairman of the National Association of Hospital and Community Friends&#151;soon to become known as Attend. We, in partnership with NAVSM, represent 100,000 volunteers over 1,000 sites, and in 2005 contributed over 1 million hours&#039; service, while friends groups contributed &#163;45 million to support services in health and social care.
</p>

<a name="60309-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>However, while the White Paper refers to barriers needing to be lowered&#151;I will be speaking on that in today&#039;s debate&#151;the Minister should take account of the current concerns over the late allocation of Section 64 and the OFV grants that are having a detrimental affect on patient care. Volunteers play an important part in supporting health and social care, and I trust that the Government will assist in promoting partnerships, as set out in the 2004 policy, &quot;Compact&quot;.

</p>

<a name="60309-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>My contribution is in two areas. First, it is extremely important, and not unreasonable, that those of us concerned with financial management in the NHS should be asked to keep the issue in perspective. While not belittling the challenge to those facing deficits or the frustrations of those who get it right&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, so ably described earlier&#151;I think that it is only fair that we should be reminded that the majority of NHS organisations are living within their budget and providing patients with better services. The Government&#039;s deficit projection currently represents 1 per cent of the NHS budget. I would be extremely pleased if an output from today&#039;s debate was a recognition of the value of NHS managers. Management in the NHS is often much maligned, particularly in the media. Maybe today we can see a turnaround of that perspective.
</p>

<a name="60309-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>We do the NHS a disservice by playing down the enormous achievements of recent years. I always bang on about cancer, as I will again in a minute, but I remind the House that&#151;in relation to coronary heart disease, for example&#151;the mortality rate from circulatory disease has decreased by 31 per cent since the baseline of 1995-97. In 2003&#150;04, 139,000 angiograms were carried out, compared with 81,000 in 1997. The number of cardiologists has increased by 58 per cent to 740 since 1999. These are just a few examples of key improvements. I am not alone in seeing the value of these changes. Most notably, the Healthcare Commission&#151;a key independent organisation&#151;said in its report, <i>State of Healthcare</i>, that &quot;much should be celebrated&quot;, as,

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>My second point concerns the success in the field of breast cancer. We have seen some great results. Mortality rates have fallen by 20 per cent in the last decade due to screening and better treatments. How do we go forward from here? Yes, we need to improve early diagnosis and reduce radiotherapy waits, and that is starting to happen. The issue of access to leading-edge drugs for cancer patients, as exemplified by the debate about access to the drug Herceptin, is key. That is why it is tremendously important that charities such as Breakthrough Breast Cancer and Breast Cancer Care, with which I have been associated in the past, campaign vigorously on this issue, as it has implications not just for breast cancer patients, but for all cancer patients.
</p>

<a name="60309-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>Herceptin is a breast cancer drug currently used and licensed for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in women with HER2-positive tumours. Research published in May 2005 suggests that it can be used to treat women with early-stage breast cancer with significant success. Progress in new drugs works by testing the drug with people with advanced disease and then bringing that experience forward into earlier disease. The potential benefits of Herceptin are clear and many clinicians are prepared to prescribe the drug off licence. Local cancer networks, such as the London Cancer New Drugs Group, have already issued interim guidance for Herceptin&#039;s use, prior to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&#039;s approval. The estimated cost of treatment with Herceptin for early-stage breast cancer is around &#163;20,000, whereas the cost of treating late-stage breast cancer is around &#163;100,000. Herceptin is suitable for only around 20 per cent of breast cancer patients who have a breast cancer classified as HER2 positive.
</p>

<a name="60309-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>The costs of this drug and the surrounding PR have created a misconception that cancer drugs are expensive. This, if unchallenged, could have damaging effects for cancer patients in the future. Cancer will, I hope, one day become a long-term condition for many, with the prospect of disease management through a series of targeted medicines&#151;some of which we can already see coming through the pipeline. Cancer drugs are not too expensive. The total NHS bill for all cancer drugs is about &#163;600 million, as compared with about &#163;800 million for statins, or &#163;600 million for antihypertensives. These are only ball-park figures and crude comparisons. The NHS must afford new cancer treatments, otherwise what is the point of spending millions on cancer research? We are in a fast-moving world of innovation and we need to keep up. The NHS must strive to make new innovations available to patients more quickly. If BUPA can do it in days, why can the NHS not do it in less than 12 months? Has the manufacturers&#039; delay in seeking a licence helped? I do not think so.
</p>

<a name="60309-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State was right to state that Herceptin should not be denied to women on the ground of costs alone. I call on all <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_899"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 899</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

PCTs to back the breast cancer specialists, the clinicians who prescribe their patients this potentially life-saving drug off licence. They do not do so lightly. Yes, a robust licensing system is essential. Nobody wants unsafe drugs to be prescribed without controls, particularly patients, as they are the ones taking the drugs. Yet, in this case, the early results are so promising and the patient need so time-critical that doctors are willing to take medical responsibility for prescribing Herceptin, so long as their patients understand the risks as well as the benefits.
</p>

<a name="60309-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>There are many other new cancer drugs on the way. We need to find a way of speeding up the licensing and cost-benefit assessment process to keep pace with progress in cancer research. This decision-making process is vital to the mutuality in the health service that we have heard about; it is also vital if the Government&#039;s outstanding record on cancer is to be built on in the future.

<a name="60309-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Colwyn: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank my noble friend for introducing the debate. I hope that she and other noble Lords will not mind if I restrict my remarks to some of the problems confronting dentistry at present. I declare an interest, in that I have been a dentist for more than 40 years, 25 of which were spent within the National Health Service. The Minister knows that I support the concept of change in NHS dentistry. I have praised the Government for their courage in tackling a dental service that has long needed revision, with an end to the treadmill of fee per item of service&#151;which was recognised as long ago as the Tattershall report of 1964&#151;and with help for the less well-off. But policy as it is today is in disarray.
</p>

<a name="60309-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>Since the Prime Minister&#039;s promise in September 1999 that everyone would have access to an NHS dentist by September 2001, the build-up to the new contract implementation date, 1 April, has been a catalogue of missed opportunity, inadequate consultation and bad calculation. Many dentists want to work for the NHS to provide a quality, preventive dental service, but the contract is dangerously flawed and that opportunity is being denied. The Government have created a system based not on prevention but on a new treadmill, creating the unnecessarily prescriptive system of monitoring output via units of dental activity&#151;UDAs. Preventive care and oral health advice do not attract a single unit of UDA. The Minister may disagree, but specific oral health advice&#151;spending time with patients advising on diet, smoking, drinking and good personal oral health regimes&#151;does not attract UDAs. Even advice on how to brush your teeth is a necessary service in many parts of the country.
</p>

<a name="60309-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>In an ideal world, we should welcome the devolution of power to PCTs, but the Public Accounts Committee in another place has voiced concern. It stated in 2004 that it was,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;extremely concerned that in this vital area of services to the public, the DoH required Primary Care Trusts to take over the management of new contracting arrangements without ensuring that they had the necessary expertise and resources&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<a name="60309-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>PCTs have serious funding problems. Their difficulties are reported daily in the press. Several PCTs are indicating that they have insufficient funds to maintain the existing level of dental services. It is even rumoured that the &#163;1,000 that was promised to each NHS practice as an organisational development fund has been retained by some PCTs to pay their own staff. The promised fund for access, quality and choice, which was not distributed last year, is unlikely to be allocated this year. I should be grateful to hear whether the Minister has any new information on those two funds.
</p>

<a name="60309-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>That reconfiguration and the huge uncertainty on funding for further growth have meant upheaval for PCTs and anxiety for a significant number of dental practices, which will lead to a reduction in the number of NHS dentists and a reduction in NHS dentistry. In some areas, the introduction of the new contract is actually discouraging any increase in NHS work. I am aware of practices that are planning to lay off dentists and staff because the contract value, based on earnings from October 2004 to September 2005, simply does not reflect the amount of NHS work that they are undertaking.
</p>

<a name="60309-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>Although there are more NHS dentists, they are doing less NHS work, yet net expenditure has increased by 19 per cent since 2003&#150;04. In 2006&#150;07, expenditure is expected to be &#163;1.66 billion, with a further &#163;608 million recovered through patient charges. Last November, the Government reported that 1,400 new dentists had been recruited, yet a survey of 34 of the 109 local dental committees revealed that 90 per cent of dentists were experiencing problems with the calculation of their new contract. Fewer patients are able to find an NHS dentist. The proportion of the population registered has declined from 53 per cent in March 1997 to 48 per cent in March 2005.
</p>

<a name="60309-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>The Government have insisted that patient charges should not represent a larger proportion of expenditure than they do at present, but the British Dental Association has calculated that income from dental charges is expected to increase in real terms by 28 per cent, despite the Government&#039;s contribution to NHS dentistry increasing by only 9 per cent.
</p>

<a name="60309-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>Under the new contracts, dentists will no longer have the right to restrict their NHS practice to certain patients. The contract demands that care and treatment are provided to any patient who requires them until dentists have met their UDA requirement. A recent survey suggests that, already, 14 PCTs out of 303 are insisting that dentists do not treat adults and children differently. If PCTs insist that income from patient contributions is maintained&#151;the minimum charge for treatment will be &#163;42.40 from 1 April&#151;dentists will not be able to prioritise NHS treatment to children and exempt adults. That will encourage dentists to work entirely privately and mean that many more children, low-paid adults and people on benefits will be left without the care previously available from their regular dentists.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 901</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60309-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>Dentists have always been unhappy with the drill-and-fill treadmill, which encourages over-treatment and discourages discussion on preventive advice. The Government have stressed the importance of ending that arrangement with the new contract, but the new system, whereby a dentist must complete a fixed number of UDAs in a year, introduces a system of targets that is worse than the current system, where at least dentists have the flexibility to work as they wish. The new system should have been tested. The Government need to trust the profession, to make the profession feel part of the NHS family. I wonder why dentistry was specifically excluded from the White Paper <i>Our health, our care, our say</i>. That does not help morale.
</p>

<a name="60309-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>I hope that the new implementation team that was recently announced to oversee the changes will take on the issues that I have raised and many more that time does not allow me to raise. If it can accept that changes should be made to ensure that prevention is the driver of the dentist/patient relationship and that dentists are allowed sufficient time with their patients, I am sure that NHS dentistry can prosper.

<a name="60309-11_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Greengross: </b>   My Lords, like most people in this country, I am an enthusiastic supporter of the NHS. Like everyone else here, I am determined to get things right in both the short- and longer-term future.
</p>

<a name="60309-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>My enthusiasm for the NHS stems from one of my very early childhood experiences&#151;the sort of thing that stays with you. When my grandmother contracted bone cancer soon after the end of World War II, her six children had all either been in the services or were married to people in the services. No one had any money. They were trying to rebuild their lives after the war. The first drug to combat bone cancer was developed in the United States and the only way to get hold of it was through flights over to England every second day. Between them, the six children decided to do that and they were getting into more and more debt. One day, the NHS was introduced and she was kept alive for another two years through the NHS. That stays with you throughout your life, so I have a huge commitment to all of us working together to ensure that we get the future of the NHS right.
</p>

<a name="60309-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>The Government&#039;s plans and the huge injection of money into the NHS have been very welcome, although they are mostly about organisation, process and, lately, the huge problem of financial management. Sometimes, we forget how quickly things are changing, partly because we now live in a knowledge-based society. That means that when a new drug is introduced, whether in Zurich, Australia or the United States, we want it. If it is for our loved ones, anyone we know or ourselves, we want it, we demand it. We want it in this country at our disposal and, wrongly, we think that we have a right to it, whatever the cost, with the NHS paying.
</p>

<a name="60309-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>That is an enormous problem: how we pay and, therefore, how we ration drugs. It must be seriously addressed, perhaps through a national debate. We do <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_902"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 902</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

not accept rationing by the ability to pay&#151;quite rightly. We do not accept rationing by waiting time&#151;quite rightly. We do not accept it by postcode allocation&#151;quite rightly. We do not always accept the rationing that organisations, especially NICE, say is justified. We do not&#151;at least, I do not&#151;accept rationing because of age. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, would not accept rationing by sex. None of us would. So how will we get drugs distributed to everyone who needs them?
</p>

<a name="60309-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>Twelve pieces of guidance are due to be published in the next year for cancer alone on new drugs that hold enormous hope for treatment. There is very good news in people getting cancer treatment more quickly than they used to. The bottleneck in getting treatment has therefore shifted from secondary care to how the PCT makes choices about how to pay for those drugs. It is good that patients can get to the doctor more quickly, but so many new drugs are coming on to the market and entering our knowledge that we really must find a way of ensuring that these treatments are available. We know that cancer money is not always ring-fenced for cancer care alone. How can we deal with that?
</p>

<a name="60309-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>The philosophy of the health service, which the Government are quite rightly determined to maintain, is equality of access to healthcare. There is a problem between equality of access in a national health service and devolution, because in many ways those are incompatible. As the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, said, if one area is paying for the deficits in another area, you will get, not equality, but inequality because some areas will get more than others. Although that looks like equality in the longer term, it creates a big problem, both philosophically and in the implementation.

<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="60309-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, I apologise for interrupting. I agree with much of what the noble Baroness has said, but surely the problem, as the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Drefelin, pointed out, is inequality of access. People with BUPA insurance get Herceptin; those who are in the wrong area do not.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="60309-12_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Greengross: </b>   My Lords, I agree completely, but this inequality is also embedded in the health service through socio-economic status, which I shall come to, which affects our health and our life expectancy to an absolutely unacceptable extent. If we do not tackle this inequality in access to healthcare, the difference in life expectancy in the population is more than five years. This is not about differences in the tendency to become ill; it is about differences in socio-economic status. Professor Sir Michael Marmot and others working with him at UCL have demonstrated that very clearly.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>We must take a holistic approach that involves a national debate about how we are to distribute the treatments that people expect and deserve. I very much welcome the work already being done to bring together different aspects of care, such as health and social care, because people who have either acute illnesses or long-term illnesses do not fit into one silo. So far, because we have different methods of funding, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_903"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 903</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

we expect people to fit into those different silos, and it just does not work. It creates perpetual disputes. Cancer, for example, can involve treatment that does not apply if you suffer from Alzheimer&#039;s disease, when the care that you need comes under social care. Such differentiation is no longer acceptable.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, quite rightly pointed to the huge problem of long-term care, which we must do something about. One of the problems with long-term care and the way in which we allocate resources is that many people still need residential and nursing-home care and will go on needing it. There is a huge problem with care staff not being available or qualified to provide that sort of care, which is not in fact funded by the health service but by social care. These need to be brought together. This is the Cinderella part of the service. These people need to be educated and trained to professional standards. We welcome those rigorous standards, but increased costs are making nursing homes and residential care homes go broke and simply close down while the need for that sort of care is increasing. So there is a crisis in funding and retaining care staff and long-term care homes. I am privileged to be associated with organisations, which are mostly voluntary but include academic bodies, that are looking into how that training and professionalism of care staff might be improved. That is part of the holistic approach that we need to take.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>We must consider the huge mental health problems across Europe&#151;about 80 million people will need mental health treatment at some point in a year. That is another huge priority which we need to take into account if we are to consider the long-term future of the NHS and make it work.

<a name="60309-12_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   My Lords, one of the great advantages of being elected to this House by your peers is that you have the privilege of learning from professionals from time to time without being subject to elective surgery. I speak today as a total amateur in this subject. I admit that I have absolutely no idea how most parts of my body work, and I find that I have many common allies in the United Kingdom, but once you move into the international realm, the knowledge of what your body does, what biliary cirrhosis is or what each component ingredient mixes with, even with the knowledge of food, is important.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>I was reminded of this when I saw a surgeon the other day and asked for advice. I said, &quot;But surely surgeons are the most important people in hospitals. They are the dictators, the demigods, the gods&quot;. He said, &quot;Yes, but we suffer from OCD&quot;&#151;I think he said obsessive compulsory disorder or something. I found that I knew nothing about all the acronyms and other abbreviations that are passed around by professionals. In many countries, the word &quot;amateur&quot; is a compliment. It means someone who knows and loves his subject. I have suddenly found that I am compulsorily interested in health but, for reasons different from those of all your Lordships, I see it as a really great opportunity.

</p>

<a name="60309-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>I express particular thanks to my noble friend, who secured this debate, for adding so much through our colleagues today to my own personal knowledge. I appreciate it. I declare an interest in that my first involvement in the subject came when, by some accident or other, I was appointed to the board of the oldest health company in the world&#151;a spa in Poretta, near Pisa and Bologna, which was known as Terme di Poretta. One of our skills was dealing with poison. We used to treat people who had been poisoned with lead by Lucretia Borgia. I then moved on in my commercial and banking world to find that the staff and serpent came from Egypt, where, of course, they treated with waters, and I learnt a lot about Prince Helwan and the others. We ended up financing and building a hospital in Egypt.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>More recently, and with some regret, I have been a director of a construction company that has built 20 hospitals, with more than 2,000 beds. But we have lost so much money building hospitals that we have decided to stop building. I have found that other people have done the same. One great contractor, who shall be nameless, was reported to have lost &#163;100 million on a recent PFI project. You do not knock the health service. I now regard it not as a service but as an absolutely essential public utility. It is a utility, and it becomes more and more essential as, to the regret of many life insurances companies, we live longer and longer.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>I ask why 18 per cent of our utilities in this country are now owned by the Germans and much else by the French, and why we, who had some of the best run utilities in the world, have lost the way. I always felt that the gas man or the electricity man was one of the most knowledgeable people you could meet. Now, the bureaucracy that they face causes us concern. So when we talk about the efficiency of the health service today, I would not talk about the past, as the noble Lord, Lord Bilston, did, I would ask what other people do. I take as an example the health system in France, which I think is the best in the world, and which has 400,000 beds with 500,000 staff. Germany was not so bad, with 500,000 beds and 800,000 people. But in this country, with fewer than 200,000 beds, we are proud to have more than 1 million staff. Somehow, that is where the problem lies. But why should that be so important? We say with pride, &quot;Look at the number of people within the health service&quot;. There are good people who are effectively thwarted by levels of bureaucracy and tiers that I find difficult to understand.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>I found out the other day that we also have higher rates of pay for doctors than almost anywhere in Europe. Doctors want to come here because they will receive a higher net income than in their own countries. But they also want to come for some of the technological advances that we have in certain sectors, which included, for a while, new drugs. But the worries when people are doing animal testing and so on makes one realise that many drug companies may now cease or wish to withdraw.

I support the whole concept of the National Health Service, but it is extraordinarily difficult to determine how we can resolve this serious problem. In my days as a consultant I had a senior partner who was brilliant at selling himself. He would go to see a company and say, &quot;I have been looking at your shares old chap. They have not been performing. The City does not understand you&quot;. There would be an immediate nod of acceptance. Then he would say, &quot;I think that your problem is management&quot;. He would be addressing the managing director, who you could watch start to shudder and look nervous. Then my senior partner would add the word, &quot;structure&quot;. The problem facing the National Health Service is not people or competence but entirely one of structure.

I also welcome the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth back to your Lordships&#039; House, and I noted what he said about choice. I took it from his speech that what mattered to him was quality of service and that he was not convinced about the extent to which choice was a factor in determining quality, for which I thank him.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>The National Health Service Act 1946 sets out a vision of a,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;comprehensive health service designed to secure improvement in the physical and mental health of people&quot;,</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>That vision remains at the heart of NHS policy. It is as apt today as it was then, even though the context in which the NHS operates has changed dramatically&#151;not least in terms of longevity. However, things have changed in the NHS. In 1948, a consultant was a medical god who attained the right to call himself &quot;Mister&quot;. Now, a consultant is someone who appears from the DoH financial turnaround team to tell you what you are doing wrong in the management of your trust.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>Several noble Lords have focused on the fact that increased expenditure has not been remarkable for increasing health promotion or prevention of illness; during the past eight years, it has tended to be in pursuit of political targets. It is against that background that we need to assess the long-awaited White Paper. I shall focus on a few areas of importance. One key factor is the stated aim of rebalancing the NHS in terms of preventative and community care. The Wanless reports give the economic background to the White Paper. They set out in great detail the economic impact on the NHS of failing to invest in social and community care. It is now accepted that failure to do so sets up high costs down the line for the NHS. That is the rhetoric of the White Paper. But the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, had it absolutely right when she talked about mental health <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_906"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 906</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and the reality of how the White Paper downplays small-scale interventions for people who suffer from mental health problems.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>The White Paper&#039;s emphasis on integration of the commissioning of health and social care is to be lauded. By 2008, all PCTs&#151;the ones that are left&#151;and local authorities&#151;wherever they are&#151;will establish joint health and social care teams to help people with long-term conditions. That will be an enormous challenge. As noble Lords have said, whatever the structures may be&#151;we do not know what they will be&#151;we will have to merge two entirely different systems; that is, an NHS system, which is based on capacity, and a social care system, which is based on eligibility. Nowhere in the structure has that key issue been addressed.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>I want to concentrate on the cost of reform to the NHS, which is not so much reform as constant churn and disorganisation. One of the costs of reform, periodic as it is, is how it limits the ability of the NHS to deal with other agencies, such as local authorities and schools, all of which have a profound impact on public health. But the principal cost of reform is on the greatest asset of the NHS&#151;its staff. The letter of 28 July 2005 from Sir Nigel Crisp did more to damage the morale of staff in the NHS than can be imagined. I do not know any other leader of a major business who would do that to his staff.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>Another cost, which has not been mentioned today, is the haemorrhaging of expertise from the NHS. The average expectancy for a senior executive to be in post in the NHS or a PCT is reckoned to be two to three years, which represents a massive loss of investment, because the NHS invests well in staff training. That is exemplified in one paragraph towards the end of the White Paper. It made my heart sink. It said that over the next year, NHS staff will spend time mapping local statutory and independent services.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a> I have a way to save the NHS money. I know how people can do that in an afternoon. They find the dust-covered filing cabinet in someone&#039;s office. They take out the five mapping exercises that were done in the past. They look at them. Then they ask the voluntary sector to help them update the files and to fill in the gaps. There is a massive amount of expenditure in the NHS on unnecessary repetition because of a loss of corporate memory in the process of change. We should recognise that.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>On NICE, I listened very closely to the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Drefelin. It has always been noted, particularly in the Wanless reports, that judgments about what is clinically and cost effective are complex and difficult. They are becoming more so as the pace of medical advance increases. But if, in the midst of all this reform, we do not maintain an independent, objective means of determining which drugs work, or not, whatever edifice is built around it, the NHS and medicine will suffer. Judgments need to be transparent and evidence-based. Findings need to be included in NSFs.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>The recent case concerning Herceptin was interesting. I do not blame in any way patient groups who do what they believe to be the best for people for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_907"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 907</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

whom they care deeply. But politicians should accept what NICE says and that there will be differences in availability and in prescribing. That is a political difficulty. Ministers should stand behind NICE and give it their support, not use it as a shield.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>Practice-based commissioning is a very interesting concept. GPs are perhaps one of the most stable parts of the NHS. They stay in an area, which they get to know very well.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>People in the voluntary sector, where I work, are most interested in what the potential for practice-based commissioning is. First, it is practice-based commissioning, not just GPs but all staff in practices need to be involved. Secondly, it has to be placed in a context where there is overall strategic planning for the health needs of an area. It is not clear from what is proposed whether patients who are expensive and complicated&#151;such as those with HIV, as the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, revealed&#151;will still have the same access to GPs, or whether they will become too hot to handle. It is also not clear what will happen to specialist commissioning for some of the conditions mentioned earlier, such as diabetes and particularly neurological conditions. What will happen to that?
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>Finally, what is going to happen about the overview of scrutiny of health provision in an area? There is an odd section in the White Paper that talks about calls for local action. On theses Benches we believe that it is right to go in the broad direction of the integration of health and social care, but there should be local control, which should be open, democratic and accountable. It should, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, said, include clinicians&#151;much more than it has done in the past&#151;to ensure that choices are well-informed choices. I am pleased to see the emphasis on public health in the White Paper but I do not see how that can be fulfilled, especially, as was said at the time, when local government is about to be reorganised.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>However we do it, we need a system in this country which brings out the best of local knowledge of acknowledgement which has behind it overarching skills, the research that we have talked about has been so necessary and above all else enables patients to know how and when they can influence the provision and work with the clinicians as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, said.
</p>

<a name="60309-12_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The White Paper holds out some prospects. Whether the resources are there to make it a reality is something on which the jury is going to be out for a considerable time.

<a name="60309-13_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend Lady Cumberlege is to be congratulated on having tabled this Motion and on introducing it so superbly. I am sure we all agree that we have listened to some excellent speeches throughout this debate. I join my noble friend in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Warner, for changing his diary arrangements in order to be present to reply.

</p>

<a name="60309-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>Some four years ago the Government did something bold and important and right, which was to start thinking seriously about how to put the patient at the centre of decision-making in the NHS; how to empower the patient; and how to give the patient a greater choice over what happens to him. In a state-run monopoly such as the NHS that somewhat revolutionary thought entailed certain consequences. It meant setting up payment mechanisms so as to enable money to follow the patient in response to the choices the patient made&#151;the system known as &quot;payment by results&quot;. But it also meant giving hospitals a greater ability to compete for the patient&#039;s favour and to be more responsive to local health needs. That, in turn, involved something pretty revolutionary, which was the idea of setting hospitals free of the shackles of central government control. Hence the foundation trust was born; and hence, to create greater capacity in the system, independent sector providers were brought in to take some of the load off the NHS&#151;something that in May 1997 would have been inconceivable.
</p>

<a name="60309-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>At the same time as all this, the Government did something else that was important and right, which was to address the problem of recruitment and retention in general practice; in the medical specialties; and in nursing and midwifery. Patient choice is not deliverable without doctors and nurses on the ground to deliver it. New contracts were negotiated with all three groups, the net result of which, in each case, was a very considerable increase in basic remuneration. Into the melting pot at the same time as all this was thrown another good idea: that at general practice level GPs should be able to commission services on behalf of their patients. Practice-based commissioning is not the same thing as the old fund-holding, alas, but it strives to achieve what fundholding did, which was to give real choice to patients and to make the health service more responsive to what patients need.
</p>

<a name="60309-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>If three years ago you had presented these reforms to a bank manager in the form of a business plan, there is one thing you would have been told, which is that every single one of these changes is potentially destabilising to the NHS. So when you budget for what it is all going to cost, you need to build in a healthy margin of safety to allow for the unexpected; and, as my noble friend Lord Fowler rightly said, you need to have high quality management to steer the reforms through what are very probably going to be some choppy waters. The Government would have done well to commission and heed such advice. They did not. And because they did not, it is not wrong to say that the NHS currently faces an almost unprecedented degree of uncertainty and instability, with inevitable knock-on effects for patients.
</p>

<a name="60309-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>The large deficits we are now seeing are only part of the issue. The Minister is right to remind us, as he does, that as a proportion of the NHS budget the current deficit is not the highest it has ever been. But what is different today is that at trust level, there is now absolutely no give in the system. Many NHS trusts&#151;possibly the majority&#151;are having to cut back services; the reason for that is, quite simply, that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_909"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 909</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Department of Health got its sums wrong. The GP contract, the consultants contract and Agenda for Change were imposed on the NHS from the centre and are all costing a great deal more than the Department budgeted. With the activity targets imposed on them, trusts have effectively had no room for manoeuvre. Worse still, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, mentioned, these pay contracts contained almost no incentives to increase productivity, so that hospitals are being forced to save money in other ways that are extremely painful. But on top of that, the tariff system under payment by results is still immature. In a survey of PCTs and GP practices last month, 93 per cent of respondents said that the payment by results system was unfit for purpose and needs amending. Their chief criticism was that it encourages so-called gaming by providers to maximise income unfairly.
</p>

<a name="60309-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>It is no tribute to the department that last week, only three weeks after publishing the national tariff for next year, they suddenly withdrew it and, in so doing, threw the business plans of the entire health service into a state of complete chaos. Simultaneously with that, leaders of PCTs were being told that their careers hung in the balance if they failed to produce improved financial forecasts within days.
</p>

<a name="60309-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>We are witnessing departmental mismanagement on an epic scale Financial control of the NHS has effectively been lost. But there is a whole separate dimension to this. Last December the Government announced a major reconfiguration of NHS bodies. The number of strategic health authorities is to be cut from 28 to between nine and 11; and the number of PCT&#039;s cut by nearly two-thirds from 302 to a minimum of 115. This reconfiguration comes only three years after the last one; when, noble Lords will remember, the Government abolished the 100 health authorities, along with the nine regional offices of the NHS Executive. In other words, we are going back, after only three years, to almost exactly the same configuration of NHS bodies as we had before. The cost of this reorganisation in redundancy payments alone will be &#163;320 million.
</p>

<a name="60309-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>The reason given is that it will save the NHS &#163;250 million a year. Whether it will or not remains to be seen, but it is not just the upheaval that this will bring. The Government are also proposing major changes to the structure of PCTs without first clearly defining what their role should be. Originally, Sir Nigel Crisp said that PCTs would become &quot;commissioning-led&quot; organisations with only a minimal role as providers. That was Government policy. The Secretary of State then contradicted him and said that it would be up to PCTs whether they continued to provide services. That inexcusable muddying of the waters prompted a broadside from the Health Select Committee in another place. The whole impression given is of policy-making on the hoof from the centre. Indeed, the public consultation exercise that took place last year might just as well not have happened.
</p>

<a name="60309-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>The effect of all this on the workforce in PCTs has been deeply demoralising. It is a huge distraction from what really matters, which is delivering community <br>&nbsp;<br>

services and public health services to patients and setting about the important task of implementing the recent White Paper. And for strategic health authorities, the task is formidable. How do you start to design new organisations unless you clearly understand what their function is going to be? How do you know if PCTs are going to be fit for purpose if that purpose is left open? And if, as a senior manager in a strategic health authority you know that your own job may not exist in a year&#039;s time, what does that say about your eventual accountability for the decisions that you take?
</p>

<a name="60309-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>The Minister may be able to see his way out of all this, but from where I sit, we are looking at very serious central management failings that sit alongside, I am sorry to say, equally serious political misjudgments. The recent White Paper opens up some good and worthwhile policy ideas, but I say to the Minister something very simple. Let those ideas not be ruined by core planning. The White Paper is not anything like costed, a point made very powerfully by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, in her speech. The last thing we want is for services to move into the community, only then to be found to be unaffordable. Unless there is proper planning, moving services from the acute sector has the potential to destabilise NHS hospitals even further. That must not be allowed to happen. We must acknowledge that on top of all the other policy initiatives in the health service, the White Paper carries risks.
</p>

<a name="60309-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>Over the next few weeks we need to see one thing: that Ministers have a plan to instil, contrary to all appearances, a sense of internal consistency and coherence into health policy. It is a tragedy for the NHS and for patients that that sense of coherence is now so noticeably absent.

<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="60309-13_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My Lords, I am pleased that this debate provides me with the opportunity to welcome back the right reverend Prelate and I am very glad that the NHS was able to provide him with the services he needed at a crucial time. I have to say that I listened with mounting incredulity to the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, about the wonderful NHS her government left us in 1997. I should remind her of some of the realities of those days. I know that collective memory can fail, as some have pointed out, but it is only eight years ago. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, mentioned the Wanless report. Let me remind the House that Derek Wanless found that the cumulative underfunding of the NHS amounted to a staggering &#163;267 billion&#151;not million. That built up during the period when three of the former health Ministers who have been giving so much valuable advice to the Government today were each actually in charge of the health service. I just wanted to put that on the record. I like to provide the service of refreshing people&#039;s memory about some of these things.
</p>

<a name="60309-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>That was the scale of the challenge we faced: an NHS budget of &#163;34 billion; health funding in this country running at 6 per cent of GDP, pretty well the <br>&nbsp;<br>

lowest in the EU countries at the time; waiting lists high and growing; one in 10 people on the list waiting for more than two years for their operations; A&E departments where elderly people commonly spent 12 hours on a trolley; and a topical reminder that in 1996&#150;97 there was an NHS deficit of &#163;460 million, which then represented 1.5 per cent of turnover. At six months into the current year, the deficit admittedly was a bit larger than that at &#163;625 million, but it represented under 1 per cent of turnover. That is the historical record.
</p>

<a name="60309-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>I was grateful to my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley for her timely reminder of some of the other management changes introduced by the Conservatives. It could be imagined from some of the speeches that there were no management changes during their period in office. I was also deeply grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, for recognising that his government&#039;s record might have had some impact on my own personal career development.

<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="60309-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I have to say that it was a life-changing experience when the noble Lord walked through the door.
</p>

<a name="60309-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>I would suggest that it is the height of hypocrisy for noble Lords on the Benches opposite to fail to acknowledge their contribution to the problems of the NHS and the part that they have played. I also gently remind them that their party in the other place voted against a national insurance contribution increase that has funded some of the extra money going into the NHS.
</p>

<a name="60309-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>I want briefly to remind noble Lords of what we have achieved. A number of speakers mentioned these, but I shall give a quick summation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="60309-14_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="60309-14_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I have to say to the noble Lord that I sat patiently through all the speeches from the Benches opposite; I would value noble Lords opposite doing the same while I respond.
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="60309-14_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for his courtesy. As he attacked our record in government, no one on this side has sought to argue that the Government have not spent a lot more money; what we argue is that we have got very little for that money.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="60309-14_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, if the noble Lord were to wait patiently, he would hear the rest of the story. I hope that he will wait patiently while the rest of the story is unfolded for him.
</p>

<a name="60309-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>We have put up spending from &#163;34 billion a year in 1997 to &#163;90 billion by 2008. There are 27,000 more doctors and 79,000 more nurses since 1997. I hope that no one on the Benches opposite is suggesting that patient care can be improved without having more doctors and nurses. Waiting lists are at their lowest <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_912"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 912</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

point ever. Since last month, no patient has been waiting longer than six months for their operation, with the average wait now about eight weeks. These are some of the results that have been produced by the extra investment. Some 99 per cent of people with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of referral by their GP, and since 1999 we have recruited nearly 1,000 extra cancer consultants. Patients now have a choice of four hospitals or clinics for their elective surgery; early deaths from cancer are down by 14 per cent, and for coronary heart disease they are down by 31 per cent. These death rates, along with the suicide rate, continue to fall.
</p>

<a name="60309-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>I suspect that if you were to ask most of those in the population who are affected by these conditions, they would say they think that they have had rather good value for money in the service improvements that have been made. We have 138 new or modernised hospitals after many years of under-investment, and there are many areas in which we have put in new equipment. We have, for example, 1,200 new pieces of modern equipment purchased over the past five years to help consultants in cancer save more lives. These are some very specific numbers to show where the money has gone. Patients no longer have to wait hours to be seen in A&E departments. In fact, 98 per cent of patients are now seen within four hours. Ambulance services are reaching 75 per cent of potentially life-threatening emergencies within eight minutes. Amid all this, as I have said, waiting lists continue to fall.
</p>

<a name="60309-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>Other major killer diseases have been tackled more effectively, and as I have said, premature deaths from heart disease, stroke and related diseases have continued to fall. If this was not already impressive enough, we have also worked to narrow health inequalities. I do not remember health inequalities being featured that strongly by the party opposite when it was in office. Health inequalities have been closing at a rate of more than 2.5 per cent in less than half a generation. In essence, that means that services are reaching everyone in society, including those who need the most but in the past might have struggled to gain adequate and appropriate access. Patients and carers now have many more ways to receive and provide advice and help without needing to use traditional NHS services. Notable examples of offering care and advice at a time and in a way that patients need are NHS walk-in centres and the NHS Direct telephone service and website. These are just two examples of new ways to help people get more and quicker access to services and advice.
</p>

<a name="60309-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>A number of noble Lords have talked about efficiency. Anyone would think that there have been no improvements in efficiency under this Government. The average hospital stay in England decreased from 7.4 to 7.1 days last year, delayed discharges have fallen by more than 60 per cent. in the past four years, management costs are down from 5 per cent to 4 per cent in the past seven years, and cancelled operations continue to decline. It is not just me and other Ministers saying this&#151;these developments and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_913"></a>

improvements have been recognised by others. The Healthcare Commission, in its report, <i>The</i> <i>State of Healthcare, </i>commented that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;much should be celebrated . . . people are now able to gain access to many services more quickly and easily than in the past . . . long waits for hospital care have largely been eliminated&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>That is an independent body looking at the evidence available.
</p>

<a name="60309-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>However, I recognise the realities that a number of noble Lords have brought to the debate. I pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, for the way in which she has contributed to the NHS, and I congratulate her, in her capacity as chairman of a strategic health authority, onr bringing her budget in on balance, with good-quality services provided across east London. We recognise that some areas of the NHS still need to improve. In 2004&#150;05, the NHS ended the financial year in deficit for the first time since <i>The NHS Plan </i>was published. As I have said, that needs to be put in historical perspective.
</p>

<a name="60309-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>In the current perspective, however, the majority of NHS organisations are delivering good services, with service improvements, and living within their budget, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, explained. The concerns are in a minority of organisations, and we are taking action with the under-performing organisations to ensure that financial balance in the NHS is achieved by the end of 2006&#150;07. We will say more about some of these issues at a later stage. The Department of Health has put in place a comprehensive programme to work towards rectifying financial mismanagement problems in that minority of trusts experiencing difficulties.
</p>

<a name="60309-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>I recognise the upset and frustration caused to the NHS by the errors in the 2006&#150;07 tariff, under payment by results, which a number of noble Lords have mentioned. As the Minister overseeing this area, I apologise unreservedly for the technical errors identified. We are trying to put those right. We will work with the NHS to test revisions as quickly as possible, to get a seriously good assurance that the revised tariff will be correct and will enable people within the NHS to get on with their financial planning. I must acknowledge that we should have done better in that area.
</p>

<a name="60309-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>What of the future? Several noble Lords have mentioned our new White Paper, <i>Our Health, Our Care, Our Say </i>produced after a major public consultation. One of my best experiences as a Health Minister was spending a Saturday with 1,000 people in Birmingham listening to what they had to say about their health priorities and what they wanted to see from the public services that they were funding. It is absolutely clear that the messages encapsulated in that White Paper were the messages that people were giving to us. This White Paper was not dreamt up in Richmond House; it responds to and reflects the views that people have put to us. They want to see more services closer to home, more services not in hospital, local government and the health service joining up work together more effectively, and more effort put into health promotion and prevention. They accept <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_914"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 914</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that they should have more responsibility in terms of self-care, but they want the public services to provide more support to help them do it, and more support for the people caring for them. We have a journey to travel, but it is one set by the people of this country, not just by the Government.
</p>

<a name="60309-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Several noble Lords have mentioned some of the changes introduced by the Government. I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, for his recognition of the improved change of direction that we have been trying to introduce in relation to plurality of providers, more choice in the system and practice-based commissioning. I share his views that practice-based commissioning will make a real difference to the more personalised and appropriate services that patients will get. There is clinical buy-in. I acknowledge that we might have worked harder on selling to, persuading and working with general practitioners in this area. In the past year or so, however, we have put a lot of effort into working with the profession, and we have got considerable buy-in. This is a direction of travel that they want to see.
</p>

<a name="60309-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>We have had some criticism for the introduction of independent sector treatment centres, but not, I was pleased to see, from the Benches opposite. These centres have already cut waits for diagnostic treatments and elective surgery for 250,000 people with a relatively small proportion of the NHS budget. They have caused parts of the NHS to reflect on their own clinical practices and the way that they provide care services to patients. That is a good innovation. We are still strongly committed to moving down the path of hospitals becoming foundation trusts. They have to have their finances in good order to do that, for the kinds of reasons that several noble Lords have mentioned. We are not taking our foot of the accelerator in that area, however, and I have recently sent another 20 or so candidates for foundation trust status to Monitor, and we have a programme to continue that in the coming months. I cannot respond to all the points made by noble Lords, but I promise to go through <i>Hansard </i>carefully and to write to all noble Lords on all the detailed points and concerns that they expressed. I hope to be able to say yes to my noble friend Lord Stone about speaking at his conference.
</p>

<a name="60309-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>I must respond to and correct one issue, which relates to the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, about computerised applications for doctors under the new system of modernising medical careers. I freely acknowledge that there is an online application process. It is, however, marked by experienced doctors from the postgraduate deaneries. Computers have no say in that process. It is a fair, open and transparent process and provides a single gateway for all applicants and helps practitioners match applicants to vacancies. I have already written to <i>The Times</i>, which published today a letter rebutting the erroneous set of statements previously published.
</p>

<a name="60309-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>In conclusion, our strategy of investment and reform was always going to have some bumpy periods because of the scale of our ambition to improve the health and social care system for all our fellow citizens. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_915"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 915</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

My noble friends have rightly paid tribute to the considerable advances that we have made in the NHS. Those advances are also a reflection of the huge investment of effort by NHS staff of all grades who have committed themselves to improving and turning round the NHS. We have to keep our nerve. I accept that things in some cases could have been done better, but that could be said of all governments. All governments could do things better with hindsight&#151;hindsight is a wonderful thing&#151;and I freely acknowledge that we have made some mistakes, but the direction of travel is right. We have hugely improved the services for people living in this country.
</p>

<a name="60309-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>I finish by paying tribute to all that the NHS staff themselves have done&#151;if I may put it this way&#151;to rescue the NHS from the years of neglect under our predecessors. Working in partnership with doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, porters, cleaners, catering staff, managers and non-executives, we will come through this difficult patch. We will ensure that the NHS continues to improve and meets what I recognise are the understandable rising expectations of our fellow citizens. At the core of our debate are the needs of patients and carers, and it is on those that we all need to focus and make sure that we can make their lives better.

<a name="60309-15_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Cumberlege: </b>   My Lords, I have a few minutes before the next debate; I know that this is a timed debate. I thank all noble Lords who have taken part. It has been a wise, wonderful and, on occasion, very humorous debate. I would like to reflect what my noble friend Lord Selsdon said&#151;that seldom in this House do we sit through a debate without learning a lot, and today has been one of those occasions on which we have learnt a lot. We have learnt a lot from personal experience; often that is so compelling. We have heard about cancer, Parkinson&#039;s disease, DIPEx, spinal injuries, long-term care, sexual diseases, mental health, dentistry, carers, volunteers, St John, nursing and medicine.

The burden of the day&#151;the major part of the debate&#151;has been on the reorganisation and management, or mismanagement, of the health service. It is important that those who have been at the pinnacle of political decision-making&#151;my noble friends Lord Fowler and Lord Forsyth&#151;and have had real experience in the field should be listened to carefully.

<a name="60309-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>My noble friend Lord Howe was more generous than I was, but he forensically exposed some of the flaws in the Government&#039;s plans. I am grateful for that. I thank the Minister for his reply, but I hope that he takes the message away with him which everyone has tried to reinforce&#151;that there is a welcome to the increased expenditure in the NHS, but the question is whether it has been put to really good use. A little has, but an awful lot has been wasted. We have seen huge disruption with structural changes, and a lot of that has appeared simply at the whim of Ministers. Many of us in this House and many people in the country feel <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60309-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goodlad </b>   rose to call attention to the value of the voluntary sector and volunteering; and to move for Papers.
</p>

<a name="60309-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the debate is of relevance to a large number of organisations and our fellow citizens. That number has expanded enormously in recent years. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations estimates that in 1991 there were 98,000 general charities, with a combined expenditure of &#163;11.2 billion. Ten years later, in 2001, there were over 153,000 general UK charities, with a total income of around &#163;20 billion&#151;nearly twice as much. The 2003 Home Office citizenship survey estimates that 42 per cent of the population of England and Wales volunteered formally at least once in 2002, volunteering being defined as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;giving unpaid help through groups, clubs and organisations to benefit other people or the environment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>The voluntary sector encompasses organisations of differing scales and purposes&#151;large charities such as Oxfam, Save the Children and Barnardo&#039;s employing thousands, and smaller community-based groups having no paid staff. Causes include sport and recreation, estimated by the Central Council for Physical Recreation to represent 26 per cent of all volunteering effort in Britain, health and social welfare, the arts, the environment, education and many other purposes both at home and overseas.
</p>

<a name="60309-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>The depth and breadth of the national experience is strongly represented in your Lordships&#039; House, as witnessed by those present at this debate. I have no current interest to declare, but confess to having worked as a Voluntary Service Overseas volunteer as an auxiliary housemaster at St George&#039;s Home for Boys in Johannesburg some 45 years ago. My noble friend Lord Skelmersdale is also a return volunteer from Zambia, as is the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, from Ghana. I notice that VSO&#039;s interest in the other place is represented by Mike Gapes, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, who was a VSO volunteer in Swaziland in 1971 and will be well equipped by that experience to deal with the Permanent Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Sir Michael Jay&#151;VSO Zambia, 1967&#151;and the Director-General of the British Council, Sir David Green&#151;VSO Pakistan, 1967. Should Mike Gapes wish to take his committee on an overseas visit, I am sure that his influence with the Chief Whip, Hilary Armstrong&#151;VSO Kenya, 1967&#151;and assistant government Whips Tony Cunningham&#151;VSO Tanzania, 1980&#151;and Gillian Merron&#151;VSO Guyana, 2005&#151;will ensure that he receives a typically caring Whips&#039; Office response.

<a name="60309-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>VSO, like most charities, has changed enormously since it was founded 48 years ago, when enthusiasm and energy were the chief qualifications. The average age of volunteers has increased enormously. I met in Cambodia some years ago a married couple in their late 60s, recently retired from general practice in this country, who were VSO volunteers running a large hospital. Volunteers are now much more highly qualified and VSO is by far the largest organisation of its type in the world.
</p>

<a name="60309-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>The vastly expanded voluntary sector, with an income of &#163;26.3 billion and an operating expenditure of &#163;24.9 billion, has assets of &#163;66 billion and a paid workforce of at least 600,000&#151;over 2 per cent of the overall paid workforce of the UK adult population. Twenty million people volunteer formally at least once a year and 13 million at least once a month. Most people&#039;s lives in this country are now touched by the voluntary sector.
</p>

<a name="60309-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>Something has been happening in our country, as we see around us in our daily lives. As Martin Birchall, editor of <i>The Times Top 100 Graduate Employers </i>has pointed out, three-quarters of students who left UK universities last summer said that they hoped that their first job would let them,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;give something back to the community&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>Stuart Etherington, the chief executive of the NCVO, wrote in <i>The Guardian</i> in February:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;It seems we have entered some kind of voluntary sector &#039;perfect storm&#039; where everything, at least in terms of the rhetoric, places us at the centre of policy making in this country&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>The Government have responded to that with the compact of 1998, the cross-cutting review of 2002, the Russell commission last year and the Charities Bill. The &quot;Year of the Volunteer 2005&quot; has come to an end. It would be interesting to hear from the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, how far its aims&#151;to increase the number of volunteers, particularly from marginalised groups and the young; to open up more volunteering opportunities in the public and voluntary sector; and to raise the profile of the work that volunteers are doing&#151;have been achieved.
</p>

<a name="60309-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Last week, the Public Accounts Committee in the other place produced its 32nd report, <i>Working with the Voluntary Sector</i>. The report concluded that the Government had failed to meet key targets to increase the voluntary sector&#039;s involvement in public services. Will the Minister anticipate the Government&#039;s formal response to the report by telling your Lordships the Government&#039;s thinking on how the targets can be better implemented in the future?
</p>

<a name="60309-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>What problems does the voluntary sector find are hampering its activities? How can its efforts be more greatly empowered? The Better Regulation Task Force has recommended a review of VAT on charities and of the rules that apply to charities&#039; trading arms. Sir David Arculus, the task force chairman, in referring to red tape tying the sector in knots, says that what the sector needs is a level playing field, no more and no less. Irrecoverable VAT costs charities &#163;400 million to &#163;500 million a year, according to the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_918"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 918</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

estimates, all of which is to be paid from donations made by donors. As one Royal National Lifeboat Institution volunteer expressed it recently:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;When the RNLI spends money to provide this service, with money that has been generously donated, it pays &#163;3.2 million in VAT that it cannot recover. This is not what we risk our lives for. RNLI volunteers give their all. Surely it is time for the Government to give back to our charities what belongs to our charities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>Not surprisingly, the financial burden of irrecoverable VAT on charities and its consequences for their work is unpopular with the public. A MORI poll last autumn showed that eight out of 10 people believed that charities should be compensated in full for irrecoverable VAT. The Charities Tax Reform Group, supported by all the major umbrella organisations in the sector, is seeking to persuade the Government to compensate charities for the irrecoverable VAT that they incur in four priority areas where a matching grant system is most needed.
</p>

<a name="60309-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>The first area is VAT on social welfare service, where charities are complementing or substituting for state provision. This would give charities parity with other service providers such as local authorities and ensure that there was no discrimination or distortion of competition. The second area is VAT on fundraising&#151;the Government have urged charities to make use of tax incentives to encourage charitable donations, but penalise most heavily those charities working hardest to raise funds to meet their charitable objectives. In 2003&#150;04, Oxfam spent &#163;18.9 million in fundraising and lost &#163;1.3 million through irrecoverable VAT in the process.
</p>

<a name="60309-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>The third area is joint ventures and shared services. The Government have actively encouraged charities to work together and to share costs and services, but the VAT system penalises those that do. When one charity offers a service to another, it has to charge VAT on the supply, but the charity paying for the service cannot recover the VAT. That is a further example of the absence of a level playing field between the charitable sector and the public or commercial sector, where sharing services is the normal method of reducing support costs. The fourth area is the repair, construction and maintenance of social welfare housing and charitable buildings. Currently, charities face a large and unfair problem of VAT, while public sector providers are VAT exempt and private providers can recover the VAT that they incur. Charities have the worst of both worlds. They can compete for contracts, but not on an equal basis with their competitors, resulting in lower-quality public services.
</p>

<a name="60309-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>Government officials have acknowledged that charities are almost uniquely penalised by the VAT system, because they provide a mix of fully taxable business supplies, exempt business supplies and non-business supplies. The administration involved in calculating which bit of VAT relates to which service is complicated and onerous, particularly for small organisations. Commercial organisations providing services do not have a problem recovering the VAT, as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_919"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 919</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

they almost exclusively provide taxable services. Local authorities receive an automatic refund of the VAT that they pay on providing services, many of which are identical to those provided by charities. Other member states of the EU have put in place mechanisms for reimbursing all charities some or all of the VAT that they have been charged; such schemes are compatible with EU legislation but of course are a national budget decision. I hope that the Minister can assure us that the Government is treating this problem with urgent sympathy.
</p>

<a name="60309-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>Other issues that concern the sector include the legal definition of a volunteer, which has been the subject of recent litigation. Clarification of the law would be desirable. The CCPR, for example, advocates the development of an agreed definition of a volunteer, enabling them to be covered under such laws as health and safety legislation but not giving them the same legal status as employees. Risk and insurance are also of concern to the sector. Volunteering England is now carrying forward work to address these issues. The Compensation Bill now before the House is of relevance.
</p>

<a name="60309-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>Changing times need new ideas. An important new initiative has been the founding in December 2005 by David Cameron of the Social Justice Policy Group, under the chairmanship of Iain Duncan Smith, which is charged with looking at ways of empowering the voluntary sector, fostering social enterprise and encouraging neighbourhood revival.
</p>

<a name="60309-15_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>Possible ways that are being studied of encouraging the social sector&#039;s expansion include simplifying the complicated and fragmented flows of funding in the charity and voluntary sector; relaxing rules in the tax and benefits system and rewarding volunteer work; offering long-term contracts for the provision of services, so that the voluntary sector can grow; changing planning rules to make it easier for the voluntary sector to use space flexibly and create new facilities while respecting concerns of local residents; creating a level playing field in the awarding of contracts for the delivery of social service at the community level; and introducing a national school-leavers programme to prepare teenagers for their responsibilities as adult citizens and to teach them about life in different communities. In addition, there is the idea of creating new social enterprise zones, where social enterprises&#151;businesses that trade with a social purpose, such as the Big Issue, estimated to contribute more than &#163;18 billion a year to our economy and to employ around half a million people&#151;charities and volunteer organisations can thrive. All power, say I, to the elbow of the Social Justice Policy Group.
</p>

<a name="60309-15_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>The tide of charitable activity, volunteering and the voluntary sector is a swelling current, which no doubt has many tributaries: the failure of the state and the private sector over the past 50 years to tackle the increasing gap between rich and poor, both at home and abroad, and to successfully address some of our communities&#039; long-term needs, such as multi-generational unemployment, drug and alcohol abuse, and a sense of spiritual poverty; awareness of need as a result of the development of mass communication; and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_920"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 920</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

greater leisure enabling people to put something back into the pot. Who knows what the variety of these tributaries is? What is certain is that voluntary action is now an essential part of the fabric of our society and economy. It is a vital expression of community spirit, duty, compassion and personal responsibility, where people act on their own priorities independent of the state. That tide is flowing now as strongly as it ever has. Your Lordships&#039; House has been and remains an important part of that tide, hence this debate. I beg to move for Papers.

<a name="60309-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, for selecting this topic for debate. I am sure that we shall hear contributions reflecting widely different backgrounds and experiences. I started as a volunteer at 16 years of age in the trade union movement as an office representative acting on behalf of tax staff. I suspect that many people do not see the trade union movement as a source of volunteers or as a voluntary organisation, but in the main it is because, without the thousands and thousands of unpaid health and safety representatives and shop stewards, it simply would not exist.
</p>

<a name="60309-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>These days I am a long-serving trustee of Community Service Volunteers and it is in that respect that I shall principally be speaking today. I am constantly impressed by the impact of volunteer citizens in schools, day-care centres, hospitals and with the police. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, stated, research indicates that, in one form or another, nearly half the population volunteers. That is the equivalent of 1 million people added to the labour force. However, 11 million other people tell researchers that they would gladly volunteer if only they were asked and knew the way into volunteering. There is a shortage of access opportunities into volunteering. If the Minister can say anything to indicate movement in that direction, I am sure that we would all welcome it. We need to open more doors to harness the energy in our community. For example, researchers report that trained volunteers carefully matched to school pupils for one hour a week can raise the child&#039;s reading age by a year in one term. Surely we should help every pupil to achieve more with such volunteer support throughout the education system.
</p>

<a name="60309-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>Doctors working with CSV in more than 600 general practices welcome our senior volunteers to support patients, transport patients to the surgery, remind them daily to take their medication and encourage them to take healthy exercise. More research reveals that volunteer support reduces hospital appointments by around 35 per cent and prescriptions by 30 per cent. Projected nationwide, this approach would both improve patient care and reduce the NHS drugs bill by over &#163;2 billion a year.
</p>

<a name="60309-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>In tackling crime and improving community safety, a number of police forces, including Manchester, the Met, Thames Valley and Sussex, are harnessing the skills of citizens to map crime, support witnesses, help to take statements and in some instances assist with <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_921"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 921</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

running front desks in police stations. As a result, millions of hours of police time are released to the front line. It is also interesting to look at volunteering activities in the USA, where many police forces, such as Redding, California, are required to secure 10 per cent of their person power from volunteers. That approach improves public understanding and co-operation, and policing policy. More volunteers could powerfully strengthen police effectiveness here and significantly reduce crime.
</p>

<a name="60309-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>Preventing child abuse continues to challenge our communities despite costly inquiries into deaths such as those of Jasmine Beckford and Victoria Climbi&#233;. In California, volunteers have been matched with families at risk. Over three years, daily supportive visits from volunteers reporting back to social workers have reduced child abuse by 83 per cent. In our own country, families in Bromley and Sunderland are now visited by volunteers trained and matched by CSV, with very encouraging results indeed. At a time when report after report reminds us of the need to protect children from abuse, surely we should welcome such practical and cost-effective volunteering nationwide.
</p>

<a name="60309-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>More leadership and encouragement are needed, not just from government but from local authorities and the Audit Commission, as is a more welcoming stance from what might be described as &quot;producers&quot;&#151;those with vested interests, who are not always as co-operative as they could be when volunteers are seeking to help with services. I put it to the party opposite that, as it prepares its plans in this area, it should set out how it might influence the professions and the trade union movement, which at the end of the day have the key to open the door to involve more volunteers. If it has some ideas in those areas we would welcome their being put in the public domain as early as possible.
</p>

<a name="60309-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Volunteers are not, of course, cost-free. They may need training or simple things such as bus fares. There are recruitment costs too and problems with the rising cost of criminal record checks on volunteers and delays in completing record checks, which cause difficulties. However, volunteers offer flexibility, availability and long-term commitment, which far outweigh any investment that has to be made in them.
</p>

<a name="60309-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>Moreover, we live in times when our communities are under threat and too many people feel excluded. As has been demonstrated so frequently, engaging people in building stronger communities both strengthens society and reduces crime. Across the nation there are powerful examples of how volunteer citizens make a difference: school pupils through their school citizenship programmes; employees serving in a variety of ways through their workplace; and older people volunteering through networks such as the CSV&#039;s retired and senior volunteer programme. The Year of the Volunteer recognised the millions of volunteers and, as I hope the Minister will indicate, recruited many more.
</p>

<a name="60309-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>We should continue to identify new roles which volunteer citizens can undertake in the community generally and in public services so that we have the opportunity to use their time and love to strengthen <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_922"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 922</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

those services and to improve society generally. While I recognise that the Government have done much&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, described&#151;since they came to power, more needs to be done. Now is the time for government at all levels to open their doors to endeavour to get more volunteers in the public service. That would benefit the whole of society.
<a name="time_26"></a>
<a name="60309-16_time0"></a><h5>2.57 pm </h5>

<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="60309-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, for bringing this debate to our attention. I speak about volunteering from the point of view of someone involved in the sports world. It was a revelation to many who take part in sport that if you coached, you were a volunteer. The Government either had great political cunning or great wisdom in drawing that matter to our attention, because the sporting world had not addressed it. We were coaches supporting players, like touch judges. We did not regard ourselves as part of a bigger family, but we are. We are giving our time for free to support sporting activities, especially at the junior level, which comprises the vast majority of sport.
</p>

<a name="60309-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>The debate about sport and physical recreation continues apace&#151;I refer to the 2012 Olympics and the debate about obesity. To put it more flamboyantly, the fit people and the fat people have got together to concentrate minds wonderfully well on how important sporting activity and physical recreation are to the nation. This large part of the volunteering world comprises a support service to the organised state service. All the political parties seek to raise standards in sport and to promote sporting activities after school, which has to be done primarily through the link between voluntary amateur clubs and schools. I favour the definition of a sport primarily conducted through clubs with support services from schools. Others would put the emphasis slightly more differently. Clubs are important because they provide the link once you are not prescribed to do a sport. You are not in a structure that tells you to do it, thus the volunteering angle comes in.
</p>

<a name="60309-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>One of the main considerations in the modern world is how best to prepare people through qualifications to fulfil the volunteering role. The recent trend away from adult qualifications in further education, or at least talk about it, means that people are getting worried. Coaching qualifications, which are important for safety and merely being up to date in your sport, take time and cost money. Will the Government assure us that it will become a key requirement for further education to provide such training for these groups?
</p>

<a name="60309-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>Much will be said about school teachers getting extra help and extra qualification, but they are not a big enough pool to ensure that we have people who are trained properly to ensure health and safety and the enjoyment and development of sport. Unless people are trained properly, they do not tend to enjoy sport because they are generally being told the easiest way to play a game. If you know how to catch, pass or kick a ball in any sport but cannot do it properly, you do not enjoy yourself. If you do not enjoy yourself, you stop doing it at the first available opportunity&#151;unless you <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_923"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 923</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have a masochistic streak running through you. We must try to make sure that such volunteers&#151;this great bonus and support to the health service&#151;have qualifications. The sporting world is very worried about much of what has been said of late about work-based employment and further education being the main thrust of training.
</p>

<a name="60309-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>Another related issue is the risk of litigation and the compensation culture that we hear so much about. It will be no surprise to anyone who has heard me speak before that my sport is rugby. In rugby, the odd bump, bruise and even break is accepted as part of a contact sport. I think I hear a celebratory, &quot;Hear, hear&quot; from my noble friend. That might be slightly overdoing it, as he cannot put his full weight on his left knee at the moment. The risk of the odd bump and bang is much better than carrying two or three stone around your waist in excess fat. It does not do you as much harm to have the healing process operating as it does to be obese. Will the Government assure us that they will take every opportunity to ensure that people are told not to sue over ordinary sporting injuries? You should not go on about it, especially if you have been correctly trained and coached in the first place. If the Government can make that statement clear and enforce it in legislation&#151;we will shortly have an opportunity to make that happen in legislation&#151;we would all be much happier.
</p>

<a name="60309-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>I now come to a specific point and question as a result of my consultations with the CCPR about the effects of the Private Security Industry Act 2001, which created the Security Industry Authority. It means that stewards and people on bars are properly trained as bouncers. I appreciate that the people who briefed me have an axe to grind. The problem has arisen from the fact that sporting events such as the Wimbledon tennis championship and Badminton must have their voluntary stewards trained to the same standard as doormen and bouncers. I appreciate that the securities industry might have a different take on this. The Act was designed to cut down criminality among gangs who were effectively operating protection rackets around doormen services in parts of London. Is it appropriate that that is applied to certain events merely because they have a beer tent? If so, at what level should it be appropriate? I appreciate that the Minister might not have an answer for me now, but he can let me know over the course of time. More information would be appreciated.
</p>

<a name="60309-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>Will the Minister assure me that this legislation is not merely catching the wrong group or being badly applied? Once again there is a great deal of fear that extra costs for training will stop probably the most pure form of volunteer&#151;people who volunteer to steward for a few days a week at an event&#151;who will have to go through expensive training that will up the costs and might endanger some of these sporting events. I hope that the Minister will be able to answer me in due course.

<a name="60309-17_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Sandwich: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, may remember that as Cambridge students we once volunteered our services as pioneer film-makers in China, but the embassy misjudged our honourable motives and we were refused a visa. I know that that did not prevent either of us from subsequent experience, and I thank him warmly for the opportunity to speak today.
</p>

<a name="60309-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The principle of unpaid and underpaid volunteering is a hallmark of our way of life. As a nation we depend on it and without it many of our local traditions, from church flower arranging to fundraising to electioneering, certainly in rural areas, would collapse altogether. Those who offer their services are often taken for a ride by people banking on their goodwill. Some charities and even small businesses depend on volunteers up to the point of exploitation. I hope that the Government will not be in that category. Volunteering is every government&#039;s pet creature and is becoming such an industry that it looks as though even the Olympics will depend on it. I am suspicious about the use of statistics in the Home Office citizenship survey, which was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad. By its nature, volunteering is usually spontaneous and short term, and cannot be quantified. The concept of formal volunteering may be a contradiction in terms. I acknowledge that schools and hospitals are drawing on volunteers, not least among parents, as are many social services. The idea that this is part of a grand, national plan worries me, although I acknowledge that the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, has put it rather more generously.

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>I have worked for most of my life in NGOs here and overseas. I was for many years on the staff of Christian Aid. I remember that as a member of the National Union of Journalists it was a struggle to persuade church organisations that even for Christian communications they had to pay professionally trained people a minimum wage. They did so in the end, because we were not volunteers. That remains a tension in many of our voluntary organisations, as perhaps it should, because there is justice on both sides.
</p>

<a name="60309-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>In a crisis, the vast majority are willing to do voluntary work of some kind, even on official business. Sir Michael Jay was quoted last week as saying that British consular officials worked in a voluntary capacity after the Asian tsunami putting bits of bodies into bags. That seems to go beyond the call of duty, until you remember that voluntary organisations all over Asia have to do such jobs after emergencies, although they may leave it to cleaners and sweepers. Someone has to do it, and governments are usually the last to get there.
</p>

<a name="60309-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>Beyond the crisis, the concept of volunteering becomes a philosophical compromise between charity and private business. If you look on the Internet, you will see that overseas voluntary work is now prey to a vast range of commercial as well as sponsored charitable organisations. I am a strong supporter of the gap year, which is now established and accepted by <br>&nbsp;<br>

almost all universities because of its added value for students. Six years ago, when we last debated this issue, there was some uncertainty among academics, but today over 30 universities offer courses in international development and no one needs convincing of the relevance of an exposure visit, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, has mentioned, for the training of young people in every walk of life. However, it is important to distinguish between overseas visits that count as valuable education in the UK and voluntary work that directly benefits local communities. That applies in the UK as well.
</p>

<a name="60309-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>Adventure tourism can do both. I declare an interest as a patron of the Dorset Expeditionary Society, which equips school students, mainly young men and women in the Weymouth area, for quite rigorous expeditions in India, China and Latin America. Such enterprises often depend on one or two very dedicated individuals who are volunteers in the best sense of the word&#151;people who are completely committed to the welfare and improvement of others.
</p>

<a name="60309-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>Many organisations overseas generously take on untrained volunteers, who may bring education but not the basic skills required. Many times when visiting such agencies I have found outsiders ostensibly placed as volunteers but themselves needing care and protection. We have all been young and energetic. However, I have doubts about the value of some young people doing this. I know of non-governmental organisations which groan when they hear that young volunteers are coming because, however capable they may be in themselves, they are rarely what the village or the project wants. It is hard for governments to draw the distinction, but I trust that this Government are ensuring that volunteers bring tangible benefits to the host country as well as to the volunteer, because both principles are valuable. VSO is now well seized of this and offers jobs for volunteers aged 20 to 75, which means that most of us could still apply.
</p>

<a name="60309-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>Nearer home, the Government could do a great deal to improve the position of charities. The noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, has covered most of the ground. I hope that the Government will always protect the status of volunteers. On the one hand, they will want to safeguard the voluntary principle and to recognise the contribution that it makes to the economy&#151;I give the example of small tourist attractions with shops or stalls which rely on volunteers as sales staff or guides&#151;and, on the other hand, they will need to uphold the right of every contracted employee to receive the minimum wage and proper standards in every working environment. At present there is a potential conflict between the two when volunteers and employees share the same workplace. The Government cannot&#151;and perhaps should not&#151;legislate too much in this field and should respect the frailty of many small businesses which can survive only through this flexibility, the generosity of the volunteer and the best endeavours of the employer.

<a name="60309-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>I have read David Miliband&#039;s interesting speech at the NCVO on 21 February. His enthusiasm is impressive. I can see what the Government want to do with the voluntary sector&#151;they want to reclaim the power of the individual in the service of the many, updating JS Mill&#039;s concept of personal liberty in a new partnership with the state&#151;and it is an exciting idea provided that the state does not make a mess of it.

If the Government are going to help, they should forget nannying on paper and continue to alleviate the tax burden on charities, as the noble Lord has said. In conclusion, God forbid that charities become an agent of government. It is a real concern and the Government&#151;especially under the noble Baroness&#151;should be grown up enough to avoid it.

I am sure that I shall learn a great deal today. I declare an interest as an office holder on a number of charities. I shall concentrate on talking about the voluntary sector from an organisational point of view rather than from the perspective of volunteering.
</p>

<a name="60309-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>I believe that voluntary and community organisations play a significant role in public service delivery, particularly in certain areas. There is enormous potential for them to take on an even greater role and, in so doing, to increase choice in public services locally. However, even with a strong commitment from the Government to promoting a greater role for the voluntary sector, and with numerous reports and reviews, there is still work to do to create the right conditions for the sector to reach its full potential in service delivery while maintaining its unique qualities.
</p>

<a name="60309-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>In my contribution to the debate, I should like to stress that the potential of the voluntary sector to add value to public services comes about because of its independence and its responsiveness to service users. This capability is largely, although not entirely, because of the sector&#039;s bottom-up tradition of user involvement, advocacy and campaigning. It is because of these characteristics that voluntary sector service providers must be given the chance not only to provide services but to transform them in accordance with their own experience, perspective and tradition.

</p>

<a name="60309-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>As Stuart Etherington, the chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said recently:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;Public services aren&#039;t inefficient or ineffective just because they are in the public sector and they won&#039;t be any more efficient if they are just transferred out as they are now. They are ineffective because the wrong model of delivery is driving them&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>He continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;Politicians of all sides constantly refer to the need to make services more consumer driven, to learn from the private sector model, to segment beneficiaries into markets, to prize efficiency and throughput over responsiveness and voice&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>He made a key point, which I would like to echo, that just transferring services to the voluntary sector will not make them better if the contracts and the commissioners continue with the same model. Unless they let the sector change the way in which services are delivered&#151;run from the bottom up&#151;then ultimately they will not change and they will not deliver better outcomes.
</p>

<a name="60309-17_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>I believe that the Government are extremely receptive to this analysis. As has been said, I was particularly encouraged to hear my right honourable friend David Miliband promoting a new concept of double devolution, where it is not only the &quot;how&quot; that is devolved but the &quot;what&quot; as well. Without this double devolution, public service delivery through the voluntary sector would miss the point of the third sector, which my right honourable friend described as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;the supplier of power to individuals and communities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-17_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>We must ensure that greater opportunities for voluntary and community organisations to deliver public services and access government funds avoid compromising their independence, their innovation, their role as campaigners and advocates and their roots in their communities.
</p>

<a name="60309-17_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>I stress that the voluntary sector is not only important to civic society because it is capable of delivering great services; it has a key role to play in giving a voice to communities, as defined by locality, disease or issue. In its role in providing advocacy for communities, it provides a voice for citizens campaigning against injustice, tackling vested interests and challenging the balance of power within society. This role must be safeguarded and valued.
</p>

<a name="60309-17_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>The sector has an important role to play in helping to ensure that services provided by others, not just by it, are designed and delivered with the needs of the user in mind, and that users can have access to those services whatever their background or abilities. The Government&#039;s focus to date has been almost entirely on the potential of voluntary and community organisations as service providers. I am concerned that operating with such a narrow focus could cause the Government to lose its understanding of the wider role of the sector. Many voluntary and community organisations will have no interest in delivering public services, but this does not mean that they do not want to contribute to a debate about the reform of those services, or that they do not have a useful and valid point to make. I am particularly concerned about the role of voluntary health organisations, which want to influence health policy as well as delivery.

</p>

<a name="60309-17_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>How best is this concept of choice and voice to be promoted from a practical point of view? We have already heard that there have been many reviews of the relationship between government and the voluntary sector. The Public Accounts Committee has recommended that new targets should be set beyond 2006 to provide a real incentive for government departments to increase their involvement with the sector. In response to this, the Government have made an important commitment to strengthen the compact&#151;their agreement with the sector&#151;by establishing a compact accreditation scheme, which I am very interested in, and appointing a commissioner to ensure that the scheme is administered properly. A government action plan is expected in the spring, to tell us how this is going to work.
</p>

<a name="60309-17_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>From my perspective, the most useful document to come out of all this important pondering is a low-key one from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, <i>Terms of Engagement</i>. The NCVO believes that this document should help to ensure that the Home Office&#039;s cross-cutting review protects the whole issue of voice and choice from the voluntary sector&#039;s point of view. Can the Minister tell us whether this document will be taken into account in the cross-cutting review? It aims to ensure that the value of campaigning and advocacy is protected within service delivery contracts, that the independence of voluntary and community organisations is protected and that all parts of government respect and value the role that the voluntary sector has to play in providing services and a voice to communities.

<a name="60309-18_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Emerton: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, for raising this debate on the voluntary sector and volunteering. I declare an interest, since I became a volunteer at the age of 11, as a St John Ambulance cadet, and worked my way through to being the chancellor and chief commander, retiring in 2002. I am also involved in other charities, and am chairman of the National Association of Hospital & Community Friends, and the Defence Medical Welfare Service.
</p>

<a name="60309-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>It has barely been two months since the end of the Year of the Volunteer, and I am sure, as has already been mentioned, that we would like to commend the initiative, energy and enthusiasm which it has delivered. I look forward to hearing details from the Minister. Only last week, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right honourable Gordon Brown, officially launched the country&#039;s first national youth volunteering service. Certainly, volunteering seems to have achieved an unprecedented profile and there has recently been a proliferation of initiatives.
</p>

<a name="60309-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>However, I would like to take up some of the aspects of health and care volunteering initiatives, particularly relating to the White Paper, <i>Our care, our say: a new direction for community services</i>. Paragraph 7.96 says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;The third sector, together with the private sector, already provides over 70 per cent of social care. However, there are currently considerable barriers to entry for the third sector in providing NHS services. If we are to utilise the expertise of third-sector providers, we need to lower these barriers&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="column_929"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 929</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60309-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>It is good to know that the Government recognise that there are barriers. There are also good examples of where those barriers are being lifted. For example, picking up from the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, the introduction of Compact in 2004 provided the opportunity of formalising and developing partnerships and has been successful in many areas and organisations, but there are still some difficulties.

</p>

<a name="60309-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>I am privileged to chair a working group, making partnerships work for mental health under the auspices of the National Institute of Mental Health for England. There is a group of NHS and third sector representatives. We have worked at developing a strategy to present to the national strategic partnership forum as a possible model for areas that require detailed consideration when looking at partnership agreements. There are many good examples of partnership working in mental health and in other areas, but there are also many experiencing difficulties.
</p>

<a name="60309-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>There are other barriers that cause frustration. The most recent two, relating to the funding from the Department of Health, are the delays in the allocation of Section 64 and the opportunities for volunteering grants. That caused considerable uncertainty to local organisations, particularly small organisations, having an adverse effect on projects, consequently reflecting adversely on patients and clients.
</p>

<a name="60309-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>The second paragraph in the White Paper to which I would like to refer states,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;The Department of Health will also establish a fund from April 2007 to provide advice to social entrepreneurs who want to develop new models to deliver health and social care services. This fund will also address the problems of start-up as well as current barriers to entry around access to finance, risk and skills, to develop viable business models. The Department of Health will tender for an organisation to run the fund and provide these services&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>While it is encouraging to know that the Department of Health will establish a fund in 2007, I hope that that will not be to the detriment of Section 64 or the OFV funding. I can speak with experience of the current frustrations relating to a tendering and procurement arrangement. I have experienced it as chairman of the National Association of Hospital and Community Friends. That organisation started life as the League of Friends. I remind the House that it represents 45,000 volunteers and produces &#163;45 million per year, which is put back into health and social care.
</p>

<a name="60309-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>We are now in partnership with NAVSM, so we cover 100,000 volunteers over 1,000 sites. That provides various initiatives through the whole range of social and healthcare institutions and communities. The tendering exercise extended from January to November. It was a single tender. No contract was awarded, taking no account of the time and cost to the headquarters staff. That indicates that government departments should have a better understanding of the workings of a small voluntary organisation with a headquarters staff of only nine.
</p>

<a name="60309-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>The third paragraph states,
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_930"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 930</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;Under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, PCTs will retain the responsibility to contribute to multi-agency planning and response in the event of a major incident, whether accidental or intentional. All arrangements for the provision of community services will need to ensure that those services contribute to planning for, and are able to respond to, any major catastrophic incident involving the PCT, including the provision of mutual aid to other organisations with the local health community&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>Here there is no mention of the volunteers or voluntary organisations. I ask the Minister for an assurance that the voluntary aid societies, the British Red Cross and the St John Ambulance, as well as other voluntary organisations, will be invited by the PCTs to participate in the planning not only for major incidents but for public health emergencies such as avian flu.
</p>

<a name="60309-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>In summary, voluntary organisations and volunteers are not solely concerned about raising money. The motivation is about attitudes that support a positive environment and local health and social care services. As registered charities, voluntary organisations are responsible to the Charity Commission for good governance. While developing partnership agreements and entering contracts are important ways forward it is also important to recognise that while the voluntary organisation is responsible and accountable for delivering the content of the contract it is not accountable to the other partner in a managerial sense, but is accountable to the Charity Commission itself for good governance.
</p>

<a name="60309-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>There needs to be a growing understanding between government departments and the third-sector organisations of each other&#039;s roles and parameters and a development of mutual trust. That requires a steep learning curve for government departments and the voluntary sector to ensure that health and social care needs in the widest sense are successfully met.

I have spent the past 30 years working, one way or another, in the volunteering and voluntary sector. So, I would like to concentrate partly on the role of older volunteers, in looking at the enormous contribution that volunteers generally make in this country&#151;about 1.8 billion hours every year, with 47 per cent of those hours put in by people aged 50 or over.
</p>

<a name="60309-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>Of course there are huge benefits for those people themselves. We all love the rosy glow. But we also must celebrate the effect on society generally. Most of our voluntary organisations would pack up if it were not for the older volunteers, and a lot of our local communities generally&#151;magistrates, school committees or whatever&#151;would not manage without older people using their experience, knowledge, loyalty and commitment for the benefit of the local community, or, indeed, nationally or internationally.
</p>

<a name="60309-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>I spent many years at Age Concern. I was very fortunate to be able to get a lot of initiatives off the ground, many of which were intergenerational&#151;probably my favourite type of volunteering. The benefit to both ends of the age spectrum made me weep <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 931</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with joy when I was face to face with the initiatives concerned. One of them, Ageing World, was funded across the whole of Europe. At one stage we had 12 countries participating in initiatives in which older, senior health mentors were trained and then gave health messages which encouraged healthy lifestyles, enabled early diagnoses and treatment, and built very successful, healthy alliances across each of the European state partners. That was a really wonderful experience.
</p>

<a name="60309-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>Since becoming a vice-president of Age Concern&#151;of course I keep very much in touch with my former colleagues&#151;I have been involved in volunteering initiatives in other ways too. One of them is the Experience Corps, which I still chair, which for three years was funded by the Government through the Home Office, and which managed to recruit over 200,000 volunteers, all over 50, mostly from ethnic minority and hard-to-reach communities through working through faith groups. They who have done the most extraordinary things. For example, in Derby there were a lot of problems with young Asian kids completely destroying the buses that took them to school every day. Nobody knew what to do about it. Through the Experience Corps, the older parents manned the buses, and, because of the respect for older people in that community, the wrecking of the buses immediately stopped. There is a huge amount like that that can be done for the benefit of the wider community, and which it is really worth celebrating.
</p>

<a name="60309-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>The Experience Corps is still working to introduce ways of consulting with hard-to-reach groups, so that programmes can be designed to meet their particular needs. I am very proud of that. We also should not forget the huge commitment of many of our large and small corporate bodies to provide volunteers. I chair an all-party group on corporate responsibility, and I am very heartened by the hundreds of thousands of volunteers who are in work, but who are given time to work in the local community or to go all over the place, perhaps to work in schools with pupils who need extra help, or sometimes internationally. That has to be encouraged and celebrated as well.
</p>

<a name="60309-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>At an international level, I join the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, in paying tribute to VSO. I am privileged to be its partner in a small, post-tsunami initiative in Sri Lanka. I admire the work that it does. Our own volunteers, who are going out to share skills that are needed in the rebuilding of life in Sri Lanka, tend to be older people.
</p>

<a name="60309-18_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>I am also a trustee of HelpAge International. I am amazed by what is achieved through the sort of work that it does&#151;often to the benefit of older people&#151;in many countries all over the developing world. Just yesterday, I was in a meeting in Portcullis House which looked at AIDS work carried out by volunteers. VSO states that it sent 219 skilled professionals to work in HIV and AIDS service last year. It has done the most amazing work in communities, particularly in Africa, where AIDS-related disease has affected people of all ages, including grandparents who are left to bring up children with no support and no resources. The <br>&nbsp;<br>

problems that they face are quite amazing, so anything that those volunteers can do is really worth supporting.
</p>

<a name="60309-18_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>In a 2004 report, <i>Facing the Future Together,</i> the UN called for the recognition of volunteers. Though the report focused mostly on work in HIV and AIDS across the developing world, it applies to our country as much as to any other. We really must recognise volunteers, but try to remove the blocks, particularly in the case of older volunteers, that sometimes mean that they cannot do what they would like to do. There is still a lot of discrimination on the basis of age. That manifests itself, for example, in the impossibility of getting adequate insurance cover. It is mostly based on negative attitudes. People do not recognise that those who are older bring a great deal to the work that they do.

I hope that we can all celebrate volunteering in its entirety.

<a name="60309-19_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Pitkeathley: </b>   My Lords, we are indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, for enabling us to celebrate volunteering in this debate. I have worked almost all my life either in or with the voluntary sector. I am president of Volunteering England and of the Community Council for Berkshire. I am vice-president of Carers UK and the Princess Royal Trust for Carers, and I am involved with many other charities. I am also chair of the Futurebuilders Advisory Panel and a member of the Commission on Unclaimed Assets, which is attempting to release unclaimed assets from banks for the benefit of the voluntary sector. I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Best, will speak a little more about that later.

</p>

<a name="60309-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>The wording of the Motion today presents us with a problem, given the limited time. Volunteering and the voluntary sector&#151;the &quot;third&quot;, or &quot;voluntary and community&quot; sector, as it is increasingly called&#151;are not actually interchangeable concepts, so there is a dilemma in which one to focus on. I will try to draw out the similarities or common themes rather than focus on the differences between them. One of the most important is that volunteering and the voluntary and community sector are both receiving more attention from the Government than ever before. In 40 years, I have never known the sector to have a higher profile or more support from the Government. That support comes in the form of hard cash, for example the millions of pounds put into Futurebuilders, Capacity Builders, and the Change Up programme, and in legislation, for example the Charities Bill and the commitment given to the charitable sector in the National Lottery Bill currently before your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>It also comes in recognising the part the sector can play in extending the range and scope of public service delivery. That includes acknowledgement of the unique contribution that the voluntary and community sector can bring to public services in its greater contact with users and end recipients, as my noble friend Lady Morgan has reminded us. Because of that contact it is has the ability to provide services which more readily meet the needs of disadvantaged individuals and communities. Typically, the voluntary and community sector has influenced the way all services are delivered, because of the emphasis placed on user choice and involvement. That was pioneered by the voluntary sector, and is a proud legacy which we have given to the public services. It applies just as much to those organisations which focus on campaigning and advocacy as those which focus on service delivery.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>The Government now recognise that for too long the voluntary sector has not competed on a level playing field for service contracts. That was either because local authorities and others were not keen to engage, or because the terms made it impossible for voluntary organisations, especially the smaller ones, to engage in the procurement process. It is not a level playing field if local authorities do not pay their bills on time, or if commissioners try to drive down prices by basing them on volunteers&#039; contributions, or by not acknowledging that voluntary organisations must have full cost recovery for costs incurred. Many voluntary organisations have been reluctant to engage in robust negotiations, lest the grants they need for other parts of their work are brought into jeopardy.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>The Compact with the sector has already been referred to, and I pay tribute with others to the work of NCVO. It has gone some way to addressing these issues, and Compact Plus will go further. We are making good progress. Futurebuilders, too, is an excellent initiative, focusing on trying to wean voluntary organisations off a grant culture by using development money, loans and investments to encourage more and better provision of service in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_934"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 934</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

areas of high social need. Though it is early days, some of the initiatives which it has enabled to get off the ground are truly inspiring. It would be useful for Ministers to visit some of these. I must mention here the commitment of many government Ministers, including the Prime Minister and the Chancellor, to these initiatives. That commitment is important, and it is significant that many more MPs and Ministers than at any time hitherto have direct experience of working in or with the voluntary sector.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>In my role as president of Volunteering England, I am delighted with the high profile now given to the whole issue of volunteering. The Russell commission, focusing on youth volunteering, has shown us the possibilities for young people. I quote from Joe Saxton, director of nfpSynergy:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;Something as well publicised as the Make Poverty History campaign has shown that young people are interested in the idealism that underpins it . . . Far from being &#039;born hoodies&#039; as media reports suggest, they are keen to volunteer.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>At the other end of the age scale, we have heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, about the Experience Corps. There is much more emphasis now on drawing volunteers from as diverse a base as possible.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>I am extremely pleased to say that Volunteering England is shortly to announce the appointment of a commission on the future of volunteering, which will play a central role in considering strategies and policies to ensure that we enable volunteers to benefit from their volunteering, as well as being helped to continue their contribution to communities. We ignore at our peril the willingness of so many people to engage in volunteer activities, whether as trustees, school governors, coaches, good neighbours or whatever. We give a lot of attention to anti-social behaviour, but not nearly enough to the very pro-social behaviour that leads people to give up their time freely.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>I should point out that no one has yet fallen, and I hope that no one will fall, into the trap of considering the almost 6 million carers as being in the volunteer category. They are not volunteers. They are fulfilling that often stressful role for reasons of love, duty or family obligation, not from free choice.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>However, the verdict on volunteering and the voluntary sector is pretty positive. Of course, there are problems. We still have to resolve the public benefit issues in the Charities Bill. There are debates about paying trustees or even volunteers at the level of the minimum wage, which must be addressed and which call into question some of the principles that we as volunteers have long held dear. Far too many local and even national voluntary organisations still struggle with fund-raising and having their grants peremptorily cut. However, on the whole, the story is one of which we as a nation can be very proud.

<a name="60309-19_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   My Lords, as ever, it is a pleasure to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, who has just spoken for the second time today. I follow her directly sufficiently often in <br>&nbsp;<br>

debates in your Lordships&#039; House that Pitkeathley & Brooke is on its way to becoming an item&#151;not a social item, but opposite ends of an ampersand, like Crosse & Blackwell or Chatto & Windus.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>I congratulate my noble friend Lord Goodlad on both his successes in advocacy: first, on securing the debate; and, secondly, on his launching of it. It is a discriminating choice of subject which can inspire almost a score of speeches stretching into the early evening on an unwhipped Thursday from all corners of your Lordships&#039; House, especially from the Cross Benches.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>I declare an interest, as the protagonist of two CAF trusts, one for lay causes, one for ecclesiastical; and as president of the oldest youth club in the world, this year celebrating its 140th anniversary in a modern building within half a mile of this Palace. Anyone who cares to visit will be welcome.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>My noble friend Lord Goodlad, as befits a member of our party, has chosen a subject with an ancient tradition. In the 18th century, the early rump of our parliamentary party, long in opposition, had relatively few commanding principles, but one of them was opposition to a standing Army, allied to passionate enthusiasm for the militia. The British Beer and Pub Association cannot produce an exhaustive list of British pubs, but the Library of your Lordships&#039; House has provided for me an internet list of 43 pubs devoted to the militia theme. Eleven of them are called the Volunteer Inn&#151;one of them, happily, in the former constituency of my noble friend Lord Goodlad&#151;10 called the Volunteer Arms; another 10 called the Volunteer; five called the Rifle Volunteer or Volunteers; and eight others which claim a single entry.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>I know that list not to be exhaustive, because the Volunteer in Market Lavington in Wiltshire, where I have drunk much ale after village cricket matches, is not on the list. However, the most precisely regimental of the latter individualist group is the Fifth Hants Volunteer Arms in Southsea; probably the most isolated, the Royal Volunteer in Chesterfield; and probably the most lonely, the unique&#151;I say this after the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross&#151;Old Volunteer in Carlton in Nottinghamshire. Of course, the pub signs are military, but their very longevity and ubiquity help to reinforce the sense of volunteering being a golden thread in our national life.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>As to the substance of the debate, I am not quite sure how far your Lordships&#039; House is allowed to animadvert on tax. As a former Treasury Minister for four years, including Customs and Excise responsibilities, I shall confine myself to saying, in no Eurosceptic spirit, that Brussels is a complication when it comes to VAT. I realise that the Government may thus have little leeway, but the complexity for charities of the VAT rules are Kafkaesque and the financial gurus of charities are not necessarily natural Houdinis.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>The ironic epitome of this was the Duke of Wellington&#039;s adage in defending Brussels itself against Bonaparte, which was that his own battle plan was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_936"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 936</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

always made of leather, whereas the emperor&#039;s was made of iron. One of the problems with the VAT rules is that they tend to be made of iron.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>I shall say a brief word&#151;for this is necessarily a telegraphic debate&#151;about leadership, management and training in the voluntary sector. To be telegraphic, some of those with either management consulting or large-scale retail experience who have held executive positions in the Conservative Party in the past decade have not always demonstrated that they understood the difference between volunteers and a paid workforce.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>Those in your Lordships&#039; House who are concerned with the National Lottery Bill will return to it on Monday. I offer a brief trailer to our debate on Clause 11 in Committee. Its title is &quot;Distributing bodies: publicity&quot;. Interestingly, given its title, it is permissive rather than hortatory, let alone mandatory, about what those bodies should do in affording publicity to the causes on which they bestow largesse. I agree that the permissiveness of the clause is a start, but unless the distributing bodies draw creative attention to their popular decisions, they have no amulet against unkind critics when they take an unpopular decision at the risk of turning off the punters. I am not seeking to hold Monday&#039;s debate today, but the issue is all the more critical because the Government&#039;s statutory capacity in the Bill, to a substantial degree to guide the Big Lottery Fund, means that, as the head of Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations implied in <i>The Guardian</i> 15 months ago, the Government&#039;s powers can increase the size of the target when the cause is unpopular, thus encouraging attack, especially if it is targeted to a significantly under-informed audience. We shall come back to that point on Monday.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>I have a final word about volunteering in youth clubs, derived from my own club&#039;s experience. An inner-city youth club gains immensely if it can offer sporting activity. We have a gym for training, which is sufficiently well equipped that we can rent it out during the day. But we have no playing fields, so our 11 football teams are ferried across London to other people&#039;s grounds. That is a prime opportunity for volunteers. The routes for public sector funding can come either through Ofsted-guided local authority funding&#151;I was once the DES Youth Service Minister&#151;or through that local authority&#039;s leisure arm. We had such complications with the Ofsted route that we were glad to be shifted to the leisure and sporting route within our local authority. But even that runs the risk of the local authority wanting to define us a sports club rather than as a youth club, which, after 140 years, misses the point.
</p>

<a name="60309-19_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>The mild fuss about the Ofsted route, which we caused at reasonably high levels, may have had a subsequently beneficial effect, although I confess to ignorance about that. But let me identify what the Ofsted deterrent was. If a youth club seeks funding for sport through the Ofsted-ordained route, it will be denied funding for sport purely as recreation but will be afforded it if it can be turned into a learning experience. That means the volunteers, often parents <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_937"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 937</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

who ferry 11 teams across London for half the year, having to prepare a learning strategy before the match and then mark themselves on it when the game is over. That is not what they literally volunteered for. It makes them feel like bad social workers rather than good volunteers. As an annual attender at our club&#039;s prize-giving awards, I cannot speak too highly of the club&#039;s total enthusiasm. It is an ideal antidote to inner-city ills, and it is too precious to be hazarded by unimaginative bureaucracy.

<a name="60309-20_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Montgomery of Alamein: </b>   My Lords, it is a great pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville. I found his pub crawl quite fascinating; I shall have to visit some of these establishments. I shall approach the subject from a different angle. We are all grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, for introducing this extraordinarily wide-ranging subject. From what we have heard, it covers a huge number of facets of national life&#151;VSO, charities, trade unions, sport and so on&#151;which are mostly matters of social endeavour.
</p>

<a name="60309-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>It made me think, while listening to this debate, that I started volunteering when I was at school, during the war. We volunteered to do agricultural work; we did not have to do it. Sometimes, it was not quite so voluntary: I remember my housemaster saying occasionally, &quot;I want three volunteers&#151;you, you and you&quot;. But he usually got more than that on those occasions.
</p>

<a name="60309-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>I want to turn to a completely different aspect, which has not been mentioned so far. In doing so, I owe a deep apology to the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, because I have not given her any notice of this question. I do not expect her to comment, but she might like to write to me if she thinks that what I have to say has any merit or may be followed up. In 1963, the Government set up the British National Export Council to organise trade promotion activities overseas. Under that umbrella organisation there were a large number of area advisory groups, which were comprised of businessmen from different sectors with knowledge of the region concerned. All were unpaid volunteers and all were very experienced.
</p>

<a name="60309-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>In due course, BNEC, as it was known, metamorphosised into the British Overseas Trade Board&#151;BOTB&#151;but, obviously, it had the same sort of under-structure of the area advisory groups. I declare an interest: in 1963, I was recruited to join the Latin American area advisory group and subsequently became, in the early 1970s, its chairman. Therefore, my comments are based on that experience and my subsequent involvement in many other Latin American related activities in a <i>pro bono publico</i> capacity.
</p>

<a name="60309-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>Now I turn to the problem. In 1999-2000, the Department of Trade and Industry went through yet another reorganisation, which involved wiping out all 16 area advisory groups and replacing them with four regional committees. These, again, were reduced <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_938"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 938</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

further in worse to come. In 2003, the regional committees were abolished and were replaced with a single advisory group to cover sectors and regions. So, over a very short period, the present Government wiped out the contribution of 200 highly experienced and very successful businessmen who were giving their valuable time to promote our overseas trade. These organisations created a lot of effort. Our national life blood depends on trade overseas. It is strange that it should have been wiped out like that.
</p>

<a name="60309-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>The curious thing&#151;I come to the government action&#151;is that the abolition of all those organisations coincided with the Deputy Prime Minister, no less, announcing that the voluntary sector was to be encouraged. That does not strike me as joined-up government, especially as the life blood of the nation depends so much&#151;deprived as we are of natural resources&#151;on generating overseas trade in goods and services. There are many more examples that I could mention in the financial services and other industries, but I hope that what I have said will indicate that the abolition of this vast body of successful people was not a very good use of one of our most important national assets.

<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="60309-20_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Best: </b>   My Lords, I add my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, for initiating this debate. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, that the debate comes at a time when there is more political commitment and interest in the voluntary sector, and in volunteering, than I can recall during the 38 years that I have worked in the sector. I declare my interest as director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which supports voluntary agencies and undertakes research on the sector&#039;s effectiveness. I also chair the Giving Forum, which brings together key players who want to see an increase in donations to charitable causes and also share an interest in boosting the giving of time&#151;volunteering&#151;as well as money.
</p>

<a name="60309-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>In these debates, I know it is wise to touch on only one significant issue of the moment. I would very much like to hear the views of the Minister on the treatment of unclaimed assets held by banks, building societies and other financial institutions, which can be released for social purposes. The Government are to be applauded in working towards a framework for enabling these funds to be reinvested in society, while always enabling the owners to reclaim their assets if those owners can be found later on.
</p>

<a name="60309-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>The Chancellor has announced in his Pre-Budget Report that there will be consultation on the basis on which these unclaimed assets may be passed on for social purposes. It is here that the potential hazards appear. While there is general acknowledgement that the Government have the key role to play in setting up mechanisms for these funds to be released, it is important to be clear that the money cannot be seen as belonging to the Government.
</p>

<a name="60309-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>Government spending accounts for well over a third of national expenditure and increasingly not just the public sector but the voluntary sector&#151;and even <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_939"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 939</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

sizeable parts of the private sector&#151;are reliant upon the Government for their income. We all know that, &quot;He who pays the piper calls the tune&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60309-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>As someone responsible for a large charity with its own endowment, able to act quite independently of any government&#151;because the Joseph Rowntree Foundation does not receive any grants for its work&#151;I am very aware of the huge benefits which this independence brings. We will often choose to pursue issues which are not a priority for government: sometimes an issue subsequently becomes a high priority, not least because charitable and voluntary bodies have taken it forward. The release of large sums of new money from the unclaimed assets sitting within financial institutions presents an important opportunity for activity in the voluntary sector that is outside the contract culture and not directly controlled by the state.
</p>

<a name="60309-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>In the same way that many have sought to ensure that funding from the National Lottery is always additional to that available from statutory sources, and the temptation for government to use lottery funds to replace their own funding is resisted, so advocates for the voluntary sector are keen to hear reassurances that unclaimed assets as a new source of finance&#151;and the figure of &#163;2 billion has been mentioned&#151;are allocated through a quite separate and truly independent agency.
</p>

<a name="60309-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>My foundation is giving some support, alongside others, to the Commission on Unclaimed Assets organised by the Scarman Trust and chaired by Sir Ronald Cohen. With help from the Young Foundation, this commission is looking at ways in which funds might best be deployed for the benefit of disadvantaged communities. Meanwhile the National Council for Voluntary Organisations&#151;and I declare an interest as a member of its advisory council&#151;is calling for a fair distribution of these assets to support a broad range of activities and causes across the whole of the voluntary and community sector.
</p>

<a name="60309-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>The Government have put out some rather mixed messages on the destiny of these substantial resources. The Pre-Budget Report of last December talked about a,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;focus on youth services that are responsive to the needs of young people, and also on financial education and exclusion&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>There is also mention of &quot;deprived communities&quot;, in particular, getting help. But as I read the statement, it is under the two headings of &quot;young people&quot; and &quot;financial exclusion&quot; that deprived communities would receive support. The youth focus chimes with the Chancellor&#039;s interests&#151;exemplified by the establishment of the Russell Commission on young people and volunteering. And perhaps the mention of financial exclusion is linked to the anxieties of the financial institutions, which currently hold these unclaimed assets, about bad debts from their over-stretched borrowers.
</p>

<a name="60309-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>Important as these issues are, should the Government, or indeed the financial institutions, decide the destination of these new resources? Should not government be supporting work with young <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_940"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 940</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

people from their own budgets, and should not financial institutions be investing more of their recent substantial profits in combating the problems of debt and financial exclusion without drawing on this new-found source of cash? Are not other good causes of equal value? The parallel question is: if government are not to be the arbiter, what agency should be entrusted with the task of deciding which charities should benefit from the unclaimed assets?
</p>

<a name="60309-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>The value of the voluntary sector is intimately tied to its independence. Apart from the principle of additionality&#151;that these new funds should not be a substitute for what is properly funded either by general taxation or by the financial services industry&#151;my concern is with the independent nature of the decision-making process. Funding that is not tied to the Government&#039;s own agenda is a precious resource in a free society, and I would warmly welcome the views of the Minister on the safeguards proposed for the distribution of this wonderful windfall to enhance the voluntary sector&#039;s value as an independent force for good.

<a name="60309-21_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Haskel: </b>   My Lords, I too congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, in moving this Motion. In spite of his concerns, like other noble Lords I think that volunteering and the voluntary sector is something in which we can all take pride and pleasure. It is also a huge topic, so it is right that the noble Lord differentiated between the voluntary sector and volunteering. To me, the voluntary sector implies charities and social enterprises, many professionally led and most with strong messages. The noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, told us that there are some 600,000 paid employees in the voluntary sector. That is larger than major sectors of industry. It is as large as the aircraft, the motor car and truck industries all put together.
</p>

<a name="60309-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>But is this volunteering? Not entirely. I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich. Volunteering is something rather more personal. Volunteers give of themselves. They are the foot soldiers of voluntary sector. As well as raising money, they manage, organise and help out in their own individual ways. There are 25,000 schools in this country, all of which have about a dozen governors. All are volunteers, personally committed to social and economic development as well as education. But all carry moral and legal obligations, obligations which can have a big impact on their finances, their jobs and their relationships; but more of that later.
</p>

<a name="60309-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>Why do they do it? What is it that people get out of volunteering? The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, spoke of a &quot;rosy glow&quot;. Another answer crossed my desk the other day in a letter I received from Mr Lawrie Siteman, who is standing down after five years as chairman of the Kingston Liberal Synagogue. In his letter he asks: what have I learnt in my five years? His reply: that the world of the volunteer requires tact and diplomacy, a level of sales skill, a high degree of communication skills, organisational acumen, some personal charisma, leadership, presentational skills to <br>&nbsp;<br>

ensure understanding at all levels, and a vision. He then went on to ask: what would I say to a potential replacement? His reply: there is no better way to develop yourself, to learn your own capabilities, and humbly to find out more about your own personality.

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>That is why we can take pride and pleasure in volunteering. Pride, in that as other noble Lords have told us, according to the 2003 Home Office Citizenship Survey, 42 per cent of the population of England and Wales volunteered at least once during the previous 12 months, and pleasure in the social capital and good will that is generated by the commitment and generosity of this huge number of people.
</p>

<a name="60309-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>What can the Government do to help and encourage this activity? I agree with my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley that the Government are taking it very seriously. The noble Lord, Lord Best, also made the point. My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is also taking this seriously. He has recently started to chair a ministerial committee on this subject. His ambition is to get 1 million more young people into volunteering by the end of the decade. One way I think that he can do this is to enable young people to gain qualifications while they volunteer. At present, it is hard to engage with an NVQ or other qualification and be a volunteer at the same time. I think that the Government can play an important role in facilitating this, and I hope that my noble friend the Minister will explore this with colleagues from the Department for Education and Skills.
</p>

<a name="60309-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>As I indicated earlier, there are signs in some sectors that volunteers are deterred by the legal, personal and financial responsibilities that they carry, not only while they are active but during the six years after they have moved on. Something could be done to make this less onerous, and I hope that my noble friend the Minister will look at this with colleagues from the Lord Chancellor&#039;s Department. It is also important for the Government to encourage&#151;not force&#151;each community to review its own voluntary sector. We are a diverse society, and as in all areas of social activity, the voluntary sector cannot develop on the basis of one size fits all. All communities develop in their own unique way. As my noble friend Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe said, the more that communities generate social capital, the greater the hope for sustained social cohesion. Over the years, this has happened in a haphazard way&#151;needs and interests come and go. Mapping the voluntary activity in a community is therefore important evidence for a community to develop its own strategy and planning. This is of fundamental importance to volunteering in any community.
</p>

<a name="60309-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>I say this with confidence because I have been closely involved in just such an exercise. I declare an interest as president of Jewish Policy Research, which is in many ways the Jewish community&#039;s social think tank. Over six years, from 1997 to 2003, 13 studies were published providing vital data and analysis of the Jewish voluntary sector. In the words of the study, it was

</p>

<a name="60309-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>This study has been enormously helpful in ensuring that the work of the voluntary organisations is more tangible, effective and meaningful. This project was also partly motivated by the need to think through the implications of the Government&#039;s policy to rely increasingly on the voluntary sector to provide services and facilitate citizenship participation&#151;a point made by my noble friend Lady Morgan. To achieve this, a great deal rests on the success of the minority voluntary sectors, and the evidence from research by Jewish Policy Research is enormously encouraging. This work was carried out with the encouragement of the Home Office, and I hope that the Minister will use it as a model of good practice to help other groups.
</p>

<a name="60309-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, that volunteering is not just a matter of raising money. With 42 per cent of the population participating, it is far more important than that. Its importance lies in it being the opposite of anti-social behaviour. Ministers have rightly been tough on anti-social behaviour, but have they done enough to encourage volunteering, which, as my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley put it, is pro-social behaviour? I have tried to indicate what they can do, and what voluntary organisations can do to help themselves.

<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="60309-21_spnew1"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Lords, I shall speak briefly in this debate about an organisation that, to many people, represents the quintessence of volunteering in this country&#151;the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. I declare an interest, as for the past few years I have had the honour of serving as a member of the RNLI council in an unpaid voluntary capacity.
</p>

<a name="60309-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>The RNLI relies on volunteers and voluntary contributions to operate its life-saving services. Statistics tend to be a bit dry but, at present, 6,596 volunteers are involved in operational roles at UK lifeboat stations. These include lifeboat crew members; shore helpers, who help to launch and recover lifeboats; and others who provide the management at a lifeboat station. If we look simply at crew, the RNLI has 3,777 volunteer lifeboat crew members in the UK at 190 lifeboat stations. Put another way, 95 per cent of RNLI lifeboat crew are volunteers&#151;they are the RNLI&#039;s front line, ready at any time of the day or night to go to the assistance of those in peril at sea, often at great personal risk to themselves.
</p>

<a name="60309-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>The other dimension to volunteering in the RNLI is its funding. The RNLI depends on voluntary contributions for financial support, and more than 30,000 additional volunteers are involved in active fundraising on its behalf throughout the UK, inland as well as on the coast. The RNLI costs &#163;110 million a year to run. The voluntary ethos is its great strength, so naturally it undertakes to do everything it can to look after its volunteers properly and provide them with safe, modern and efficient lifeboats and equipment, as well as excellent training and the best possible support in the event of injury. That duty of care is right and proper, but the RNLI would concede that the duty, together with the demands of EC legislation, health and safety regulations and training requirements, is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_943"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 943</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

making it more difficult to maintain its voluntary ethos. Nevertheless, the finding and keeping of volunteers is critical to the future of the service.
</p>

<a name="60309-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>My noble friend Lord Goodlad mentioned one issue that matters a great deal to the RNLI&#151;the definition of &quot;volunteer&quot;. The issue particularly affects volunteer crew members, who can be divided into two groups&#151;ordinary volunteer crew members and retained volunteer crew members. There are approximately 360 retained crew members in the UK, who include mechanics and coxswains. They receive a retaining fee in recognition of their high level of commitment, skills and training. In the past, a very small number of volunteers with an axe to grind have sought to resolve issues through employment tribunals, which in some cases have been prepared to take them on. The problem is that when volunteer status is challenged, no legislation says that they are not employees. This is by no means unique to the RNLI, as many other voluntary groups recognise that the legal status of volunteers is a very grey area. At one end of the spectrum there are pure volunteers, and at the other some relationships may be clearly contractual&#151;there is no clear dividing line in the middle.
</p>

<a name="60309-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>The RNLI has no contracts with its volunteer crew and no desire to change that. Such an organisation does not need or want a contract of employment; indeed, there is no contract of employment or mutuality of obligation between the institution and its volunteers, and it would be enormously helpful to the institution to have that recognised formally. Anything that the Minister can say about that would be very welcome. There is a different approach from the contractual one. It is something that the RNLI has recently developed that it calls a volunteer commitment, which is a set of statements intended to outline the relationship between the RNLI and all its volunteers. It is only fair that both parties are clear what this may involve and what is expected in the term.
</p>

<a name="60309-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>The volunteer commitment&#039;s purpose is to give this clarity to any volunteer, new or current, in whatever volunteer role that they fulfil. It really aims to provide three things: clarity, over the relationship and the involvement between the RNLI and all its volunteers; consistency, over how the various groups of volunteers give and receive information and are managed and developed; and communication, as a means of conveying to tens of thousands of volunteers how everyone together can help the RNLI achieve its objectives and save more lives at sea.
</p>

<a name="60309-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>That approach is not only helpful to all parties, but is also in harmony with the volunteer ethos, about which so many noble Lords have spoken. If we look around for an organisation that exemplifies and embodies what volunteering means and should mean in our society, we need look for no better example than the RNLI, which provides the nation with a first-class service and the Chancellor of the Exchequer with no burden.

<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="60309-22_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Ramsbotham: </b>   My Lords, I join all those who have thanked the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, for giving us this opportunity to raise issues connected with an important part of our national life.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>I begin with two apologies. First, as a former Inspector General of the Territorial Army, I am not going to speak about the enormous contribution that the voluntary forces make and continue to make to our operations overseas. I know that all members of this House have paid tribute to that contribution and will pay tribute whenever it is mentioned. In recompense, I am wearing the cufflinks that were given to me when I retired. My second apology is to the Minister, because, unfortunately, the point that I want to make is really for a ministry other than the one for which she is responsible. I hope that she may bear the tidings to where I wish to send them.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>I must declare an interest, in that I am an office holder of a number of voluntary organisations, many of them connected with the penal world. In those various posts, I recognise the cautions that the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, raised in relation to the activities connected with VAT. I also recognise the cautions that have been raised by a number of people about the involvement of bureaucracy and the increasing amount of paperwork.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>I will interject an interesting statistic, which was given to me by the chairman of a voluntary organisation; it is the sort of information that the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, is so good at supplying this House. There are 54 words in the Lord&#039;s Prayer&#151;71 if you include the addition and the Amen. There are 277 words in the 10 Commandments. There are 300 words in the American Declaration of Independence. There are 26,911 words in the European directive on the export of duck eggs. This has little to do with the voluntary sector, except that it illustrates the exponential increase in paperwork.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>I want to concentrate on something to which the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, and the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, have referred&#151;the involvement of the voluntary sector in what might be called pro-social behaviour and, in particular, the contribution that the voluntary sector and volunteers can make to both the penal system as a whole and the conduct of looking after offenders in prison and in the community.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>The aim of the criminal justice system is to protect the public by preventing crime and, better, re-crime&#151;in other words, reoffending. Last September, the present Home Secretary enunciated a marvellous vision of how he would like to see that operated. He sees this as being delivered by a partnership involving the public, the private and the not-for-profit sectors, all concentrating on the needs of individuals and contributing as best they can to providing what is needed to help those people to live useful and law-abiding lives, both in custody and in the community. I agree with him entirely. Having seen many examples and being involved with some of them, I believe that this partnership should be a partnership in the best <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_945"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 945</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

sense of the word, in that each of the three areas&#151;the public, the private and the not-for-profit sectors&#151;should provide what they can to aggregate the contribution of each.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>The role of the voluntary sector is vast. It covers penal organisations discussing policy, watchdogs that serve in individual establishments, visitors, help with all kinds of offending behaviour treatment, drug treatment, looking after families, providing work and education and so on&#151;all of which is encapsulated in the splendid document <i>What can I do?</i>, published by another voluntary organisation, the Bourne Trust, which previously concentrated on Catholic prisoners. I am absolutely fascinated by the width and breadth of what the sector does, the numbers involved and the fact that its help is given in so many areas of the country so freely without people seeking any reward other than the fact that they feel that they are doing something to help their community by protecting it in the longer term.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>However, in relation to arranging this partnership, I am very disturbed at a word that has crept into the vocabulary recently. This is the caution that I invite the Minister to note. I refer to the introduction of the word &quot;contestability&quot;, which I understand is a Treasury word. Some people suggest that it refers to market testing. When applied in the penal sector, it is now suggested that that contestability includes the voluntary sector competing with both the private and the public sectors for contributing services. I suggest that that is an entirely false interpretation of the role and ethos of the voluntary sector. It does not compete for delivering services; it delivers services.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>As an office holder of an organisation, I am more than happy to invite the public to contribute money to help to deliver the service that will protect them, but I cannot in all honesty ask them for money to enable me to enter a competition with a private or a public sector for delivering that service. In the past four weeks, I have had two disturbing letters. One was from the Department for Education and Skills to me in my position as chairman of the Koestler Trust suggesting that the outcomes of my trust are not sufficiently in tune with the outcomes in the Government&#039;s Green Paper on reoffending, dated 15 December, and that potential funding from the Government is questionable. The arts do not deliver hard outcomes in terms of reoffending; they provide the means by which people can become engaged in the education and training that might provide the hard outcomes. Therefore, I suggest that that is the wrong word.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>Almost as disturbingly, two weeks ago, as president of UNLOCK, the National Association of Ex Prisoners, I received a letter from a regional offender manager inviting me to contribute &#163;5,000 a year to the cost of a member of her staff who would be responsible for commissioning our services. I do not believe that as a voluntary organisation we should be asked to contribute to the staff of an official organisation.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>My caution, which I hope will be passed on, is that I do not believe that we can afford to lose the vital and unique contribution that the voluntary sector and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_946"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 946</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

volunteering can and do make to this pro-social behaviour. I ask the Government to bear that in mind in future.

<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="60309-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, for promoting this debate. It is as if he threw a very large stone into a pond which has turned out to be very deep indeed, causing many ripples. I want to add just one more small eddy towards the end of this debate. I have been involved in volunteering in a number of ways. In view of an earlier exchange with the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, I should say that I regard being a Member of the Cross Benches as the Rolls-Royce of volunteering roles.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>I want to focus on the other part of the debate, which is the voluntary sector. I declare an interest as president of Alzheimer Scotland and as an adviser to the Alzheimer&#039;s Society in England. Both are key charities, and as excellent charities they provide the effective structure and support that enables many carers more effectively to serve the needs of others. In so doing, they help carers to help themselves. That is one of the major roles of these societies, and the input is significantly from those who care helping those who are learning to care. These charities are typical of the best and they help to define the role and possibilities of the voluntary sector. The debate topic includes volunteers, and I underline the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, that many who care are not volunteers. They are there because they accept responsibilities&#151;usually of family, sometimes of friendship and sometimes of good neighbourliness&#151;and they deserve all the support that we can give them.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>I will focus on two points at which the support given by those charities to carers might be complemented by further support from the Government. In that sense, I am picking up the platform offered by the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, which is that these charities &quot;give voice&quot;. I want to give voice to two comments that have come from these and like-minded charities on ways in which the Government, in their proper and commendable focus on the charitable sector, want to help the provision of care throughout our community. The first comment focuses on the word &quot;employment&quot;. The Government are to be commended for the ways in which, through legislation, including the Work and Families Bill that is currently going through this House, they are trying to ease the burdens of those who care for others. Most evidently, in that legislation and in other legislation, the Government are to be congratulated on the support being given to people, including those in employment, who are parents, in this case of young children. Can that support be extended to those who care for parents or for elderly relatives? The Government&#039;s record is good on helping the younger end of the family, but what about the other end of the spectrum?
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>I will quote from a piece in the current Counsel and Care bulletin, which was penned by Stephen Burke, the chief executive of that organisation. He writes:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_947"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 947</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;Already the Work and Families Bill is extending the right to request flexible working to carers . . . So it must be right also to explore whether tax exemptions for employer-supported eldercare vouchers could be introduced . . . The Government&#039;s 2007 spending review is an opportunity to examine this option&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>It is a specific question, which I put to the Minister knowing that perhaps it is the responsibility of someone else. I simply ask that she might pass it on to the colleague whom she deems responsible.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>Such changes would clearly benefit the carers, their quality of life, their health and the health of the voluntary sector. Those would be significant benefits. The benefit for the public purse must also be brought into the equation, because more of those who accept the responsibilities of caring would be able to remain in work, possibly full time but certainly part time, if such changes were made to the legislation governing employment. In a time when demography points to the need for maintaining the size of the workforce, that seems to me a significant benefit in fiscal as well as humanitarian terms.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>The second topic that I want to raise is the availability of drugs to support those in the early stages of Alzheimer&#039;s and dementia. There are current reports of better provision in Scotland, and certainly better provision in some parts of England than in others. Is that true? If so, why? That is my first question. Lest there be a temptation to brush it off and say, &quot;No, no, no; we have a good drugs supply policy that is common throughout the country&quot;, I shall quote from a recent NHS publication, <i>Better Health in Old Age,</i> which is<i> </i>a report from Professor Ian Philp. In that document he commends a case study in which the whole point of a significant part of the work involved was to deal with this problem. The report states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;Alzheimer&#039;s is predominantly an older people&#039;s illness, yet the new medicines for it were being treated differently to drugs for other illnesses that affected a wider age range of patients&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>It then describes as good practice&#151;commendably so&#151;the ways in which that is being dealt with.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>There is a problem here, which has hit the headlines dramatically through recent NICE rulings. NICE has issued a supplementary revised ruling, which is much to its credit, and it has also issued&#151;I want to focus on this point&#151;a further draft guidance document for consultation. I believe that the consultation period is now complete, which means that the replies are now under consideration. I simply ask that, in the deliberations on what has come in, the questions of value for money which reasonably arise should include the beneficial impact on carers, including their ability, in varying degrees, to continue in employment. If the drugs are available and they mitigate some of the earlier symptoms of Alzheimer&#039;s and dementia, an individual can reasonably retain elements&#151;or perhaps the whole&#151;of the employment in which they were initially involved and from which they are being plucked as carers.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>The strength of the voluntary sector is founded significantly in the way in which its institutions provide efficient structure and support for many, including carers. I have suggested two ways in which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_948"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 948</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Government might extend their goodwill&#151;which I acknowledge&#151;to the sector by complementing the provisions being made in other contexts.

<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="60309-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, making a winding-up speech in a debate of this nature and richness is not easy. I fear that I shall do exactly what the noble Lord, Lord Best, said one should not do and scatter my gun in various directions. But that is the nature of winding-up speeches.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, for instituting the debate. My life has been happily intertwined with the charity and voluntary sector from the moment I set up a law practice on my own in 1970. Although I was supposedly a business lawyer, a charity person crossed my path early on and, despite pleading utter ignorance, I found myself sucked into the wonderful jungle that is the charity world. Above all else, the words &quot;charity&quot; and &quot;voluntary&quot; have a magic today even though we live in an age of spin and scepticism. Preserving the nature of the trust that exists between the public and the voluntary sector generally is perhaps the first and last essential of anything that we do. Any action which puts that in jeopardy should not be undertaken. That is partly why I am firmly against paying trustees and firmly against an excess of professionalism within the sector. I hope that no one will misunderstand that.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>As others have said, in a way the charity sector is the glory of our history, the glory of our present and the glory of our civic society. It affects that bit of our lives which we have for ourselves, on which our employers and our government cannot trespass. It involves the part of our lives that we undertake out of our own passions and enthusiasms&#151;out of love, to use the origin of the words &quot;charity&quot; and &quot;philanthropy&quot;. It is informal, it is organic, it is&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Drefelin said&#151;bottom-up. It has all the virtues that so much of our radically individualised and marketised culture lacks. It is clear from what has been said today that we all cherish it hugely.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>Above all, it is anarchic. I know that the large, well run charities have to be well ordered and well managed but none the less there is a kind of anarchic spirit&#151;even in the large charities&#151;without which it would lose its impetus, its freshness and its willingness to do things that others say are stupid. Although we live in an age of centralisation, mobilisation and globalisation, with community life breaking down under great pressure, astonishingly the seeds of our voluntarism none the less survive against considerable odds.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>I give a swift example from my own experience: in my home town of Sudbury, in Suffolk, a couple of years ago, we decided to put on the equivalent of a university freshers&#039; fair. A number of us had said &quot;Well, there is lots going on in the town, and we do not know what is happening anymore&quot;. A town of 18,000 came up with 280 voluntary organisations, 150 of which had stalls on the Saturday in February on which we chose to have &quot;Sudbury on Show&quot;. It was an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_949"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 949</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

astonishing sight; most people there were saying, &quot;My goodness, I had no idea all this was going on&quot;. One of the things we need to do to counter decommunalisation is to have better communications within and between voluntary organisations. I pay tribute to the county volunteer organisations which do so much good work, as well the NCVO and Volunteering England and so on.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>Besides my soliciting experience&#151;I did not mention that I went on to become a charity lawyer&#151;I have set up some charities in my time. The Citizenship Foundation, as some noble Lords have mentioned, is instrumental in encouraging the culture of volunteering to be kept alive through the citizenship curriculum. I was also fortunate enough to set up, with others, the Solicitors Pro Bono Group. One of the problems of our age is that the work environment is so intense&#151;some might say oppressive&#151;that it squeezes out time and energy that, even in my lifetime, were given to public service. When I started in law, no solicitor worth his salt could conceivably have survived without doing a considerable amount of unpaid public service. It was a wonderful elision between enlightened self-interest and public interest. The other thing about public service, for those who have never savoured it, is that when you get into it, it is wonderfully infectious. Public service, volunteering and <i>pro bono</i> work are far more infectious than greed&#151;at least, I hope they are.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>However, we need to face one or two unpalatable facts about the state of affairs. Giving has not risen at anywhere near the rate of national individual wealth. I particularly question the contribution of the corporate sector, especially as it demands more and more of its employees. I know that there are wonderful examples of firms which release their staff to do <i>pro bono</i> work. Despite that, the demands placed upon staff, particularly multiples and international companies, is such that few of them can take much part in civic and communal life any longer. We need to face up to that.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>We also need to face up to the fact that, although the amount of volunteering has increased a little, according to the Home Office survey, it is a very small increase. There has been a significant decrease in the amount of volunteering given regularly. Again, we need to be careful about that&#151;there is currently a tendency to over-record volunteering rather than, as in times past, not to see it at all.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>Small charities are in a predicament. They still comprise about 95 per cent of the charity world&#151;entirely voluntary, mostly local, organisations with no staff. They face many difficulties deserving particular attention. I come straight to the issue of bureaucratisation&#151;the demands placed upon recipients of grants, particularly by government and quasi-government organisations, for paperwork in connection with the paltry sum they have been given.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>I have a daughter who runs a small charity in Hoxton, the Sky Partnership; she spends one-third of her time as the chief executive of a staff of four, one-third filling in forms to send back to people, who will not read them, for moneys given in small parcels. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_950"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 950</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government are in danger in this great world of accountability, transparency and all that stuff, of so overburdening voluntary organisations&#151;other noble Lords have made this point&#151;that they take away a great deal of the energy that they could otherwise give to delivering what they are doing. Above all, it demoralises. If volunteers are demoralised they stop volunteering; it is simple, they play more golf.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a> Other noble Lords have talked about accreditation and training; my noble friend Lord Addington talked about coaching training. All that is creditable, but for Pete&#039;s sake let us not in the desire to be more competent drive out the unqualified volunteer who thinks that they have nothing to offer in a world so preoccupied with qualifications. The milk of human kindness is at the heart of the work that many charities do. A listening ear from someone who may have no academic achievements at all is as valuable as the ear of a postgraduate.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a> I want to say a word about leadership. Civic leadership is essential for the success of our communities and, with them, our charities. Again I come back to the fact that many of yesterday&#039;s civic leaders came from the middle of their careers in the professions and in business. Today there is far less of that. That has a serious retrograde impact. Lastly, I entirely support the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, on VAT. I entirely support what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, about criminal records checks. I agree too with the points made by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, about bureaucracy and by the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, about freeing NGOs to innovate. I applaud what was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, about full-cost recovery, fair price and paying bills on time. I hope that Compact Plus is practical.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a> The point of the noble Lord, Lord Best, about unclaimed assets is unanswerable, and the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, talked of a partnership with government, not contestability or prescriptiveness. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, and look forward to the noble Baroness&#039;s response.

<a name="60309-23_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, I too thank the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, for securing this debate and for his excellent opening speech, which set the scene and also raised a question that has run through the debate: how one defines a volunteer. My noble friend Lord Howe also raised that point. I declare an interest as chair of the England Volunteering Development Council, which is part of the network of Volunteering England. I have come to it recently; it is an enormous opportunity to learn about how the entire voluntary sector is working and what is being done to ensure that it continues well.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>When we were giving consideration to the holding of the debate, an important aspect was that there would be many Members with direct experience of both the voluntary sector and volunteering, whether as trustees, supporters or contributors, financially and physically. That has been borne out by the many knowledgeable <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_951"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 951</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

speeches that we have heard. It has been another good House of Lords debate. The speeches have demonstrated the depth and breadth of the work and initiatives undertaken in the voluntary sector and&#151;I would like to underline this point&#151;the value placed not only on those who run the organisations but, most particularly, on those who give their own time to helping and supporting others, which I think is the definition of a volunteer.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>So many speakers have drawn attention to individual organisations, from the Community Service Volunteers to youth clubs and lifeboats. I did not know that it cost &#163;110 million to run the lifeboat service&#151;that probably shakes us all to the core. Whether people are helping children with reading or with exports to Latin America, we have covered a wide ground. There are literally thousands and thousands of volunteers who show a determination and commitment by turning up regularly, often in the only free time they have, to help either groups or individuals who need their support, and who make thereby a better life for those they are helping.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>We need to remind ourselves, as the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, did, that volunteers come in all packages. They are all ages, all sizes and come from all aspects of society. Each of them does something which is important to somebody else. That has come through in our debate.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>Statutory organisations, such as local authorities&#151;certainly mine, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, at a very early stage&#151;have long recognised that voluntary organisations tend to do the job better than statutory organisations, and that the satisfaction from those who receive the services is often far better and greater than any provided by the council. Such organisations are often much more responsive to individual problems or needs. They are flexible and approachable, and, as a result, many are now contracted to provide the services, as mentioned. A considerable proportion of the income of these organisations is from local or national grants. That is a two-edged sword. It can, to some extent, constrain the way these organisations work because the money is provided specifically for a job, and to expand and develop further is difficult if they rely on just that statutory funding. Yet, in order to expand and develop, they need to appeal for funds elsewhere; for example, to trusts and the charitable sector.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, and the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, who made the point extremely strongly, that the voluntary sector must stay independent. Its value is in its independence, if it is to do a good job. Therefore, it must not be beguiled by the glory of money that comes from grants, but it must always have that tension of trying to find resources from elsewhere&#151;although it is quite often a terrible burden. It is one of the facts of life that the pursuit of a reliable source of income&#151;none of these organisations ever has one&#151;is not only a daily chore but often something they have to do annually. Most of this is done by organisations with great willingness, but I guess that it is also done through gritted teeth. It is a difficult aspect of the voluntary organisation. It also <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_952"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 952</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

needs to be able to attract volunteers to perform the tasks, to carry out the fundraising and provide the ethos and backbone of the organisation.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>It is not just local authorities that have found the worth of voluntary organisations; the Government are now taking a greater interest in this aspect of what I term the social support system&#151;in view of the value to the state and the enhancement of the experience of individual volunteers. But, as the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, so sagely advised, the Government must not nanny voluntary organisations or volunteers. As I have said before, they have their value in their independence.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>The Russell Commission, which has already been mentioned, was set up by the Chancellor and will have a considerable impact on the future of volunteering, particularly for young adults. The new leader of my party has already announced that he is interested in investigating ways of encouraging young people leaving school in aspects of voluntary work. The benefit of this age group being involved at an early stage of their adult life in working for, and with, others in a voluntary capacity is well recognised.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>There are of course barriers for some to doing this. Had the noble Baronesses, Lady Darcy or Lady Masham, been present, I would not have mentioned Scope, which deals with physical disability and whose purpose is to promote fully inclusive volunteering. In its recent research, it has identified those barriers associated with people who have a physical disability. Some organisations are often unaware of the skills and range of abilities which disabled people have to offer. Even where those skills are recognised, accessibility is still limited and there are constraints on the amount of work that disabled people can do.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>I touch briefly on the Criminal Records Bureau. Is the extent to which voluntary organisations think they need to discuss volunteers with the Criminal Records Bureau becoming a problem? Are they overdoing it? Perhaps they do not need to have so many people checked. Where they need to have people checked&#151;we fully understand that it is essential for work with vulnerable people&#151;they need swift answers, because quite a lot of volunteers work short term. They are quite happy to come for three months, to be in and out, and to give their support, but not if it is going to take three months for them to be checked by the bureau, because they never get round to doing the work.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, referred to the commission that is being set up under the auspices of Volunteering England and the England Volunteering Development Council, which is sponsored by the Volunteering Hub. It is intended that this commission will be the legacy of the Year of the Volunteer 2005, and be wide-ranging in its brief, making recommendations on how the state of volunteering should look in 10 years.
</p>

<a name="60309-23_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>Volunteering is now central to all our lives, whether we work as volunteers, support a voluntary organisation with expertise, serve as trustees or honorary officers, campaign for it or are the recipient <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_953"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 953</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of what it does. Interest in, and concern about the future for, the voluntary sector and those who volunteer to support it are well to the fore. I hope that the success of today&#039;s debate is just the tip of the iceberg of the realisation of its and their value. By &quot;its&quot;, I mean the voluntary sector; by &quot;their&quot;, I mean volunteers. I thank all those who have contributed to the debate.

<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="60309-24_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Baroness Andrews): </b>  My Lords, it has been an excellent debate. I join all noble Lords who have congratulated the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, on creating an opportunity for a debate that has been informed not only by expertise, as usual, but by a huge range of personal experience. I started listing the number of voluntary organisations in which noble Lords mentioned that they had been involved. When I reached 23, I gave up. I know that noble Lords actively support many more.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>I was intrigued by the reference by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, to the oldest youth club in the world. It was my impression that your Lordships&#039; House was the oldest youth club in the world, but volunteering is a cross-generational issue.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>The debate has been extremely wide-ranging. I hope that the noble Lord has taken great pleasure from that. It has also raised some complex issues and tensions in the relationships between the voluntary and the statutory sector. It has led us to think about the quality and the scope of our service; the way in which we express our obligations to the community; the way in which we relate as individuals to society; and the challenges and the prospects ahead. I welcome noble Lords&#039; recognition of the central role that we in government give to the voluntary sector. It has never been greater; we are proud to do that.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>I will certainly not be able to answer all the questions that were raised, but I will do my best to deal with as many as I can. It is a joy as well as a challenge for me to wind up this debate, because my most anarchic years were spent in the voluntary sector, growing a charity that, I am delighted to say, eventually had an influence on policy on the way we look at how and where children and adults learn and what we can offer outside the school day. That has been extremely important in my life.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>It is also interesting to reflect, as some noble Lords have done, on the whole notion of philanthropy in the history of our state. It has moved from an individual preoccupation parallel to the notion of a Victorian-nightwatchman state through metamorphosis into the Welfare State, without losing the trust that is at the bedrock of that relationship, to now, where it takes different expression in different forms. It is a source of fascination to other countries, rightly so, because it is so different from the way in which they organise their services and public relationships.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, spoke eloquently about the scope and scale of the present configuration, and one of the most dramatic statistics for me is that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_954"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 954</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

last year the Charity Commission registered over 5,000 new charities. It is a phenomenally fast-growing sector, and there has been phenomenal new activity: an army of 600,000 volunteers. A staggering 20.4 million adults volunteered at least once a month in England in 2005. Yet, the noble Lord was right: we must look not just at quantity but at the quality and consistency of volunteering. That is one of the many challenges, as is keeping people&#039;s enthusiasm, giving them continuing opportunities and making sure that they know that they are valued. We have seen this afternoon huge diversity in the description of volunteering, from advocacy and the representation of the individual to action in all forms throughout the public services. It is the smaller charities that often have the most to give and are most vulnerable, and it is those charities that I have in mind when I talk about growing capacity and what we need to be able to do.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>As well as advocacy, speaking truth to power, attacking vested interests and reaching below the radar to the parts of the community that are silent and often invisible, we have taken the debate beyond the domestic agenda. Thanks to the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, we had the opportunity of an international <i>tour d&#039;horizon</i>. We looked at the changing role of volunteers abroad, who bring added value in greater skills and greater experience to build capacities in those countries and at how we could use the diaspora to go back and grow more voluntary activity. If we are serious about ending poverty and improving health and social care in those countries, that is exactly the way we need to go. That is a definite improvement, without losing the altruism and enthusiasm of young people, many of whom belong to us in this House.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>On the domestic agenda, I want to say three things. First, I want to set out why the Government believe so passionately that the VCS has a role not just in public services&#151;although, my goodness, we are glad of its contribution&#151;but in what they represent in innovation, free thinking, making us aware of the gaps in everything that we do as a society and so on. Secondly, I want to examine the notion of partnership, the relationship between VCS and government, and thirdly, to explore why we believe that local government reform and community empowerment are vital in tackling the power gap. I want to stress in all that, even if I do not use the terms, that at the core is a genuine commitment to independence. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said, without independence the sector does not exist. That is its greatest resource and our most precious asset.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>We are now working in a different context in the voluntary sector, not only because society is changing so fast but because there is more wealth, prosperity and opportunity. That makes us aware of the greater impact of disadvantage, of the concentrations of poverty and how we reach particular groups. We live in an increasingly ageing society, and it is delightful to hear from the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, of the huge contribution that the older volunteer continues to make and makes in such a pro-social way. One of the great pleasures of the debate has been the emphasis <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_955"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 955</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on pro-social behaviour rather than anti-social activity. We are living in an age when traditional support mechanisms&#151;the family, the Church&#151;are breaking down; when there is greater mobility but weaker geographical ties; where there are limited resources, including environmental resources; and when there is a sense among some individuals and groups of a genuine powerlessness. All that increases the need for a voluntary sector that is strong and vibrant and a critical friend to government because of its diversity; its strength; the speed at which it can move; its ability to get communities that are very stressed to trust a group to act with it and on its behalf; and, above all, its innovation. Our task is to ask more but also to give more. We are therefore responsible for removing barriers.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>We see a step change in the extent to which public services are delivered by the VCS. That is not exploitation or transferring responsibility but, as my noble friend Lady Morgan said, transforming the sector. However, barriers remain. There are difficulties with access to investment and finance and a lack of infrastructure and capacity. It is sometimes very difficult to form partnerships. There is a perception that there is a threat to independence and an outdated legal and regulatory framework.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a> The noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, asked me about the PAC report. We welcome the report&#039;s recommendations. One of our responses is to publish this spring a cross-Whitehall action plan that will address the barriers. It will bring together in one place all the opportunities available to the sector and announce flagship areas to be open to contestability, which is an important method for opening opportunity and driving up quality in services. It will set out frameworks and timetables for departments and local authorities to commit to agreed pathways. It will include challenging targets for increasing public service delivery, a question raised by my noble friend.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>Noble Lords talked about better partnership, more effective investment in capacity building and more proportionate regulation. They are all equally important. In the new landscape of partnership, there is a tension in contractual relationships that we must address. That is why the Compact that we introduced in 1998 is now entering a new generation of Compact Plus, which will not only distil principles but introduce a chap with some teeth, an independent Compact commissioner, who will be tasked with promoting the Compact and how it works in the context of public service and social care.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>We heard the beginnings of an interesting debate on social and health care from the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, and the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland. That is a big challenge. The White Paper on health raises some important challenges for us, and the contractual arrangements, as set out by the noble Baroness, are very important. The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, raised some extremely important point about carers that I should like to think about and which I shall certainly post on to the relevant Minister. The answer to his question about Alzheimer&#039;s is yes; the consultation has finished, but I am sure that his point will have been well taken.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_956"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 956</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60309-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>Moving on from Compact, the greater challenge is sustainability. Therefore, the ChangeUp Fund, which arose from the 2000 review to which my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley referred, is vital. Her speech was magnificent in bringing together coherently so much of what we are doing. The important thing about ChangeUp is that it will generate capacity support, which is what the sector needs, whether for technology, training or finance, supported by &#163;80 million of additional investment originally and a further &#163;70 million last year. The sector is in the driving seat. That is why we have set up Capacity Builders, which will take over the running of that fund.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>My noble friend also referred to Future Builders. It is a genuine innovation involving not just grants but loans. Yes, that creates certain fears in some quarters, but if we can increase capacity, how much stronger will be those front-line organisations? Again, the trick will be whether we can ensure that small charities benefit from such innovations.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Best, referred to unclaimed assets. He was absolutely right to do so, because that brings us to one of the most interesting developments. He raised his fears that that might precipitate a take-over by government. I assure him that there is greater scope for the scheme to develop. It is not about the Government seizing assets to cover statutory obligations. Let me make that clear. Those youth-based voluntary and community organisations are best placed to make a real difference at grass-roots level. It is essential that the voluntary sector is informed at the very beginning of that process and continues its partnership explicitly. He will know that the Pre-Budget Report set out our position on that in some detail. I believe that a broad debate on that issue is important, and I look forward to seeing that take shape.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>The independence of the sector, as I keep emphasising, is extremely important. We have created a new environment for charitable giving, which is quite generous, but the noble Lord is right that, although we launched <i>A Generous Society</i>, there is still a resistance to giving&#151;one sees it in the corporate sector&#151;which we need to overcome. Part of our task in <i>A Generous Society</i> is a package of measures that builds on the legacy of the Giving Campaign and develops priorities such as expanding and making the most of the payroll-giving schemes; extending the notion of democracy and giving; and working with young people&#151;the things that will instil a culture and a habit of giving from a very early age.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, asked about VAT. Before I answer him, I must say that one of the challenges is that, if we can work with the sector to promote regular and effective giving, we could get another &#163;600 million to charities in the form of tax relief if the number of donations that were made used tax-efficient measures. It is extremely sad that we are not doing that. I am afraid that he will not be surprised by my reply. Tax reliefs and exemptions for charities and charitable giving in the UK are generous; they are worth over &#163;2.5 billion a year. Existing reliefs from VAT on purchases made by charities are worth <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_957"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 957</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&#163;200 million a year. No government have considered the issue of irrecoverable VAT more seriously than this Government. We have conducted two major reviews to see if we could find a solution. We have not been able to identify a solution that is practical and efficient, affordable and well targeted, but the debate will continue.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>The other thing that we need to do is to reduce regulation. Noble Lords have talked about bureaucracy. Having been at the end of the voluntary sector that is applying for grants, I know what the forms and the bureaucracy are like, and I wish that we could streamline much of that. We are introducing new concepts and better regulation in the Charities Bill, and we will take that further in the context of the cross-government better regulation agenda. We will respond shortly to the recommendations made by the Better Regulation Task Force in its report, <i>Better Regulation for Civil Society.</i> We welcome that report, and we very much want to help to develop the self-regulation of the sector.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>Several noble Lords, not least the noble Lord, Lord Addington and my noble friend Lord Haskel, referred to another barrier&#151;risk and redress. Of course there is a fear of possible litigation. I think that it is a disproportionate fear, but we must address it in partnership to encourage sensible and proportionate risk management. I shall write to the noble Lord about the case he mentioned that involved sports training and volunteers, because I believe that I can give him some positive news about that. Last year, the Home Office paid for an additional 30,000 copies of an excellent book written by Volunteering England, which the noble Baroness will want to know about, entitled, <i>Volunteers and the law</i>. The same grant was used to enable the author to give regional seminars. It is helping, but clearly the Compensation Bill will have a role to play because of the provision about the clarification of the value of negligence.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>I am racing through my remarks because there is so much to say, but I shall now talk about volunteering. There has never been a better time to be a volunteer. We need to deal with some of the myths. Volunteering is not going out of fashion, and it is not the preserve of white, rather elderly ladies. Several noble Lords asked about the legacy of TimeBank UK, which has been remarkable. There have been record numbers of volunteers. Some 76 per cent were aged between 18 and 35, and more than 52 per cent came from a black or ethnic minority community. Some 2.2 billion minutes were pledged, as were 12 themed months, and 13,500 people registered on a dedicated website. There were also 3,000 national activities and events. Having been associated with this work, I was very pleased with campaigns such as TimeBank and Crime Concern encouraging more young black men to volunteer to mentor young people at risk of being involved in crime. Wonderful things have happened, and more will happen because the legacy will be built on. We <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_958"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 958</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have put more money into strategic grant aid to 14 voluntary charitable giving organisations, but, importantly, we must learn from all this, hence the importance of a full evaluation. We continue to set targets around volunteering. That is about opening more doors, which is what the year did. We will go on opening those doors. The Olympics will have a huge demand for volunteers.

<a name="60309-24_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>We have two specific programmes. The GoldStar programme is a two-year &#163;5 million fund, which was launched in November. It is an exemplar programme that focuses on spreading good practice and how to recruit, manage and retain volunteers. However&#151;very timely today&#151;I can tell the House that we are attacking the barriers that stop many people, including those from BME communities, coming forward. Today, a Home Office Minister has confirmed that a new programme, Volunteering for All, will focus on raising awareness of volunteering and on removing some of the barriers to volunteering faced by the most excluded groups. The programme will help with the sort of issues that my noble friend Lord Haskel raised about qualifications. We know that the great asset for a volunteer is to discover his skills and to develop them, which will involve work with Jobcentre Plus developing relationships and skills at the same time. I would like to write to the noble Lord about that. There is a lot of interesting work on level 2 qualifications and the work that we are doing with DfES and the learning and skills councils to ensure that volunteers are enabled to benefit from that development.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>The recommendations of the Russell commission report, which we accepted in full, include accreditation, with which we will go forward. The Russell commission&#151;which was informed by young people, not just informed by adults for young people&#151;will be a most exciting development in terms of the new youth advisory board, which is made up of 20 young people, and the work that it will do.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>Several noble Lords raised complex issues about employment and the definition of volunteers. It would probably be safer if I wrote, but I was struck by the example of the RNLI. That is not alone, because there are other search and rescue services that fall into the same category. I know that that is a live debate in the Home Office. The RNLI was involved in a recent meeting. There are issues about a lack of consensus on the definition of a volunteer. Part of the problem is that we see the value of having a definition, but, at the same time, we do not want to run the risk of placing volunteering on a statutory footing. There are issues around the nature of contracts and employment that will have to be addressed. I understand that there is a cross-government search and rescue committee that exists to review the area. It will be informed, I think, by the commission mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley. I will write fully to explore that and to explain to the noble Lord how this sensible document fits into that.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>I am conscious that I have not been able to reply to the specific questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and the noble Viscount, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_959"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 959</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord Montgomery of Alamein. I will either pass their questions to a more competent Minister or I will write myself. I was interested in the work in Latin America that the noble Viscount mentioned.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>In winding up, I want to say briefly that we in ODPM have a particular care for the role of the volunteer, not least because of our work on renewal, regeneration and growing new communities. The noble Lord mentioned the words of David Miliband&#151;double devolution&#151;but, importantly, we will not be able to grow the sort of healthy, safe communities that we want to see without the role of the voluntary sector, which plays a very important role. Organisations such as Groundwork show that the environmental sector can engage and enthuse people&#039;s work-time and energy in astonishing ways, which is extremely important. As we move into new arrangements for local area agreements and so on, it is critical that in those new configurations the voluntary sector plays its role as centrally as possible.
</p>

<a name="60309-24_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>I am conscious of having spoken at great speed. I hope that I have addressed the most important issues raised. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, again, on the opportunity that he has presented for an extremely welcome debate.

</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, now for something completely different. We are addressing the important issue of the new regime which requires the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_960"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 960</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

payment of fees by mineral and landfill site operators. The Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications and Deemed Applications) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2006 were laid before the House on 10 February 2006.
</p>

<a name="60309-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>In summary, these regulations introduce a new regime, requiring the payment of fees by mineral and landfill waste operators in England for the monitoring of their sites by mineral and waste planning authorities. If approved by this House and the other place, the regulations will come into effect on 6 April 2006.
</p>

<a name="60309-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>The objective of the proposed regime is to recover the costs to planning authorities of essential monitoring of mining and landfill sites according to good practice guidance. Monitoring by local planning authorities of development of all types is not new, but charging the developer for that monitoring&#151;as we now propose after considerable research and consultation&#151;for these two particular types of operations is new.
</p>

<a name="60309-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>Implementation of these regulations will fulfil a commitment made in the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review. The commitment was, when a legislative opportunity arose, to extend the scope of charges which can be imposed under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to allow mineral planning authorities to recover the costs of monitoring and enforcing planning conditions. That commitment recognised that planning application fees do not recover the costs of monitoring and enforcing planning permissions. It also recognised the particular and unusual requirements for monitoring mineral development.
</p>

<a name="60309-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>Fundamentally, this commitment supports the progression&#151;both here and in Europe&#151;towards greater protection of the environment and the need for sustainable development based on up-to-date environmental standards. Mineral and landfill development poses significant environmental challenges. We continue to respond to those challenges through incentives such as the aggregates levy and landfill tax. These measures encourage greater use of recycled and secondary aggregate, a reduction in the amount of waste sent to landfill and investment in alternative waste management capacity. The total volume of waste disposed to landfill has fallen by almost 20 per cent since the introduction of the landfill tax in 1996. That is, of course, good news.
</p>

<a name="60309-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>But we also recognise the importance of ensuring that mineral and landfill operations meet the modern environmental standards we have rightly come to expect. These standards are determined through planning controls applied by local planning authorities and the complementary pollution control regime which is the responsibility of the Environment Agency. Planning fees cover only the costs of handling and determining planning applications. They do not include the costs of monitoring and enforcing planning <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_961"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 961</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

permissions. Nor do they cover the cost of the specialised necessary monitoring to ensure that mineral and landfill sites are environmentally sustainable, contained, managed and reclaimed, in such a way as to minimise their impacts. Both mineral and landfill waste operations are governed by sometimes complex and technical planning conditions. These deal with matters such as noise and dust control, traffic, blasting, hours of working and soil stripping and storage. They are needed to deal with the physical impacts of the operations on the environment. Regular monitoring by competent authority officers is needed to ensure that essential environmental standards are maintained.
</p>

<a name="60309-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>Mineral planning permissions are implemented progressively as mineral is extracted, and land restored. The process of &quot;development&quot; can sometimes last for many decades. Similarly, sites can be used for landfill waste for many years. So it is not case of &quot;permit it, see it built, check once and forget&quot;. Monitoring practice by authorities at present is, however, variable. In some cases it can fall short of the Planning Officers Society good practice guidance, published in 1998, by a considerable margin. Operators of mining and landfill sites are beneficiaries of permissions allowing these operations to proceed over a considerable period. Without extensive planning conditions minimising their environmental impact, those operations would not be improved or upgraded to modern standards. We believe therefore that it is reasonable for the operators to support the unusual, long-term monitoring requirement imposed by these extended processes of development. The widening of the scope of planning authorities&#039; fee-charging powers in Section 53 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 means that we are now able to implement the fee regime in line with our commitment made in the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review.
</p>

<a name="60309-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>Delays in securing the necessary legislative powers to implement monitoring fees enabled us to carry out a thorough research and consultation on the options for and details of a regime. These regulations have had a long and very thorough gestation. The features of the proposed regime have been developed from research studies carried out in 2000 and 2004. These studies considered various charging options and validated local authority monitoring costs. Two subsequent public consultation exercises in 2001 and 2005 yielded a strong polarisation of views. Mineral and waste planning authorities were in favour of the introduction of a fees regime. Unsurprisingly, the industries were unequivocal in their objection in principle to any monitoring fees. However, to their credit, most of the trade associations also commented constructively on how the proposals should be implemented, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_962"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 962</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

notwithstanding their opposition. Both the industries and the authorities agreed that the structure of the proposed regime, based on a nationally set flat rate fee, was about right.
</p>

<a name="60309-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>These regulations define mining and landfill sites, what constitutes a site visit, who is liable to pay the fee, and prescribe different fees for the monitoring of active and inactive sites. The fee for a visit to an active site will be &#163;288, while the fee for each visit to an inactive site will be &#163;96. These fees reflect comprehensive research carried out in 2004 to validate local authority costs of monitoring in accordance with good practice principles. The fee for a visit to an active site is significantly lower than that which was proposed in 2001. It is now &#163;288 compared with &#163;435 at 2006&#150;07 prices. An inactive site is one where quarrying, landfilling, restoration or aftercare is not currently taking place to any substantial extent, but could lawfully be resumed. Normally it should take much less time to monitor these than active sites, and will be subject to only one chargeable visit per year. Each active site will be subject to a maximum of eight visits per year for which a fee is payable. Authorities can of course make further visits, but no fee will be payable for them.
</p>

<a name="60309-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>Guidance has been prepared to assist implementation of the regime. I am most grateful for the constructive help given by representatives of the Planning Officers Society and the minerals and waste industries in commenting on the guidance. It includes advice on good practice monitoring and the factors that authorities should take into account in agreeing the number of visits.
</p>

<a name="60309-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>I must stress that the figure of eight visits is a maximum. Generally, when active sites are compliant with planning conditions, we consider that there should not be more than four visits a year, and over time, as the monitoring according to good practice becomes established and standards rise, the percentage of sites with four or fewer visits each year should rise. I know also that many mineral and landfill operators have good working relationships with their authorities. By working constructively together, problems can be resolved and formal enforcement action thus minimised. I emphasise that we do not want the introduction of monitoring fees to detract from these constructive relationships.
</p>

<a name="60309-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>I know that these fees are not comfortable for many in the industries, but they are essential. We acknowledge industry objections to the principle of monitoring fees, and in developing the regime we have listened carefully to what the industries have told us. We have addressed some of their concerns about its detailed operation and we have kept the regime as simple as possible. For example, we are introducing a flat rate fee to apply to all sites. We have restricted the maximum number of visits for which a fee is chargeable and the level of fee is considerably less than that proposed following the initial research.
</p>

<a name="60309-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>There are also benefits to the industry. These include consistency in terms of the level of fees and an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_963"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 963</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

accountable and transparent approach to monitoring, along with the provision of full written feedback, which means that the standard of monitoring should improve. These benefits will address more general industry concerns for there to be consistent and more effective enforcement of regulations, including planning controls, and effective action against poorer operators. It is not just the industries that will benefit. Improved monitoring will deliver valuable benefits to the communities near to these sites and to the wider environment.
</p>

<a name="60309-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>We acknowledge, as I have said, that the regime introduces a new concept into the planning system&#151;charging for monitoring development as it occurs. This reflects the unusual nature of mineral extraction and landfill deposition. Long-term and temporary processes of development, whose physical impacts can be intense at the sites concerned, need to be mitigated through extensive conditions. In the modern world of environmental protection, no conditions would mean no permissions.
</p>

<a name="60309-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>That said, we will consider how the regime works in practice. We need to do that, and we will do that. I therefore undertake now that we shall review the regime once it has been established and has bedded in, and in any event, no later than in 2011. I commend these regulations to the House. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>I came here with quite a few questions but, unfortunately, the noble Baroness has already answered them, which will save a bit of time. This idea has gestated over the years, and it is certainly needed, as local authorities have increased responsibilities. Back in Scotland, an open cast mining site near my home has gone bust&#151;or perhaps I should say that it has been sequestrated&#151;so it is as well that the local authority insisted on a bond for its restoration. But that has been slowed up.
</p>

<a name="60309-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>I was going to ask whether each complaint made to the planning authority will lead to yet another fee, but I now fully understand that that will not be the case. The only merit of that would have been as a huge incentive to run the site properly. However, we on these Benches are satisfied by these regulations.

<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, with these regulations, we are debating the National Assembly for Wales (Representation of the People) (Amendment) Order 2006 and the Representation of the People (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2006, which appear subsequently on the Order Paper.
</p>

<a name="60309-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>The Government are taking forward in the regulations and order a number of measures under existing legislation-making powers that are aimed at addressing security concerns around postal voting, improving access for the elector and the administrative effectiveness of elections. The regulations also include some changes to the access to and supply of the electoral register in England, Wales and Scotland. Noble Lords will be reassured to know that the Government have undertaken extensive consultation with key interested parties and the Electoral Commission in bringing forward these proposals.
</p>

<a name="60309-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>The Representation of the People (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 need to be in place by 24 March to ensure the effective running of this year&#039;s local government elections on 4 May. The draft Representation of the People (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 replicate the provisions of the draft England and Wales regulations for the conduct of parliamentary elections in Scotland, but also take into account the differences in electoral provisions and institutions in Scotland. The conduct of the Scottish local government elections is a devolved matter for the Scottish Ministers, who I understand are planning to introduce legislation before the combined 3 May 2007 elections in Scotland to ensure consistency in electoral practice at elections in Scotland.
</p>

<a name="60309-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>The measures in the draft National Assembly for Wales order replicate the provisions of the draft regulations for England and Wales, but only in so far as they will apply to any by-election to the National Assembly for Wales called between now and the third ordinary elections, to be held on 3 May 2007. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Wales will undertake a further review of the 2003 Assembly elections order to take into account changes to electoral practice introduced by the Electoral Administration Bill. The limited changes he is making with this order will ensure consistency of electoral practice in Wales in the interim.
</p>

<a name="60309-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>On 25 May 2005, the Government issued a discussion paper on electoral administration, seeking views on a range of proposals for improving accessibility, enhancing security and improving administrative effectiveness. At the close of consultation on 10 June 2005, 161 written responses had been received. On 11 October 2005, the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_965"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 965</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government published a report setting out the secondary legislative changes we aimed to have in place for the May 2006 local government elections. The Government have taken on board further views from the Electoral Commission and administrators in developing the measures in these regulations.
</p>

<a name="60309-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>Similarly, the changes relating to the access to and supply of the electoral register were drafted following extensive consultation with key interested parties. On 30 August 2005, a consultation paper seeking views on the proposed changes was issued to key interested parties and placed on the DCA website. At the close of consultation 75 responses had been received. Respondents were generally supportive of the Government&#039;s proposals and suggested some further changes that form part of the regulations.
</p>

<a name="60309-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>I turn to specific measures in the regulations and the order. On the conduct side, the regulations and order will help to enhance the security of the postal vote by: requiring existing postal voters to give a reason for asking for their postal vote to be redirected to an address other than that to which postal papers are normally sent for a particular election; and requiring the outcome of all new postal vote applications, including requests to vary the arrangements, to be notified to the elector. These two provisions will work in tandem to alert an elector if someone else has falsely re-directed their vote, clarifying that electoral administrators have the power to check a signature on a postal vote application with any other documents they may hold with the applicant&#039;s signature, to satisfy themselves of the identity or as part of the process of establishing the identity of the applicant. Moving the deadline for application for postal voting from six to 11 days before polling day will give electoral administrators more time to process postal vote applications.
</p>

<a name="60309-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>The specific measures in the regulations and order aimed at improving access to and participation in the electoral process include: allowing electors to request a replacement postal ballot paper any time up to 5 pm on polling day; clarifying, at the request of the Electoral Commission, that a new set of postal ballot papers may be issued, not just the ballot paper itself; allowing electors to apply for a postal or proxy vote at the same time as registering to vote; leaving the deadline for applying for a proxy vote as six days before polling day, but allowing an emergency proxy application in the five days leading up to polling day and up to 5 pm on polling day itself, with supporting evidence, in cases where an elector becomes physically incapacitated from voting in person; and standardising the polling hours of all local authority referendums and local authority mayoral elections in England and Wales from 7 am to 10 pm. Similar changes to extend polling hours for local government elections in England and Wales are being made in the Local Elections (Principal Areas and Parishes and Communities) (Amendment) (England and Wales) Rules 2006, laid before Parliament on 22 February and coming into force on 24 March.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_966"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 966</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60309-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>The Government are also introducing improvements to the administrative effectiveness of elections by allowing administrators to securely collect postal ballots that are returned to the polling station before the close of the poll and by extending the collection of statistical information on postal voting for all local government elections in England and Wales.
</p>

<a name="60309-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>I will now turn to the changes concerning access to and the supply of electoral registers. The current framework governing access and supply was established in 2002. It was introduced in response to privacy and security concerns expressed by the public about the possible misuse of data from the electoral register. It also took into account the ramifications of the Robertson case, where the High Court found that the supply of the electoral register for direct marketing purposes without giving individual electors the opportunity to object was in breach of data protection and human rights law.
</p>

<a name="60309-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>Under the framework, there are two versions of the register: the full version and the edited version. The main use of the full version of the register, containing the names of all electors, is for electoral purposes, by elected representatives, candidates and political parties. Certain other people and organisations can have access to the full register for specified purposes&#151;for example, the police for prevention and detection of crime. Electors may choose to have their names excluded from the edited version of the register, which may be purchased by anyone, for any purpose.
</p>

<a name="60309-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>The Government consider the broad policy governing access to and the supply of the electoral register to be settled. They are bringing forward changes to widen access to the full register for a limited number of persons and organisations only. In summary, the proposed changes will provide for the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Financial Services Authority to be supplied with a copy of the electoral register in the same manner as government departments are. The security services will be supplied with the full register for the full range of their statutory functions. Government departments and other specified bodies will be able to use the full register for national security vetting purposes. The National Library of Wales and the National Library of Scotland will be supplied with a full register, in the same way as the British Library is. Public libraries and local authority archive services will be able to request a copy of the full register. Members of the public will be able to use out-of-date electoral registers held by public libraries or archive services for research purposes after 10 years. Local authorities will have access to the full electoral register for the purposes of conducting local polls in England and Wales, under Section 116 of the Local Government Act 2003, and local referendums in Scotland. Authorised users will have access to the full electoral register from a data processor, without first having to obtain a copy from the electoral registration officer.

<a name="60309-27_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his introduction and explanation of the regulations. To some extent, I share the view that has been expressed, or at least also wish to inquire about this mode of amendment. As the Minister said, these are serious issues and there are a number of proposed changes, some of which will have significance, particularly in combating feared fraud. I believe that the Government may have it in mind to use this means simply to expedite the implementation of these changes so that they can take effect in time for the May local government elections in England and Wales. Certainly it seems to me desirable that that should happen, but I am not entirely sure whether the Bill that is before the House will have reached the statute book in time to achieve that.
</p>

<a name="60309-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>It is clear that these measures have been subjected to very widespread consultation and are broadly based upon recommendations of the Electoral Commission and the returning officers. There have been opportunities for consultation and there has been widespread consultation. So far as I am aware, the conclusions are not controversial, although it has to be said that because the measures are untried, their effectiveness in reconciling access and the avoidance of fraud will have to be judged in the event. I hope that the Minister will say something about the scrutiny of how the new rules&#151;particularly those governing postal vote verification&#151;will work in practice.
</p>

<a name="60309-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>I have one other question to put to the Minister with regard to the proposed change in the time of voting, or the standardisation of voting hours in local elections in England and Wales&#151;the 7 to 10 proposal. That seems to me to be entirely welcome, but I fear that it may not be sufficiently widely known at the time of the elections that the change has taken place. Have the Government given any thought to how they might publicise it, as that could considerably affect turnout on the day? Otherwise, so far as I am concerned, these regulations are broadly welcome.
</p>




<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="60309-27_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, I wish to speak to the Welsh order, which is being made under a different Act; it is proposed that it will come into force under the Government of Wales Act 1998, as opposed to the other statutes which give rise to the other regulations.

</p>

<a name="60309-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>We in Wales are very concerned about the security of the vote and we welcome the measures to improve postal and proxy voting. We look forward to seeing what changes are likely to be introduced before the elections in 2007. The matter is less urgent for us, because we do not have the relevant elections in May of this year. These are holding measures for Wales in case there are by-elections, as I understand it.
</p>

<a name="60309-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>In previous local elections, great concern has been expressed about fraud, but of course it is no new topic. I recall a colleague of mine many years ago in the 1950s standing, not in Wales as it happened, but in Bootle. He was a bit worried that at 9 o&#039;clock in the morning not many people seemed to be voting. He was told, &quot;Don&#039;t worry, half the graveyard has already voted for you&quot;. The possibility of fraud in local elections has long been there and it is right that we should tighten the rules as much as we can.
</p>




<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="60309-27_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords for generally welcoming these regulations, although one or two questions were raised. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, that we are not amending the Bill that is passing through the House at the moment; we are making changes under existing powers in time for the May 2006 elections. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, also raised that point. One of the reasons why these regulations are coming forward now is that the 6 May elections are only a month or so away. The changes complement the Bill; they do not duplicate any part of it. Interestingly, when I read my speaking notes, that was the first question that I asked. I was assured that there would not be a problem in bringing forward these regulations while the Bill went through the House.
</p>

<a name="60309-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, rightly said that these are holding measures. He also made some important points about fraud. Part of the purpose of these measures is to reduce and contain fraud, which has perhaps been a feature not only of local government elections in Wales. We are making our very best efforts to stop such fraud. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, asked about publicising 7 am to 10 pm voting. We are in close contact with the electoral administrators on these changes, which the Electoral Commission will publicise so that electors are aware of the new polling hours. I hope that I have answered the questions raised. If not, we will deal with them in correspondence.
</p>




<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="60309-27_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, I want to be clear about this. These regulations and articles may not be absolutely identical to the clauses in the Electoral Administration Bill, but they have the same effect. I want to be clear that we are able to amend them, although I do not suppose that we will want to. This is a curious way of legislating&#151;the clauses in the Electoral Administration Bill will still be able to be amended, when we get around to them, even if they then changed these regulations. We have had no opportunity to discuss this area as part of the Electoral Administration Bill and, if we implement the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="60309-27_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I am absolutely sure where we are.

If we wish to amend the orders, we can do so without reference to the Bill that is going through the House at the moment.

<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="60309-27_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting </b>   rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 14 December 2005 be approved [<i>14th Report from the Joint Committee</i>].
</p>

<a name="60309-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Parliamentary Constituencies and Assembly Electoral Regions (Wales) Order will give effect to the recommendations of the Boundary Commission for Wales and will affect constituencies for both the Westminster Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales.
</p>

<a name="60309-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>The Boundary Commission for Wales announced in December 2002 the start of its review of Welsh parliamentary constituencies and National Assembly for Wales electoral regions. It submitted its fifth periodical report of the Boundary Commission for Wales in January 2005. In May 2005, as part of the machinery of government changes, sponsorship responsibility for the Boundary Commission for Wales transferred from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to the Department for Constitutional Affairs.
</p>

<a name="60309-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Constitutional Affairs in the other place laid the report and a draft order before Parliament on 14 December 2005 and therefore fulfilled the Secretary of State&#039;s obligation under the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 to lay a draft order before Parliament giving effect to the report.
</p>

<a name="60309-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>Before turning to the details of the order, I thank the Boundary Commission for Wales&#151;that is, the right honourable Lord Justice Stephen Richards, who was the deputy chairman, and his fellow commissioners, Professor Kenneth George and Mrs Susan Smith, together with their expert advisers and secretariat&#151;for its work in delivering its fifth periodic report.
</p>

<a name="60309-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>Noble Lords may question the amount of time that elapsed between the report being presented to the Government and it being laid before Parliament. In the run up to the 2005 general election, officials made a working assumption that delaying boundary changes in Wales would help the effective planning for the election. After the general election, the report was delayed by the transfer of sponsorship responsibility for the Boundary Commission for Wales between departments. There followed a need for consideration of representations received by my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Constitutional Affairs concerning some of the recommendations. However, noble Lords will be reassured to know that the Government laid the report and the draft order at the earliest opportunity.
</p>

<a name="60309-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>The Boundary Commission for Wales is required under the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 continuously to keep Welsh parliamentary boundaries under review and to conduct a general review every eight to 12 years. In formulating the conclusions of its latest review, the Boundary Commission sought, in line with the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, to create constituencies that adhered as closely as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_971"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 971</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

possible to the electoral quota. This is a figure devised by dividing the total electorate in Wales by the number of seats. The figures used in this calculation were taken from the electoral register in December 2002. On that basis, the electoral quota was set at 55,640.
</p>

<a name="60309-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>Apart from the electoral quota, the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 requires that other factors be taken into consideration&#151;these include special geographical considerations and community and transport links&#151;to achieve the best possible outcome in drawing up new constituency boundaries. This is well illustrated by the Isle of Wight, which the Boundary Commission for England had previously recommended should remain a single parliamentary constituency in its own right given its geographical position, though the number of electors there&#151;more than 100,000&#151;could warrant part of the Isle of Wight being combined with electors from the UK mainland.
</p>

<a name="60309-27_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>I am aware that there were some local concerns expressed about aspects of some of the recommendations in the report&#151;for example, the transfer of the Aberkenfig and Cefn Cribwr electoral divisions from the Bridgend constituency to the Ogmore constituency. These local concerns are perhaps inevitable given the nature of the work of the Boundary Commission and the implications that proposed changes will have for members of the public, elected representatives and political parties. However, interested parties were invited to attend public meetings prior to the Boundary Commission finalising its proposals.
</p>

<a name="60309-27_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>If interested parties objected to a specific recommendation, a public inquiry was held to discuss the issues and allow for counter proposals to be submitted. Independent legal experts&#151;QCs&#151;chaired these inquiries. The objections were considered, and the chair then recommended a course of action to be adopted in a report. The Government, having carefully considered representations that have been brought, have accepted the recommendations of the Boundary Commission for Wales.
</p>

<a name="60309-27_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>In conclusion, the Government are satisfied that the Boundary Commission has carried out a full review in reaching its conclusions and making its recommendations. The Government now need to complete the parliamentary process to give effect to the Boundary Commission report by agreeing the terms of the draft order. I therefore commend the draft order to the House. I beg to move.

<a name="60309-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a>Can the Minister give us a better explanation of why it has taken so long? What discussions were held with Ministers&#151;not officials&#151;on the implementation of the report, and why could the report not be implemented before the general election? The recommendations were all there in time for the general election, but somehow the implementation seems to have escaped that important date.

<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="60309-28_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, it brings back a lot of memories to go through the various parts of constituencies that I have fought so many times. There have been considerable changes to Wrexham and West Flint in the meantime.
</p>

<a name="60309-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>I am not entirely happy with some of the spelling. I suggest that the spelling is checked before this order is finalised, because I note that, for my home area, the electors of Brymbo would be surprised to find themselves coming from a community called &quot;Byrmbo&quot;, on page 5. I would not have them disenfranchised on that basis. I think &quot;Betws-y-Coed&quot; should also be checked.
</p>

<a name="60309-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>I commend the work of the commissioners. It is an important job to try to get fair constituencies together, and they have successfully preserved the historic areas of Aberconwy, Arfon and Dwyfor Meironnydd in such a way that they are all voting together. The changes are perfectly acceptable; I doubt whether there would have been any change in the general election had this order been in force at the time.
</p>

<a name="60309-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>I am particularly pleased that, although the provisional constituencies cross the boundaries of the current electoral regions for the Welsh Assembly, they have been adjusted in a satisfactory way so as to bring together the areas in north-west Wales which properly run together; also in mid and west Wales; and on the boundary between South Wales West and South Wales Central. There is a great deal of controversy about those electoral regions, which no doubt the Minister and I will be exploring shortly on the Government of Wales Bill. At least we have a firm basis on which to work, thanks to the work of the Electoral Commission. I commend its staff on their results.

<p>Clause 1 [<i>Maternity pay period</i>]:
</p>


<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60309-28_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley </b>   moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 1, line 7, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_0"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   In section 35(1) for the words before paragraph (a) substitute&#151;

<br>
&quot;(1)   A woman shall be entitled to maternity allowance at a weekly rate as equal to, or greater than, thirty-five hours of pay at the highest level of the national minimum wage, if-.&quot;


<br>
(   )   In section 166(3) (which specifies the rate of statutory maternity pay), after second &quot;rate&quot; insert &quot;as equal to, or greater than, thirty-five hours of pay at the highest level of the national minimum wage, as set out in the National Minimum Wage Regulations&quot;.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_1"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 1 aims to tie the minimum level of statutory maternity&#151;and, by default, paternity&#151;pay to the national minimum wage. This is because the current low rate of pay leads to a low rate of take-up of the leave. With pay at the rate of &#163;106, or, now, &#163;108 a week, many mothers and fathers will be unable to take up the leave extensions proposed in this Bill, and will have no choice but to continue to work to make ends meet. Indeed, even with the current entitlement, research shows that seven out of 10 mothers currently return to work for financial reasons before their leave period expires, yet only one of those seven would say that she really wanted, or was ready, to do so.
</p>

<a name="60309-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>Similarly, the Equal Opportunities Commission, who support this amendment, did some research that showed that only 28 per cent of fathers said they would take leave at the current level of &#163;106 or &#163;108 a week, and of course only about 17 per cent do; but 80 per cent of them would do so if it were increased to the &#163;200 a week proposed by the EOC. Without tying statutory pay at least to the minimum wage level, which I believe is about &#163;177 a week, extensions to maternity and paternity leave will only be a paper exercise for most parents, particularly lone parents and those from low income families who have no chance to build up a nest-egg while they are working to tide them through several months on only &#163;106 a week.
</p>

<a name="60309-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>During the House of Commons Committee stages, Meg Munn MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;The first principle is that maternity pay is wage replacement&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 13/12/05; col. 16.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>If wage replacement is the first principle of statutory pay, it is illogical for it to be below the national minimum wage. Just as an agreed minimum wage level <br>&nbsp;<br>

aims to maintain decent standards of living and fairness for workers, so should those standards be offered to parents, whose cost of living can only increase when a baby is born.
</p>

<a name="60309-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>Yesterday the Government announced their failure to reach their target to get 1 million children out of poverty. This is despite the Government&#039;s best endeavours, which I welcome. Surely it is sensible therefore to ensure, at the beginning of a child&#039;s life, that the mother can look forward to a decent standard of living, will take her full maternity leave and then go back to work. The Government have linked child poverty to workless families. They should therefore consider the benefit rights of working parents right from the beginning of the child&#039;s life.
</p>

<a name="60309-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>Your Lordships will know that the Liberal Democrats always put their money where their mouth is. To illustrate the point, I shall mention what we did in our manifesto at the last general election: we put in a maternity income guarantee, which did not go anywhere near far enough, but went as far as we felt we could, having costed it. The manifesto said that for the first six months of maternity leave, for the first child only, the mother would get the equivalent of a 35-hour working week on the minimum wage. We somehow found the money to support that, because our manifesto is always fully costed. It was nowhere near enough, but it was at least a step in the right direction. What steps in the right direction are the Government going to make towards this surely desirable standard?
</p>

<a name="60309-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>Parents&#039; contributions to society should be valued just as much as workers&#039; contributions, but, with the statutory pay not tied to the national minimum wage, parents will continue to be financially disadvantaged and their contribution to society will remain under-recognised and under-supported. I beg to move.

<a name="60309-29_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   I strongly support the amendment and hope there are other opportunities to promote the cause of making the Government&#039;s welcome provision more generous. At Second Reading I sought to outline why I felt that this provision was so important. I may have seemed somewhat extravagant in my comments on the impact on children and adults in society, but I should have referred to the Government&#039;s childcare strategy paper published in December 2004, <i>Choice for parents, the best start for children: a ten year strategy for childcare</i>. It states in Annex A on child development:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;Evidence would suggest there is a case for enabling mothers to stay at home when the child is very young, if they wish to do so. Maternity leave is the key mechanism to achieve this. Evidence suggests that paid maternity leave is associated with a range of significant benefits, such as lower maternal depression, lower infant mortality (four per cent reduction when leave is extended 10 weeks), fewer low birthweight babies, more breast-feeding, and more use of preventative healthcare. Unpaid leave does not have the same protective effects&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>I should add another excerpt from the paper. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;For those mothers who want to return to work soon after the birth of a child, it is important for them to be able to access high quality, appropriate childcare&quot;.</p>
</ul>

</p>

<a name="60309-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>I hope your Lordships will forgive me. I intend to speak at a greater length than perhaps the Committee would wish to this first amendment, but I intend to say very little during the rest of the afternoon.
</p>

<a name="60309-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>Perhaps I may add a further quotation from the annex. It states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;during the first year of a child&#039;s life, in the majority of cases it is good for the child to receive consistent one-to-one care. For health reasons (e.g. breast-feeding) mothers should have a genuine choice to be the main carer in the early months of a child&#039;s life. There are also child development benefits that derive from close parental contact in the early years&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The evidence is clear about the importance of the significant impact that the amendment will make and why it is so important that parents, particularly mothers, have a genuine choice in these matters.
</p>

<a name="60309-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>On Monday, I was speaking with a child psychotherapist about this issue. She has established child and baby projects in Holloway Prison and in other women&#039;s prisons, and a similar project in a women&#039;s hostel in Camden Sure Start scheme. Her view is that a one-to-one relationship with a primary carer, normally the mother in the first nine to 12 months is most important to the child&#039;s successful development. At the same time a discrete relationship with the father is also crucial. Finally, the regular play of both parents together with the child is highly desirable, because that not only binds the child to the parents, but binds the parents to the child. The more joy that they have in a child, the more joy she can have in them. That is particularly important given the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, about family break-up and the stress that having a child can have on a family.
</p>

<a name="60309-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>So the Bill needs to go as far as it can in making it possible for mothers, should they wish, to devote most of their attention to the child in the first year of life. It is that attachment that enables children to begin to master their feelings. With that done, they can concentrate at school and become passionate about their work and, perhaps later, passionate about a family of their own. They are less likely to fall into depression later in life or have a tendency towards aggressive outbursts or other difficulties in managing their emotions.
</p>

<a name="60309-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>I ask your Lordships to cast your minds back to one of the quotations I have just read regarding what happens when there are difficulties and the mother needs to return to work soon after the birth of a child. They need at that time access to high quality and appropriate childcare. Sadly, it is well recognised that there is a lack of good quality childcare. That is not to say that there are not many people out there doing a good job, but we have to recognise that, generally, there is not the capacity that we need in this area. I welcome the Government&#039;s next Bill on childcare. Realistically, however, it will be several years before high quality childcare is widely available to all. There is particular concern about the quality of childcare for the very young, those less than 12 months. I hope it becomes clear how important the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment is.

</p>

<a name="60309-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>A good start, a strong relationship with his mother, enables a child to manage his emotions. Without Blake&#039;s &quot;arrows of desire&quot; there can be no mental fight nor any hope of building Jerusalem in this green and pleasant land. I hope Members of the Committee will not mind my being a little poetic.  Children need to live to their full potential and make the fullest contribution to society. With the decline in our birth rate, never has the successful growth of each of our children been more important to us all. I urge Members of the Committee to consider the amendment very carefully.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60309-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Northbourne: </b>   I, too, support the amendment. As I was walking down to the House this morning, I was wondering what I would say in its support. As I passed Westminster School, a gangling boy of about 16 passed me in the opposite direction. As I walked on, I found myself wondering what his hopes and dreams were as he began to confront the adult world. Then the thought came to me that those hopes and dreams are in our hands, or at least the hopes and dreams of children born today and in the future are in our hands. I shall not repeat what my noble friend Lord Listowel said about the importance of bonding in the early years because I am sure we are all conscious of it. But this is an area where we should not be penny-pinching. Even if this is a bit of a bribe to mothers to take more leave and be with their child, surely it is a good investment. I support the amendment.

<a name="60309-29_spnew2"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham: </b>   I am most grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, for her clear articulation in support of the amendment and to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, for his erudite fleshing out of the previous supporting comments.
</p>

<a name="60309-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>Forty years ago I met and married a nurse at Great Ormond Street Hospital, so I have had the importance of the first year of a child&#039;s life drummed into me solidly through the years. Pastorally, I have seen again and again good evidence of the importance and the effect of this. Without wanting to reiterate the points that have already been made, if we want a healthy society and family life, structuring and facilitating our society, and if we want an economically buoyant, efficient and effective society, we must be prepared to invest in it. This is a small investment with great potential outcomes to give women on maternity leave the latitude to have realistic options so that they can take their time to build up that bond of affection with their children.

<a name="60309-29_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </b>  I am very grateful to the noble Baroness for allowing us the opportunity to debate this very broad and important amendment. It is my eldest son&#039;s 18th birthday today; as the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, said, one does ponder what the future holds. Thinking back to the early days, I agree strongly with the right reverend Prelate and the noble Earl about the importance of parents giving all support to their children, particularly in the early years.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC329"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC329</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60309-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>Noble Lords have generally given the Bill a very warm welcome. I hope its elements will be seen as supporting parents in wishing to do their best for their children. Although we will no doubt have a debate about whether the level of statutory maternity pay is right, there is nothing between any of us about the importance of what we are seeking to do.
</p>

<a name="60309-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>I will come on to the details of the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment in due course. If one looks at the Government&#039;s action on statutory maternity pay, there has been a large increase. She will know, for example, that in 1997 it was &#163;55.70, in 2003 it had risen to &#163;100, and it now stands at &#163;106. I think that that shows the Government&#039;s good intent in this area.
</p>

<a name="60309-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned the report published today. There is no question but that the task that we have set ourselves in relation to child poverty is very challenging. I shall not seek to run away from that or from the fact that we hope to make faster progress. A great deal of progress has been made. The Government have halved the number of children in absolute poverty, and more than 1.8 million fewer children are in absolute low income compared with the numbers in 1996&#150;97. Clearly, we need to go further. As the noble Baroness knows, we see work as one way in which many poor people and the children of those poor people can increase their income, and my department&#039;s whole welfare reform agenda is very much focused on that.
<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="60309-29_time0"></a><h5>2.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60309-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>I also say to the noble Baroness that, looking ahead at the figures from April 2007, if one takes the flat rate of statutory maternity pay plus other forms of government support for the poorest working families, that will be worth more than &#163;8,000 during a child&#039;s first year. I think that there has been a significant and credible advance there.
</p>

<a name="60309-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>I have assumed that the amendment seeks to increase the basic rate of both statutory maternity pay and maternity allowance to a rate equivalent to 35 hours paid at the highest level of the national minimum wage. At current rates, that would be &#163;176.75 a week. As currently drafted, the amendment achieves that for women who will get maternity allowance, but women who will get statutory maternity pay would receive that same minimum level, or 90 per cent of their average earnings if that is lower. But I take that to be a drafting quibble rather than a substantive point.
</p>

<a name="60309-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Currently SMP is paid at 90 per cent of a woman&#039;s average earnings for the first six weeks, with no upper limit, followed by 20 weeks at the basic rate or the 90 per cent rate, whichever is the lower. Maternity allowance is paid at the basic rate or 90 per cent of her average earnings, whichever is lower. Women can qualify for maternity allowance if they earn, on average, &#163;30 per week. The significance of that is that the amendment would mean that many lower paid, and probably part-time, working women would be far better off while they received maternity allowance&#151;and, if I understand the noble Baroness&#039;s intentions, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC330"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC330</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

SMP as well&#151;than they would be when at work. I am not sure that that can really be a fair outcome of the purpose of statutory maternity pay.
</p>

<a name="60309-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>I was interested in what the noble Baroness said about the number of parents who were dissuaded from taking leave because of what she suggested was the low availability of resources. However, research that my department has seen shows that most women stay off work for the whole of their paid maternity leave. We increased the payment period for SMP and MA from 18 to 26 weeks and we increased the basic rate as I suggested.
</p>

<a name="60309-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Of course, the Government&#039;s intention is to deliver greater choice to parents in how they balance their work and family life during the first year of a child&#039;s life. Noble Lords will know that we have already set out our commitment to extend paid maternity leave to one year by the end of this Parliament. That will also be significant in meeting the point raised by the noble Earl. As a step towards that, we intend to extend the payment period for SMP and MA to 39 weeks from April 2007. So, in answer to the noble Baroness, I think that we are making considerable progress here.
</p>

<a name="60309-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>My officials estimate that, if we were to accept the amendment, the cost for the Government of up to 39 weeks would be about &#163;650 million and, for business, &#163;45 million. If it were extended to 52 weeks, we reckon on &#163;1 billion for government expenditure and &#163;68 million for business expenditure. The noble Baroness&#039;s proposal would require a considerable amount of additional public expenditure and would be a burden on business. I fully understand the noble Baroness&#039;s reasons for wishing to see more generous leave payments being made, but given the size of those sums and considering the competing pressures on public finances, it would be difficult at this stage to go down that route.
</p>

<a name="60309-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Overall, the action taken by the Government since 1997 has made a considerable contribution to parents wishing to spend time with their children. One would always like to be more generous, but the current level is a considerable increase over previous levels. As I said, the public expenditure implications of the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment are considerable. On that basis, I hope that she will withdraw her amendment.

<a name="60309-30_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for his detailed response to this important amendment. I recognise the important step that the Government have made in moving paid paternity leave forward to nine months and then on to 12 months. He spoke of the balance and fairness between employed and unemployed women and I recognise the concerns there. However, I suggest that he should balance that with the imperative that we have all been discussing; about giving the best start&#151;Sure Start&#151;to children. He might also consider the public health implications and costs to the National Health Service later in life.
</p>

<a name="60309-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>I know young people of 16, 17 or 18 years of age who have had the worst starts in life and are suffering from low levels of paranoia or depression, which are quite likely to blossom into more florid developments later.

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC331</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

according to the Office for National statistics, 68 per cent have a mental disorder following tremendous upset in their family lives. I recognise what the Minister is saying, but I ask him to consider balancing that against the financial benefits to us all of this early investment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60309-30_spnew1"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham: </b>   The Minister has a great advantage over the rest of us because the trump card that he can ultimately play is the statistical one, which can wrong-foot us. Can the figures be substantiated? I do not doubt the statistics, but it is rather like being at school and the teacher wanting to see the working and reasoning behind your answer.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60309-30_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   If it would help, I would be happy to write to noble Lords between Grand Committee and Report with statistics relating to the costs of the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment and in relation to the take-up of maternity allowance. I would like to respond in further detail to the noble Baroness on that point.
</p>

<a name="60309-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>I recognise what the noble Earl said. We know that as &quot;spend to save&quot;. The argument departments make to the Treasury on a frequent basis is that upfront investment will lead to savings downstream. The Treasury is not always sympathetic to that point. Of course, the earlier you can make interventions to help children, the greater the impact later on in reducing crime and social exclusion. I have no argument with the point that he makes. In a sense, what we are doing today and the expenditure to which we are already committed indicate our recognition of that. There is no real disagreement between us in principle. The question is about the actual cost of what is proposed.
</p>

<a name="60309-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>There is an important principle in relation to payments being made that are higher than the person is actually earning in work. But, at the end of the day, the changes and investment that we are making are focused on the points raised by the noble Earl.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60309-30_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I thank the Minister for all his comments and apologise to him for not starting my remarks by welcoming the main thrust of the Bill and recognising the steps forward that the Bill will make&#151;and, indeed, by recognising what the Government have committed themselves to in future, in the general thrust of the direction in which they are going. The Minister is quite right in saying that we all absolutely support that. I suppose that I was so keen to get into the meat of my amendments that I neglected to do that. But I thank him and all Members of the Committee who supported the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60309-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>I also thank the Mother&#039;s Union, which I forgot to mention has briefed me on this matter. The point that the Mother&#039;s Union, and all of us, are making, is that parents need to have a real choice to take the full entitlement of maternity leave. If the financial constraints are great, they do not really have a real choice. Families tend to live up to the income that they normally have; they take on a mortgage of a certain size and payments on their car and their furniture and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC332"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC332</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

so on. It is very difficult to ratchet those back for a period of six, nine or 12 months, when the mother wants to take time to bond with her child. That is why it is really desirable to have this amendment.
</p>

<a name="60309-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>As for the detail of the Minister&#039;s remarks on the different kinds of benefits, I think that one should give parents a choice. I do not have any problem with a mother having an allowance during her maternity leave that is actually greater than what she normally earns, because of what we heard yesterday from the Women and Work Commission about the terrible low pay that so many women receive. So I do not think that is a bad thing at all&#151;we should think of it as a subsidy for a new baby citizen coming into the world.
</p>

<a name="60309-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>I accept that the cost is not inconsiderable, and I was aware that it would amount to many millions of pounds&#151;but we should think of the benefits. The Government have done a great deal to spend in order to save in the future, but they need to go further in that direction, because we all know how lack of bonding between parents and children and lack of a proper progress of child development during those first 12 months can actually lay the foundations for problems in later years, and the physical and mental health problems that can occur. We hear about so many mental problems that teenagers have these days, and not enough services to take account of them. There is also the cost if they get into the criminal justice system. So it really is worth spending to save when it comes to early intervention.
</p>

<a name="60309-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>It is a matter of priorities. Do we spend money on a war in Iraq or do we spend it on ensuring that our parents and children have the opportunity to make strong families and strong physical and mental development right from the start? I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_11"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment inserts additional wording into the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to enable foster parents who have become adoptive parents under the concurrent scheme to be entitled to adoption pay. Amendments Nos. 6 and 9 ensure that similar provisions are added to Clauses 4 and 7, enabling them to qualify for additional paternity leave adoption and additional statutory paternity pay adoption. I consider Amendments Nos. 6 and 9 to be consequential to the acceptance of the idea that those foster parents who become adoptive parents under the concurrent scheme should qualify for adoption pay and leave.

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>At Second Reading I highlighted the concern among fostering and adoption experts with regard to concurrent planning schemes. I remind Members of the Committee that concurrent planning schemes are those in which potential carers are approved both as foster carers and adopters for the same child. A baby is placed with them on an interim foster basis while the birth family is assessed. When it is established that the baby cannot return to its birth parents, the placement is converted to an adoption application. However, as the law currently stands, the adoptive parents are not eligible for adoption leave or pay, nor are their rights to return to work protected.

<a name="60309-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Concurrence is a bold initiative aimed at the least possible disruption and upheaval to the baby, and yet the risks the potential adopters face are enormous. Not only do they face emotional hurt but they face considerable financial burdens. Because of the very nature of concurrent planning schemes they have instability written all over them. And yet there are amazing, selfless, exceptional people who are willing to put themselves through the emotional and financial wringer to give a baby born into difficult and challenging circumstances a real chance.
</p>

<a name="60309-30_para12"></a>

I will not repeat everything that the noble Baroness has just said, but I would point out to the Minister that if he is thinking about the word cost, as he was in the previous amendment, the numbers here are really very small. We are not talking about a large amount of money but it will make a great difference to those children. The benefits are enormous. Concurrent planning is best practice. If we are going to be able to spread that best practice wider than the pilot schemes that are currently under way, what we do not want is for fostering or adoptive parents to be put off by the fact that they are not entitled to the sorts of support that these amendments would like to give them. It is the last thing we want to do. Ninety per cent of these schemes have already been successful and led to adoptions. This has given vulnerable infants a great deal more security and one less move, which is highly desirable because they stay with the same family. That is an enormous benefit to these particularly vulnerable children. There are not many of them so there is not a lot of cost. I hope the Minister can accept the amendments.

<a name="60309-31_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, for introducing the amendment and to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, for speaking to it. I think it will be one of those amendments, as is the case with many today, where there is full agreement on the thrust of what is trying to be achieved; it is just that there are so many issues and practicalities surrounding it. I think we all agree that the role played by adopters is vital. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, spoke with some passion on that when she moved the amendment. It was in recognition of the role played by adopters that the Government introduced the entitlement to statutory adoption pay and adoption leave in 2003. This was an historic milestone and one of which we are proud.
</p>

<a name="60309-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>We estimate that currently around 4,000 adoptive parents per year are entitled to statutory adoption pay and leave. Since the introduction of what is still a relatively recent right, we are aware that some stakeholders have called for these entitlements to be extended to those parents who take on the care of a child through what is termed concurrent planning. In concurrent planning, as has been explained, the child is placed with approved foster carers who, as well as providing temporary care for the child, act as support to the birth parents in helping them meet the objectives of any rehabilitation plan. The carers are also approved as adopters, so that if the rehabilitation plan is not successful, the child does not need to move and can remain in the same placement while the adoption plan is developed and implemented.
</p>

<a name="60309-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>As I said on Second Reading of the Work and Families Bill and as we have been reminded today, the Government are currently considering the question of how statutory entitlements to pay and leave fit with concurrent planning.
</p>

<a name="60309-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>We need to consider the rationale for adoption leave and pay. This is to support adopters in taking time off work when a child is placed with them. This helps the adopter and the child adjust to their new relationships. The Government&#039;s position is that this will help to reduce the number of disrupted placements and improve the life chances of looked-after children. In the case of concurrent planning, of course, the point at which the placement becomes a placement for adoption, will be some time after the child first joins the new parents, as the child will have spent some time being fostered. A further consideration will be the fostering allowance already paid to the parents in respect of each child placed. We will, of course, also need to consider the position of the employer.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60309-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>In the case of adoptions where there has been no concurrent planning, the adopter will usually be in a position to notify his or her employer of the expected date of placement of the child. The purpose of this period of notice, clearly, is to enable the employer to plan ahead for the absence and arrange cover as necessary. With the extension of the adoption pay period to 39 weeks as a result of the work and families legislation, the likelihood is that adopters will choose to take more time away from work. In the case of concurrent planning the situation will often be different: the child will already be placed with the adoptive parents to be, and when the placement switches to one of formal adoption we need to consider whether the employer is given sufficient notice of their entitlement to leave and pay. Further consultation on the matter with employers&#039; representatives will be necessary. I am sure that the noble Baroness would not wish to see employers placed in a position where they had very little notice of an employee&#039;s entitlement to take up to 52 weeks away from work.
</p>

<a name="60309-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Concurrent planning is still not widespread; I acknowledge that it is still fairly embryonic. Only four adoption agencies currently operate the concurrent planning model, and figures from one of those suggest that, between 1998 and 2004, only 57 children were placed in this way. None the less, we appreciate that, where it operates, concurrent planning can provide a number of advantages. It can reduce the number of placements for children, engage the birth parents in planning for the child, identify potential permanent families early on, and cut the time needed to reach adoption where this becomes necessary.
</p>

<a name="60309-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>In conclusion, the Government recognise the important role that concurrent planning can play, and wish to consider in more detail how statutory pay and leave entitlements apply, and what further legislation and guidance might be required. Given the relatively recent interest in the issue, we should make sure we do this properly. Officials and lawyers from the DTI and the DfES&#151;the department with lead responsibility for adoption&#151;are working jointly on the matter.
</p>

<a name="60309-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>Even if the Government concluded that eligible parents adopting children through such arrangements should have an automatic entitlement to statutory adoption pay and leave, we do not accept that the amendments would necessarily be the most sensible way of achieving this. It is worth noting that they would not introduce an entitlement to adoption leave for concurrent planning, which would be necessary in order to enable the adopters to take time away from work and to receive statutory adoption pay; nor would they introduce an entitlement for the two-week ordinary statutory paternity pay for adoption or paternity leave. However, I appreciate that these are probing amendments.
</p>

<a name="60309-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Given that the Government agree with the noble Baroness that the matter merits careful consideration, and given our clear commitment that we are already looking at this issue, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment. I also note the request from <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60309-31_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   I am most grateful to the Minister for his reply to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, who supported the amendment, and to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel. I recognise the complexity of the arrangements and the need for consultation. As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, the matter is so important and it is a very small group of people. I am afraid that there are already too many babies in the system who are moved around from home to home. Recent research has shown that because a baby exists only at sensory level, when we move that baby away from what is known and familiar&#151;your look, your feel, your touch, your smell&#151;it panics. And when it panics, some of the neural pathways close down and they never reopen. Then, as they get older, we have troubled, difficult teenagers.

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Clause 3 [<i>Additional paternity leave: birth</i>]:
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60309-31_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon </b>   moved Amendment No. 3:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>Page 2, line 10, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_2"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   For the purposes of subsection (1)(b) and (c), the relationship with the child must be that of the biological father and the relationship with the mother shall be that of co-habitor at the time the child is born and for the time when the additional paternity leave is taken and contributing directly or indirectly to the maintenance of the child or its mother.&quot;

<p><a name="st_17"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving the amendment, I should like also to speak to Amendment No. 4. Clause 3 gives entitlement to additional paternity leave on the birth of a child. It is said that it is a wise child who knows his own father. How much wiser must an employer be to know which putative father is the person entitled to the benefit of additional paternity leave.
</p>

<a name="60309-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>Let us consider the possible permutations: both biological parents living together; both biological parents living apart; the biological mother living apart from the father but now living with another man who is performing parental duties, whether or not assuming any financial responsibilities; and the biological mother unable to state who is the father. In all these cases, we must assume that the person claiming the additional paternity leave is not employed by the same person as the mother. Indeed, the mother may not be employed by anyone.
</p>

<a name="60309-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to define who among possible claimants is specifically entitled to the benefit and to relieve the employer, or possibly several employers, from having to determine who is entitled to it. The amendment lays down specific conditions for entitlement: the claimant must be the biological father, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC337"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC337</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

not some other man who has merely been living with the mother when the child was conceived or has begun to do so after that event. Alternatively, he must be living with the mother both at the time when the child is born and at the time when the leave is taken. In other words, this valuable provision should not be available to part-time separated fathers simply acting as occasional babysitters. He must actually be contributing to the maintenance of either the child or its mother. There is no justice in a father who is contributing nothing to the upkeep of either the child or its mother having this neglect rewarded by being granted an undeserved paid holiday.
</p>

<a name="60309-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>The Explanatory Notes explicitly state:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;An employee is eligible for paternity leave if he has or expects to have responsibility for the baby&#039;s upbringing&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>The amendment spells out this excellent and very necessary qualification without waiting for the Secretary of State to define it by the regulations which he intends to make.
</p>

<a name="60309-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>Amendment No. 4 would resolve another problem raised by the clause as originally drafted. As I pointed out in my opening remarks on this group of amendments, how does an employer know whether the person claiming the leave is really entitled to it? How does an employer who grants the leave and makes the payments in good faith know that he is not a victim of some fraud? How can an employer acting in good faith be protected against a refusal of reimbursement by the Inland Revenue on the grounds that another person was receiving that benefit? The combination of this amendment and the strict wording of the qualifications laid down by Amendment No. 3 would protect employers and the state alike against fraudulent claims.
</p>

<a name="60309-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>I am not suggesting by any means that this is a perfect defence&#151;nothing is&#151;but it is a little more so than the Bill provides. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60309-32_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Northbourne: </b>   I rise to speak to Amendment No. 3A, which, by implication, is critical of Amendment No. 3 but perhaps not as critical as it is of the existing government proposals. On Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, said, at col. 1120, said that the definition of a &quot;father&quot; for the purposes of the Bill is that he is the father of the child or married to, or a partner of, the child&#039;s mother and is responsible for bringing up the child. Amendment No. 3 does not make a definition of &quot;partner&quot; but, rather, defines the relationship which must exist between the father, the mother and the child. The father must be the biological father and cohabit with the mother at the time, and contribute to the maintenance of the child or his mother.
</p>

<a name="60309-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>My amendment follows Amendment No. 3, which has many merits, but it substitutes &quot;parental responsibility&quot; for the words &quot;biological father&quot;. I am concerned about unsuitable biological fathers and also the exclusion of non-biological fathers, who may for one reason or another be committed to the well-being of the child.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC338"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC338</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60309-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>As I understand it, and judging by the speeches on Second Reading, the principal purpose of paternity leave and additional paternity leave is to enable and encourage fathers to bond with their children. Such bonding is not much use&#151;indeed, it can even be harmful&#151;if the father has no intention of being involved with the child in the long term. Today, any father who wants to make a long-term commitment to his child can easily do so. He can have parental responsibility for that child simply by signing the birth register, unless he is married to the mother, in which case he has it automatically.
</p>

<a name="60309-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>I believe that my amendment therefore adequately covers fathers who want to make a serious and helpful commitment to their child. As I see it, the advantages that it has over the other amendments are as follows. First, the fact that a man is the birth father of a child does not mean that he intends to make a long-term commitment to him or her, even if he may still be living with the mother when the child is born. Furthermore, he may not be a suitable person to care for the child. Secondly, parental responsibility is a well established concept in law. It is easy, if necessary, to verify it and so it would tend to reduce fraud and perhaps make Amendment No. 4 unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="60309-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Thirdly, in my view there is a very strong case for trying to bring together the definition of a father and his rights and responsibilities into an existing legal definition rather than have yet another definition. We have definitions under anti-social behaviour legislation and the Child Support Act and definitions of parental responsibility under the Children Acts. In a way, one of the greatest difficulties experienced by parents and people who advise parents is that the law is extremely uncertain. If anyone does not believe me, two publications produced by the National Family and Parenting Institute over the past 12 months make that point in great detail. I should be happy to give the Minister the references.
</p>

<a name="60309-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>Finally, there may be cases&#151;I admit that these are perhaps less frequent than in times past&#151;where the husband of the mother accepts paternity of the child for the mother&#039;s and the child&#039;s sake, even if he is not the biological father. In a situation of that kind, it could be greatly in the best interests of the child for the father, although he is not the biological father, to have the opportunity to have paternity leave.

<a name="60309-32_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I had intended to add my name to Amendment No. 3A, but yesterday afternoon I was diverted and did not do so in time. I support Amendment No. 3A as the alternative to Amendment No. 3. I agree with a great deal of what the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has said. I understand her concerns. They are absolutely genuine and well founded. However, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, that a father does not have to be the biological father of a child to make a full commitment which will cost him money, time, effort, emotional energy and so on, in favour of a child in order to qualify for these benefits, as I think he should. I point out, in the presence of the right reverend <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60309-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I also give cautious support to Amendment No. 4. I see where the noble Baroness is coming from. There is a need to ensure that it is not possible for two fathers to claim the same benefit. In such a situation there would be an opportunity for an employer to lose out if he inadvertently gave the benefit to the wrong father. I am a little worried about Amendment No. 4 as it may be possible for a market to develop among women who are prepared to sign documents that go to more than one employer enabling more than one man to claim benefit.
</p>

<a name="60309-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>I would quibble with one phrase the noble Baroness used. I do not think that looking after any young child is a paid holiday, even if one receives &#163;106 a week. I certainly support the spirit of what she is trying to do, but I am just not sure that we are protected from the possibility of a market developing by the wording of her amendment.

<a name="60309-32_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   I have no problem with Amendment No. 3A. We are trying to find the correct way to do this to ensure that the problems that have been identified do not occur. I suggest that Amendment No. 3A approaches the problem from another way. Amendment No. 4 might create a market, although I would hate to think that that would be a possibility. We have to find a way of ensuring that an employer genuinely knows who is the father. I would assume that the mother would know who was living with her and who had responsibility for the child. I found the word &quot;biological&quot; somewhat easy to start with because I like to assume that all is done that way, but of course that is not so in real life. I think it should be anyone whom the mother is prepared to say is acting as the father, is working with her to bring up the child, is taking full responsibility and maintaining the child and indeed, if possible, the mother.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60309-32_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, for tabling these amendments so that we can discuss this issue. On Amendments Nos. 3 and 3A, as I outlined on Second Reading, existing paternity provisions require that, for a father to qualify for paternity leave, which will now be known as ordinary paternity leave, he must, in the case of the birth of a child&#151;rather than adoption&#151;be either the father of the child, or married to, or the partner&#151;including civil partner&#151;of the child&#039;s mother, and be responsible for the upbringing of the child. This definition was consulted on prior to the introduction of paternity leave in 2003 and was accepted as a reasonable definition that encompassed a wide range of fathers, who would be supporting the mother and child after the birth of the child. This definition clearly outlines who could be eligible, which would not be the case were we to adopt the &quot;parental responsibility&quot; phrase suggested by Amendment No. 3A.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC340"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC340</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60309-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>We intend to adopt the same relationship criteria for fathers to be able to take additional paternity leave, subject to other qualification criteria, as we believe that these are the right criteria and we have no evidence to prove otherwise. This will keep the scheme straightforward and help both employees and their employers to understand who is eligible. In most cases, an employee who wishes to take additional paternity leave and pay will have taken ordinary paternity leave and his employer will, therefore, have processed a claim, so having the same definition means the employer will not have to check again.
</p>

<a name="60309-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>The current definition that I have outlined has not caused any concern or any problems for employees or their employers in taking and administering ordinary paternity leave. We would not envisage there being any new problems by adopting the same definition for the additional paternity leave scheme. This leave is to care for the child. It is important for both parent and child and it has been proved that contact between the child and father during the first year has educational benefits in later life, as we spoke about earlier. Even if the father is not the biological father, but is caring for the child, the same benefits apply.
</p>

<a name="60309-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>In these modern times we have to be realistic. Marriages and relationships break down, divorces occur and, therefore, we need to be able to provide for these circumstances and ensure that the child receives the best possible care. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, gave us some permutations on what modern life can throw up. For example, could it honestly be said that a step-parent should not be eligible for this leave despite being one of the primary carers of the child? If the step-parent is responsible for the upbringing up of the child and the mother wishes to return to work, the step-parent should be able to take the time off to care for that child. The child can benefit from this as much as if the biological father were caring for the child. Although this example would not apply if we were to adopt the &quot;parental responsibility&quot; definition, as this could include step-parents, parental responsibility could cause problems as it can require complex legal processes to establish who has parental responsibility.
</p>

<a name="60309-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>Under current law, a mother always has parental responsibility for her child. A father, however, has this responsibility only if he is married to the mother, is named on the birth certificate as the father of the child or has acquired legal responsibility for his child. Living with the mother, even for a long time, does not automatically give a father parental responsibility.

I hesitate to say that the Minister is wrong, but since 2003&#151;I forget in which piece of legislation&#151;it has been possible for the father to sign the birth register and automatically have parental responsibility for the child. I am fairly sure of my facts.

<p><a name="st_23"></a>

processes have to take place for that responsibility to be established. I think that is now quite common and many parents choose to do it.
</p>

<a name="60309-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>A father whose name does not appear on the birth certificate can apply for parental responsibility through the courts and a parental responsibility order can be issued. This could also be a problem for step-parents and same-sex partners who might well be in a position where they have to apply for parental responsibility. While a mother can agree to give parental responsibility, an agreement would have to be drawn up and certified by a solicitor. This could all add to the complexity of the scheme, which we want to avoid and we do not think it would be right for a father, step-parent or same-sex partner to have to go through this possible process to establish eligibility to take additional paternity leave and pay.
</p>

<a name="60309-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>The intention of this policy is to improve the possibilities for caring for the child and ensure that the right person is caring for the child. We do not want to include additional steps for someone to qualify and maintain that the same definition we have for a father to be eligible for ordinary paternity leave is the most appropriate definition. These amendments seek to narrow the definition and would reduce the number of fathers eligible to take additional paternity leave.
</p>

<a name="60309-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Introducing a requirement that a father has to be related to the mother by being a co-habitor at the time the child is born, and for the time when additional paternity leave is taken, and is contributing to the maintenance of the child or the mother, would further limit the number of eligible fathers. This would not necessarily ensure that the right person is eligible to take additional paternity leave and be able to care for the child. Circumstances change and it is not always the father who is paying maintenance who has any caring responsibilities, or wishes to have any responsibilities for his child. It is important for the benefit of the child that the right person is caring for the child and we believe that the definition I have outlined is the correct definition to allow the most appropriate person to care for the child. We expect that in the vast majority of cases, parents will cohabit, but we want to reflect a range of personal choices that people can make.

</p>

<a name="60309-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>We do not believe that linking maintenance payments to the care of the child is necessarily an ideal approach and would question the relevance of this requirement. The definition we propose already provides that the person taking additional paternity leave and receiving additional statutory paternity pay must be responsible for the child&#039;s upbringing and can take additional paternity leave only to care for the child. Furthermore, including a link to the maintenance payment could result in further complexities about how this is proved and would not keep the scheme straightforward.
</p>

<a name="60309-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>We recognise that employers and taxpayers would want to be sure that the scheme was robust and that we were not enabling multiple payments or increasing the <br>&nbsp;<br>

risk of wrongful payments. In the additional paternity leave and pay consultation published on 8 March&#151;I accept that noble Lords may not have had the chance to peruse that in detail yet&#151;we sought views on issues surrounding this. For example, we have asked for views on whether it should be mandatory for a father to produce evidence of the birth or adoption of the baby or child, prior to additional paternity leave being taken. Under the existing two weeks&#039; paternity leave and pay arrangements a father is required only to self-certify that they have a child to qualify for the leave and pay entitlement. An employer may ask for evidence if they feel that there are grounds to do so. We want to ensure that we get the balance right, making the administration of the additional paternity leave scheme as straightforward as possible, while limiting the potential for abuse. We will continue to listen to the views of stakeholders and work with employers on this aspect following the consultation.
</p>

<a name="60309-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>We believe that it is important not to have the definition of a father to qualify for additional paternity leave included in the primary legislation. The definition of a father is not included in primary legislation for ordinary paternity leave and the sensible approach would be to set out the definition in the secondary regulations, which we will develop once the detail of the policy is finalised following further consultation and consideration.
</p>

<a name="60309-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 4, we recognise that how the additional paternity leave and pay scheme actually works is very important, and we want to ensure that we get it right. In the consultation, there is a whole section devoted to the administration of the scheme and this section asks for views on how the transfer of information, which is a vital part of the process, is carried out, and seeks views on sanctions and compliance. We have committed to keeping the administration &quot;light touch&quot;, but recognise that this has to be balanced with ensuring that the scheme is robust. Obtaining the views of employers is especially important in developing the administration of the scheme. Following the consultation, we will be working closely with employer representative groups and specialist HR and payroll personnel to assist in making the administration straightforward in terms of understanding and process.

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>In the <i>Work and Families: Choice and Flexibility</i> consultation published in February 2005, we asked for views on the procedure for administering the transferable leave and pay scheme, which was being considered at that time. We gave three options: self certification by the mother and father of their eligibility; self certification by the parents combined with confirmation by the mother&#039;s employer; and Inland Revenue compliance checks, which would require Inland Revenue&#151;now HMRC&#151;to undertake an additional check to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the system.
</p>

<a name="60309-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>From that consultation, it became clear that self certification by the mother and father of their eligibility with confirmation from the mother&#039;s employer that the mother was entitled to maternity leave and/or pay and has notified her intention to <br>&nbsp;<br>

return to work was the preferred option, as it provided a balance between keeping the bureaucracy to a minimum while limiting the potential for errors in payment or abuse of the system, through providing an additional check by employers. This principle can also be applied to the administration of the additional paternity leave and pay scheme. We want to minimise direct contact between the mother&#039;s employer and the father&#039;s employer and believe that this can be avoided, but we want to ensure this is what employers and employees also want.
</p>

<a name="60309-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>The amendment as drafted would not work in so far as the mother would not be able to confirm that a father was entitled to additional paternity leave and pay. While the mother could confirm that the father was the child&#039;s father or her partner and responsible for the upbringing of the child, the mother could not confirm the length of service a father had provided to their employer, or provide confirmation of the father&#039;s earnings, which are also eligibility criteria. This information would have to come through the father&#039;s employer.
</p>

<a name="60309-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>The amendment could lead to a more complicated administration arrangement. Where possible, we want to build on existing administration arrangements for maternity and paternity leave, as that will assist in keeping the scheme straightforward and should mean that many employers already have an understanding of the system. That, along with new guidance will, I am sure, make the administration straightforward and the scheme a success. It is crucial that we do not rush into making decisions about who is responsible for providing certain information and how that information is exchanged until we have had time to fully consult and explore the options. We want the scheme to be a success, as I am sure that other noble Lords do; we believe that these amendments should not be part of the Bill and that the issue should be left for further consultation and consideration before the regulations are drafted. Accordingly, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<a name="60309-33_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   I thank the Minister for his extremely clear in-depth answer to the amendments. I shall read his response with interest; as I listened, it sounded perfect but, sometimes, when you read the small print, you think of something that was not covered. But the Minister was very kind, and I assure noble Lords who spoke that I have no problem with any of the comments that they made. It is good that we have had the opportunity to discuss an important amendment. I agree with the Minister that all Members of the Committee want to ensure that when we make the decision on this, it is the right one. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="60309-34_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Northbourne </b>   had given notice of his intention to move Amendment No. 3A:

&quot;(   )   For the purposes of subsection (1)(b) and (c), the relationship with the child must be that the employee has parental responsibility for the child and the relationship with the mother shall be that of co-habitor at the time the child is born and for the time when the additional paternity leave is taken and contributing directly or indirectly to the maintenance of the child or its mother.&quot;

<p><a name="st_26"></a>The noble Lord said: I am most grateful to the Minister. I could not entirely follow the considerable amount of detail that he gave, so I should like to look at it again and if possible come and talk to him about it before Report, if necessary. I entirely agree, of course, that the definition of &quot;father&quot; for ordinary and additional paternity leave should be the same, but that does not prevent us changing the definition for ordinary paternity leave. The Minister may have answered this question, but what is the definition of &quot;father&quot; for the purposes of his definition of the person who is entitled to the leave? It is perfectly open to any father who genuinely wants to make a long-term commitment to his child to sign the birth register&#151;and any father who is not prepared to make such a commitment is, arguably, an unsuitable person to bond with a child.

</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60309-34_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Does the noble Baroness mean Amendment No. 20?
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60309-34_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   Yes, Amendment No. 20.
</p>

<a name="60309-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>These are probing amendments, seeking a very positive assurance from the Government. All the amendments call for regulations made under this legislation to be subject to the positive resolution procedure. The Secretary of State in the other place gave us an assurance that that indeed would be the case. I hasten to add that I do not doubt for one moment the Secretary of State&#039;s word on the subject. However, on reading the Bill as it reached your Lordships&#039; House, I found that that was far from clear, so I raised the issue on Second Reading. In his reply, the Minister said that all regulations were affirmative, apart from those on maternity pay and flexible working.
</p>

<a name="60309-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>That gives rise to two different points. First, as to the regulations other than those mentioned by the Minister, which provide for maternity pay and flexible working, the Minister told your Lordships that the provision for positive resolutions was to be found in the clauses or in Schedule 1. He then went on to say that it is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;not easy to find as you have to delve into Schedule 1 to get some of it&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 14/02/06; col. 1121.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC345"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC345</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60309-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>And then he added, &quot;I think&quot;. Those two words underline my problem. The Minister and I share the same dilemma. It is by no means clear where the provision is in that schedule, and I have really tried very hard to find it. The Government claim to espouse clarity of laws and regulations, and transparency. There is no reason why I or the Minister should have to go &quot;delving around&quot; in Schedule 1, as he put it, to find out what the law is.
</p>

<a name="60309-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>I also do not understand why the provisions about some regulations made under Clauses 13 and 14 are specifically made subject to the positive procedure, whereas the others, which apparently are also subject to the positive procedure, are for some reason buried in Schedule 1. It seems such an extraordinary way to structure a Bill, and it makes it very difficult for people to see what the position is.
</p>

<a name="60309-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>I repeat and I emphasise that not for one moment do I doubt the words of the Minister in either House. All I need is an unequivocal statement, preferably in one simple sentence, that the regulations will be subject to the positive procedure, and not one that ends with the words, &quot;I think&quot;. Also, as the Minister has a wonderful staff working on the Bill, maybe they would be kind enough to tell us on what page, at what line, and where it says it, so that we have it easier. If someone were looking at the Bill without the benefit of having <i>Hansard</i> next to them so they could see what the Minister has said about the positive procedure, they would say, &quot;Why isn&#039;t it here?&quot;. That is quite important.
</p>

<a name="60309-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>The two exceptions mentioned by the Minister on Second Reading were the regulations relating to maternity adoption pay and flexible working. The question there is, &quot;why?&quot;. Neither of those matters relate to some trivial administrative point unworthy of taking up parliamentary time unless someone wishes to raise a particular issue. As so often happens these days, this Bill is largely an enabling Bill. Much of the substance is buried away in regulation which means that, even when Parliament gets the opportunity to debate it, there is just one single chance rather than three separate stages in each House, and, conventionally, without the opportunity to amend those regulations. So what is so trivial in those two particular regulations that they do not deserve full parliamentary scrutiny?
</p>

<a name="60309-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>To summarise: will the Minister please give the House the confirmation about the regulations and where they are, and give us an equally clear explanation of why others, which in our view are also important, are not to be positive? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60309-34_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I share the noble Baroness&#039;s confusion about this issue, and I too would welcome some clarification from the Minister.

careful what one says when it goes on the record. I hope I can deal with the points raised, but in any event I will write to the noble Baroness and other noble Lords participating today, so that these matters are clearly set down.
</p>

<a name="60309-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Members of the Committee will be aware that this issue has been discussed in another place, but I am grateful for this opportunity to clarify that the additional paternity leave and pay regulations will be subject to the affirmative procedure, and the flexible working regulations will be under the negative procedure. We agree that the House should have the opportunity to consider the detail in the additional paternity leave and pay regulations, and for this reason we have made these provisions subject to the affirmative procedure.
</p>

<a name="60309-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>Paragraph 44 of Schedule 1 amends Section 236 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 to provide that regulations made under the new Sections 80AA and 80BB of that Act are to be made under the affirmative procedure. That covers regulations made under powers conferred under Clauses 3 and 4. Paragraph 22 of Schedule 1 amends Section 176 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to provide that regulations made under the new Sections 171ZEA and 171ZEE of that Act relating to additional statutory paternity pay are to be made by the affirmative procedure. This covers regulations made under the power set out in Clauses 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.

</p>

<a name="60309-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>With regard to Clause 12 and the legislation on flexible working, I can confirm that the decision was taken on which procedure should apply during the passage of the Employment Act 2002. Parliament decided that the regulations dealing with procedural requirements should be subject to the affirmative procedure, while those dealing with eligibility complaints and remedies should be subject to the negative procedure. As a consequence of this Bill we are proposing to amend only the regulations concerning eligibility for the right to request, and therefore the negative procedure is the proper one.
</p>

<a name="60309-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a> It is also worth noting that a full and detailed memorandum was submitted to the Lords Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform setting out, in detail, the background to each delegated power in this Bill, including the power currently under consideration, and explaining why each given procedure was deemed appropriate. The Committee made various references to the delegated powers set out in this Bill in its 15th report, and did not consider it necessary to raise any objection to the use of the negative procedure.
</p>

<a name="60309-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>Our record on developing the right to request flexible working, from the original task force to the recent work and families consultation, shows our commitment to full consultation and debate. We will always consider the needs and views of all interested parties, whether unions, employees, employers, parent groups or carers&#039; groups, and we welcome and <br>&nbsp;<br>

encourage the views of Members of both Houses. In January this year we launched a full public consultation on the detail of exactly which carers should be covered by an extension in the scope of the law. By talking to all stakeholders and carefully considering their views, we will ensure that the regulations are straightforward, easy to understand, and achieve our desired objective. However, notwithstanding what I have just said, which I am sure will go on the record, I reiterate that I will write to everyone here today so that they have this all clearly set out. I hope that has clarified matters at least a little.

<a name="60309-35_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon </b>   moved Amendment No. 11:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>Page 8, line 9, leave out from first &quot;of&quot; to end of line 22 and insert &quot;the Commissioners for Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 11 and 13 together. These are probing amendments because the Government have not yet made clear the justification for what they are proposing. The amendments share the same objective: to shift the responsibility for the administration of these schemes&#151;payment of statutory maternity and paternity pay&#151;from the employer on to the shoulders of the Government via the Inland Revenue and Customs.
</p>

<a name="60309-35_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>It is significant that when the Bill and the Explanatory Notes were first published in the other place, subsection (3) provided that there would be circumstances when the liability to pay&#151;in other words, administer&#151;the additional statutory pay would be that of the Commissioner of the Inland Revenue. Somewhere along the line since the Bill&#039;s publication, the Government have changed their mind and the burden is being shifted to the employers. This <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC348"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC348</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

change of mind is one of the reasons why the CBI has told us it has withdrawn its initial support for the Bill. The Minister should explain that change of mind to us.
</p>

<a name="60309-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a> One explanation, or perhaps part of the explanation, is the fact that the Treasury has estimated that it would cost &#163;75 million to set up and &#163;50 million per annum to administer. The Treasury wants that burden to become the responsibility of employers, most of whom are small employers who do not have the luxury of payroll departments to do the work, or personnel departments&#151;or human resources departments as they are now sometimes called. Among the welter of conflicting figures produced by the Government, it is suggested that the cost to business would be only &#163;3 million. How can it cost the Treasury &#163;50 million but cost employers only &#163;3 million. As far as I can see there is no indication where this figure comes from. I would be most grateful if the Minister could clarify this.
</p>

<a name="60309-35_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>I suggest that the figures have been plucked from the air, because in a paper published by HMRC there is another set of no less bewildering and somewhat different figures of the costs and benefits. I also notice that the HMRC figures suggest that an 8 per cent proportion of small employers deals with such matters electronically. How do they know this? How many employers using payroll programs on their computers will have to get them updated, and at what expense, to take on this additional responsibility?
</p>

<a name="60309-35_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>I believe that the Treasury is relying on small employers being unpaid benefits administrators. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State told the Standing Committee of the other place that it would require too complicated an exchange of information between employers and HMRC. I do not understand that. I cannot see why it could not be a simple letter such as, &quot;Dear taxman, Employee Bill Bloggins, reference number 1234, is taking additional paternity pay. Please let him have the money or ask the Social Security Department which is used to dealing with such matters to do so&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60309-35_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>The amendment to Clause 9 will, in my opinion, put additional maternity pay on the same basis as, for example, statutory sick pay, where the employer, in effect, pays out the money on behalf of the Government and recovers it by deduction from the monthly or quarterly payments to the Revenue of the sums that the employer has to hand over under the PAYE scheme. The difficulties that the amendment to Clause 9 seeks to redress is that the complexities of the scheme, which undoubtedly will result in many employers being bewildered about who is entitled to the payments and when and for how long.
</p>

<a name="60309-35_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>That especially impinges on small employers who do not, as I said, have the benefit of a payroll department to work it all out for them. It is true, as the Minister told your Lordships on Second Reading, that employers will be reimbursed 104.5 per cent of the money that they pay out. I think that 104.5 per cent is a curiously exact figure but I am sure that they have worked it out very carefully. I do not know what arcane calculation produced the figure, but I suppose, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC349"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC349</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in reality, it means that the employer who pays out &#163;100 to his employee will be rewarded by getting back &#163;4.50 from a most grateful Government who did not have to do it even though they said initially that they were prepared to consider doing it. It will be more, of course, if the weekly pay is more than &#163;100.
</p>

<a name="60309-35_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>I do not know whether, in turn, this bounty is itself taxable in the employer&#039;s hands or whether he gets the &#163;4.50 free of tax. But in my book the whole thing will now become very much more complicated. I am sure that the Minister can tell us the situation as he has just received a note. It must be wonderful to have that facility.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60309-35_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   The noble Baroness has us.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60309-35_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   That is true. Whether it is tax free or not, I think I can speak on behalf of thousands of employers around the country who have a regular monthly struggle to do their PAYE returns. They would rather not have the responsibility of finding how much is due and to whom and, having done so, finding a way to get it into the hands of the eligible employee with whom, by virtue of the very fact that they are on leave, they may not at that time be in close contact.
</p>

<a name="60309-35_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>I am not being sceptical when I surmise that if the Treasury is prepared to pay a bonus to employers to do this work for it, someone has worked out that it costs perhaps a little more than that to do the job. Perhaps that is a little cynical and not very gracious of me. I have no intention of withdrawing it, but I was smiling at the Minister as I said that.
</p>

<a name="60309-35_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>It is simply not right that employers, large or small, should have to bear even a part of the financial burden of implementing the very welcome government social policy, even one that has all our support. I cannot see why it is put particularly on small employers. In spite of my view that the main beneficiary of the amendment will be small employers, that has not hindered the CBI from giving it its great support. It mostly deals with larger employers, but feels this issue is important for small employers.
</p>

<a name="60309-35_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>Amendment No. 13, which is grouped with it, is also a probing amendment. The Government have not explained the reason for their change of mind, as set out in the Explanatory Note, about imposing this administrative burden on small businesses, even though I said earlier that it is probably for financial reasons. As your Lordships know, small businesses are the backbone of commerce in this country, whether in the form of small manufacturing companies, service industries, from hairdressers to estate agents, professional firms or retailers.
</p>

<a name="60309-35_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>Corner shops are particularly hard pressed at the moment. They are often family-run, small businesses, open 24 hours a day every day, with no time at all for complicated book-keeping. The Government, to do them credit, are currently offering inducements to small firms to do some of their tax filing online. Firms with fewer than 50 employees are currently being offered &#163;250 to file their PAYE online. Before imposing what the Government acknowledge is a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC350"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC350</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

substantial burden on employers, why cannot HMRC simply upgrade the programme it already has to enable these social benefits at least to be calculated, even if the employer is left with the duty of paying them to the employee entitled?
</p>

<a name="60309-35_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>As I said in relation to Amendment No. 11, we have no idea how the Government arrived at what we think is an unduly optimistic calculation of the cost to small businesses that do not enjoy in-house professional assistance and will have to pay their accountants to do this job for them. Where they have to do it themselves, they will have to do so either in trading hours or during the little leisure time that many businesspeople running small businesses are able to enjoy. We need the justification for the Government&#039;s cost projections. We think the burden on small businesses will be much greater, not only in terms of cost but also in terms of the time it will take them. Many of them, as I said, work all around the clock.
</p>

<a name="60309-35_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>This probing new clause simply suggests&#151;I put it no higher than that&#151;that the responsibility for administering the whole raft of different kinds of benefits should be that of the Secretary of State. The burden should be taken off small employers if they feel they absolutely cannot cope with it. A small employer, as we are clear, is defined as someone employing fewer than 50 people. How the Secretary of State will do that work is up to him, including providing the online facility. The argument for the amendment is precisely the same as the argument I have just spoken to on Clause 9, which I now beg to move.

<a name="60309-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   I support the amendment put forward by the noble Baroness. My first point probably answers one of her questions: we on these Benches accept that the cost to small businesses of administering these payments will clearly be more than the &#163;4.50 referred to. That answers her question on tax. That is because if the payment is taxable, the expense is greater than the payment; therefore the overall tax burden of the employer has not increased&#151;it has probably marginally reduced.

<a name="60309-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>This raises an important principle&#151;almost the most important principle raised by the Bill. As noble Lords said at Second Reading and as various Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members said in another place, this is a moment at which the burden of regulation on small businesses can be alleviated. People did not realise when the PAYE system was introduced, many decades ago, what a burden that placed on businesses&#151;particularly small businesses.

This debate took place at least twice in another place and in this House at Second Reading, and I suspect that we will not persuade the Government of this. It is particularly unfortunate that this is one factor that has led the CBI to withdraw its support for the Bill, because we have managed under <br>&nbsp;<br>

this Government since 1997 to have more or less a consensus on legislation. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, nods her head in agreement. I am not sure that those of us who participated with her in debates on earlier legislation would necessarily have found her nodding so agreeably; nevertheless there has been reasonable consensus across the parties. It is a shame that the CBI has been put into a position in which it has now withdrawn its approval. This clause is one of the reasons why.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>The prime argument made both in another place and at Second Reading for why the Secretary of State cannot take over responsibility for the administration of the scheme for small businesses was that he would have to get involved in all sorts of detail on individual provisions and circumstances which they would not have. It is difficult to believe that that is a satisfactory answer, given the computer online world that we live in, where most small and large businesses operate computer systems, and details could easily be provided to the organisation that would administer this proposal.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>I suspect that we will not win the argument and that the Government have made up their mind not to do this. It is a pity, but I support the amendment.

<a name="60309-36_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for introducing the amendment and allowing us to have another discussion on this topic, and I thank other noble Lords who have contributed.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>The matter of direct payment by HMRC of statutory maternity pay, statutory adoption pay and statutory paternity pay has already received some discussion in the other place. However, we first need to understand why the Government have decided against direct payment generally, as the same considerations will apply for direct payment of additional statutory paternity pay and for an optional direct payment scheme for small employers.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>The Government have made clear from the outset that we are committed to delivering the work and families legislation in ways that balance the needs of children, families and their employers. Recognising the needs of employers, we committed at the time of PBR 2004 to consider the possibility of direct payment of statutory maternity pay, statutory adoption pay and statutory paternity pay, as one way of easing the administrative burden for employers.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>After careful consideration, much external consultation&#151;including with an ad hoc consultation panel of payroll experts&#151;and extensive analysis, we concluded that DP was not as attractive as it initially <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC352"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC352</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

appeared. HMRC&#039;s analysis was published on its website at PBR 2005. I invite noble Lords to access that because it gives a lot of detail. This showed that direct payments would not, in fact, remove from employers all the burdens associated with maternity, and so on, leave and pay. It would not really be viable without major risk of errors on a large scale affecting employees at a particularly vulnerable time and their employers. It would not represent good value for money for the taxpayer&#151;the costs of set-up in particular being disproportionate to the benefit for employers. It would not be timely&#151;HMRC says that it could not deliver direct payment before at least 2010, in view of its other IT commitments. Narrowing direct payment down to an optional scheme or to additional statutory paternity pay only would still not make it viable. However, I invite noble Lords to note that we are taking steps to remove the main payroll problem employers have with statutory maternity pay, and so forth, by another means&#151;a free calculation service delivered much sooner and at much less cost to the taxpayer.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>It might help noble Lords if I explain in more detail the purpose of the amendment&#151;the employer problems that we are trying to address here. Then I will explain just what direct payment would actually involve because it is not immediately obvious. The main problem that employers have is with their employees&#039; leave. They have to manage the leave entitlement and the job left vacant by the absent employee. An additional problem is the employees&#039; statutory pay. Here the main problem is the calculation of the pay due to the employee and recoverable from the state. This is more difficult for employers calculating it manually than for those using software calculators. But actually making the payments is not complex, as an established payment route from employer to employee already exists.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>Direct payment is also more complex than some might expect. Largely, that is because these statutory payments are wage replacements not state benefits paid gross. That means that they are subject to the whole range of payroll deductions, such as tax, national insurance, pension contributions and payroll giving, and are subject to earnings-based employer contributions, such as employer national insurance contributions, or occupational pension contributions, or the large employer&#039;s 8 per cent contribution to maternity, and so on, pay.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>At this juncture, I should comment on the 4.5 per cent uplift over re-imbursement for smaller employers and stress that it is not intended to compensate for the administrative costs of operating the scheme. It is meant to compensate for the employer&#039;s national insurance contributions due on SMP that are paid out. It is right that that is taxable, whichever of those features it is intended to cover.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>So what would direct payment actually involve? First, for statutory pay, it would obviously mean HMRC taking over from the employer the calculation and payment of the statutory payment in question. What is less obvious is that they would also take over the payroll deductions; and the employer would still <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC353"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC353</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

retain responsibility for earnings-based employer contributions and for periodic returns of the employees&#039; income, like the employer&#039;s annual return, to HMRC. To accomplish all of that, the employer and HMRC would need to carry out a complex two-way information exchange to high standards of accuracy and tight time limits.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>The Committee may like to note that the ad hoc consultation group of payroll experts did not believe such an information exchange could take place without error&#151;and error on a large scale&#151;affecting employees at a particularly vulnerable time; and affecting their employers to whom they would turn with their immediate concerns about wrong or late payments. Correcting these errors, which the group of experts believed inevitable, would impact heavily on HMRC.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>Secondly, for any other earnings of the employee from that employer&#151;late payments for overtime or bonuses as well as any occupational top-ups and occupational maternity pay amongst others&#151;the employer would continue to remain totally responsible. That would mean two parties running two parallel payrolls with two sets of incomes, deductions and contributions&#151;HMRC&#039;s payroll for the statutory pay; the employer&#039;s for the other earnings. The group of experts considered that errors would be inevitable. I will continue to try to throw some light on that.

</p>

<a name="60309-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>Thirdly, the employer would remain responsible for managing the leave and the vacant job. At this point, the Committee may like to consider the overall effect of direct payment on employers, for clearly it does not take away all the problems with leave and statutory pay. Rather, it removes some pay burdens&#151;calculation, payment and deductions, but the employer retains other pay burdens&#151;the earnings-based employer contributions and periodic returns; running a parallel payroll for other earnings from the employment. The employer also retains their main burden&#151;the leave and the vacant job and the employer acquires two major new burdens&#151;the information exchange and dealing with errors.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>Even if direct payment does not remove all employer burdens, the Committee may still like to know if it is viable. For this I will remind you of the view of the external group of payroll experts. In their opinion, the information exchange was, of necessity, complex and errors on a large scale would be unavoidable. This would therefore prevent direct payment from being viable without adverse impacts on all concerned&#151;employees, employers and HMRC.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>Would direct payment be value for money? That question has excited some interest in the other place as well as among noble Lords. I have deliberately spent time explaining how complex direct payment would be, as that has a bearing on the cost to HMRC. One-off set-up costs are estimated at up to &#163;75 million&#151;the major components of which are the new IT system for calculation, payment and deductions and for the information exchange; and the probable costs of a new contact centre to handle the inevitable errors. This would be no ordinary stand-alone payroll software <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC354"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC354</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

package. It would need links internally to HMRC&#039;s other data systems&#151;for employee identification and other purposes&#151;and externally to employers and sundry recipients of the payroll deductions. This would require a secure two-way electronic connection or gateway, protecting the flow of personal data. In addition to the initial &#163;75 million start-up costs, there would then be annual running costs, estimated at around &#163;50 million, which include maintenance costs for this highly complex IT system.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>Employers would save time from the removal of calculation, payment and deductions, estimated at around &#163;3 million gross. The extra time costs of the information exchange are estimated at around &#163;2 million, leaving employers about &#163;1million better off in net terms. The net benefit for small employers was estimated at around &#163;400,000. Out of this, employers would still need to meet the costs of sorting out errors; and software users would be likely to face the costs of more complex software to handle the information exchanges.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>That does not represent good value for money for the taxpayer. Direct payment is much more complicated and cumbersome than people anticipate&#151;and that is reflected in the heavy one-off set-up costs for enormously complex IT and a contact centre. It is technically feasible&#151;nobody would dispute that&#151;but it would not be easy or timely. As we saw before, employers lose few burdens&#151;their savings are in the time spent on calculations, payment and deductions.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>The Committee might well ask if direct payment would be timely. In view of its other IT commitments, HMRC says that it would not be able to deliver direct payment before at least 2010, as I indicated earlier. I hope that it will be clear now that there are many good reasons why the Government have decided against direct payment&#151;it has been a thorough and proper analysis. As I said earlier, detailed costs are available on the website and I urge noble Lords to look at those. Value for money is only one of the reasons.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>The Committee might wonder therefore what the Government are planning to do to remove the payroll problems of these statutory payments. We recognise that the main payroll problem is the complex manual calculation. Our response is to eliminate the need for any employer to calculate statutory pay manually&#151;through a combination of easy-to-use electronic calculators provided free by HMRC, and, for those employers less comfortable with such calculators, a free telephone helpline calculation service. The cost of this to HMRC is less than &#163;1m in one-off costs, and the timing is much sooner than direct payment&#151;much is already in place and the rest is planned for April 2006. These measures will remove the main payroll problem of manual calculation for employers.

</p>

<a name="60309-36_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The amendments under consideration suggest, in effect, direct payment of additional statutory paternity pay alone and an optional direct payment scheme for smaller employers. As I have just said, there is now less <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC355"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC355</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

need for direct payment anyway because manual calculation is being eliminated. This and all the above arguments apply here too. The payroll burdens related to ASPP and other statutory payments would not be removed, nor would the need for a new information exchange and the inevitable errors. It would still not be value for money. In the case of an optional DP scheme HMRC&#039;s one-off costs would not change much&#151;the IT system would need the same capabilities and a new capability to distinguish between larger and smaller employers. On the other hand, any specialist contact centre could be smaller. Annual staff costs could be lower too. However, depending on uptake, optional direct payment would affect fewer employers and their net benefits would be smaller. Treating some employers differently from others would only add confusion to an already complex area.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>In the case of a scheme solely for ASPP, HMRC&#039;s one-off costs might decrease by around &#163;10 million or so, whereas the benefit would be received by fewer employers and would likely be a fraction of the net &#163;1 million I mentioned. Claims in the first year are estimated at up to 16,000 only, and treating ASPP differently from the other statutory payments would only add confusion to an already complex area. Large employers and many small employers have already made it clear that they do not want direct payment, with its complex information exchange, anyway. I understand the CBI&#039;s position on that, but it does not speak on this matter for the whole of industry by some way.
</p>

<a name="60309-36_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>I hope that noble Lords will now fully appreciate why the Government took the view that there would have been little point in proceeding with a direct payment scheme generally, for a wide range of good reasons, including the poor value for money; and why optional direct payment for smaller employers is even less attractive, as is one of additional statutory paternity pay alone, given the small number of employers affected and the reduced net benefits. I therefore respectfully ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>When there is a good relationship between employer and employee, which is in the vast majority of cases, it will be beneficial to both sides if the employer can call on an employee who is on leave to come in to help out with a problem, whether it is to help find a missing file, solve a computer problem, deal with a particular customer with whom the employee has a special relationship, and so on. From the employee&#039;s point of view, the main advantage is keeping a foot in the door, keeping up with current affairs in the business, maintaining contact with colleagues, and even marking out a territorial claim to seniority.

For example, after the first six months, one day a week back at work would help to phase in the return to full-time work, and give the employee an opportunity to catch up on developments in the business or undertake training necessary to move forward with the business. The business may well have moved forward during six months of maternity leave&#151;particularly an IT business.

One must remember that at a time of great pressure on parents with new children, when they have left work, it is a challenge to return to it and it is sometimes daunting to do that and bring up children. The more contact that can take place between the parent and the employer so that returning to work is as smooth as possible must be in everyone&#039;s interest.
</p>

<a name="60309-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>Equally, we must balance the needs of employers in terms of the way that they can administer and manage staff who are in that position. At all times, we are trying to seek a balance between the desirability of making it as easy as possible for the employee to come back in as flexible a way as possible for the needs of the business. As noble Lords said in the previous debate, by and large we have managed to create a consensus although there has been a little kerfuffle over direct payments. At all times we need to bear that in mind.
</p>

<a name="60309-37_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>Whether we can be even more flexible in the future will always be a question of how we can keep that consensus and evaluate each step to see what needs to be done. The Government have no problem at all with the general principle of the amendment. The noble Baroness will know that there was extensive consultation prior to the introduction of the Bill in another place. Quite a number of employers reported that they felt uncertain about whether they were permitted to initiate contact with employees. Although there is in fact no problem about employers initiating such contacts, the very fact that they may feel inhibited from doing so suggests that if we can, through legislation, encourage employer and employee to feel free to communicate openly during <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC359</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

this time, we ought to do that. Alongside that, the Bill allows us to introduce &quot;keeping in touch&quot; days which will further support employers and employees in keeping in touch by allowing a woman to work a limited number of days for her employer during maternity leave. That is where we have got to.

<a name="60309-37_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>We will, as the amendment suggests, need to be clear about the meaning of &quot;reasonable contact&quot;. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, was a mite critical that we had not simply gone ahead and done this as opposed to our approach of using regulations and concentrating on the guidance on reasonable contact. Our experience in the area of employment suggests that it is much better to get it right. Publishing draft regulations which allow for both keeping in touch days and reasonable contact, along with the guidance that will define what reasonable contact means, is probably the appropriate way to go. Although that means that these measures will be implemented later than the noble Baroness suggests, we are much more likely to get it right and to get the consensus we need.
</p>

<a name="60309-37_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>I hope that I have assured the noble Baroness that we very much agree with the points that all noble Lords have made this afternoon. Our approach in the draft regulations shows that we are dealing convincingly with this issue. I hope that the noble Baroness is satisfied with that response.

However, describing me as &quot;a mite critical&quot; is rather strong. He referred to a kerfuffle with regard to a previous amendment. I certainly did not regard that as a kerfuffle; I thought it was a nice probing amendment, and we got a satisfactory explanation of the situation. If I was a mite critical, it is true, is it not, that the entire Bill was dealt with in the Commons with no sight of any draft regulation.

<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="60309-38_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness, but could she clarify something? The amendment as so amended appears to relate in part to a situation in which notification has to be given for leave when a woman becomes pregnant. Is the noble Baroness talking about the period when the woman is actually on leave and giving notice of coming back to work?
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="60309-38_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   Yes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="60309-38_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   Exactly. As noble Lords will recognise, that is already in the draft regulations, and I can assure the noble Baroness and other Members of the Committee that the Government are clearly committed to continuing with the policy. As the noble Baroness says, and I think we all agree, we are trying to reach a consensus and get a balance between the needs of businesses to run their business effectively and the needs of employees to take advantage of these provisions, which, as we have all agreed, are important for raising children in the most supportive and effective way possible.
</p>

<a name="60309-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>The issue of the extension from 28 to 56 days is pretty persuasive. Employers do have a concern about managing maternity leave and, particularly at the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC361"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC361</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

point when women return from maternity leave, they can be uncertain about when an employee will return. The experience of many businesses is that, when a woman wishes to return early, the current 28-day notice does not give the business enough time to make the necessary arrangements, particularly when that includes notice to a temporary employee taken on to cover the maternity leave absence. That is why we were persuaded that it would be right to extend the period from 28 to 56 days.
</p>

<a name="60309-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>Obviously, it is a matter of achieving a realistic balance between the needs of women and their employers. The regulations are subject to consultation and, clearly, we will consider those in due course. But ultimately our view is that this is a very satisfactory outcome of these discussions, as it still enables the woman to give notice in due time and enables her to plan that, while also enabling the employer to make such arrangements.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="60309-38_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   I thank the Minister for his reply. Those were exactly the points that we sought to clarify. However, if the Government have conceded that the issue is important, why cannot it be on the face of the Bill rather than being left to secondary legislation? If the provision were put in the Bill, in theory it could be acted on faster than if we had to find a slot to debate regulations.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="60309-38_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   The noble Baroness will see from the draft regulation that there is an amendment to the current regulations. It seemed much more straightforward to make an amendment to the current regulations; after all, it gives more flexibility in future. We have already talked about issues relating to flexibility. I should have thought that it was more sensible to consider how experience relates to the 56 days: after a certain period of time when there is evaluation of how the new package is going, there might be a requirement to make changes. Being able to do that within regulations gives us flexibility, and so it is the most appropriate way in which to do that.

<a name="column_GC362"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC362</b><br>&nbsp;<br>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>The noble Baroness said: I thank the Prudential and M&G for briefing us on this. The current legislation and guidance from the Department for Work and Pensions requires employers to include annual bonuses and other payments in the calculation of statutory maternity pay. Statutory maternity pay is calculated using the eight-week period up to and including the fifteenth week before childbirth. Individuals whose annual bonus is paid within that period have it included in their calculation. Those who are paid an annual bonus outside that period do not. That results in a number of issues. First, there is an inequality between women in respect of the treatment of annual bonuses in the statutory maternity pay calculation; secondly, there is a potentially significant difference in the amount of statutory maternity pay received by individuals on identical remuneration packages; and, thirdly, there is an unnecessary cost to the Government, and therefore to the taxpayer, as a result of 92 per cent of the statutory maternity pay being reimbursed.
</p>

<a name="60309-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>The significance of the issues raised clearly relates to the size of the bonus payment. I know that we are talking about women on high wages, particularly in the financial services industry, but some of the bonuses paid are quite enormous. For example, someone on a basic salary of &#163;80,000 a year would qualify for statutory maternity pay of &#163;1,384 a week for that six-week period. However, had such a woman received a bonus of &#163;40,000 during the relevant eight-week period, that would be included in the calculation of statutory maternity pay and she would receive &#163;5,539 a week. Clearly that is not in the spirit of the legislation.
</p>

<a name="60309-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>I understand that a significant majority of the money is refunded to employers and that, as large annual bonuses are common only in certain sectors, this issue has not had widespread attention. However, the situation is plainly unfair and does not stand up to financial scrutiny. Should the proposals for statutory paternity pay mirror those currently in place for statutory maternity pay, the issue would become much wider.
</p>

<a name="60309-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>When debating Amendment No. 1, we talked about giving women a real choice. My noble friend Lady Miller and I had huge sympathy with what was being discussed. Some women do not receive a great deal of money and have to go back to work at a vital time when they should be bonding with their children, but here we have a wholly unintended consequence of some women earning an enormous amount of money. The amendment has been tabled to save the Government money. If the Government save money, perhaps they could consider doing other things in those early years.
</p>

<a name="60309-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>I have suggested for consideration an amendment to the Work and Families Bill that would require employers to include a prorated amount of bonus rather than the full amount in statutory maternity payments to women whose bonus falls within the relevant eight-week period. That would reduce the financial disparity between the maternity benefits <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="60309-39_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   I support the amendment. The noble Baroness gave three reasons why the amendment is appropriate. I can add a fourth. It may not come as a surprise to the Minister, but a number of businesses, particularly small ones, have been in the practice of manipulating earnings and the timing of bonuses for people who are to claim maternity pay on the basis that a large amount will come back to the individual from the Government with minimal cost to the employer. It would be in the Government&#039;s interest to take over the administration of the system for small businesses as that would result in it happening less often, but it certainly does happen. I would not be prepared to confess to having done it myself, because that would be entirely inappropriate, but I am well aware that it happens. To say that it is a scam is to use too strong a word, but it is certainly being done to maximise the return to the employee primarily at the cost of the Treasury. Therefore, I am delighted to support the noble Baroness on this amendment.

</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="60309-39_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   This has been a very interesting debate. There is no doubt that the Government have given a great deal of consideration to the matter because the average earnings calculation for statutory maternity pay is an area that causes controversy and debate for both employers and employees. The noble Baroness described circumstances in which a woman could lose out if her earnings had been depressed during the period when the calculation was made or she has missed out on a bonus.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>The Government have talked to experts in the HR and payroll area over a considerable period of time to see whether there is a magic formula that will allow us to work out average weekly earnings that are as fair and simple as possible. The problem, as I am discovering in my time at the Department for Work and Pensions&#151;it is the same with all benefits and the same with the Child Support Agency in calculating how much maintenance should be paid&#151;is that being as fair as possible can often increase the complexity. That is one of the dilemmas here. The proposal, certainly as I see the amendment, would be very complex for employers to handle. I recall the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, about the impact on business. Given that we need to consider that impact at all times, that would be a real concern in relation to the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>In response to the comment by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, about collusion between employer and employee, I can see that there may be circumstances in which that takes place. Large employers must meet 8 per cent of their employees&#039; payments, which one would hope would be some inhibition to such collusive behaviour&#151;clearly one could not condone such behaviour.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC364"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC364</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60309-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>We believe that the changes suggested by the amendment would create additional complications and potentially lead to anomalies. The aim of the average earnings calculation is to arrive at a reasonable reflection of the woman&#039;s earnings during her pregnancy in order for her to receive earnings-related SMP, which is a proportion of those earnings. One aim of the scheme is to keep it as simple as possible for employers to operate and for all to understand how it works, with, I emphasise, the minimum room for disputes. The calculation of a woman&#039;s normal weekly earnings is set out in Regulation 21 of the Statutory Maternity Pay (General) Regulations 1986. In summary, a woman&#039;s average weekly earnings are typically calculated over the eight-week period up to and including the last pay day before the qualifying week. The calculation may differ slightly from that to take into account different pay periods but it will generally take account of the woman&#039;s earnings between the fourth and sixth months of her pregnancy.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>The calculation uses earnings actually paid in a defined period, rather than earnings which might be payable for that period or excluding some earnings but not others. Simply, the reason for that is that it allows employers to avoid complicated rules that might lead to disputes over entitlement. In practice, the amendment would mean that employers would have to examine each payment of earnings paid in the calculation period and work out the period actually covered by each individual payment. If the period covered was more than the eight-week calculation period itself, the payment would have to be divided into daily amounts, and only that part of the payment which fell in the eight-week period could be used to average the woman&#039;s earnings for statutory maternity pay. That illustrates that a good deal of complexity would be added to the calculation.

</p>

<a name="60309-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>Of course, I accept that the aim of the amendment is to ensure that the calculation does not take account of earnings which are untypically high because, for example, of a one-off bonus, or overtime payments or perhaps arrears of pay which happen to be paid in the calculation period. The other side of the coin is dealing with earnings that are untypically low, perhaps because of sickness or other absence. Once one goes into it, one sees how complex the administration could be. We have looked at other ways that this may be assessed. In our consultation in 2002, in the run up to that year&#039;s Employment Act, we explored other means of assessing pay perhaps on the basis of an average over 26 weeks, for example.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>During the latest Work and Families Bill consultation, we worked with the DTI&#039;s advisory group of HR experts and HMRC&#039;s payment and administration group of payroll and software experts and looked at a wide range of suggestions. We have picked up some of them. That has resulted in the changes contained in this Bill: moving to an any-day start for the payment of SMP and MA; the facility for employers to pay SMP on a daily basis, if that fits better with their own payroll arrangements; and the option for a woman to return to work for a few days, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC365"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC365</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as we have already debated, during her maternity pay period to keep in touch, without losing statutory maternity pay.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>That consultation confirmed that there is consensus that the existing calculation provides the best balance between a representative reflection of a woman&#039;s average weekly earnings and a straightforward calculation for employers. I fully accept that there are some who gain and some who lose. The outcome is a little rough and ready. However, on the whole the system works well; it is clear; and it avoids the need for difficult judgment as to what is or is not included in the assessment. On balance, we think it right to keep it as it is.

<a name="60309-39_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   I thank the Minister for his answer. I am slightly disappointed.

First, I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 and deal with Amendment No. 18 later. We deal now with extending the right to request flexible working. Clause 12 amends the Employment Act 2002 in two ways. First, it allows the age of the child to be prescribed by regulations rather than placed on the face of the Bill. Secondly, it extends the right to carers of adults over 18 who meet <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC366"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC366</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

certain prescribed conditions, such as disabled adults. While we very much welcome the second provision, we are rather worried about the first one.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>The Government have stated that they intend through regulations to reinstate the age limit of six years for parents of non-disabled children, and I would like to stop them doing that. The amendment would remove the ability to prescribe an age limit in regulations; it would simply allow any carer of a child under the age of 18 the right to request flexible working.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>This group of amendments has been supported by a galaxy of organisations that have the well-being of children and their families at heart&#151;Working Families, the NSPCC, the National Family and Parenting Institute, the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Mothers&#039; Union, and many others. That is because the need for flexible working arrangements for parents does not stop once the child reaches the age of six. Indeed, parents of older children need the flexibility; in addition, the economic arguments are strong.

<a name="60309-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>While the provisions to extend childcare arrangements through extended schools and the changes in the Childcare Bill that is coming to us soon are most welcome, few parents want their own long working hours to be translated into childcare for their children.

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Making childcare arrangements which fit around the school day can actually be more complex than arranging full-time pre-school care for pre-school children. For example, parents who use the Working Families helpline have reported difficulties with requests to change their shift patterns. I have a couple of examples.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>A single father called the helpline because he had been given six weeks&#039; notice of a change in his hours. He had previously worked from 8.30 in the morning and was asked to work from 7.30. He needed to find childcare which started at 7 o&#039;clock and that was proving impossible. Because his children were over the age of six, he did not have the right to request flexible working. It is extremely difficult to get childcare from 7 o&#039;clock in the morning until the school day begins.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>Another issue arises in relation to parents working at the weekend. A single mother rang the helpline to say she had always worked Monday to Friday at a large supermarket and was now being asked to work Saturdays. As a lone parent, that was impossible for her. She explained that she could not do Saturdays and the supermarket said it could not afford to get in a Saturday worker. Her only option was to leave the job as her child was too old for her to have the right to request flexible working.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The Government have rightly emphasised parents&#039; responsibilities towards their children. Parents need to ensure that children attend school; they offer guidance so that their children can avoid anti-social behaviour. Parents tell us that they want to be present at times of emotional difficulty for their child. Research has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC367"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC367</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

shown that young people of secondary school age are much more likely to truant, get involved with drink, drugs or anti-social behaviour than those of primary school age. Dealing with these problems requires someone who really knows and understands the child. Such behaviour is much better dealt with by a parent than by anybody in loco parentis.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>If a child commits a criminal offence&#151;if it has truanted or received an anti-social behaviour order&#151;a parenting order can be given to the parent or carer. This may include requirements to attend counselling sessions or conditions to ensure that the child does not visit certain places at certain times. Parents can be prosecuted for failing to fulfil such conditions. I think it is only right that if parents are to be penalised for their failures, they should also have the option to adjust their work-life balance in favour of their child&#039;s welfare.

</p>

<a name="60309-39_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>The British Association for Adoption and Fostering has told us that adoptive parents and their children would benefit particularly from any move to extend the right to request flexible working to parents of all children, of whatever age. Some children are adopted only when they are already over the age of six, and, even if the maximum period of adoption leave is taken, their special needs&#151;and, indeed, those of all adopted children&#151;may make it very difficult for both parents or a single carer to return to work full time.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I mentioned earlier that the economic case is strong. The Government have argued that the change in the law introduced in 2003 has had a positive impact, with 22 per cent of parents of children under the age of six requesting to work flexibly over those last two years. Eighty-one per cent of these have had the request fully or partly accepted, and so there is clear evidence of success.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>Such flexibility can be successful and there is a need to extend it. According to the work-life balance survey from the Department of Trade and Industry, 18 per cent of employees with children aged between six and 12 and 15 per cent of employees with children aged between 12 and 16 have made requests to work flexibly. But, of course, unless the Bill is amended by my amendments, they will have no rights in the matter. A recent report from the Equal Opportunities Commission showed that many mothers continue to work part-time beyond the present cut-off point for eligibility to the right to request flexible working&#151;that is, with a child at age six. The proportion of mothers working part-time if their children are of primary school age is 65 per cent&#151;the same as for pre-school-age children&#151;and 48 per cent of mothers with a youngest child aged over the age of 11 also continue to work part-time as their children grow older.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The Government&#039;s strategy is to promote a culture where flexible working is the norm across the workforce. Yet, they say that in the Bill they are proposing to limit the extension of the right to request because of concerns that employers may find it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC368"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC368</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

difficult, despite the evidence of success that I have just cited. I should like to see a change in the working culture of this country that recognises that children&#039;s well-being is an important and relevant consideration in the wider debate about employment matters. The Government say that they are keen to support parents and families. I believe that the single most useful thing that the Government can do is to support parents with the rights that they need and to back them when they go to their employers with a reasonable request to work flexible hours.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 18. Only yesterday, last month&#039;s report by the Women and Work Commission was debated in your Lordships&#039; House at Question Time. One recommendation in it was number 16, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;The right to request flexible working should be extended over time to cover a wider group of employees&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-39_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>I know that the commission was referring not only to women who are carers&#151;to whom the Government have, in the Bill, extended those rights&#151;nor to the mothers of older children; I think that it was referring to women workers in general.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>Amendment No. 18 would extend the right to ask for flexible working to other workers, beyond parents of children, whether the age limit is six or 18, and even beyond carers, as long as they could make a reasonable business case and show that it would contribute to a better work-life balance. The people I have in mind are not just working women but men, too&#151;husbands and fathers. I call to mind a very striking image in the film &quot;Brassed Off&quot;&#151;a film that I very much enjoyed&#151;about the characters in a northern brass band. In the scene that I have in mind, the husband is walking up his front path early in the morning at the end of his night shift at the colliery just as his wife is walking down the path on her way to work. They exchange grunts. That family in the film broke up, to the great heartbreak of both the parents and children.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>That was a fictional family, but too many marriages today are put under the strain of spending little or no time together. The wife works from early in the morning until the afternoon, and the husband starts a little later and works well into the evening. There is no time to work at their relationship, which far too often breaks down. The rate of divorce in this country is a matter of great concern to all of us.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>I also have in mind fathers who leave for work at seven in the morning and arrive home after the children have gone to bed, as well as absent or separate fathers who do not live with the family any more but may want to have flexible hours in order to pick up the child from school on weekdays and do something normal, such as cooking their tea, instead of having to rely on the artificial Saturday afternoon contact meeting sitting in the park or going to McDonald&#039;s. Fathers need an opportunity to form proper parenting relationships with their children.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>I also have in mind carers who fall beyond the definition of carers in the Bill. Several organisations speaking for carers have contacted us saying that they are worried that many genuine carers, whose <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC369"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC369</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

relationship with the cared-for person is beyond the definition, would not get the right to ask for flexible working given to some carers by the Bill. My Amendment No. 18 would deal with that, rather than trying to fiddle about with the definition of a carer.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>I also have in mind the fact that, in this country, we have long working hours and high levels of stress and mental health problems. I think that if people feel that changing their working hours would contribute to their quality of life, reduce their stress and thereby prevent mental illness, they should have every right to ask for it and negotiate a mutually satisfactory arrangement with their employer.
</p>

<a name="60309-39_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>The Equal Opportunities Commission supports this amendment. It has found that Britain&#039;s current flexible and part-time arrangements are failing to meet the needs of working women and men, leaving 5.6 million people&#151;four out of five of Britain&#039;s 7 million part-time workers&#151;working in jobs that do not use their potential. This is grossly wasteful to the economy and it blights the lives of many individuals and their families. So I hope that the Minister will look kindly on these three amendments, which I believe have enormous support in the country. I beg to move.

<a name="60309-40_spnew0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham: </b>   I support the amendment, which seeks a statutory right to ask for flexible working hours where necessary for what I believe are good reasons. I hope not to be unduly repetitive of the cogent remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley.
</p>

<a name="60309-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>I begin with a couple of reflections from where I sit as a bishop in the city of Nottingham and the county of Nottinghamshire. I have a lot of contact with families through 300 churches and 72 Church schools, through the organisation, Family Care, which is our adoptive agency, and through a very good director of education. I am in regular contact with the children&#039;s adviser and with an active Mothers&#039; Union, which is involved intimately with family life. It is from that basis that I make these reflections.
</p>

<a name="60309-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>We talk about the importance of parenting, and on many occasions the Government have stressed&#151;we are grateful to them&#151;how important it is. If they accepted the amendment, that would signal to parents and employers how seriously they take parents&#039; responsibilities to their children up to the age of 18, even if they are working.
</p>

<a name="60309-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>In several surveys conducted by many organisations, such as the NFPI, again and again parents have indicated their concerns about managing work and family commitments. Giving the right to ask for flexible hours would give parents of all children the opportunity to choose to have time with their children and with each other, thus strengthening the marriage as well as the home and the family. It would also enable them to continue in employment and provide for the family, rather than depend increasingly on 24/7 childcare by others.
</p>

<a name="60309-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>If parents are to be held legally accountable for truancy, as is currently the case&#151;for example, if a child is missing school regularly&#151;they should have the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC370"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC370</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

right to renegotiate their hours with their employer so that they can go to work earlier or later to collect a child from school.
</p>

<a name="60309-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>Increasing numbers of children are now from single-parent homes, where there is no extra support from a partner, and that adds stress to the home environment and relationships. Again, flexible working hours are required to help single parents juggle the demands of parental, work and domestic requirements. Obviously, the hours would have to be agreed with the employer and would not be totally flexible&#151;we realise that. Other employees would soon get pretty annoyed if single parents took off for any reason, substantial or insubstantial.
</p>

<a name="60309-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>Many children find themselves in step-families and can take time to readjust and settle. In that regard, the parents need time and space to help the children to settle into the new structure and life patterns.

</p>

<a name="60309-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>New extended schooling, which was referred to a moment ago, meets the needs not only of single parents but, increasingly, of two parents at work. In this case, creative measures of employment hours need to be established to enable such households to meet the needs of a growing family and to allow couples time to sustain their own relationships.
</p>

<a name="60309-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>We have heard of the focus on educational testing and, regardless of its merits, it has brought pressure into children&#039;s lives. Again, parents need to help them through that. The worrying social phenomena have been alluded to. Increasingly, children suffering from stress and depression are having very early intervention medication. There are issues of obesity, the high rate of teenage pregnancy and the seduction of drugs and alcohol. In all those, parents need to give help at the time of need through a flexible right to negotiate.
</p>

<a name="60309-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>An overall statement is that no one can replace a &quot;good enough parent&quot;. In others words, the provision of appropriate adults or in loco parentis figures is never quite the same as the parent who can most adequately meet a child&#039;s biological, psychological, sociological, emotional and spiritual needs. As I alluded to earlier, flexible working hours for parents may seem to be another tack to the provision already being made available by extended schooling&#151;that is, the current government initiative in schools to plug the gaps for families that need extended childcare. Personally, I feel that such initiatives need to be tempered, and the amendment attempts to do exactly that. It gives power and responsibility back where it belongs&#151;with the parents.
</p>

<a name="60309-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>The Government are rightly concerned about the importance of parenthood, and we all applaud the government stance on that. I understand that they are soon to announce a campaign emphasising the importance of parental involvement with children&#039;s education and one relating to family meal times. I believe that to give the right to ask for flexible hours, right up to a child reaching the age of 18, gives parents of all children the opportunity to choose to have time with their children and for each other, as well as <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60309-40_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   I wholeheartedly endorse everything that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham have said about the importance of parenthood, supporting families and good quality time that parents have with their children. We very much identify and have sympathy with the aims behind the amendment but we also have some concerns. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, made a very strong case, which has been promoted by a group of 13 family and children&#039;s lobby groups. I think that she described them as a &quot;galaxy&quot;, and indeed they are.
</p>

<a name="60309-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>Extending the right to carers of all children could provide much-needed support for older children, particularly, for example, teenagers who suffer from mental health problems. The national charity, Young Minds, has stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;There is deeply worrying evidence of a dramatic deterioration in teenage mental health&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>Researchers at the Institute of Psychiatry have reported that behavioural problems have doubled and that emotional problems have increased by 70 per cent in 15 year-olds over a 25-year period.
</p>

<a name="60309-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>As the right reverend Prelate has already mentioned, eating disorders, sadly, form a high proportion of teenage mental stress, with anorexia affecting two out of every 100 teenagers. It is 20 times more common in girls than in boys. Overall research into the mental health of children shows that 20 per cent of children have mental health problems but that fewer than half get any help with those problems. They rely very much on the support of their parents. We have already heard in earlier debates that 90 per cent of young offenders have a mental health problem when they are children, and most of those problems are apparent at the age of seven&#151;an age beyond the cut-off suggested by the Government for flexible working.
</p>

<a name="60309-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>Can the Minister say whether the Government have received representations from children&#039;s mental health groups on flexible working or whether they have undertaken any of their own research into how flexible working may help with the care of such children? Indeed, could the parents of children suffering these problems come under the definition of &quot;carer&quot;? I should be interested to hear the noble Lord&#039;s views.
</p>

<a name="60309-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>As I highlighted on Second Reading, family is a crucial building block of a stable and prosperous society. The lack of a proper family structure is a sure path to poverty; I mean poverty in all senses of the word, not just economical but emotional as well. There is no doubt that the request for flexible working to date has been a success, a fact supported by the CBI employment trends survey. But many large and small businesses now extend the right to flexible working to all their employees. As I said on Second Reading, flexible working is almost an area where business is ahead of legislation.

<a name="60309-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>The Conservative Party feels that it is time for a detailed and wide-ranging debate on the whole issue of flexible working. It goes way beyond the consultation that the Government have had. As such, we think it should not be rushed. We would like to see how the proposed extension to carers works first. One of the consequences&#151;which I am sure is not intended&#151;of the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, may be that although we now have the original right to request flexible working and we extend it to children up to 18 and add it to carers, we leave a small part of the work force with no right to request flexible working. It leaves them feeling very put upon and could lead to an unhappy working environment. Increased rights for parents and carers often mean burdens on employers and other employees. While the current system extends the flexible work right, it also adds regulatory burden. It is particularly hard on small businesses.
</p>

<a name="60309-40_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>We must be careful to ensure that the right balance is struck between the family life of the employer and employee and between flexible working and viable business practices. I very much welcome the noble Baroness&#039;s amendments. I hope that this has been a start to an open and frank debate surrounding the issues of flexible working and the potential benefits it holds for everybody, in addition to the fine line that needs to be held to achieve it.

<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="60309-41_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   I strongly support particularly the amendment to allow parents flexibility in providing for their child up to the end of childhood. I recall, in 1999, sitting in a Centrepoint hostel with a 16 year-old and a 17 year-old girl and hearing from them that their mother was with a new partner and that they had been pushed out of their home. Where a mother is trying to build a new relationship and wants to hold on to her new partner and her children and perhaps is also struggling to keep a job, it may be helpful if she has this possibility of flexibility. It is a particular concern of mine after meeting many homeless young people aged 16 to 20. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, referred to the sculpting of an infant&#039;s brain by its relationship to its mother. That process re-emerges in adolescence. It is an opportunity to deal with some of the problems, but adolescence is also a time of revolt. In adolescence, children move from the close attachment that one hopes they formed in early childhood with their peers and towards a special person of their own. It is natural and normal for children to revolt in that period. It requires such sensitivity on the part of the parent, who continues to love their child and to demonstrate that they are there for them. But they also have to let them gradually stand on their own two feet. I strongly support the amendment and look forward to the Minister&#039;s response.
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="60309-41_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   This has been an interesting debate. Like other noble Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, for allowing us to have it. She was very persuasive. I was grateful for her <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC373</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

remarks on the success of the flexible working law so far. She was very clear about some of the issues around family&#151;some of the stresses and how a flexible approach to working may enable parents to be able to relate more to their children. The right reverend Prelate and the noble Earl as well as the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, expanded on that theme.
</p>

<a name="60309-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>Noble Lords will know that I have ministerial responsibility for the Child Support Agency. Whatever the issues around the administration of the CSA&#151;or even its IT programme, which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, referred to&#151;at the heart of the CSA&#039;s problem is the fact that they are dealing with parents who often refuse to behave responsibly to each other, with the child being the loser. The more we can do to encourage parents to behave responsibly towards their children, the less likely that we will need the CSA, and the less likely that we will see some of the consequences of family breakdown. So there is no disagreement between any of us.
</p>

<a name="60309-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>I am particularly interested in the debate about mental health issues. If one looks at the instance of workplace ill health, there is no question that mental health issues have become the number one problem. They have overtaken back pain and other musculoskeletal diseases, and therefore it is a matter of great concern. As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, suggested, it is clear that good employers are focused on tackling these issues, and I can point to a number of companies and public sector organisations who have very good occupational health services, where, the moment an employee has issues of stress, they are referred to occupational health and there is an attempt to deal with the problem right at the start, rather than allowing it to fester. Flexible working may well be one of the answers to how we deal with stress. There is no doubt that there is much more that can be done.
</p>

<a name="60309-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>Any employee now has the right to ask to work flexibly, regardless of whether they have a statutory right to do so. The statutory right is a significant right to which the employer must respond in due process. It is possible for an employee to appeal to ACAS or an employment tribunal if they are dissatisfied with the approach taken by the employer. I suspect that the next amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, will come back to this issue, but I refer to it because we need to be clear that it is not simply a question of an employee having the right to ask for flexible working. Once that is done under the provisions of statute there is due process to be followed, and therefore it is a serious issue for an employer; it has to be taken seriously. That is why one has to recognise that seeking to extend flexibility has a consequence for business. Given that the Bill attempts to straddle the line between the needs of business and the needs of employees, we have to be very cautious before we enter into further commitments that might have a knock-on impact on business, which it is then unable to support. Keeping the consensus is very important here.
</p>

<a name="60309-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>From that, noble Lords will gather that I support what the Government have described as a targeted approach to extending flexible working. In 2002, we <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC374"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC374</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

asked the Work and Parents Task Force, chaired by Professor Sir George Bain, to examine how parents&#039; desire for more flexible patterns could be met in a way that would be compatible with business efficiency. In order to ensure employer support, the task force recommended that a duty to consider flexible working based on existing best practice should be introduced cautiously. The aim was to allow both employers and employees to become familiar with the legislation and to evaluate how it worked in practice.
</p>

<a name="60309-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>The task force acknowledged the difficulty in setting an age limit. It recommended that the law should be targeted at people with young children, setting the age limit at six to cover the key stages of birth and starting school. It also suggested that the age limit should be set at 18 for parents of disabled children in recognition of the particular challenges that they face.
</p>

<a name="60309-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>We made a clear commitment to keep under review how this was working and what more could be done. In the Government&#039;s Work and Families: Choice and Flexibility consultation paper, we asked what more could be done to help families to find working hours to match their caring responsibilities. The consultation responses highlighted that a key factor in the success of the law has been its targeted, rather than blanket, approach, enabling employers to manage and grow flexible working in their individual organisations.
</p>

<a name="60309-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>The retention of that principle is important to employers, as they expressed concerns about managing requests from a wider section of the workforce&#151;a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. The noble Baroness also made the point that small businesses in particular have stressed that their resources to meet an increase in demand are inevitably limited. That means that we have to be cautious about widening the scope of the law. Any increase in the scope of the legislation, where an employee has the right for his request to be dealt with by the step-by-step procedure set out in the regulations, must be done sensibly to ensure that the legislation remains a success and that we do not place undue burdens on business.
</p>

<a name="60309-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>Overall, respondents to the work and families consultation considered that carers should be the priority in any extension of the law. We have gone down that path. In maintaining a targeted approach, we think that we will retain employer support, which has been so critical to the success of the law so far. With the knowledge, based on experience to date, that it is likely to stimulate opportunities to work flexibly, we will provide employers with the ability to manage requests.
</p>

<a name="60309-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>I end by commenting on two points that were raised during the debate. First, I turn to the definition of a carer. I understand that the third amendment in this group is intended to enable as wide a definition as possible. I say to the noble Baroness that we are keen to adopt as broad a definition as is sensible and we are consulting on the possibilities. We are listening to stakeholders and will be taking their views into account. We want to ensure that the definition is easy <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC375"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC375</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and clear to understand for both employers and employees. It is very important that the law is straightforward in this regard.
</p>

<a name="60309-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>Secondly, I turn to the question of mental health in relation to teenagers in particular and children in general. I do not have with me the answer to the question raised by the noble Baroness but I shall see whether I can find anything. However, it is worth making the point that parents of children under the age of 18 with mental health problems can be covered if they fall within the definition of &quot;disabled&quot;. In this context, that means that they are entitled to a disability living allowance within the meaning of Section 71 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. It may not go as far as noble Lords wish, but I hope that it will provide some comfort in relation to parents who are experiencing extreme stress if they are dealing with a highly disturbed teenager, as described by noble Lords.
</p>

<a name="60309-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>In conclusion, I do not think that anyone here has any problem with the general principle raised by the noble Baroness, but we think that a targeted approach, working cautiously and getting support from business is probably the best way forward.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="60309-41_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I thank the Minister for his reply and, in particular, I thank the right reverend Prelate and others for their support for the amendments. We have to bear in mind that, as it stands, this is quite a weak right. If an employer is not convinced by the business case, there is nothing to force him to give flexible working to any employee.
</p>

<a name="60309-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>At Second Reading I gave an excellent example of where business is, indeed, ahead of legislation, as the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said. I think that best practice is excellent but sometimes government have to take a lead and pull people along to make them adopt best practice. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, expressed her concern that a small part of the workforce might be left behind, but they would not be if my Amendment No. 18 were passed. What concerns me is that the state is gradually taking on more and more responsibility for children, and that is the wrong approach. It is better to help parents do it for themselves. These amendments would be one of those measures.

<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>The statutory right backs up the employee with an appeals process if the employer turns them down unreasonably. I accept that a lot of people who do not have the statutory right can still go to their employer, but the fact that they are backed up by a procedure makes that right more important. It is important to get a balance between the needs of the employer and the employee, and none of us want to put an undue burden on business, but I would refer the Committee to the statistics: 87 per cent of businesses surveyed by the CBI have reported that the existing law has had either <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60309-42_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   Does that not show the benefit of moving in this targeted way, if we are in a position where business is giving generous support? We are now extending the flexible request right to carers. Hopefully we will keep business with us. Does the noble Baroness not agree that an incremental approach has some benefits?
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="60309-42_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I like to frame legislation based on evidence, and here we have a clear piece of evidence that the law, since it was changed in 2002, is having a beneficial on employees and on businesses. I see no reason why we should not move forward even further, given the major problems we have with some of our young people and the need to have their parents there to help them. The Government&#039;s own Work-Life Balance Challenge Fund revealed that 81 per cent of workplaces with flexible working policies have reported actual financial savings. 68 per cent reported a reduction in staff turnover, 50 per cent a reduction in absenteeism, and 50 per cent reported improved productivity.
</p>

<a name="60309-42_para0"></a>

<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="60309-42_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley </b>   moved Amendment No. 19:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>Page 10, line 22, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>


<p class="tabletext">

<a name="amdtpar_0"></a>&quot;(   )   In subsection (5) after paragraph (b) insert &quot;, and

<br>
(c)   an annual review of the impact of such applications on employees making applications under this section, including on those employees whose applications are refused.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_85"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of this amendment is to provide for an annual review of the right to request legislation and its impact on employees, particularly where an application for flexible working is refused. In other words, I want to provide even more evidence. If there is evidence that there has been a detrimental effect on families of unreasonable refusals of the request for flexible working, perhaps in future that would stimulate a debate on the role of employment tribunals and whether they need to be strengthened when they are considering complaints under the Act.
</p>

<a name="60309-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>The 2002 Act introduced a number of employers&#039; duties with regard to the applications. Those duties are to deal with the applications in accordance with the regulations, and to only refuse the application on a number of specified grounds, or if they have incorrect facts. Section 80AH of that Act makes provision for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC377"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC377</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

complaints to employers&#039; tribunals if a request is not agreed between the employer and the employee. However, the complaint to an employment tribunal can only be made on the grounds that the employer has failed to comply with the regulations setting out how he should consider the request, or that the application was rejected on the basis of incorrect facts. In practical terms, that means employment tribunals can look only at the procedural issues and cannot look at the business case behind the request. When making a request for contract variation under the Act, the employee is expected to explain the effect of the request on the employer and how such an effect might be dealt with, but there is no corresponding onus on the employer to demonstrate the business case for refusing the request.
</p>

<a name="60309-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>An employee has very limited grounds for complaint to a tribunal. Tribunals cannot question the commercial validity of the employer&#039;s decision, nor rule on the merits of that decision. Furthermore, even if an employment tribunal finds that the procedures are not being correctly followed, the compensation available is very small. The problem is that that situation leads to a number of dual claims, both under the right to request legislation and, at the same time, under the sex discrimination legislation. Women who want to work flexibly may be able to bring the claim of indirect sex discrimination against their employer under the Sex Discrimination Act, and it has been successfully argued that, because women tend to have more childcare responsibilities than men, insisting that they work long or unsocial hours is actually indirect sex discrimination. Tribunals looking at cases of sex discrimination are able to look into the business case and to make much higher compensation awards, so why should flexible working tribunals not be able to do exactly the same?
</p>

<a name="60309-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>The options open to men to bring sex discrimination claims are much more limited. Fathers are both less likely to ask for flexible working in the first place, and, if they ask for it, they are less likely than mothers to get it. Working Families and the TUC undertook some research in August 2004, when the right to request had been in place for a year. The research showed that 46 per cent of women requesting flexible working were successful compared to only 35 per cent having their requests rejected; yet for men only 20 per cent were successful and 47 per cent were rejected. That finding has subsequently been reinforced by research from the DTI. The annual review I am proposing would gather the information and highlight any problems, and its findings might lead to the Government concluding that flexible working rights need to be brought into line with those on sex discrimination. I beg to move.

<a name="60309-42_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, does exactly what it says on the tin. It enables the Secretary of State to review the impact on employees of the right to request flexible working applications, including the impact on those whose application is refused. The noble Baroness has highlighted the concerns of the Working Families group, which I am sympathetic to. I am <br>&nbsp;<br>

greatly concerned about their fears, which the noble Baroness has already mentioned, that fathers are both less likely to request flexible working arrangements than mothers, and are more likely to have their requests rejected.
</p>

<a name="60309-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>While understanding the aims behind the amendment, however, we have been arguing throughout the whole of Committee about the need not to over-burden business with regulation as a result of promoting family-friendly issues, and to a degree the same must be true of government. It may be that an annual review would be too onerous, and that there are better measures the Government could use to consider this issue without recourse to primary legislation. For example, the current consultation on the regulations could include representations on this issue, and the Government could respond to them when they publish the consultation results. But I support the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, in her desire to evaluate the effectiveness of these measures on the whole work-life balance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="60309-42_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   Although the Government do not support the amendment, I hope I can reassure the noble Baroness that we are indeed committed to the kind of review that she wishes to see. There is no question that it is important to monitor and evaluate the impact of legislation to ensure it is achieving its purpose.
</p>

<a name="60309-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>We have put a comprehensive monitoring strategy in place. To serve as a baseline before the law came into force, we carried out two work-life balance surveys, one on employees and one on employers. These addressed actual working practices, as well as attitudes towards work-life balance and the new flexible working law. After the introduction of the law, we commissioned two stand-alone surveys to evaluate awareness and uptake of flexible working, and we have just started fieldwork on Work-Life Balance 3, which will look at the impact of the flexible working law. The intention is that we will bring together all the evidence in the summer, and we will be publishing a compendium on flexible working. It will provide an analysis of the evidence of the impact of the law on both employees and employers, and will draw upon the evidence produced not only by the Department for Trade and Industry, but also from all our stakeholders. I hope that work will inform further debate.
</p>

<a name="60309-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The noble Baroness had some interesting comments to make about the current law as it relates to flexible working and recourse both to employment tribunals and to complaints under the Sex Discrimination Act. The evidence we have so far is that the law is working well. My understanding is that the overwhelming majority of requests, nearly 90 per cent, are agreed; indeed, that almost a quarter of parents with children under six have asked to work flexibly. About 605 cases have so far been referred to tribunals: 64 have been heard, of which 20 have been successful and 44 unsuccessful; 232 were settled by ACAS before tribunal; 185 were withdrawn or settled privately; 31 were dismissed at hearing or otherwise not taken forward; and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC379"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC379</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

93 cases are still pending. I do not have figures to hand regarding the Sex Discrimination Act, but I will try and find them and let the noble Baroness know. It seems that so far the legislation is working pretty well.
</p>

<a name="60309-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>The noble Baroness referred to the business grounds for rejecting an application. As I said in our earlier debate, it is no light thing for an employer not to deal with this issue in a proper, sensible way. Most employers I know do not want to go to an employment tribunal. I agree with the last point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, when she said that many of our most successful companies have adopted flexible working practices. That is absolutely right. Whether it is a question of flexible working, health and safety or healthy work, I am convinced that the best companies know that investment in those areas produces a much more productive, happier and contended workforce; higher productivity; and higher profits. There is no question that we want to encourage that, but there is a balance to be drawn between encouragement and statutory responsibilities. We think that we have drawn the right balance here. I realise I am straying back on to the last group of amendments.
</p>

<a name="60309-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>With regard to the question of evidence on how flexible working has gone so far, I hope that, although we do not want to go down the path the noble Baroness has raised, I have convinced her that we are monitoring and evaluating, and we will be producing something in the summer on this subject.

I am also grateful to the Minister for describing the monitoring processes that are in place. Would the Government consider strengthening the powers of the tribunals if evidence emerged that businesses were dragging their feet? I accept that it is better to do this by encouragement, but, as well as an enormous number of very good employers out there, there are a few maverick employers who are really awful. One hears terrible stories of workers who are afraid even to ask for their statutory rights for maternity or paternity leave, for example, for fear that the next time there is some downsizing, they will be the people to go first. Would the Government consider strengthening those powers if it emerged that it was the only way to make certain that businesses fall into line?

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>After Clause 12, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_7"></a><br>
&quot;ORDINARY PATERNITY LEAVE-DURATION AND FLEXIBILITY

<br>
(1)   Section 80A of ERA 1996 (entitlement to paternity leave: birth) is amended as follows.


<br>
(2)   In subsection (3), for &quot;at least two weeks&#039; leave&quot; substitute &quot;at least four weeks&#039; leave&quot;.


<br>
(3)   In subsection (4), for &quot;a period of at least 56 days&quot; substitute &quot;a period of at least 182 days, and of no more than 365 days&quot;.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_92"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I also speak to Amendment No. 22, which is grouped with it. This amendment has been suggested to us by the Citizens Advice Bureau and is supported by a galaxy of organisations, including the GMB, the Mothers&#039; Union, the T&GWU, Fathers Direct and the Women&#039;s Budget Group. First, it would increase the entitlement to ordinary paternity leave, which is set out in regulation, from the current level of two weeks to at least four weeks with the potential to increase it further through revised regulations. Secondly, it would extend the period during which such leave has to be taken from the current very restricted period of eight weeks after the birth to a minimum of six months and a maximum of 12 months after the birth, the period to be set in regulations.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>The amendment would partially address two out of three concerns in respect of ordinary paternity leave&#151;that it needs to be better paid, of longer duration and more flexible in terms of how it can be taken. Allowing fathers to take ordinary paternity leave during the first six months after the child&#039;s birth would meet the Government&#039;s declared intention to provide more support and more choice in the first year of a child&#039;s life.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>The amendment would surely increase the terribly low uptake of ordinary paternity leave from the current level of about 17 per cent. A similar amendment could be made in relation to adoptive parents. Two out of three fathers would support this proposed change, especially if it were combined with an increase in pay.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>Amendment No. 22 would reduce the current grossly disproportionate notice period for taking ordinary paternity leave. Again, a similar amendment could be made in relation adoptive parents. Currently, would-be fathers must give their employer the same amount of notice that expectant mothers must give of their intention to take maternity leave&#151;by the fifteenth week before the expected week of the child&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC381"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC381</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

birth. The amendment would bring the notice period into line with that required by law for taking paid holiday&#151;two weeks&#039; notice for each week of paid holiday to be taken&#151;so that two week&#039;s notice would be required to take one week of paternity leave, and four weeks to take two weeks of paternity leave.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>A recent report by the Citizens Advice Bureau, <i>Hard Labour</i> <i>- Making maternity and paternity rights at work a reality for all, </i>demonstrates that awareness of the right to paternity leave is poor among low paid workers, and many would-be fathers do not realise that they have to give 15 weeks&#039; notice until shortly before the birth and then find that they have lost their right, realise that it is too late and do not take their leave. Too many employers are taking advantage of a worker&#039;s failure to give the full 15 weeks&#039; notice to deny paternity leave.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>It is worth noting that the Government have indicated that the notice period for taking up to six months of additional paternity leave will be only &quot;two months&quot;&#151;half that currently required to take just one or two weeks of ordinary paternity leave. That is not very logical. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="60309-43_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   Many Members of this Committee also took part in the Children and Adoption Bill earlier this Session. The discussions during that Bill highlighted the important role that a father plays in a child&#039;s nurture and development. Research has shown that the stability provided by the involvement of both parents often gives children the grounding and confidence to be bold, take risks and develop into well-rounded individuals. The Equal Opportunities Commission has provided research that suggests&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said&#151;that 70 per cent of people questioned agreed or agreed strongly that having time off work when a baby is born would change the role of fathers within the family for the better. I completely agree, particularly when we look at the important work into attachment. There can be no doubt that we welcome the extended paternity rights and provisions that the Bill makes.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, would take the provisions further. She mentioned the results of the EOC/ICM poll that one in three fathers would have liked to have taken more time off at the time of birth and more than two-thirds of fathers supported increasing time off to four weeks, as proposed by the amendment. Also, more than nine in 10 fathers working as employees currently take leave from work during their baby&#039;s first eight weeks. Those figures have helped support the case for the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>However, we are aware of the additional burden that the Bill already places on businesses, especially small businesses. The EOC itself recognises that these changes are good only if they are also good for business. Indeed, I am interested that the EOC survey also stated that only 28 per cent of fathers said that they would take leave at the current level. That does not bode well for the proposed take up of the extended options suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, in Amendment No. 21.

<a name="60309-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>Many lobby groups have called for more government support to coincide with the changes that the Bill produces. The CBI has already been critical of the Government for failing to meet their commitments to better regulation and lightening the burden on business, while the Federation of Small Businesses, for example, has concerns over the current provision for new paternity leave provided for by the Bill and how it will actually work in practice, citing serious concerns that the Government have not given this sufficient consideration. No one doubts&#151;least of all me&#151;the important role that a father plays in the life of his family. However, we need to consider these amendments as part of a wider balance between families and work, employers and employees. I reiterate the comments of my right honourable friend Theresa May in another place that:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;There is no point in being family-friendly if we are not job-friendly&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 5/12/05; col. 656.]</p>

<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="60309-43_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, for tabling these amendments and giving us the opportunity to discuss these issues, and for the contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. As was explained, the amendments would extend the period of existing paternity leave available to the father immediately after the birth from two weeks to four, and increase the period during which it may be taken to between six months and a year. They would also limit the notice periods prescribed in legislation to no more than two weeks for each week of paternity leave to be taken. Therefore, the notice period for two weeks&#039; paternity leave would be reduced from 15 weeks before the expected week of birth to no more than four weeks. 
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>When the Government introduced paid paternity leave as a result of the Employment Act 2002 it was rightly hailed as an important milestone. For the first time the law recognised the role played by fathers in the upbringing of new children. As the Committee will be aware, the Bill seeks to build further on this recognition, and clauses introducing a right to additional paternity leave and pay are being considered separately by the Committee.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>I will deal first of all with the question of the two weeks of paternity leave. Paternity leave is, of course, still a relatively new right. We have been extremely pleased by the fact that many thousands of employees have made use of it. Recent survey evidence from the Equal Opportunities Commission, extensively quoted in this debate, found that around nine out of 10 fathers take time off work to spend with a new child, and that more than two-thirds of fathers currently take up the paternity entitlements available to them. That is slightly at odds with the evidence quoted by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. Survey evidence to be published by the Government in the next few weeks is expected to confirm similarly high levels of uptake.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>The new entitlement was structured following very careful consultation with stakeholders, including businesses. We took the view then that the maximum period of two weeks struck the right balance between the needs of employers and employees, and we remain <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC383"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC383</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of that view now. However, it is not just the Government&#039;s view that two weeks is about right. Well over half the fathers in the EOC study said that they were satisfied with the amount of leave that they had taken around the time their child was born, and a fifth said that they were very satisfied.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a> Two weeks off work soon after the time of the birth allows a father to provide support to both the mother and new child at the time they most need it, and to begin to play his important part in the child&#039;s upbringing from the earliest opportunity. We know from research that many fathers actually take more time off work, combining the statutory two weeks with other entitlements, such as annual leave. On top of that, eligible fathers have a right to 13 weeks&#039; unpaid parental leave, which provides them with the flexibility to take extra weeks once the child is more than 8 weeks old. It can be taken until the child is five years old. It is absolutely necessary to balance the needs of employees with those of the businesses that employ them. The maximum statutory entitlement reflects that sensible balance, and the needs and views of those who contributed to the consultation prior to the introduction of the new law.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>On the question of the time during which the paternity leave may be taken, the law as it stands allows fathers to take up to two weeks in a single block at any time within 56 days&#151;eight weeks&#151;of the birth of the child. To allow this leave to be taken up to a year later would be to ignore the purpose of those two weeks of paternity leave. The entitlement is provided to allow the father time off work to support the mother and child at the vital time soon after the birth of the child, in recognition of the fact that both are likely to be most in need of that care and support during the first few weeks. To allow the leave to be taken up to a year later would be to fundamentally change the purpose of the entitlement. We are introducing additional paternity leave for those fathers who wish to take leave later on in the first year of the child&#039;s life.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>Allowing up to eight weeks, in the Government&#039;s opinion, allows a sensible degree of flexibility for the employee to choose when best to take the leave. The employer is expected to accommodate the request for those two weeks to be taken at the time that suits the employee. Most employers recognise their responsibilities and play a full part in this process. But to ask them to allow fathers to take their paternity leave over a significantly longer period than the current eight weeks&#151;up to one year after the date of birth of the child as this amendment suggests&#151;would be to place far too great a burden on the employer. Extending the time over which paternity leave can be taken would reduce certainty for employers at a time when we are bringing in other measures to increase it, such as extending the period of notice women must give if changing their return from maternity leave.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>I now turn to the question of notice to be given to the employer. At present, employees need to give their employer notice of their intention to take paternity leave by the 15th week before their baby is due. The amendment would have the effect of reducing that to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC384"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC384</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

no more than two weeks for each week of leave taken. In other words, there would be a maximum period of notice of no more than four weeks for a period of paternity leave of two weeks. The Government&#039;s view is that the current notice requirements are an appropriate balance between the needs of employer and employee, and that the effect of the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness would be to place an unjustifiable burden on employers.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>While eligible employees of course have an entitlement to paternity leave, it is, in our view, only right that their employers are given proper notice of an employee&#039;s intentions so that they can plan ahead and provide cover or make alternative arrangements as necessary. We believe that there should be as much consistency as possible across the various statutory entitlements so that administration is kept as simple as possible. There is therefore a particular benefit to business of having the same notice period for both paternity and maternity leave: businesses do not need to remember different lengths of notice periods dependent on the type of leave taken.
<a name="time_12"></a>
<a name="60309-43_time1"></a><h5>5.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60309-43_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>The point was raised about the provisions that might apply to additional paternity leave and the notice period relating to that. An eight-week notice period for the additional paternity leave will mirror the notice that a woman has to give for going back to work early. Again, there is a logical consistency to that. Employers may not always see the need for such notice periods. Noble Lords should be aware that such an employer is always free to accept a shorter notice period if they wish; indeed, they should in any event accept a notice period shorter than 15 weeks if it is not reasonably practicable for the employee to give the requisite notice. It is also worth noting that there is flexibility for an employee to change his mind about the date of his paternity leave so long as he gives his employer 28 days&#039; notice.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>I am aware that some argue that long notice periods mean that some fathers end up losing their entitlement to paternity leave because they do not realise they need to give notice until it is too late. In fact the evidence does not bear this out. Most fathers will obviously know well before the 15th week before birth that their partners are pregnant and, when those partners are employees, the fathers are likely to know that they are giving notice to take paternity leave. Further, the Equal Opportunities Commission&#039;s survey, <i>Dads and Their Babies: Leave Arrangements and the First Year</i>, published in 2005 and part-funded by the DTI, found that nine out of 10 fathers take time off work to spend with a new child and that over two-thirds of fathers currently take up the paternity entitlements. The same report suggested that levels of awareness were good. Most fathers questioned in the EOC&#039;s survey were aware of their rights before their child was born. However, we will of course continue working with employers, trade unions and others to ensure that the already high levels of awareness of these employment <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC385"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC385</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

rights and responsibilities continue to improve. We all want to ensure that there is an understanding of what is required.
</p>

<a name="60309-43_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>The notice requirements for taking paternity leave were structured following careful consultation with employers, employees, trades unions and others. They reflect an appropriate balance between the needs of all those affected. In conclusion, the length of ordinary paternity leave, the timescale within which it may be taken, and the requirements for notice to be given to employers all reflect a sensible balance between the needs of employee, employer, child and child&#039;s mother. Accordingly, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<a name="60309-44_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I thank the Minister for his comments, and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. I think that we are all agreed that allowing a father time with his child when it is young provides an important opportunity to bond, which has effects years later&#151;long after we have forgotten how cute the baby was when it was first born. But the reason why I have focused on the ordinary rather than the new additional paternity leave is because, at current rates of pay, very few people are going to take that additional paternity leave. More people are likely to take the statutory ordinary paternity leave near the beginning of when the child is born.
</p>

<a name="60309-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>The problem is that the system is so terribly inflexible: you can only take two weeks together or, if you take one week, you lose your second week. Really, what is the problem with taking the second week a little later on? I think that is unreasonably inflexible, but clearly we have a disagreement here. I think we should leave it to couples to decide how they want to take the leave. It might not be unreasonable to suggest linking this amendment with something we were talking about earlier: the father might want to take one day per week for a number of months, while the mother goes back to work for one day per week so she can keep close with her job and smooth her transition back to work.
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="60309-44_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   One can understand the benefits for families of having endless flexibility, but there has to be a balance with the needs of employers. The sort of arrangements that she proposed would be quite difficult for employers, particularly smaller employers, to cope with. We are agreed about the benefits of the arrangements, but it is the practical balance that we are trying to strike. That is where the difference between us lies.
</p>




<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="60309-44_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I think there is not a lot of difference between what we are talking about now and the right to ask for flexible leave for parents of children under six or carers of disabled children up to 18 or adults who have disabilities. There is obviously a disagreement between us on how many people take the ordinary paternity leave&#151;but the figures the Minister is quoting include a combination of people taking a period of ordinary paternity leave and some statutory holiday leave and perhaps some other kind of entitlement as well. The levels of satisfaction that he quoted have a relationship to the rate of pay. People <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC386"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC386</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

are going to be satisfied with two weeks if they are getting only &#163;106 a week for it; they will not necessarily want to take a longer period if that is all that they are going to get.
</p>

<a name="60309-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>We should think about what the purpose of this leave is. When we realise that purpose, we should leave it to the couple to decide when the mother needs support. I accept what the Minister was saying: the purpose of the leave is to support the child and the mother. In the first couple of months the mother might have her own mother with her; but when mother-in-law goes home, that might be exactly the time when the father wants to take paternity leave. So to restrict it to eight weeks may not suit all couples. There is really very little difference to the employer if he takes his two weeks two months further down the track than if he takes it straightaway when the baby is born.
</p>

<a name="60309-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>On the notice period, I really fail to se the difference between ordinary paternity leave and a couple of weeks&#039; holiday. The father is away from work; if he gives a month&#039;s notice that he is going to take two weeks to go to Majorca, it is just the same as if he took two weeks to stay at home and look after the baby. It would be far simpler for businesses to make exactly the same notice regulations apply to taking ordinary paternity leave, especially when it is only two weeks, and to taking that time off to go to Majorca on holiday.
</p>

<a name="60309-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>The Minister said that a man need give only 28 days&#039; notice if he wants to change the dates of his paternity leave. If the employer can manage with 28 days for a change in the dates, why cannot he manage with 28 days&#039; notice for the leave in the first place? That does not make any sense to me&#151;I cannot understand what the difficulty is there.
</p>

<a name="60309-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>The Minister also mentioned that employers are quite free to accept a shorter period of notice than 15 weeks if they are minded so to do. The trouble is that some employers are not doing that and, because of that, some men are losing their right to have that time with their partner or wife and baby. It is a great pity, given that it is little enough entitlement, that people are losing out just because some employers are being bone-headed about it and insisting on 15 weeks&#039; notice&#151;especially when, as I say, 15 weeks is a totally unreasonable period of notice to require.
</p>




<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="60309-44_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Employees do not have a statutory right to take annual leave whenever they like, even if they give good notice. Working time regulations simply require that employees are able to take entitlements, but I think that it depends on contractual issues in each case.

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_8"></a><br>
&quot;ANTE-NATAL APPOINTMENTS

<br>
   After subsection (4) of section 55 of ERA 1996 (right to time off for ante-natal care) insert&#151;


<br>
&quot;(4A)   The Secretary of State shall make regulations entitling an employee who satisfies certain conditions&#151;


<br>
(a)   as to relationship with an expected child, and


<br>
(b)   as to relationship with the expected child&#039;s mother,


<br>
to be absent from work on leave under this section for the purpose of attending ante-natal appointments.&quot;&quot; .</p>



<p><a name="st_101"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 23 establishes a new statutory right of fathers-to-be and other partners of expectant mothers, including female partners in same-sex couples, to paid time off work to accompany an expectant mother to antenatal appointments.
</p>

<a name="60309-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>Under Sections 55 and 56 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 an expectant mother can get time off work to attend such appointments. Antenatal care can include relaxation classes and parent-craft classes. The expectant mother should receive her normal rate of pay in respect of such time off work. For the second and subsequent appointments the employer can ask for proof that she is genuinely going to such appointments, perhaps from the doctor or health visitor.
</p>

<a name="60309-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>However, these rights are limited to women who are pregnant, and there is no legal right for fathers-to-be and other partners to have time off, paid or otherwise, to accompany expectant mothers to antenatal appointments. Yet all the available evidence suggests that allowing fathers paid time off to attend antenatal care not only allows them to support their partners during pregnancy by sharing problems, anxieties and concerns, but increases the likelihood of them taking an active role in the care of their children once they are born. The Government have acknowledged that families benefit from a father being involved in caring for his child from the earliest time, and that that can begin with his attendance at antenatal appointments.
</p>

<a name="60309-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>The DTI good practice guide encourages employers to allow fathers-to-be the flexibility to do that, as it will enable them to be involved with important decisions about pregnancy, birth and care of the baby after it is born. As long ago as January 2003 the Government stated that they were considering whether to allow fathers time off to attend antenatal care. I am disappointed that the Government have not taken the opportunity offered by this Bill to move forward on this point. If the Government are serious about wanting to engender a cultural shift so that fathers play a bigger role in caring for their young children, and we have no reason to doubt that that is the case, they should begin at the beginning and extend the right of paid time off to attend antenatal appointments.
</p>

<a name="60309-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>My amendment would establish such a right and would allow the Secretary of State to make regulations defining who is able to exercise it so as to include not only biological fathers, but also husbands who are not the biological fathers, or partners who are cohabiting who want to take parental responsibility for their <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC388"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC388</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

children. That approach is already taken by the Government in relation to statutory rights to ordinary paternity and adoption leave.
</p>

<a name="60309-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>I hope the Government will bear in mind that many organisations feel that it would be very beneficial to go that little bit further: Citizens Advice, Working Families, the TUC, Fathers Direct, Working Parents Group, Mothers&#039; Union, the GMB, the T&GWU and many other such people. I cannot see that it would be an enormous additional cost burden on businesses because not a lot of time is required for the appointments, and not every father would want to attend them. I hope all new men would want to, because to be closely involved with the birth of their child can give them enormous satisfaction. To see the scan of the baby in the womb provides a great thrill to many young fathers I know, and they have proudly shown me the photographs. Seeing the photographs when the mother brings them home is one thing, but seeing the baby kick in the womb in the hospital is another.
</p>

<a name="60309-44_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>Low-paid fathers in particular cannot afford to take time off unpaid or to take a day&#039;s holiday. People sometimes only have a few precious weeks&#039; holiday which they might want to save for when the baby is born, because ordinary paternity leave is only two weeks. I do not believe that this is an enormous burden, but it might provide some very happy workers who would be happy to stay in their jobs, be more productive and some of the other things that we have described in relation to flexible working. I beg to move.

<a name="60309-45_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has made an extremely impressive case for what she proposes. I strongly support her. Earlier, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, emphasised from his perspective as Minister for the Child Support Agency the vital need to bind fathers into the family. Recently, I was told by a friend that his wife was pregnant, but that his five year-old son did not welcome the news. I am afraid it is inevitable that children feel displaced by new siblings, although that is generally transformed into love, but it is a difficult transformation. Fathers may also be affected in that way. Often they may feel displaced by the new light in the family&#039;s life, but that transition stage passes very quickly. The birth of a child, especially a first child, is a shock. This measure might assist in attenuating the shock and binding the father into the family.

for his family. Indeed, the introduction of additional paternity leave and pay, which are key elements of the Bill, are intended to enable a father to do just that. In recognising that families benefit from a father being involved with his child from the earliest time, we also recognise that this can begin with his attendance at antenatal appointments.
</p>

<a name="60309-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>The Department of Trade and Industry publishes best practice guidance that sets out ways that employers can enable a father to attend antenatal appointments without losing pay: for example, enabling him to make up time on another day. The guidance includes information from employers on approaches they have found to work for them. While we encourage employers to allow expectant fathers to take time off work without losing pay to attend antenatal appointments, we do not believe it would be appropriate to introduce a statutory right to paid time off. That is something which should be agreed between employer and employee.
</p>

<a name="60309-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>This amendment would provide fathers with the same rights as pregnant women to fully paid time off to attend antenatal appointments. The right for pregnant women to take time off to attend antenatal appointments reflects the importance of regular antenatal care to ensure the health and safety of pregnant women and their babies. Ensuring women do not lose pay if they need time off helps to remove disincentives for women keeping appointments that are important not only to their health but also to that of their babies. The provision of such a right is required by the Pregnant Workers Directive.
</p>

<a name="60309-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>While we would agree that it is desirable for fathers to be able to take time off to attend appointments, we need to balance the interests of parents-to-be with their employers and we believe this is best approached through encouraging employer best practice rather than by placing a statutory duty on employers. It is a matter of where the balance should fall and not what we jointly wish to achieve. Accordingly, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="60309-45_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I thank the Minister for his reply and I thank the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, for making a very good point, which I wish I had made, that sometimes fathers feel displaced after the birth of a child as well as older brothers or sisters. If a father is really involved with a pregnancy as it goes along, and in all the preparations for it, he is much less likely to feel displaced within the family after the baby is born. That is a very good point and I thank him for it.
</p>

<a name="60309-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>The Minister says that it might be better to have this done on a best practice basis, rather than on a statutory basis.

<p><a name="st_106"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment may be very simply and shortly explained. The present law, in accordance with the requirements of EU directives, prescribes four weeks&#039; paid leave for every employee. There are eight public bank holidays in England and Wales and eight slightly different ones in Scotland, which the Government seek to add to the employees&#039; entitlement by Clause 13. Assuming a five-day working week, which is largely the norm, adding eight more working days to the existing four weeks&#039; paid holiday means adding an extra 40 per cent to the entitlement to paid leave. It means adding more than an extra working week and a half to the paid leave entitlement.
</p>

<a name="60309-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>It is, in our view, too much of an additional burden to impose on industry and commerce all in one go. However, without diminishing the Government&#039;s manifesto commitment to grant these extra days&#039; holiday, it is vital that they should be phased in at a rate that all employers can more easily absorb in their medium-term business plans. My very moderate amendment proposes that the Government should phase in these extra eight days&#039; holiday, two at a time, over a period of at least four years. That is within the theoretical lifetime of the present Parliament, yet still fulfils the Government&#039;s manifesto commitment. I beg to move.

We understand the intention behind the amendment. The phased introduction of the additional leave entitlement would give longer for business to adjust to the additional costs, and the amendment reflects the proposal put forward by the CBI.

<a name="60309-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>We will consider phasing in the additional leave entitlement when we consult shortly on how to implement the annual leave provisions in the Bill. However, the amendment would pre-judge the results of that consultation. It proposes that the additional leave be phased in through four annual increases in leave entitlement. While this is one possible pattern to phase in the additional leave, it may place an excessive burden on business by changing the rules every year for four years. Before we decide whether the additional leave should be phased in, and over what period, we should consult those affected&#151;both staff and businesses&#151;on what would be most appropriate. That is what we intend to do, and I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

&quot;(   )   The higher sum so specified shall not be greater than 110 per cent of the current maximum amount of a week&#039;s pay immediately prior to the date of the order.&quot;

<p><a name="st_110"></a>The noble Baroness said: We are meant to be finishing in a few minutes. I am quite content to sit until 6.30 but I would not like to go on longer, given that, as Members of the Committee may know&#151;certainly my friends do&#151;that I am a carer, and my mother, who is nearly 98, is waiting for her dinner. My speech is not very long but it is an important issue; as we are in Grand Committee, we will not divide on it. I am happy to speak to it if everybody agrees.
</p>

<a name="60309-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>The amendment would impose a cap on the uprating of redundancy pay which is introduced by Clause 14. The noble Lord will remember that I mentioned that my noble friend Lady Morris and I were somewhat surprised when we saw the clause because we thought it was incongruous. The Minister said that it was there because it was a manifesto commitment. I have to concede that indeed it was a manifesto commitment, so long as you are used to reading the fine print in credit card agreements or holiday brochures. The manifesto says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;The Labour Party has agreed a set of policies for the work place (the Warwick Agreement) and we will deliver them in full&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-45_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>Agreed with whom? It was an agreement with the trade unions. I wonder how many of the voters have ever heard of the Warwick Agreement, let alone know what the Government promised them as the price of their continuing support.
</p>

<a name="60309-45_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>In my opening sentence introducing the amendment, I referred to the &quot;uprating of redundancy pay&quot;. I used those words especially because those four scant words are the sole reference to this provision in the Warwick agreement&#151;whereas the other one, about the eight days, is spelt out. Yet it is on these four words, and the obscure introduction of them into the manifesto, that the Government claim a blank cheque to alter the formula by which redundancy pay has been calculated for the past 40 years, and regularly updated to take inflation into account. The Explanatory Notes do not give any reason for this proposed change in that formula, nor did we get one from the Minister when I raised the issue at Second Reading, save for the fact that, as I have just quoted, it was in the manifesto.
</p>

<a name="60309-45_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>I am not impressed by the fact that the Government, in an apparent act of real self-denial, limit the right to make this increase to just one occasion, because the Government know full well that one Parliament cannot commit or bind a future Parliament. This <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC392"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC392</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government may do it only once&#151;I do not doubt that at all&#151;but all this clause does is to set a precedent which could be prayed in aid at some time in future. There is a suggestion that some changes will have to be made to the basic formula to allow for compliance with yet another EU directive, and obviously we will need to examine this aspect when they come before Parliament under the affirmative procedure. However, what we are concerned with is the provision that the Government can make a one-off increase outside of the inflation proofing formula of an unspecified and&#151;as the Bill currently stands&#151;unlimited amount.
</p>

<a name="60309-45_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>Apart from not giving any explanation of this provision, except to say that it is Labour Party and trade union policy, as mentioned in the Warwick agreement, the Minister also did not comply with my suggestion in the debate that he should tell your Lordships precisely what figure the Government have in mind, or, if nothing has been decided yet, to tell your Lordships what representations they have received. I am, however, most grateful to the Minister for having written to me and to other noble Lords who share my concerns after Second Reading to give further information. He tells me that the Government are consulting with what he calls &quot;key stakeholders&quot; including the CBI and the Engineering Employers&#039; Federation. He did not mention whether he was consulting again with the unions in his letter, but I assume they are definitely included in the current consultation unless the Government are already aware of what amount they are seeking.
</p>

<a name="60309-45_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>We believe that the unions are seeking an increase from the current fully-indexed &#163;290 per week to a possible &#163;400 or &#163;500, or even a staggering increase of 100 per cent, which would make it nearly &#163;600&#151;in other words, &#163;580. The Minister did not deny this when I put that suggestion to him on Second Reading. At this present stage of the legislation, we are therefore being asked for a blank cheque. The questions are how much of an increase are the Government proposing, what is the justification for it, and what are the Government expecting in return for it? Who will be paying for this largesse? Will it be the employer, who, one assumes, will be in some financial difficulty, otherwise why would he be making staff redundant? Or will it be the shareholders in a failed company whose depleted assets will be distributed in this way? Or will it even be, in an extreme case, if an employer is totally insolvent, the taxpayer who will be left to pick up the bill?
</p>

<a name="60309-45_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>In his letter to me the Minister was kind enough to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;I am not prepared at this stage to comment on the timing or amount of any increase, other than to say that l do not expect the limit to be increased dramatically&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60309-45_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>Well, it all depends, as the late Professor Joad used to say, on what you mean by &quot;dramatically&quot;. We have still not been given a substantive explanation as to the reason for this change of a time-tested formula. However, this probing amendment seeks to define &quot;dramatically&quot; by setting a cap to the increase to 110 per cent of the amount of the figure applicable at the time when the Government make the order, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC393"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC393</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which is also to take place on a date the Government have declined to reveal to us. In other words, the Government can add a bonus on one occasion only limited to an extra 10 per cent of the then current figure. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="60309-46_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for moving the amendment, which will again give me an opportunity to try to clarify the position. I hope that my reply will not be too long and that we will all be able to get away in good time.
</p>

<a name="60309-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>I should like to start by outlining why the Government are doing this. I do not think that the provision is out of place in a Bill of this nature. It is right that it was a manifesto commitment to raise the limit, but we should recognise that successive governments have let the relative value of the weekly limit fall in recent years because it is linked to RPI rather than average earnings. That was a particular reason why we are looking for this one-off change.
</p>

<a name="60309-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>The Government are well aware of employers&#039; concerns about the size of any increase to the weekly limit, and I understand the remarks made by the noble Baroness in support of the amendment. However, it is simply too soon to say what the increase will be&#151;I know that this will disappoint her&#151;and indeed when it will be introduced. I cannot tie the Government to a particular figure or timetable today. However, I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that the Government do not expect the increase to be dramatic. I understand that there have been some press reports&#151;they have been referred to&#151;speculating that the limit might be more or less doubled to around &#163;560 per week. Without wishing to restrict the Government&#039;s room for manoeuvre, I suspect that an increase of 10 per cent may be rather closer to the mark than 100 per cent.
</p>

<a name="60309-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>In addition, we have provided in subsection (5) of the clause that any order will be subject to the affirmative procedure, so it is not really the blank <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC394"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column GC394</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

cheque that was suggested. When we have reached a view on how the limit should be reset, the House will have the opportunity fully to debate the order and the new weekly limit. This is an important safeguard that guarantees that any new limit will be properly debated and scrutinised.
</p>

<a name="60309-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>I hope that that additional information has helped the noble Baroness, but I understand that she, like me, will have to await the consultation and the ongoing discussions. The Government will bring forward proposals in due course.
</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="60309-46_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   I thank the Minister for his answer; it was as brief as my explanation of the amendment. At this stage I will seek leave to withdraw the amendment, but I may bring it back on Report. The noble Lord need not look too worried&#151;I am sure that he will not be made redundant.
</p>

<a name="60309-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>It is a serious matter. The noble Lord said that 10 per cent is closer than 100 per cent, as has been rumoured&#151;but it was a rumour from quite a few sources. That is why I put down 10 per cent, which sounded reasonable and close to what the Government might be thinking. In a sense, with the greatest respect to the Minister, it is a blank cheque until regulations and all the rest of it appear. He could hardly make it a negative statutory instrument; that would be completely impossible. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="60309-46_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60309-46_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>I am today announcing an allocation of &#163;37.5 million for the research into use programme, as part of DfID&#039;s new strategy for research on sustainable agriculture. The programme will identify up to 30 research programmes and their findings from DfID&#039;s previous renewable natural resources research strategy, based on their potential to contribute to sustained growth and reducing poverty, and will seek to promote their widespread use in Africa and south Asia.
</p>

<a name="60309-46_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The new strategy is made up of four parts: (i) a new programme to promote the widespread use of research findings from previous work funded by DfID; (ii) four new regional research programmes in Africa and Asia; (iii) new joint programmes with UK research councils; (iv) existing support to international research institutions.
</p>

<a name="60309-46_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>DfID is allocating a total of &#163;l00 million over five years to fund the three new initiatives as part of the strategy, starting in the financial year 2006-07. Funding for the first two financial years, &#163;40 million, is part of the total &#163;255 million DfID announced for all research in these two financial years.

</p>

<a name="60309-46_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>As part of our work on the future Army structure (FAS), the previous Secretary of State for Defence announced on 16 December 2004 (<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, cols. 1795-1800) that there would be a reduction in the number of Royal Armoured Corps and infantry bands within the Army, and that the band of the Light Division would be reduced by 14 posts, bringing it into line with the rest of the line infantry.
</p>

<a name="60309-46_para16"></a>

</p>

<a name="60309-46_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>Asia is changing. In the past few years, it has achieved notable development success, with more people having been lifted out of extreme poverty than at any other time in history. Yet there remain immense challenges.

<a name="60309-47_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Childcare Bill: Vetting of Carers</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="60309-47_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  My right honourable friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families (Beverley Hughes) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>On 19 January 2006 the Secretary of State made an oral Statement to the House about arrangements for vetting people working with children, and for barring those who are unsuitable. A Written Statement on 1 March outlined progress against commitments. In preparation for Report and Third Reading on the Childcare Bill, the following Statement outlines the arrangements for ensuring the suitability of childcare workers.
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><i>Current Ofsted Registration and Process</i>
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a>Childminders and day-care providers for children under eight are required to be registered by Ofsted. The Children Act 1989 requires Ofsted to determine whether someone is &quot;qualified&quot; for registration, and in order to make that determination, Ofsted have to determine that certain people, and premises, are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS70"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column WS70</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

suitable to look after or be in regular contact with children. Section 79B(5A) of the Children Act 1989 states that if a person fails to consent to certain prescribed checks, Ofsted can then deem them to be unsuitable to work with or have regular contact with children under eight. One of the ways Ofsted checks suitability is through enhanced CRB disclosures. A check with the CRB includes:
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>a check against the police national computer records;
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>a check against the Protection of Children Act list (the PoCA list);
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a>a check against List 99; and
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>a check with local police forces, which includes a check against the sex offenders register held by local police forces.
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a>The disclosure includes details of all convictions and cautions a person has including those that, under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, are deemed to have been &quot;spent&quot;. In addition, an enhanced CRB disclosure may include any additional information from the police that the chief constable thinks relevant. This would include cases where a person has not been convicted or cautioned for a sexual offence but is nevertheless required to register with the police.
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a>Ofsted will not grant registration where they have doubts about the person&#039;s suitability, or about the suitability of others connected with an application. Concerns can vary greatly ranging from medical matters, to offences that did not involve children, to offences involving harm to a child. If, after taking into account all the information available Ofsted is concerned about a person&#039;s suitability and the risks to children it will refuse registration. Such refusal automatically disqualifies a person from providing childcare.
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a>The CRB and other checks that Ofsted carries out are part of its robust system for preventing unsuitable people from being registered to provide childcare. Ofsted will always investigate further if they have any concerns about an applicant&#039;s suitability to work with children.
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a>Registered childcare providers employing staff are required, under the Protection of Children Act 1999, to check the PoCA list&#151;and this is done through an enhanced CRB. The registered person of a setting must have rigorous vetting and recruitment processes in place to ensure its staff are suitable to work with children. It is an offence knowingly to employ someone who is disqualified from working with children. The national standards for childcare state that a provider must ensure that any person who has not been vetted is never left alone with children. Ofsted investigates any concerns it is notified of and takes action against a provider, if necessary, to ensure the safety and well-being of children. As part of the inspection process, an Ofsted inspector questions the applicant or registered person about their recruitment processes.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a>It is vital that parents have access to good information about childcare so they can make informed choices and take responsibility for who they leave their child with.
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a>All Ofsted-registered providers have been subject to a range of checks and have a certificate of registration which they are required to display in their setting. Parents can get information from their local authority&#039;s children&#039;s information service (CIS) on which childcare providers, and the services and facilities childminders and day-care centres offer, are listed.
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a>Information services have a key role in ensuring that parents have appropriate information to help them take decisions on which childcare providers are suitable to look after their children. Information services must be able to explain the differences between registered and non-registered childcare and the checks that registered providers and their staff will have undergone. They should guide parents to relevant materials and inform them of the questions they should be asking. The DfES Sure Start booklet <i>Looking for Childcare</i> includes the key points that parents may wish to cover in their discussions with prospective providers. Information services should also be able to inform parents of what they should do if they have any concerns about children&#039;s welfare or safety whether in the childcare context or not.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><i>The Childcare Bill</i>
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a>The Childcare Bill currently before Parliament will place a legal duty on local authorities to provide information to parents or prospective parents on childcare and other services, facilities or publications which may be of benefit to parents, prospective parents, children or young people. We will ensure that the statutory guidance accompanying the Childcare Bill makes this clear to local authorities. In the mean time, we plan to write to local authorities and information services to highlight the importance of supporting parents to make an informed choice about childcare provision.
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a>Further to this the Childcare Bill will complement the Ofsted registration scheme for the registered childcare sector by providing the option of Ofsted registration (which will include enhanced CRB checks as well as List 99 and PoCA checks for staff) to a wider range of childcare providers such as provision for children over eight and nannies.
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a>The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, introduced in the other place on 28 February 2006 will provide the legislative framework for a new vetting and barring scheme. This will extend the current requirements for vetting of people who work closely with children, and provide a new facility to enable those who want to work with children to undertake the vetting process. Individuals will be committing an offence if they seek to work with children where they are barred from doing so. For the first time, individuals, parents and families (including direct payment recipients) will be able to make a &quot;real-time&quot; instant check of whether a prospective employee is barred. This will include the ability to make an instant <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS72"></a>

online check of the barred status of people they are considering employing for activities such as nannying/childcare, care provision, or music or personal tuition.
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a>Under the new scheme, where work, either paid and unpaid, involves frequent teaching, caring for or otherwise working closely with children, the employer will be required to check that their employees are not barred from working with children, and they will be committing an offence and will face penalties if they employ a person so barred. This will include those working in childcare not registered by Ofsted. Parents will not be required to check barred status, as, for example, a parent using a babysitter recommended by a friend may not wish to check the person&#039;s barred status. Parents will, however, be empowered as for the first time they will have the option of checking barred status. This will provide the extra reassurances they need to make informed judgments about their childcare provision.
</p>

<a name="60309-47_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a>The Bill will ensure that there is the right framework to enable parents, employers and others to play their part in working together to ensure children are better protected.

<a name="60309-48_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60309-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a>Last year the international community agreed a comprehensive development plan to help tackle the huge challenges faced by poor countries and poor people across the globe. Political leaders from the G8, EU, Africa and elsewhere made a number of commitments, including pledges to increase aid by $50 billion a year by 2010 and to implement 100 per cent debt cancellation for up to 38 of the world&#039;s poorest countries. Progress is being made, although there is much further still to go, particularly on trade. The Government&#039;s priority is to ensure that commitments made last year are delivered, so that poor people see real improvements in their lives.

</p>

<a name="60309-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a>The report highlights particular achievements. These include: the debt relief already being delivered by the International Monetary Fund; the launch of the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm) by the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Norway, alongside a grant from The Gates Foundation, which will provide $4 billion to fund vaccinations, saving 5 million lives by 2015 and another 5 million after that; the establishment of the UN Peacebuilding Commission to help countries emerging from conflict; and the entry into force of the UN Convention against Corruption to help developing countries recover plundered assets. In Africa, there has been good progress by the African Union towards establishing an African standby force, able to intervene to prevent conflicts at an early stage. Progress is being made in developing a plan to deliver last year&#039;s commitment to provide HIV and AIDS treatment to everyone who needs it by 2010.

</p>

<a name="60309-48_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a>When I announced the security normalisation programme on 1 August last year, I stressed that normalisation could take place only in an enabling environment. I have a non-negotiable duty to protect the safety and security of the people of Northern Ireland. I have subsequently made it clear that if the security situation changes and there is not an enabling environment I will not hesitate to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to safeguard the public in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60309-48_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a>I welcome the IMC&#039;s confirmation that the Government have proceeded with normalisation as promised and that they believe this is consistent with the Government&#039;s obligations to the safety and security of the public.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a>In line with the commitment given in <i>The Future of Rail</i> White Paper, I am today launching a consultation document <i>Proposals for the Mayor of London&#039;s Rail Powers beyond the London Boundary</i>. The Mayor of London is required to promote integrated and economic transport services to, from, and within Greater London. This paper asks for views on whether the Mayor should have the ability to propose changes to rail services within a defined network extending beyond the London boundary, subject to agreed governance arrangements.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a>These changes will include the ability to buy additional services and propose savings on defined routes, to propose limited changes to train stopping patterns on longer distance services and to pay for other enhancements, such as station improvements.

</p>

<a name="60309-49_para2"></a>

<p><a name="wms_st_13"></a>
<a name="60309-49_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_81"></a>I am today publishing a consultation prospectus announcing our proposals for a long-term, strategic, capital investment programme to provide well designed, sustainable 21st-century primary school buildings at the heart of our communities. This uses the additional investment promised by my right honourable friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his Budget last year. This prospectus sets out the objectives of the programme and consults on proposals for meeting them.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a>Our children deserve the best start in life. To that end, we have increased capital investment to unprecedented levels for the benefit of pupils, staff and the community. Building Schools for the Future and academies are already transforming secondary schools. For early years, Sure Start is providing new, modern infrastructure. We have already improved most primary schools, but now turn our attention to their longer-term building needs. It is time to help all local authorities, dioceses and communities to transform their primary schools and primary-age special schools across the country.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a>The programme will enable us to meet a challenging set of objectives.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a>We will rebuild, remodel or refurbish at least 50 per cent of primary schools. Within that, we would hope to rebuild or take out of use, as a minimum, at least the 5 per cent of school buildings in the worst physical condition nationally, and to improve or take out of use the 20 per cent of the worst condition buildings in our most deprived communities.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a>Our primary schools need buildings that support high standards of teaching and learning, personalised learning and inclusion, and the provision of a wide range of services to pupils, their families and local communities, as envisaged in <i>Every Child Matters</i>. We want all primary school buildings to be brought up to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS78"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column WS78</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a good standard, with improvements to, for example, classrooms, kitchens and dining rooms, or sport and arts facilities. We also want every child and family to have access to year-round, 8 am to 6 pm childcare, parenting support, specialist support services, a good range of after-school activities and access to ICT and sports and arts facilities after hours; access to be at their child&#039;s primary school or at a school or venue nearby, with supervised transfer arrangements for children.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"></a>The primary capital programme will help to achieve a number of national strategies that are already under way. It will support particularly <i>Every Child Matters: Change for Children</i>, the White Paper <i>Higher Standards, Better Schools for All </i>and proposals in the Education and Inspection Bill, and the primary strategy. It also brings together the 10-year childcare strategy, workforce strategy, sustainable development action plan, and ICT and extended schools programmes.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_87"></a>An extra &#163;150 million will be available in 2008-09, rising to &#163;500 million in 2009-10. It is expected that investment will remain at that level for around 15 years, subject to future public spending decisions&#151;some &#163;7 billion in total. This could be joined to other capital for primary schools from my department to create a much larger sum for investment. On top of this could be added other eligible investment from central government departments and agencies; local government investment, receipts and prudential borrowing; as well as contributions from the private sector and others. By joining up this funding and targeting it precisely we will achieve the ambitions of this programme.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_88"></a>All local authorities will benefit from capital allocated by a simple, open formula reflecting pupil numbers and deprivation. Devolved formula capital will still be available for primary schools not directly benefiting from this programme.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_89"></a>Authorities will need to set out how they will transform their primary schools over the long term and how they will target local deprivation from the start. My department will support authorities that need help with this planning, and will approve all local plans before releasing funding.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_90"></a>We know that well designed, sustainable buildings can transform how teachers teach and learners learn. We have learned much through developing primary school exemplar designs and propose to use the current design quality indicators and building standards, which should be applied to all schemes.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_91"></a>We must be ambitious in looking at the best models of procurement and construction, if the programme is to achieve significant efficiency and deliver value for money for the taxpayer. We propose the use of local education partnerships (LEPs) where they will have been set up or, where there are no LEPs, other forms of local authority agreements, partnerships or national framework.

<a name="60309-49_head2"></a><h3 align=center>United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_14"></a>
<a name="60309-49_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_95"></a>I am pleased to announce that the United Nations (UN) Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) is being launched officially today, 9 March, in New York. I know that many honourable Members have shown interest in this initiative.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_96"></a>The CERF is a main element of the reforms to the international humanitarian system that I set out in December 2004, and which the UN has since taken forward. The CERF was approved formally by the UN General Assembly in December 2005, as a fund with a medium-term target of $500 million, consisting of a pre-existing $50 million loan facility, with a grant facility of up to $450 million to be built up by donor contributions over five years. The CERF will enable UN humanitarian agencies to provide a more predictable and timely response to emergencies by ensuring initial funding from the grant facility is available immediately to support a rapid response to, for example, natural disasters or sharply deteriorating conflicts, and to address critical humanitarian needs in underfunded chronic or slower-onset emergencies&#151;so-called &quot;forgotten crises&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_97"></a>The UK has been at the forefront of efforts to lobby donors for political support for, and contributions to, the CERF. As at 6 March 2006 a total of over $192.7 million has been pledged by 22 countries and one private-sector organisation. The UK is the single largest donor, with a contribution of &#163;40 million (about $70 million at current exchange rates) that is in the process of being paid. This will add to the $76.5 million that has already been paid into the CERF by other donors.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_98"></a>The CERF will be administered by the UN&#039;s Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS80"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column WS80</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

(OCHA), under the management of the UN&#039;s emergency relief co-ordinator, who will be responsible for approving all grant disbursements from the fund. The CERF will report annually to the General Assembly, which will provide overall policy guidance on use of the fund, and an advisory group of 12 humanitarian experts will be appointed by the UN Secretary-General as an independent body to advise on operational aspects and performance. Eight of the group will be drawn from donors, with the other four members being independent experts. The emergency relief co-ordinator will convene an annual donor consultation and also liaise regularly with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, regarding use of the CERF.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_99"></a>The CERF will be subject to an annual financial audit by the UN&#039;s external auditors, with reports made available to the advisory group, and public reporting on donations, expenditures, and CERF-funded programme results will be posted on to a dedicated CERF internet website. The CERF itself will be critically and independently evaluated after the first two years of operation, to review its relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and impact.
</p>

<a name="60309-49_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_100"></a>I believe strongly that the CERF will make a critical difference in saving more lives and alleviating suffering earlier in future humanitarian crises by enabling the humanitarian agencies to respond more quickly and effectively. Combined with the other reforms under way, it will significantly improve the international humanitarian system.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a>My honourable friend the Member for Basildon and East Thurrock, in response to a previous Parliamentary Question from the honourable Member for North Down, asked the employing authorities (that is, the Education and Library Boards, the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, and voluntary grammar, Irish-medium, grant-maintained integrated and independent schools which employ their staff directly) to check their records and to inform her whether there is any person currently in employment in any capacity in a grant-aided school who is required t notify their details to the Police Service as a sex offender, or who has a history of sex offending. This process confirmed that there are three persons, none of them teaching staff, with a conviction for a sexual offence who are currently working in schools; none of these persons is on a sex offenders register as all the offences were committed over 15 years ago. In one case the offence was against a minor and involved a girl who was just under age; in the other two cases the offence was against an adult female. In each case the employing authority knew of the conviction through the pre-employment check and took professional advice. The advice was, in each case, that the person was not a risk to children, and so employment was offered. The employing authorities remain satisfied that these persons do not pose a risk to children. None of these offences was committed outside the UK.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_12"></a>More widely, the CRB has been working in line with the recommendations of the Bichard inquiry further to improve access to the records of persons from overseas. Special projects have been established with countries from which significant numbers of employees migrate such as Australia and South Africa to agree arrangements for bilateral checks.
</p>

<a name="60309w02_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_13"></a>Full details of the breadth of work in this area are provided in<i> Bichard Inquiry Recommendations: Second Progress Report</i>, presented to Parliament in November 2005.
</p>

<a name="60309w02_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_14"></a>Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to highlight an important point. Criminal records disclosures should only form part of overall employment process.

<a name="60309w04_spmin3"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  There is no entirely reliable assessment of the number of Iraqis killed or injured in this period. Estimates vary according to the methods used. We believe that the Iraqi authorities are best placed to provide such figures. The Iraqi Ministry of Health has released figures covering the period from 5 April 2004, when collation of statistics began, to 5 April 2005. According to these figures, 6,629 Iraqis were killed and 28,838 injured during that period. This figure includes all Iraqis, including civilians, Iraqi security forces and insurgents. The Iraqi Government have not yet published comprehensive figures for the period beyond April 2005. The <i>Iraq Body Count</i>, which relies on media reporting, currently estimates that at least 28,636 civilians have been killed since March 2003. But reliance on media reporting cannot give an entirely accurate portrayal of civilian casualties in Iraq.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_61"></a>What representations they have made to the Government of Sudan concerning the alleged destruction of schools and medical centres in Greater Khartoum; and, if so, what replies they have received.  [HL4355]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_52"></a>
<a name="60309w08_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  Khartoum state and the capital are host to around 4 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) from across Sudan. The IDP population has increased since the 1980s, in both camp and non-camp environments, and presents the Khartoum authorities with significant concerns for urban planning. In March 2004, the Government stepped up a process of demolitions and interruption of essential services as a way of moving IDPs to new sites. We have made clear that, while we acknowledge the right of the Sudanese authorities to replan their urban environment, the process must respect international human rights conventions.
</p>

<a name="60309w08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_42"></a>We have no reports of recent destruction of schools and medical centres in Greater Khartoum. The UK and international community have been working closely with the Government of Sudan to ensure that their treatment of IDPs is compliant with international human rights conventions. The UK has funded a number of projects in this regard, including providing an expert to work with the Khartoum authorities on settlement and replanning in Khartoum state. The majority of the interventions in Khartoum state under the UN&#039;s 2006 Workplan for Sudan will focus on providing essential services for IDPs. The UK is providing &#163;40 million towards this workplan.

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_62"></a>What reports they have received about the Committee for the Eradication of the Abduction of Women and Children (CEAWC) in Sudan; how many victims have been returned to their families in the past two years; and whether the Department for International Development will provide further resources to encourage family reunion and prosecutions.  [HL4049]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_53"></a>
<a name="60309w08_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  The Sudanese Committee for the Eradication of Abduction of Women and Children (CEAWC) returns victims of abduction during Sudan&#039;s civil wars to their families and area of origin. In the report of the 93rd Session of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) of 31 May to 16 June 2005 representatives of the government of Sudan claimed that CEAWC has returned 11,000 from an estimated number of 14,000 victims of abduction, with 7,500 of these returns taking place over the previous year. At the 2004 ILO session <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WA176"></a>

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column WA176</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the government of Sudan reported that CEAWC had returned 728 people over the preceding year. International observers have been unable to accurately verify these figures. Since January 2006, UNICEF and the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) monitored the return of over 300 people through CEAWC, and will continue to work with CEAWC, particularly in relation to concerns about provisions for reintegrating those returned back into society.

As part of its programme the ICRC is working to reunite families separated during the conflict. At present, the Department for International Development has no plans to fund CEAWC directly.

<p><a name="wa_st_54"></a>
<a name="60309w08_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  We are very concerned about the recent decision made by Taiwanese leader Chen Shui-bian to cease the functions of the National Unification Council and application of the national unification guidelines. We believe that this decision is not helpful to maintaining stability and peaceful development of cross-strait relations.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_45"></a>Our long-standing position on Taiwan remains unchanged; that is, we acknowledge the position of the Chinese Government that Taiwan is a province of China and recognise the government of the People&#039;s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China.

</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_66"></a>Whether they will offer advice to consumers to assist them in choosing manufacturers who will extend a warranty to cover alternative fuels.  [HL4376]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_55"></a>
<a name="60309w08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The Government do not offer any incentives to vehicle manufacturers to warrant their vehicles to run on fuels containing more than 5 per cent. biofuel. The Government are, however, encouraging the European Commission to amend the relevant fuel quality standards so as to allow higher percentages of biofuel to be blended into regular petrol and diesel. The Commission has confirmed in its recent biofuels strategy (available at http://europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/biomass/biofuel/com2006&#150;34&#150;en.pdf) that it will review the current standards during 2006, with a view to increasing the 5 per cent. biofuel inclusion limit. Any adaptations or modifications to a vehicle are likely to have an impact on the vehicle&#039;s warranty. This is likely to be a factor which many people take into account in deciding on whether or not to convert their vehicles to run on liquefied petroleum gas. The Government does not, however, have any detailed information on the extent to which it has affected the market. Advice on the warranty implications of conversions is available from, and best provided by, vehicle manufacturers and the vehicle conversion industry.

<p><a name="wa_st_56"></a>
<a name="60309w08_spmin3"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal):  </b> Although the Immigration and Nationality Directorate is not currently enforcing returns to Zimbabwe, voluntary returns, including by failed asylum seekers, continue as normal. The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal did not find that failed asylum seekers who returned voluntarily to Zimbabwe would be at risk and we therefore expect them to return voluntarily. Unsuccessful asylum seekers from Zimbabwe who appear to be destitute and who are unable to leave the United Kingdom immediately are eligible for support under Section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 if they meet the criteria set out in the Immigration and Asylum (Provision of Accommodation to failed Asylum Seekers) Regulations 2005. Those who have signed up for voluntary return with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) will normally satisfy the conditions for Section 4 support. It would not be right to permit failed asylum seekers to work as this would put them in a more favourable position than those still awaiting a decision on their claim who do not have permission to work.
